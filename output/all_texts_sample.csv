Democrat,"Hank Johnson, Jr.",Law-Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act,"Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  bill because it would make us less safe. Police already have access to  less-than-lethal weapons like tasers. They don't need a change in  the law. That is not an excuse for changing the law.

This bill expands access to dangerous, prohibited individuals by  stripping away Federal safeguards. Tasers may not shoot bullets, but  they are still dangerous in the wrong hands.

This bill would mean that anyone can buy them without a background  check including people convicted of serious violent crimes and domestic  abusers with restraining orders against them.

This bill would also eliminate serialization, making these dangerous  devices untraceable. H.R. 2189 is a reckless expansion of the gun  industry.

Mr. Speaker, because we all care about public safety, I urge my  colleagues to stand with me and my colleagues in opposition to this  dangerous piece of legislation.",2026-02-12,2026-W07
Democrat,Jeff Merkley,Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Proposed Export of,"Mr. MERKLEY. Following the attacks on October 7, 2023, Israel had  every right to go after Hamas, but how they do so matters.  Indiscriminate bombing with massive casualties, women and children, is  horrific, completely unacceptable. Blocking food and medicine with the  goal of inducing starvation is horrific and unacceptable. And that is  true under any religious or moral code.

Let me tell you about a few children the AP reported on a couple  weeks ago.

Four children who starved to death, ranging from 4 months old to 2  years old--picture that little child in your arm, their legs and arms  just a twig, their ribs showing every indentation, and then, finally,  their body, as it goes through malnutrition, starts to consume itself,  and they died of gastric arrest. Their stomach's ability to absorb  nutrition shut down, and they died. The hospital they were at, the  Patient's Friends Hospital, had run out of emergency nutrition  supplies.

There are supplies that are specially designed for malnutrition among  children. There are high-calorie biscuits and a high-calorie peanut  paste enriched with milk powder that often goes by the name Plumpy'Nut.  It is designed to help children. It has a long shelf life. It doesn't  have to be refrigerated. To help save them from severe acute  malnutrition, couldn't we have enough such assistance that no child  would be starving to death in Gaza?

Organizations across Gaza have been running out of these supplies.  UNICEF warned that their locations are running out. In fact, they said  they would run out of this high-nutrition assistance for children 2  weeks from now.

Doctors working with malnourished children are saying the wards are  quiet. And if you have been around a ward of children, you know that  they are not quiet. But why are these children quiet? Because they  don't have the energy to cry.

Noura has an 11-month-old son. He is deeply malnourished. He is  missing his major developmental milestones, and she says:

My son is supposed to be drinking formula milk, but there       is none . . . [and] I am barely able to breastfeed him; my       milk had almost dried up because I'm also not eating well.

And, in fact, Noura is in better condition than many other mothers  because many mothers across Gaza were unable to breastfeed at all  because of their own malnourishment.

Samah, another mother, relays that her family was driven from their  home by air strikes--certainly true for almost every family in Gaza.  And she says:

I am pregnant, but I have not eaten anything since       yesterday.

Dr. Mohammed Fadlalla of Doctors Without Borders says the Gaza  ``health  system is overwhelmed, and it's collapsing.'' And a Doctors Without  Borders report says that doctors and nurses are doing their best with  dwindling supplies amidst ``near-daily mass casualty incidents'' and  that their clinics report treating ``hundreds of people injured at food  distribution sites and ongoing attacks in Gaza,'' while doctors and  nurses are working day after day, shift after shift, without eating  themselves.

The suffering is unimaginable. I have called for international  reporters to be allowed in so we could all see exactly what is  happening. I have called for Members of Congress to be allowed in to  bear witness to what is happening. But the Netanyahu government has  said no reporters, no Members of Congress.

More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, widely reported, but  understand this: 18,500 of them were children. According to a reporting  by Associated Press, more than 80 children have died from malnutrition- related causes. And for every child who dies of malnutrition, there are  thousands more in deep trouble.

UNICEF, in a July 25 report, said 320,000 children are at risk of  acute malnutrition with thousands already suffering from severe  malnutrition, the deadliest form.

This headline from the Washington Post, ``60,000 Gazans have been  killed. 18,500 were children. These are their names.'' That was in  today's paper. Take a look at it, colleagues. Take a look at the pages  of microscopic names, all children. And every name here on this poster,  a child who is less than a year old.

These are not just numbers. These are individuals, beloved by their  family. Children who are dying. Children who are deeply malnourished.

Let me read you a couple names to remind us all of the fact that  these are individuals, just like you are an individual, just like I am  an individual, my friends, my colleagues:

Anisa Ali, Diaa Saleh Mousa, Basel Abu Jaser, Malak Abu       Saif, Wael Assaf, Sama Darwish.

All these children, almost 1,000 of them, under the age of 1. They  never got a chance to pursue their dreams. They were cut down by  bombing and by malnutrition.

The IPC, the world's leading hunger monitor, published a report on  Tuesday, and I have that report here. Let me hold it up. This report,  it says:

The worst-case scenario of famine is [currently] playing       out in the Gaza strip.

``The worst case.'' The World Food Programme reports that hunger in  Gaza has reached ``astonishing levels of desperation, [and] a third of  the population is not eating for multiple days in a row.''

But what do we hear from the head man, the leader in Israel,  Netanyahu? He says, on Sunday, this past Sunday:

There is no starvation in Gaza.

Let me be clear. That is a lie. The world knows it is a lie. We know  that it is a lie. Donald Trump knows that it is a lie. President Trump  said on Monday:

Some of those kids--that's real starvation stuff, I see it,       and you can't fake that.

The use of food and water and medicine as a weapon of war against  civilians--including against children, the ill, the elderly, the  women--it is unacceptable. It is unacceptable under international law.  It is unacceptable under any religious or moral code.

I have much more to share on this topic, many more facts I would like  to present, but I want to make sure that my colleague, my colleague  from Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen gets an opportunity to share his  thoughts.

We have called on addressing starvation, the lack of food, going way  back to January of last year, 19 months ago. We called on the Biden  administration; we called on the Trump administration.

He has been a leader, understanding and reporting so many facts to  help the rest of us understand what is going on.

I will be voting against any weapon of war provided to Israel until  every child and every woman has adequate nutrition in Gaza.

Mr. President, I yield to my colleague.",2025-07-30,2025-W31
Democrat,John Mannion,Protecting Education for Children with Disabilities,"Mr. MANNION. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share what is at stake for  students with disabilities as this administration continues its attacks  on the Department of Education.

Last year, one of our Nation's most fundamental laws, the Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA,  reached its 50th anniversary. IDEA opened the doors to opportunities  and protected the rights of millions of students with disabilities and  their families. It guaranteed a free, appropriate public education  where students with disabilities could learn in the least restrictive  environment and with the proper support.

Before this landmark piece of legislation, generations of students  with disabilities were routinely denied equal access to education. As a  teacher for almost 30 years and the founding chairman of the New York  State Senate Disabilities Committee, I have seen firsthand how IDEA has  transformed lives and what it means to families.

Yet, for all of the progress that we have made, much work still  remains, and IDEA is still more at risk today than it has ever been.  This administration has recklessly conducted mass layoffs across the  Department of Education, with no regard for the impacts on programs,  school districts, students, and families whom they serve.

Sadly, these firings have reached the Office of Special Education  Programs, which administers IDEA, as well as the Office for Civil  Rights, which investigates cases of disability discrimination. Without  these agencies and their dedicated employees, parents would have little  recourse when schools fail to protect their students and provide  appropriate accommodations.

From day one, it was obvious that this administration wanted to  transfer IDEA oversight out of the Department of Education entirely by  moving it to HHS, an agency with no expertise or legal authority over  special education.

Countless disability advocates have sounded the alarm on this  proposal. We cannot let these attacks continue, and we must also  continue to call out the vile rhetoric and misinformation about  disabilities in this country and around the world that this  administration has spread.

Parents of students with disabilities fight hard every single day for  their children, and there is no reason that they should have to fight  harder. I came to Congress to be a voice for those families and to  ensure that our country lives up to its promises and our values.

That is why my very first bill was the Protecting Students With  Disabilities Act, which would protect IDEA programs from the illegal  dismantling of the Department of Education. This should be a bipartisan  cause, as it has long been, and we should be talking more about fully  funding IDEA and strengthening it. Instead, we are left defending it  from political attacks.

I thank my colleague, Representative Hayes, for organizing this  discussion. I also thank my fellow members of the Education and  Workforce Committee for their commitment to maintaining IDEA. As a  fellow educator, I am proud to stand with Representative Hayes in this  fight.",2026-01-13,2026-W03
Democrat,Peter Welch,Terminating the National Emergency Declared with Respect to Energy,"Mr. WELCH. Mr. President, there are just two issues: One is about the  policy, the energy policy, that the Trump administration is announcing,  and we can have a debate about that. I am in full support of the  comments that my colleagues have made. But there is another issue that,  in many ways, is more important, and that issue is whether this U.S.  Senate will accede to relinquishing its authority as a separate and  independent branch of government to a President who tries to seize that  power by claiming a phony emergency.

What justifies this action, as far as President Trump is concerned  and legally, is the assertion that we have an ``energy emergency.'' And  by invoking that term, he is saying to Congress: Get lost. This needs  immediate attention that only the Executive can give. And getting lost  means that we don't act as an independent branch of government and  fulfill the constitutional responsibility we have to be separate,  independent, and a check and balance on Executive power.

That is a separate question from whether Members agree or disagree  with the ``drill, baby, drill'' policy, but it is fundamental to the  well-being of our democracy. Congress, in the past, has never come  close to relinquishing that authority. And whether you are a Democrat  or Republican, if you are a U.S. Senator, you have to defend the  institution, not because it is good for me or you or any other Member  of the Senate, but it is good for America. We rely on that system of  checks and balances.

So the question is, Is it an emergency? And as my colleagues have  laid out, no, we have never had more production of power in our  history. We are exporting power. The power situation is not an  emergency. There is power abundance.

Now, second thing, as many of my colleagues are saying, there are  real consequences because, essentially, what the President is doing is  going all in on fossil fuels and casting aside the opportunities that  come--economic opportunities as well as cleaner climate opportunities-- with clean energy. I am not going to repeat all of the information  provided by starting with Senator Kaine, but it is true. And, you know,  selling out, as some of my colleagues say, to the fossil fuel  industry--the President was reported to have said ``get me a  billion''--what I don't understand is why you would kill jobs in the  clean energy sector that is producing cheaper power and good jobs.  There is no justification for an Executive or Member of Congress doing  that.

The other final point is that we are having this bizarre debate about  whether there is a climate situation caused by carbon emissions.  Reality is, we all know it is happening. We are all victimized by these  wild weather events.

And there are only two explanations that explain the actions of the  administration: One is they just favor fossil fuels no matter what.  There is a lot of truth to that. The other is, there is a lack of  confidence on the administration about the capacity of the American  people, the American innovators, the American entrepreneurs to take  full advantage of solving the issue of climate change by building out  clean energy, by doing efficiency.

That really, really works. And a confident person, a confident  country doesn't deny problems exist. They acknowledge them, face them  squarely, and then solve them. And in the process of doing that, they  all end up better and have a stronger economy as well.

So there is no emergency. We must stand first for the separation of  powers and the authority of Congress and not allow us to be stripped of  that by an Executive; and, second, we have to have a wise policy that  is going to create jobs, be sustainable for our economy and for our  future.",2025-02-26,2025-W09

Democrat,Marcy Kaptur,Reporting Gang Activity,"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reintroduce the bipartisan  Gang Activity Reporting Act with the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs.  Hinson), my fellow appropriator.

This legislation has an urgent purpose: to give law enforcement the  accurate, comprehensive data they need to combat gang violence and to  keep our communities safe.

From 2021 to 2024, law enforcement agencies reported more than 69,000  incidents of gang activity nationwide. Over half involved violent  crime. Yet, today, Federal gang data remains fragmented, inconsistent,  and incomplete.

That gap puts officers at risk and leaves communities, especially in  rural America, without the tools needed to respond effectively. Our  bill would require the Attorney General to submit an annual report to  Congress on gang activity investigations and prosecutions.

While recent FBI data show violent crime trending downward, we know  progress does not mean the work is all done. This legislation  strengthens public safety, supports law enforcement, and helps protect  families from Ohio to Iowa, and coast to coast.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please support this critical  Gang Activity Reporting Act.",2026-01-08,2026-W02
Democrat,Eleanor Norton,Introduction of the Blue Envelope Act of 2025,"Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Blue Envelope Act of  2025. This bill would make blue envelope programs, which improve  interactions between police officers and drivers with difficulty  communicating through speech during a traffic stop, eligible for  federal transportation safety funding. The American Association of  People with Disabilities has endorsed this bill.

Blue envelope programs allow drivers, upon request, to receive a blue  envelope that explains on the front that the driver has difficulty  communicating through speech and that holds the documents a police  officer might request during a traffic stop. These programs exist in  many jurisdictions across the country, including statewide in  Massachusetts, Connecticut, Arkansas, Rhode Island, Arizona and  Vermont.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",2025-08-05,2025-W32
Democrat,Bill Keating,Release of Epstein Files,"Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, the House and now our Senate have finally  acted to release the files and all the information regarding the  criminal activities of Jeffrey Epstein and all who enabled, all who  knew and did nothing, and all who participated in some of the worst  sexual abuse and trafficking crimes our country has experienced.

This will expose the rich, the powerful, and the self-entitled who  were involved in these crimes and who did it for the worst possible  reason, because they thought they could.

This necessary legislation should not have been necessary because  this White House, this administration, this President could have merely  released these files. Instead, they withheld, dismissed, and covered  up. They even had their Justice Department's two highest officials try  to coerce a House Member to take their name off the discharge petition  that finally triggered the approval of this legislation.

It was only because of the actions of courageous survivors coming  forward, coming to the Capitol, and speaking truth to power that we are  able to advance this legislation.

As a Massachusetts district attorney, I oversaw specialized sexual  assault police units, specialized sexual assault prosecutors, and  specialized sexual assault victim-witness assistance units. I founded a  child advocacy center to treat and reduce trauma for child victims of  sexual assault.

I know from this one thing. The survivors want one thing and one  thing only: that no child, no young girl, will ever have to go through  the trauma that they went through, a trauma so great that one survivor  took her own life.

Now, a warning to this White House, this administration, and this  President. Never again say these crimes did not occur. Never call them  a hoax, and don't attempt to abuse and pervert what this legislation  does by invoking a sham active investigation as a disingenuous excuse  to withhold a complete release of the Epstein files. Don't do this  because the brave survivors will not stand for it, and they will not  stand alone. The majority of this House will stand with them. The  majority of our Senate will stand with them. Most importantly, the  American people will stand with them.",2025-11-19,2025-W47
Democrat,Gwen Moore,"Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2026","Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment  No. 233 to the FY 2026 Defense Appropriations bill. I thank Chairman  Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for including it in the Amendments  En Bloc No. 3.

Our world is facing numerous water challenges. Climate change is  making those challenges worse.

Our military is not exempt. The Defense Department has previously  identified water services failures as a growing risk, as they impact a  military facility's ability to execute missions and maintain warfighter  readiness. That is where my amendment comes in.

My amendment would increase funding for ongoing research and work  being done by the Army, with the help of some leading institutions of  higher education like the one in my district, Marquette University.

These partnerships with the Department of Defense (DoD), Marquette,  and other institutions of higher education are being used to study  technology and other solutions to water challenges facing our military  and our service members that can also benefit our communities like  improved sensing/monitoring of water pollution, and advanced water/ wastewater treatment technologies to facilitate reuse of pollution- impacted water resources.

Thus, collaboration between DoD and civilian researchers on water  contamination and resilience issues has the potential for many  benefits, including positive public health impacts.

With these additional funds, we can help unleash researchers to  explore water sustainment and resiliency technologies that increase  readiness and safety of military personnel in contingency bases and at  military installations, that can address and improve water efficiency,  and improve the conservation of water resources, and the resiliency of  water infrastructure.

I urge support for my amendment.",2025-07-23,2025-W30
Republican,Mike Kennedy,Recognizing the Capitol Hill Challenge,"Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize and  congratulate the outstanding Whitehorse High School team from Montezuma  Creek, Utah, for achieving national distinction in the Capitol Hill  Challenge.

Out of hundreds of teams from across the country, this remarkable  group finished in the top ten. This is a truly impressive  accomplishment that speaks to their academic excellence and their  strong grasp of financial markets, economics, and civic engagement.  These students demonstrated exceptional teamwork, discipline, and a  genuine passion for learning throughout the competition.

The team members who I met today, along with their teacher, are Hope,  JaSea, Gabrielle, Nateo, and Kalvin, and they excelled under the  leadership of their dedicated teacher, Mr. Gosney. Their success is a  testament to both their individual talents and the support and guidance  that they received.

I am immensely proud to have such bright and committed leaders  representing Utah's Third District. Their achievement reflects the  strength, resilience, and character of our community.",2025-06-11,2025-W24
Democrat,Chris Murphy,Gun Violence,"Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I want to come to the floor today to talk  about a success story but, potentially, a success story interrupted.

Back in 2022, we all were shocked to watch news playing out during an  afternoon that we were here, working in the Senate, of another mass  shooting--this one of just unthinkable size and scope--in Uvalde, TX. I  was actually sitting in the Presiding Officer's chair when I saw word  of the shooting scroll across my smartphone screen.

Gratefully, in the wake of that shooting, a group of us--Republicans  and Democrats--were able to come together and set aside the differences  that we had and still have on the issue of gun violence in this  country. We decided not to argue about an assault weapons ban, for  instance. Instead, we decided to work on finding the least common  denominator, as we called it, and tried to find a set of commonsense  changes to our gun laws and commonsense investments in our communities  that would, hopefully, together, try to put a downward pressure on  what, up until then, had been annual spiking rates of homicides and  mass shootings.

It is just true that, in this country, you are 10 times more likely  to be shot in your school, in your neighborhood, at a movie theater  than you are in any other high-income, developed nation. That is a  choice. That is not bad luck. That is not happenstance. That is  because, in America, we decide to have a ton of weapons in the hands of  very dangerous people. We also don't spend enough time trying to unwind  some of the reasons young people, in particular, get into lives of  really risky and potentially violent behavior.

So we came together in 2022, and we passed the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act. It was a big bipartisan vote. It wasn't close. The  final tally was 65 to 33, with nearly two-thirds of the Senate voting  in favor of this commonsense gun safety measure. It wasn't anything  close to what I see as being necessary in order to tackle this epidemic  in this country, but it was significant. It was five changes in gun  laws: supporting State red flag laws; stopping domestic abusers from  getting their hands on guns; putting in a short but meaningful waiting  period when young people are hastily buying an assault weapon; making  it easier for law enforcement to go after drug trafficking rings. It  was five meaningful changes, but it was also a big investment, a big  investment in the kind of services that can help interrupt violence.

A lot of my Republican friends said: You know, we don't believe it is  the guns. We think it is mental illness.

Well, I don't agree, but this is how you put together a compromise.  So we passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which included a  landmark $14 billion investment, most of it in mental health, most of  it directed toward kids' school-based mental health, but there were  also significant investments in school safety--just hardening schools  to make it harder for a shooter to get inside and community anti-gun  violence initiatives, which is the work that local community groups are  doing in North Carolina and Connecticut and all across the country to  just try to wrap services around people who might be at risk of gun  violence or to stop that cycle of violence once the first shooting  happens.

So we passed this legislation, and we crossed our fingers. We said:  Let's hope that we are right and that these changes in gun laws and  these investments we are making in our communities will make a  difference.

Well, what happened after we passed that law was absolutely stunning:  the biggest 2-year decline in gun violence in the history of recorded  statistics in the United States of America. That is extraordinary. That  is extraordinary. I am not going to sit here and claim that the entire  reason was the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, but it was a big part  of the reason because we did make it harder for bad people to get their  hands on guns. We did deliver the kinds of services that are necessary.  You are seeing this downward trajectory, but let me just put the  numbers on it.

In 2023, there were 659 mass shootings in America. In 2024, there  were 500. That is a 24-percent, 1-year decline in mass shootings. That  means that there were 160 mass shootings that didn't happen and 160  communities that were not terrorized in 2024. And this bill had a lot  to do with it. Overall gun deaths went down from 2023 to 2024 from  19,000 to 16,700. That was a 12-percent reduction. We have never in  this country's history seen 1-year declines in gun homicides in the  neighborhood of 12 percent. Certain cities saw astronomical declines.  In Hartford, we saw a 39-percent drop in homicides from 2023 to 2024.  This year--this year, 2025--Hartford is on track to have the lowest  recorded instances of gun violence--those are homicides and nonfatal  shootings--since 2006. New Haven saw a 39-percent drop in homicides. As  I think I said, overall, in Connecticut, we had 167 homicides in 2023.  In 2024, we had 63. It is wild.

This happened in Baltimore, and this happened in Chicago. In most of  the major cities in this country and in rural areas as well, we saw  this dramatic, dramatic decline. So it is just something to celebrate  because it is not easy to get that kind of consensus. It is not easy to  get that kind of consensus, and we should celebrate the fact that there  are literally thousands of people--largely young men--who are alive  today because of the bill that we passed.

But this progress is in threat of being interrupted, and the reason  is that the Trump administration has reversed course. I want to talk  specifically about how they are undoing the progress of this bill, but  their attempt to try to reverse the broader progress that we have made  on reducing gun violence is pretty comprehensive. Let me just give you  a handful of the ways in which the Trump administration is trying to  make our communities less safe.

First, they closed the Office of Gun Violence Prevention. This was  something the Biden administration set up to try to better implement  the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This wasn't a terribly political  office. It was just trying to coordinate all the work being done across  Agencies to reduce violence in our communities. Trump would have taken  this office in a different direction, but he didn't. He just shuttered  it. There is no Office of Gun Violence Prevention anymore in the  Federal Government.

On March 20, the administration announced that they are going to  start a process of restoring firearms rights to individuals who have  had them taken away because they had serious criminal records. This is  likely illegal.  There is an appropriations bill rider that says the ATF can't do this,  but the message was sent: We actually think that dangerous people  should be able to get their gun rights back.

That same day, Trump's Department of Justice filed a motion in  Federal court, trying to overturn a decision to say that silencers are  not protected by the Second Amendment, trying to say that no State  legislature could ban or regulate the use of silencers, and silencers  are broadly used by killers, by criminals who are trying to hide the  fact that they are engaged in criminal, lethal conduct.

On April 7, the DOJ announced that it was repealing a policy from the  Biden administration that said simply this: If you are a gun dealer and  you are engaged in illegal conduct, we are going to pull your license,  and we are not going to give you two or three or four shots. We are  going to have a zero tolerance policy for gun dealers who are selling  guns on to the black market. That is a policy most Americans would see  as common sense, but the DOJ announced that it was going to let off the  hook gun dealers who are violating the laws.

Now, throughout the last 100 days, the Trump administration has been  sending all sorts of signals that they are deprioritizing the work of  the ATF. Most recently, on April 9, they announced that the Army  Secretary would now be the acting head of ATF. This was basically  telling ATF agents: We don't care about your work. We are not going to  have a full-time ATF head. We are putting somebody with a big, other  important job in charge of the ATF. You are not going to have any real  supervision or direction.

It was just a signal of the deprioritization of the enforcement of  our gun laws that caused, the next day, the second highest ranking  official at the ATF, who had served admirably for 35 years, to resign  in protest.

Then, maybe most unconscionably and most cruelly, just a few days  ago, the ATF took down the memorial wall dedicated to victims of gun  violence. I mean, there were names up there, tributes to moms and dads,  brothers and sisters who had been killed in episodes of gun violence.  That was really important to hundreds of families out there who knew  that their loved ones' names were part of that wall. Now the wall comes  down. For what? Just to send another signal that the administration  doesn't care about attacking gun violence.

But I really wanted to come to the floor today to talk about the two  most important assaults that the Trump administration has made on our  work to try to keep our communities safe. Those are the twin  announcements that the administration made that they were going to end  two of the key streams of funding for community groups in the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.

First, the administration announced it was ending $1 billion in  grants under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to invest in school  mental health and then that they were ending $800 million of DOJ grants  to try to drive down violence through supporting community efforts to  do that work.

This makes no sense. I understand we have a difference. The President  and I have a difference on what our gun laws should be. But there is  consensus--I thought there was consensus--that we should support  investment in mental health. I thought there was a consensus that we  all believed that there were good community groups that were doing  totally apolitical work, not related at all to gun laws, to try to  interrupt cycles of violence.

The reason that these numbers have been going down is not just the  changes in gun laws. The reason that our communities are safer all  across the country is that we are finally putting real money into  school-based mental health, into children's mental health, and into the  groups in our communities that are keeping kids alive.

In Oakland, they have seen a stunning 32-percent drop in homicides,  and it is a result of groups like Youth Alive!. This is a nonprofit  that is working to prevent and disrupt the cycle of gun violence. So  you go into a community, you go into a place where a shooting has  happened, and you do work with the victim of that incident to make sure  that it doesn't become a cycle of violence.

These are often called hospital-based violence intervention programs.  When there is a shooting, you have a social worker or a community anti- gun violence worker that goes to the hospital. That is often when the  communities are the most angry, the friends of that victim may be  planning for revenge, and you do the work to stop that cycle of  violence.

It was working in Oakland. Youth Alive! was preventing gun violence.  Last year, of the 113 clients they served, only 1 of them was injured a  second time. Yet, in the middle of a 3-year $2 million grant that Youth  Alive! was getting, it was suspended, terminated. They are going to  have to lay off their staff. That program is being shut down in  Oakland. And I will just tell you, I would bet you homicides are going  to start going back up in Oakland.

Baltimore has seen a similar massive decline in gun violence, a 43- percent reduction since 2010--what a success story in Baltimore, one of  the most violent communities in terms of rates of gun violence in the  country, a 43-percent decline.

Center for Hope is a group in Baltimore that provides prevention and  healing services for children who have been the witnesses or victims of  gun violence. They were getting, again, a $2 million grant to work with  the victims of gun violence to try to heal those communities and,  again, stop that cycle of retributive violence that often happens in  places like Baltimore.

Donald Trump cut their grant. So in the middle of the grant, they are  losing $1.2 million, and they are going to have to lay off 7 employees.

Center for Hope runs 6 of the city's 10 Safe Streets sites. These  operate in the pockets of Baltimore where you see the most shootings.  Because of these Center for Hope sites--these Safe Streets sites-- between 2023 and 2024, four of the sites run by the Center for Hope saw  zero homicides. Now they are having to lay off people. Guess what is  going to happen. Those shootings are going to go up again.

We had to work really hard to find this consensus on a very difficult  issue. It is illegal, what the President has done. He is not allowed,  under the Constitution, to decide unilaterally to cancel spending that  has been authorized and appropriated by Congress. So maybe the first  and most important thing to say about what the President has done to  cancel mental health grants and anti-violence grants is that it is  illegal. He can't do it, and it is likely that a court will turn these  grants back on.

But it is also such bad policy. It is cruel and inhumane, but it is  also illogical. We literally are seeing the fruits of the labor of  these groups, and not just in saving a life or two. You are talking  about a 30- and 40-percent reduction in violence in these cities. And  what will happen is unmistakable. You stop funding these groups that  are doing the mental health work in the schools, that are doing the  anti-gun violence work, and these rates will start to go back up again.

That is illogical, but it is cruel as well because what the President  is doing, for instance, in cutting off the school mental health grants  is that he is cutting off existing grants. It is not that he is  announcing: I am not giving any new grants.

There are schools all across this country that have set up new mental  health clinics because of the grants they got. They were 5-year grants,  and 1 or 2 or 3 years into those grants, Donald Trump is shutting those  programs down. So there are literally going to be thousands of  children--traumatized children, children with serious mental illness,  with cycles and histories of abuse in their households--who have  created this relationship with an adult--this adult who is helping them  address their potential tendency to act out in violent ways due to  their mental illness, their trauma. And one day, these kids are going  to show up at school, and that adult is going to be gone. That trusted  adult that had created that bond, that relationship that is helping  that child, that is keeping that school safe--that relationship, that  bond is destroyed because in cutting these grants off with no warning,  there is no way, in the middle of a school year, for a school mental  health clinic to find the money under the mattress.

It is illogical. It is going to drive up gun violence rates. And it  is cruel to  our poorest and most at-risk communities and to the kids--and to the  kids--the traumatized kids, the kids with serious mental illness, the  kids that we should think first about when we wake up in the morning.

I guess the final thing to say is this: We are putting ourselves out  of business. We are putting ourselves out of business. What is the  point of passing a law by a 65-to-33 vote if the President of the  United States can just ignore it? As I said, that is illegal, and the  courts will likely tell him: You can't shut off the funding that we  appropriated and authorized.

This should matter to Republicans and Democrats. Every single one of  my Republican colleagues worked really hard to get this job, worked  really hard to become a U.S. Senator. Those of us who worked on these  bipartisan pieces of legislation worked really hard to pass them. What  is the point of running for the U.S. Senate, what is the point of  working to forge this compromise if the President can just ignore it?

By the way, if Donald Trump gets away with it, mark my words, a  Democratic President will do the same thing. If this becomes standard  practice, if our laws just become advisory, then there is no reason for  any of us to show up any longer. Why do you work so hard, why do you  care so much about getting to this place if you don't care when the  President just ignores the laws that we pass?

It is very hard to find consensus here, especially on an issue as  important and as politically sensitive as gun violence. So when we do  find that consensus, on behalf of the kids and the families out there  who are begging us to work together to save lives, we should protect  that consensus.",2025-05-08,2025-W19
Republican,Mike Crapo,National Pow/Mia Recognition Day,"Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in acknowledgement of National POW/MIA  Recognition Day this September 19, 2025, I honor Idaho's and all of  America's prisoners of war, POWs, and missing in action, MIA, as I  extend my support and gratitude to their loved ones.

In February, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, DPAA, the Agency  primarily responsible for recovering America's servicemembers, unveiled  its 2025 National POW/MIA Recognition Day poster. Each year, the Agency  creates a poster commemorating the lives of U.S. servicemembers still  unaccounted for from past conflicts and showcasing the DPAA's  commitment to bringing them home. This year's poster features the  statement, ``Delivering on the nation's promise.''

Fittingly, this year's poster was designed by a Gold Star Daughter,  Jeanie Jacobs Huffman who, unfortunately, knows deeply and personally  the price military families pay for our freedoms. Jeanie Jacobs  Huffman's father, Navy Commander Edward J. Jacobs, Jr., remains  unaccounted for after contact was lost with the aircraft he was  piloting in the Gulf of Tonkin off the coast of North Vietnam in 1967.  At the unveiling of the poster, Jeanie shared, ``I always felt a huge  void in my life not having my father. I believe that each of our  missing is still seeking their way home and they expect that our  nation's promise will be kept.''

To help meet our Nation's promise to America's servicemembers and  support the efforts of those who work tirelessly for their return, I  continue to press for the enactment of the Bring Our Heroes Home Act.  This legislation would help eliminate obstacles preventing families and  caseworkers from accessing the records needed for recovering America's  POWs and MIA.

This POW/MIA Recognition Day, and every day, I remain deeply grateful  for the committed individuals and groups, such as the POW*MIA Awareness  Rally Corp. of Pocatello, ID, and others across our country who keep an  unwavering spotlight on the need to bring every American servicemember  home. With a heavy but hopeful heart, I continue to pray for all those  who await answers about lost servicemembers and thank America's  servicemembers, veterans, and their families for their extraordinary  commitment to our country.",,
Republican,Eli Crane,Apache County and Navajo County Conveyance Act of 2025,"Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of my bill,  the Apache County and Navajo County Conveyance Act of 2025.

This legislation would transfer Federal land currently under the  purview of the U.S. Forest Service to Navajo and Apache Counties.

For more than a decade, the communities of Pinedale and Alpine have  struggled to find appropriate cemetery space to meet the needs of  family members wishing to enter and pay respects to their loved ones.

My bill would expand the land adjacent to the Alpine Community  Cemetery, preventing the need for members of the community to be laid  to rest in a distant cemetery.

These communities have storied histories dating back to the pioneers,  and they deserve to lay their loved ones to rest in a place that means  so much to them.

My primary objective as a public official is to remain principled and  effective for the district that I represent, ensuring that rural  communities are not forgotten by the Federal Government.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Chairman Westerman, Navajo County  Supervisor Seymore, and Apache County Supervisor Nelson, and also my  colleagues on the other side for their support and their leadership.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this sensible solution.",2025-05-13,2025-W20
Democrat,Salud Carbajal,Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2025,"Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 4275, the  Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2025.

This bill is a prime example of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee's bipartisanship under the leadership of Chairman Graves,  Ranking Member Larsen, and Chairman Ezell.

As ranking member of the subcommittee, I am proud of all the good  work that we have done on this bill to ensure that we reauthorize,  enhance, and support the critical missions of the U.S. Coast Guard to  save lives, protect our maritime environment, and prioritize  servicemembers both in and out of the workplace.

These significant investments in the service signal our confidence in  the capability of the Coast Guard to conduct each of their diverse  missions to better serve the American people.

This bill puts coasties first by addressing the need for more  affordable and quality housing. It also provides enhancement of our  coasties' quality of life, such as family leave policies, career  flexibility, tuition assistance incentives, and behavioral healthcare.

Equally important, this bill capitalizes on the extensive work that  former Commandant, Admiral Fagan, did to make institutional changes to  address sexual assault and sexual harassment.

Our coasties deserve better, and this legislation provides oversight  and the tools needed for the Coast Guard to prevent these crimes,  protect victims, and hold perpetrators accountable.

Moreover, I am proud that this bill includes several provisions that  I sponsored regarding U.S. merchant mariners. This bill tackles long  outdated methods for processing mariner credentials by investing in and  revamping the Coast Guard's process.

This bill also improves merchant mariner credentialing tests by  ensuring the most relevant and technologically critical elements are  included. We want the best mariners in the industry, and by removing  outdated entry barriers, we will help ensure steady, long-term  employment opportunities.

Madam Speaker, I, once again, thank Chairman Graves for his  leadership and bipartisan collaboration in crafting this bill. I am  proud to have worked with my colleagues on this important legislation,  and I look forward to seeing it pass into law.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Larsen).

Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. DeSaulnier).

Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Gillen).

Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 4275, the Coast Guard Authorization Act  of 2025. I encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do  the same.

Republican,Mike Bost,Fallen Servicemembers Religious Heritage Restoration Act,"Mr. BOST.  Madam Speaker, I rise to include in the Record the  following letter of support for H.R. 2701 from National Commander Scott  P. Stevens, CW04, USA, (R).

The Jewish War Veterans of the USA supports H.R. 2701, the       Fallen Servicemembers Religious Heritage Restoration Act. JWV       appreciates the leadership of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz        (D-FL) and Rep. Max Miller (R-OH) for their bipartisan       introduction, as well as the support of the House Veterans       Affairs Subcommittee on Disability and Memorial Affairs and       the Full Committee in moving this critical legislation to the       House floor. JWV urges swift passage of H.R. 2701 to start       the process of properly marking graves and honoring these       brave Jewish American servicemembers.

The Fallen Servicemembers Religious Heritage Restoration       Act requires the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC)       to create a program to identify Jewish servicemembers buried       with grave markers that do not reflect their faith and to       connect with their descendants. This vital effort will       correct the historical record and ensure our fallen heroes       are remembered as they lived and served.

JVW understands that approximately 900 American-Jewish       servicemembers who lost their lives during World War I and       World War II and were buried in U.S. military cemeteries       overseas (ABMC) were mistakenly interred under markers that       do not represent their religion or heritage. JVW recognizes       that most of these errors are unintentional; however, these       mistakes hide the identity and legacy of those who made the       ultimate sacrifice for our country. American-Jewish       servicemembers served with honor and bravery, playing a       crucial role in winning the Allied victory. They deserve to       be remembered with dignity and accuracy.

The United States has a solemn duty to ensure every fallen       servicemember is honored correctly Enacting H.R. 2701 helps       ensure that the Star of David marks the Jewish graves of       servicemembers, currently marked in error.",,
Democrat,"Sanford Bishop, Jr.",In Memory of Clifford Odell Rutledge,"Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated husband,  loving father, doting grandfather, committed educator, astute  entrepreneur, patriotic soldier, broadcast hall of famer and friend of  longstanding, Mr. Clifford Odell Rutledge. Sadly, Cliff passed from  labor to reward on Sunday, February 16, 2025. A funeral service to  celebrate his extraordinary life will be held on Wednesday, February  26, 2025, at Nichols Chapel AME Church in Phenix City, Alabama.

Cliff's journey began with his birth to Dock and Willie Mae Rutledge.  He graduated from South Girard High School in Phenix City and furthered  his education at Alabama A&M University in Huntsville, Alabama.  Following his studies, Cliff served our country honorably in the United  States Army from 1950 to 1953 during the Korean Conflict.

It has been said that ``Education is the passport to the future; it  belongs to those who prepare for it today.'' Cliff dedicated a  significant part of his life to preparing young people for their  futures, embarking on a distinguished 41-year career in education. His  educational journey included roles at his alma mater, South Girard High  School, South Girard Elementary, and Ridgecrest Elementary, where he  coached junior high basketball teams and instilled in his students the  importance of winning in the game of life.

Throughout his career, Cliff pursued continuous improvement through  advanced studies in school administration at both Auburn and Tuskegee  Universities. He served as a teacher and principal at Susie E. Allen  Elementary School and later became the Director of Community Education  for the Phenix City Public Schools, overseeing Head Start and Adult  Education Programs.

In addition to his contributions to education, Cliff was a gifted  radio broadcaster. His journey began in the late 1950s as the host of a  Sunday morning gospel show on WCLE. In 1964, he joined WOKS radio  station, where he launched his sports announcing career, becoming a  trusted voice in the Chattahoochee Valley sports community. His  dedication to broadcasting earned him induction into the Chattahoochee  Valley Sports Hall of Fame in 2014.

Cliff was not only committed to education and broadcasting but also  to his community. As the saying goes, ``Service is the rent that we pay  for the space that we occupy here on this earth.'' Cliff paid his rent  well and he paid it well. His commitment to justice led him to co-found  United to Save Ourselves, an organization dedicated to equality and  change. His efforts were recognized by several community organizations,  including the USO's Hometown High Achievers Award in 2002 and the  SAMARC Foundation Award, which honored him as a community legend in  2012. In 2020, the City of Phenix City recognized him with a  Trailblazer award during a Black History Proclamation Event, and in  2023, the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP honored him with their  esteemed Humanitarian Award.

Cliff loved his family deeply and held his faith close to his heart.  He began serving God early in life at Nichols Chapel AME Church, where  his musical talents flourished. His passion for music led him to serve  as Minister of Music at the church and as a member of the Board of  Trustees.

None of Cliff's achievements would have been possible without the  love and support of his family, including his late wife of 50 years,  Sadie Jean Nix Rutledge, his son, Timothy Thomas; his granddaughter,  Clemitruis Hartley, and his niece and devoted caregiver, Decliffia  Coleman and a host of other relatives who loved him dearly.

On a personal note, Cliff was my longtime friend and supporter for  over 50 years. He was also my brother in the bond of Kappa Alpha Psi  Fraternity, Inc. His wise counsel and sage advice have profoundly  influenced my journey and success as I serve in Congress. For that, I  will always be grateful. Moreover, his life and career exemplify the  noble purpose of our great fraternity--``Achievement in all fields of  human endeavor.'' Truly the world is a better place because of Cliff.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me, my wife Vivian, and the  more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in  honoring the life and legacy of Mr. Clifford Odell Rutledge. We extend  our deepest sympathies to his family, friends, colleagues, and all  those who mourn his loss. May we all find comfort in our abiding faith  and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.",2025-02-26,2025-W09
Democrat,"Frank Pallone, Jr.",Amendment No. 1 Offered By Mr. Massie,"Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise also in strong opposition to this  amendment.

In 2023, 12,429 people died in drunk driving crashes nationwide. In  Kentucky alone, 198 people were killed. In  Pennsylvania, 321 people lost their lives. These deaths were  preventable.

Advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology will  prevent impaired drivers from illegally operating vehicles and causing  deaths and injuries. I understand that my Republican colleagues are  concerned about privacy, but the technology being developed does not  track the vehicle's location or collect, use, or store any data that  would compromise the privacy of vehicle occupants.

Privacy is a concern, and my friends should weigh in on the  rulemaking process. NHTSA, the agency involved with this, should work  with government agencies that have expertise in this area to ensure  that consumer data is secure, anonymous, and protected from  unauthorized use. That can and should be addressed as part of the  rulemaking process.

It is not right, though. Preventing impaired drivers from illegally  operating vehicles and causing fatalities should be a nonpartisan  issue, and the work on that needs to continue.

The problem here is that while NHTSA has not finalized the rule, they  would not be able to do any work related to the rule or advanced  alcohol monitoring technology if this amendment passes. That is going  to just cause more deaths from drunk driving.

I would implore everybody: Please, privacy can be addressed, but we  should not stop this work from continuing. We can't have drunk drivers  on the road. It is not just them but everyone else who is killed and  injured as a result of those drunk drivers.",2026-01-22,2026-W04
Republican,French Hill,Keaton Beasley Teaches Importance of Financial Literacy,"Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Keaton  Beasley of Simmons Bank.

Keaton is a graduate of Henderson State University, a member of the  Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, and a banker in Little Rock.

Keaton exemplifies the ethos of a community banker, frequently  working with children, adults, and seniors to teach them the importance  of financial literacy. His efforts prove it is never too late or too  early to learn how to manage your finances.

As a former community banker, I admire his efforts to uplift his  community and help those around him build a stronger foundation in  finance.

I look forward to seeing Keaton's continued impact in central  Arkansas  and wish him the best of luck in his bright future in banking.            Honoring John Edward Hain, Jr., on His 100th Birthday

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John Edward  Hain, Jr., who celebrated his 100th birthday on March 20.

A Little Rock native, John graduated from Catholic High School at age  in 1941 and is currently the school's oldest living alumnus.

He is a World War II veteran. John was drafted at 18 and served in  England, Belgium, Germany, France, and the Netherlands as an Army  corporal in the field artillery attachment of the 5th Army Division,  the 9th Army spearhead, the 5th Armored Division, and the 29th Division  in Operation Kaput.

John married his wife, Beverly, in 1947. They have 5 daughters, 17  grandchildren, and 19 great-grandchildren.

After his service to our Nation in World War II, he worked at the  Krebs Brothers Supply Company as a traveling salesman, and he retired  as president of Krebs after working there for 50 years.

I thank John for his long service to our community, and I  congratulate him on reaching this amazing milestone.                               PAWS for Justice

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  Susan Bradshaw and Fawn Borden of PAWS for Justice.

PAWS for Justice is an Arkansas charity that provides courthouse  facility dogs to assist witnesses and victims as they go through  difficult court proceedings. For children who are recounting  heartbreaking terrible events, these dogs provide comfort and support  to make those difficult moments just a little bit better.

While these dogs can often cost courthouses around $50,000 each, PAWS  for Justice provides them free of charge.

As a proud owner of my great pup, Taft, I have an incredible  appreciation for PAWS for Justice's efforts and thank them for their  hard work in providing comfort for those who need it the most.                           Recognizing Lance Restum

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lance  Restum, director of community relations for the Arkansas Travelers  baseball team.

Lance has been with the championship-winning Travelers since 2006 and  is the founder of the Arkansas Travelers Youth Foundation.

Since 2021, the foundation has been introducing kids across the  Natural State to America's pastime. They provide baseball clinics,  equipment, grants, and scholarships to get kids active and interested  in baseball.

Lance and the foundation's work serve as an excellent example for  those of us who want to make a difference in our communities.

I wish Lance and the Arkansas Travelers the best of luck in their new  season, and I look forward to my next game at Dickey-Stephens Park.",2025-03-24,2025-W13
Republican,"Jimmy Patronis, Jr.",True Cost of Big Tech,"Mr. PATRONIS. Mr. Speaker, Section 230 of the Communications Decency  Act insulates ``Big Tech'' from most liability for the digital fentanyl  promoted on their sites. Time and time again, drugs are sold, sexually  suggestive and/or explicit content is posted without consent,  algorithms promote and normalize suicide and self-harm, and chatbots  tell children how to cope with their emotions. All of these things are  harming our vulnerable and impressionable youth. Chatbot usage is now  so widespread that nearly three quarters of teens have used AI  companions, and of these users approximately one in three have used  them for social interactions and relationships to include the more than  one in ten who sought emotional or mental health support.

That is why I proudly introduced H.R. 7045, the Promoting Responsible  Online Technology and Ensuring Consumer Trust (PROTECT) Act, to  immediately repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and to  restore accountability for online platforms.

The question we must ask ourselves is: can there be any  accountability when there is no liability. The answer is no. Without  liability there is no accountability. When was the last time you saw  revenge porn or fentanyl marketed on a billboard? The answer is you  have not seen it because of a well-crafted system that punishes  wrongdoing. Why do we see this content online constantly? The answer is  Section 230.

Let us stop pretending like the internet is new, novel, and worthy of  special treatment when 96 percent Americans access it. When the law  passed in 1996, the internet was in its early days long before the  average American spent nearly half the month online and nearly one in  six sales occurred online. Congress can no longer ignore the fact that  the average American spends nearly 60,000 percent more time online than  during the year of the law's passage.

To be clear, this law lets the large companies that dominate the  areas where Americans spend almost half their time generally face no  consequences for the content these platforms share, actively promote,  and generate billions from. Worse yet, the law also deprives states of  the power to protect their own citizens through state law. I am deeply  troubled by alarming national trends and the proliferation of AI  chatbots, providing advice to our children. Increasingly, children have  been suffering, and parents have been unable to pursue an effective  means of encouraging the industry to police itself.

Sadly, one in five children receive an unwanted sexual solicitation  annually online. Despite Section 230 continuing to insulate online  predation, I am proud of the work multiple sheriff offices, as well as  state and federal agencies did to arrest 13 suspects during an online  child sexual predator operation in my district and in surrounding  communities last fall.

Imagine how much more ``Big Tech'' would be willing to do to shut  down the predator superhighway if they faced actual consequences. While  I could fill hundreds of pages with stories about how social media is  harming our youth and supplement it daily, I want to focus on stories  from my district and my home state of Florida.

As a successful Section 230 defense often results in the court  granting dismissal early in the litigation, the facts are often  accepted as plead. In these instances, the excerpts below reflect the  claims as plead by the victims and their families.  Only Fans Parent Company Faces No Liability for Allegedly Profiting Off                          Rape of a Miami Teenager

In April 2022, Michelson Romelus and Bendjy Charles       allegedly filmed each other on video while they forcible       raped and sodomized the teenage victim in Miami. Several       weeks later, the footage was allegedly edited and uploaded to       OnlyFans.com where the footage was allegedly sold as part of       a monthly subscription. Despite these facts, the case was       recommended for dismissal based on Section 230, meaning the       alleged victim could not recover from the platform.    Omegle Immune From Liability for Allegedly Connecting a Minor With a            Predator Who Coerced an 11-Year-Old Into Undressing

On March 31, 2020, an 11-year-old girl and user of the       Omegle platform, which allowed users to connect with people       randomly and anonymously allegedly connected the child with a       predator. This predator allegedly informed the victim that he       knew where she lived and provided specific details about       where she lived to prove it. He allegedly threatened to hack       the victim and her family's devices if she did not disrobe       and comply with his demands. The predator allegedly filmed       the incident. The case was dismissed by the Court as the       victim's family ``failed to plead claims that withstand       Omegle's Section 230 immunity.'' The platform has since       ceased operations.   OfferUp Found Not Liable for Allegedly Connecting Buyer With Seller Who                           Robbed and Shot Buyer

On June 13, 2018, the victim allegedly arranged to meet       with the seller in Palmetto, Florida to consummate the       contemplated sale of goods. The meeting was allegedly setup       in response to a post on the OfferUp platform. When the       victim arrived, he was allegedly robbed and shot multiple       times. The Court concluded that Section 230 barred the claim       against OfferUp.      Craigslist Faces No Accountability for Allegedly Facilitating Sex                        Trafficking of a 15-Year-Old

Back in 2008, a then fifteen-year-old girl began to       allegedly be forcibly trafficked for commercial sex, which       allegedly continued for a decade across Miami-Dade County.       She was allegedly frequently expected to perform commercial       sexual acts for between eleven and fourteen different men       daily. The traffickers allegedly used craigslist's ``erotic       services'', ``adult services'', ``massage services'',       ``casual encounters'', and``personals'' categories to display       their posts and to send emails on the platform to negotiate       commercial sex sales. Her traffickers allegedly posted       sexually explicit, nude and partially nude photos as well as       coded words to advertise commercial sex. At times, messages       allegedly sent on the platform indicated that the victim was       underage. To use their platform, the traffickers allegedly       paid a fee to craigslist who never rejected or removed any       posts.

Although the Court explained that ``some of her allegations       demonstrate craigslist's appalling lack of diligence in       preventing trafficking, not a single one establishes that       craigslist created or developed the trafficking content.''       After an extensive legal battle, the Court ultimately found       craigslist not liable based on a Section 230 defense.    Mother Whose 11-year-old Son Was an Alleged Victim of Sexual Battery                   Denied Relief After a Four-Year Fight

Following an alleged sexual assault of legal guardian's 11-      year-old son and two other minor males in 1994, Richard Lee       Russell was criminally convicted for events relating to those       alleged in the complaint. This sexual predator under Florida       Law allegedly solicited the sale of the photographs and video       of this assault in America Online, Inc., chat rooms.       Ultimately, this case was appealed all the way to the Florida       Supreme Court. The mother was denied civil relief from       America Online, Inc., after the Court found Section 230       preempted Florida law.                        Emerging Threat of AI Chatbots

Beyond platforms serving as a predator superhighway,       today's parents must contend with AI chatbots that are       grooming children and pretending to be licensed therapists.       For example, a 14-year-old boy, after allegedly prolonged       conversations with an AI chatbot, tragically ended his life       near Orlando, Florida. His brave mother recently testified in       the Senate Judiciary Committee that the company Character       Technologies, Inc., would not disclose to her many of her       child's last words. Imagine a parent not being allowed to       know what was going on through her child's mind in his final       minutes.

Republican,Dave Joyce,Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act,"Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S.  331, the HALT Fentanyl Act.

This bipartisan bill will save lives by providing critical tools for  law enforcement to combat the ongoing opioid crisis across our country.

Thousands of Americans continue to die each year from fentanyl  overdoses, and Ohio has been particularly hard-hit by the epidemic.

Prior to the temporary rescheduling in 2018, fentanyl-related  substances could only be controlled individually, allowing cartel  chemists to easily create new uncontrolled compounds. This temporary  rescheduling proved to be effective as the number of new compounds  since then has significantly declined.

The prevalence of fentanyl-related substances and continued  trafficking of dangerous narcotics across our southern border requires  strong, decisive action from our Congress.

According to the DEA, there were more than 36 million fentanyl pills  and nearly 4,000 pounds of fentanyl powder seized in 2025. This  represents over 157 million deadly doses.

As a former prosecutor and a co-chair of the Addiction, Treatment,  and Recovery Caucus, I understand the importance of law enforcement  aggressively targeting traffickers and making sure that we are  addressing societal challenges of addiction.

Each life lost to an overdose is a tragedy. We must declare war on  the drugs that are killing our kids in our community.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and send  it to the President's desk.",2025-06-11,2025-W24
Republican,Tom Cole,"Motion to Go to Conference on H.R. Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026","Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1 of rule XXII, and by  direction of the Committee on Appropriations, I offer a motion.

Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I support this return to regular order in the  appropriations process.

I support the motion. I yield back the balance of my time, and move  the previous question.

The previous question was ordered.",,
Democrat,Scott Peters,Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act,"Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment includes the language from my  bill, H.R. 1948, allowing the International Boundary and Water  Commission, or IBWC, to accept up to $5 million per year from other  Federal agencies or outside entities, such as cities, States, and  nonprofit organizations, for wastewater treatment and flood-control  projects like those that would fight the cross-border sewage crisis in  San Diego.

The IBWC has jurisdiction over the South Bay International Wastewater  Treatment Plant in San Diego, where longstanding operational and  maintenance failures have allowed raw sewage to flow from the Tijuana  River into San Diego's beaches. This has created a public health crisis  that strains local resources, poses significant environmental risks,  and forces our servicemembers to train in polluted sewage water.

Under current law, Federal agencies, State governments, and local  entities cannot transfer funds to projects under IBWC's jurisdiction.  This leaves IBWC reliant on annual appropriations or emergency funding  to build and maintain its facilities.

My office, along with the rest of the San Diego delegation, has  secured $360 million in emergency funding to help address chronic  issues at the South Bay treatment plant. I thank all of the people in  this Chamber who have supported that, including a number of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are veteran Navy SEALs  and have been very concerned about this issue.

This amendment would provide another tool to ensure San Diego does  not need to move from emergency to emergency to secure adequate funding  for the plant. If we can get money from other sources, there is no  reason not to accept it. For some reason, current law prevents us from  accepting even a donation from a nonprofit that would want to help us  with the issue.

Mr. Chair, I say let's get out of the way. H.R. 1948 passed out of  the House on suspension in June of this year, and I hope to see it  become law on any topical legislative vehicle before us. In this case,  our amendment would authorize additional funding sources to further  expedite the completion of clean water projects that fall under IBWC's  jurisdiction. I think it makes sense and is good for everyone.

Mr. Chair, I appreciate the support of my colleagues, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the support of my colleague,  the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer), and the committee. I  urge support of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.",2025-12-11,2025-W50
Democrat,Bill Foster,Recognizing Robert ``bob'' P. Hubbard As Batavia's 2024 Citizen of the Year,"Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Robert ``Bob'' P.  Hubbard for receiving the 2024 Citizen of the Year Award in the City of  Batavia. The Citizen of the Year Award celebrates individuals who have  made a profound impact towards inspiring and uplifting the City of  Batavia.

As a native Batavian, Bob has lived a life rooted in the values of  compassion, civic engagement, and integrity. His contributions have  touched nearly every corner of the Batavia community and continue to  uplift countless lives.

Bob is a driving force behind the recruiting and funding work for the  INCubator Entrepreneurship Program. Since 2015, he has recruited and  coordinated dozens of volunteer mentors, coaches, and judges, providing  over 500 students with meaningful real-world business experience.  Through his leadership, the program has raised more than $80,000 and  secured $100,000 in grants, helping to build a lasting foundation for  future innovation.

As a longtime CASA Kane County volunteer, he has dedicated his  efforts to protecting the community's most vulnerable, serving as a  Court-Appointed Special Advocate and Guardian Ad Litem. In these roles,  he has been a steadfast voice for children in abuse and neglect cases,  offering critical guidance and advocacy. He has also provided  leadership to numerous community organizations, including TriCity  Family Services, the LivingWell Cancer Resource Center, the Community  Foundation of the Fox River Valley, and the Batavia Community Chest.  Notably, his tenure with the Rotary Club of Batavia has spanned nearly  four decades and includes service as club president, recognition as  Rotarian of the Year, and multiple Paul Harris Fellow honors.

Beyond formal roles, Bob embodies the essence of ``Service Above  Self.'' Whether he's packing food for the Northern Illinois Food Bank,  supporting families through CHIP IN Batavia, participating in roadside  cleanups, or doing yard work for neighbors in need, Bob is always the  first to volunteer.

He is also a steward of Batavia's legacy. As the third-generation  owner of Hubbard's Home Furnishings, his family's business served the  community for over 100 years.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent such an extraordinary citizen of  Batavia, Illinois, who exemplifies what it means to be a good neighbor  and a true public servant. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring  Robert ``Bob'' P. Hubbard for his remarkable lifetime of service and  congratulating him on being named the 2024 Citizen of the Year.",2025-04-24,2025-W17
Democrat,Al Green,Racism Infused in Texas Politics,"Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, a liberated  Democrat, unbought, unbossed, unafraid; censured, but not silenced.

I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to address the topic of racism infused in  Texas politics.

Mr. Speaker, I have in my hand a letter from the Justice Department.  It is a letter that has as its reference Unconstitutional Race-Based  Congressional Districts, and then it cites the districts: Texas  District 9, occupied by a person of color; Texas 18 was occupied by a  person of color, who is deceased, to be filled soon; District 29,  occupied by a person of color; District 33, occupied by a person of  color.

Now, this letter goes on to infuse race into the conversation. The  last sentence in the last paragraph reads: ``If the State of Texas  fails to rectify the racial gerrymandering of TX-09, TX-18, TX-29, and  TX-33, the Attorney General reserves the right to seek legal action  against the State, including without limitation under the 14th  Amendment.''

Race has been infused into this letter. It was sent to the Honorable  Greg Abbott, the Governor of the State of Texas, and the Honorable Ken  Paxton.

Dear friends, at the end of the day, if they can fulfill what they  proclaim in this letter, there will be more White representation in  Congress from Texas and less Black and Latino representation. This is  nothing more than an attempt to silence many of the voices that are  emanating from communities of color in the State of Texas. It is  racist.

Now, in this country there seems to be a problem with people saying  ``racism.'' It is okay to say ``anti-Semitism,'' but don't say  ``racism.'' Racism has not received the same amount of  acclaim when it comes to dealing with racist issues that anti-Semitism  has received when it comes to dealing with things that are anti- Semitic.

Well, I am not afraid. I am going to speak truth to power and about  power. Here is the truth: Under this President, Republicanism is  eroding and devolving into racism. This President has declined to allow  persons from countries of color to come into the country when he has  opened the door to Anglos from South Africa. This President has found a  way to circumvent what would ordinarily be a society that appreciates  and respects people of all colors, and he is turning society against  people of color.

This letter, if they succeed with this, will be the equivalent of  having a mid-decade redistricting without the empirical evidence  necessary to do it with a sense of justice. They will do this, and in  so doing, it is comparable to having the halftime at a basketball game,  and one team decides, because they have the power to do so, to remove  two players from the other team and let that team proceed with three  players, and they will now proceed with five. Oh, no, wait, you have to  have 10 players on the floor, so what they will do is they will just  take those 2 players and add them to their team. They will play with  seven, and the other team will play with three.

They are diminishing the amount of representation that people of  color will have in the State of Texas. Republicanism is being equated  to racism too often in this country, and that is not the case.  Republicanism has always been about conservative policies, but now they  are about racist policies.

This President is infusing, injecting racism into Presidential  policy. It is unconstitutional. I am going to fight it, but more than  that, I am going to tell the truth about it. If I happen to be one of  those who is extricated, who is removed, evicted, I will be bloodied  but unbowed.

Mr. Speaker, nobody is going to silence me. You can come after me,  but you won't stop me. You won't silence me. I refuse to allow  Republicanism in the form of racism to dictate the policies in the  State of Texas without my voice being heard.

Finally, this: I say to my friends that I have on my Texas tie. I am  proud to represent my State. I am proud to say I stand against  Republicanism as racism.",2025-07-23,2025-W30
Democrat,Ron Wyden,Recognizing the 40th Anniversary of the Goonies,"Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, this year marks the 40th anniversary of  the release of the beloved classic film, ``The Goonies.'' With enduring  and relatable themes of adventure, acceptance, and friendship, ``The  Goonies'' has become one of the alltime great American underdog  stories. ``The Goonies'' has withstood the test of time and firmly  established its place in American culture. A large part of what makes  this film unique and impactful is its iconic setting along the stunning  Oregon coastline. Indeed, so significant is the film's location that  thousands of fans from around the globe gather each year in Astoria,  OR, for a multiday celebration to commemorate the magic that is ``The  Goonies.''

One of the reasons for the enduring success of ``The Goonies'' is the  lessons it has imparted on generations of viewers who come away  inspired to stand up to bullies, accept people who are different from  them, and ``never say die'' when it comes to fighting for their  communities and the things they believe in. As I travel to my townhalls  all over Oregon and hear the deep concerns that so many Oregonians feel  about the state of our country and the world, I hope we can all take an  important lesson or two from ``The Goonies.''

Fans from around the world will flock to Astoria this summer for  ``The Goonies'' 40th anniversary celebration. All of them will be able  to participate  in treasure hunts, costume contests, and many other Goonies-adjacent  events. In addition to Astoria, the 40th anniversary festivities will  also include a visit to Ecola State Park, home to some of Oregon's  foremost coastal views and the site of some legendary Goonies  adventures. Visitors to Astoria this summer will also be welcomed to  the Oregon Film Museum, which eagle-eyed fans may recognize as the  former Clatsop County jail, which played host to the Goonies iconic  jailbreak scene.

Just as the original Goonies fans and stars have grown and matured  since the film's release in 1985, so has Oregon's film industry. With  its magnificent and diverse natural beauty, Oregon has become a much  sought after location for film production. As the backdrop for major  television shows and box office hits alike, film production in Oregon  brings with it good-paying jobs and tourism that in turn support local  businesses and economic development across the State. Certainly all  film producers in Oregon and across the country should aspire to  achieve the remarkable success of ``The Goonies.''

Whether we are learning important life lessons from the stalwart  friendships in ``The Goonies'' or taking note of how Oregon has grown a  film industry no one could have imagined 40 years ago, what is  important is that we all recognize the power in our differences--and to  ``never say die!''",2025-04-03,2025-W14
Democrat,Brittany Pettersen,Support for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025,"Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Chair, I am here to beg for your consideration in support of my  amendment to address something that happened with the reconciliation  bill that changed the 1115 waiver.

Now, this sounds incredibly wonky. An 1115 waiver to Medicaid is  something that we are not going to be able to go home and talk to  constituents about what we were able to do for them. Nobody knows what  the 1115 waiver is.

However, when you talk about the impacts that this has made, this is  especially impactful when it comes to Colorado and what we have been  able to do to address the opioid epidemic. In Colorado, we were able to  utilize the 1115 waiver by proving that by covering substance use  disorder treatment, we could save money over time.

What happened in the reconciliation bill was language that said you  actually had to prove that it was cost neutral up front and that you  couldn't prove the cost savings over time.

What this language will do, it will take our ability in Colorado away  to utilize this waiver that has drawn down hundreds of millions of  dollars for substance use disorder treatment. In fact, we were the  second in the Nation to implement this waiver, and a total of 37 States  now take advantage of this.

Mr. Chair, 83 percent of people who are treated in the rural parts of  Colorado and across the Nation are on Medicaid. This will significantly  impact red States, blue States, and especially the rural places across  the United States.

Like many people, my family has been impacted by the opioid epidemic.  When I was just 6 years old, my mom hurt her back. She was  overprescribed opioids and became addicted like so many Americans.  Through my struggle fighting to save my mom's life, I saw how broken  our system was, and that is when I worked as a State legislator to  change that.

What I saw in my mom's fight when she was overdosing at a high rate  when fentanyl started coming into the supply chain, and she was begging  for help with nowhere to go, was that Medicaid did not cover substance  use disorder treatment. You actually had to go through this waiver  process.

I watched my mom being churned in and out of the ER, being kept alive  in the ICU in critical condition. The State of Colorado and the Federal  Government spent over a million dollars in one year keeping her alive  in the ER while denying her access to the care that she so desperately  sought.

I was finally able to go through a very complicated court order  process to get her the care that she needed. My mom now is about to  celebrate 8 years in recovery. She works at one of the places that  saved her life and gives back to the community. She is a taxpayer. She  is an example of what is possible when we actually invest in people and  give them the care that they need.

After hearing her story, we were able to implement this waiver to  really increase our capacity as a State to address the opioid crisis.  We know that more people have died from the opioid crisis than all  world wars combined, and these are people that we didn't have to lose  if we actually had the system to support them.

Mr. Chairman, by rolling back this language, you are decimating the  substance use disorder treatment across the United States in 37 States  and many right now who are in the process of applying for the waiver  and who are looking to Colorado as an example.

This would mean hundreds of millions of dollars of treatment we would  be denied. The first year alone, we treated 58,000 people with the care  that they needed in Colorado. This is 5 years with implementation. It  is the reason why we now have a 35 percent reduction in overdose deaths  in Colorado. It is overwhelmingly the reason.

Addressing the Medicaid barrier is so important. Let me explain why.  People who struggle with the substance use disorder, this brain  disease, it increases the likelihood of a decrease in employment.

Mr. Chairman, 80 to 90 percent of people who are struggling with  substance use disorder qualify for Medicaid. When the treatment they  need and the healthcare they need is not covered and the healthcare  system they are relying on is dismantled, the people in this community  who are the most vulnerable are disproportionately impacted.

On a day when we are working to ensure that some of the critical  programs at the Federal level are funded in this bill which is an  important piece of this, we also have to support the structure  and the payment system that supports the people on the ground who are  doing this work.

It took us years to bring the study, bring the waiver, and prove that  this would be a cost savings over time, and then to implement it.

Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

Ms. PETTERSEN. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.",2025-06-04,2025-W23
Democrat,Richard Blumenthal,-9999,"Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored to follow the ranking  member on the Foreign Relations Committee and to be followed by another  distinguished member of that same committee and to focus on these first  100 days.

The focus on the first 100 days of an administration, I think, comes  from  the time of Franklin Roosevelt and his 100 days in the midst of deep  depression, despondency, and despair on the part of the American  people, and the whirlwind of activity that he brought to addressing our  Nation's depression.

And there are dramatic differences between those 100 days and the 100  days we have seen from President Trump. First and foremost, our economy  was at near full employment, at a time of solid prosperity, 100 days  ago, and we are now sliding toward exactly the kind of economic  downturn that F.D.R. helped to address.

Second, in those first 100 days of the Roosevelt administration,  there was a whirlwind of congressional activity, inspired by the  President, with his proposals for new Agencies and programs and  investments. Congress was a partner. In this administration, President  Trump has acted unilaterally by Executive order--illegally,  unconstitutionally, and unchecked, except by courts that have been a  bulwark.

In those first 100 days of the Roosevelt administration, F.D.R.  appealed to our ``better angels,'' our willingness to give back, to be  generous to our fellow Americans. He later inspired us with the call to  ``a rendezvous with destiny.'' In this administration, which is plagued  with corruption, crypto theft, and Musk exploitation of Agencies, it is  a downward spiral, a race to the bottom in an appeal to self-indulgence  and self-enrichment.

There are many, many other differences, but the whirlwind of activity  here has produced chaos. That is the operative word: chaos. The turmoil  and turbulence have produced confusion and, yes, anxiety, deep fear,  and apprehension about the future of this country. And the poll numbers  only reflect not only the downward spiral of our economy but of our  confidence in the future.

This administration has been cruel, and it has been dumb. It is  unmatched for its meanness and stupidity--the harm and hurt done to  everyday Americans in real life and realtime; the harm in tariffs  already having effect on the uncertainty of businesses about the  future, their inability to plan, to invest in new manufacturing, and  the fear of people that they will be jobless and lose the dignity of  work and be hit with higher prices for everything from groceries to  gasoline, to housing; the harm done in healthcare already, our  federally qualified health centers deprived of funding, NIH research  grants for curing cancer, for diabetes or hypertension canceled or  frozen; in education, the uncertainty and loss of funding for special  education and other programs that benefit children and the neediest and  most vulnerable of our districts, in rural areas as well as urban; and,  of course, the damage to our fundamental freedoms, women's reproductive  freedoms, the suspension of title X grants, and the assault on women's  healthcare--other freedoms: the basic due process of people who should  have a right to receive notice and the opportunity to be heard before  they are deported, before they are detained, before they are imprisoned  or put on a plane to be imprisoned out of the country.

Basic fairness and due process rights that involve also the President  intimidating law firms with threats that they will be denied access to  security clearances or even to go on to governmental property, and  intimidation and threatening our universities, supposedly in the name  of anti-Semitism--nobody hates anti-Semitism more than I do, but I  despise using anti-Semitism as a pretext or a guise simply to attack  people or institutions because they disagree with a public official.

We live in a time when the rule of law is under threat, perhaps as  never before in my lifetime, and the cause of freedom, all around the  world, is in jeopardy. Ukraine has been betrayed. This Nation has  switched sides to the enduring and deep detriment of our standing in  the world, our reliability as a partner and ally. The harm may be  irreparable.

We must stand with Ukraine. We now have more than 60 cosponsors of a  Russia sanctions bill that I have been proud to lead with Senator  Graham--it is bipartisan, evenly divided in cosponsorship--to send a  message to Vladimir Putin: We are going to hit you, and we are going to  hit you hard economically if you continue to stall and string along  America, if you continue to play the President.

But Donald Trump has been a seemingly willing partner in being played  by Vladimir Putin, his bro, his role model, perhaps.

Nobody has a stronger right to claim credit for preserving our  freedoms in the past and now than our veterans, and they have been  betrayed by this administration. For our veterans, it has been 100 days  of chaos, of cruelty, stupidity, anxiety on their part, and  apprehension, and 100 days of decisions made about their healthcare and  their benefits. They were promised healthcare, and they were promised  benefits. And now this administration is breaking those promises, not  by coming to Congress and asking for a rescission or changing the PACT  Act, which we passed in a bipartisan way, but simply by firing the  people who were supposed to approve those claims for PACT Act benefits  for veterans who have been exposed to toxic chemicals or burn pits.

And this is an administration that has fired already 2,500 of those  dedicated VA employees, close to one-third of them veterans themselves,  thousands from the Federal workforce, generally, close to 30 percent of  them are veterans as well. And make no mistake, every one of these days  has been a time of crisis for those veterans. Since day one, the  administration has systematically shortchanged and betrayed veterans  with its policies.

They have not only fired that 2,500 in reckless mass terminations of  probationary employees--our young workforce, starting out on jobs, our  VA future, and some of them dedicated multiyear employees who have just  been promoted and, therefore, are in those new positions on a  probationary basis. They have been promoted because they were good at  their jobs and dedicated and hard-working, and they have been fired.

That is why I have proposed the Putting Veterans First Act, which  would put those veterans back on the job--all of them from the VA--and  put those veterans back on the job from the Federal workforce, and make  sure that anybody who is terminated in the future gets a right to a  personal, individual evaluation, and not just fired because Elon Musk  wants to meet certain numbers or apply an algorithm or have his tech  bros pick out randomly, arbitrarily names from the list.

There are 83,000 of those VA jobs on the chopping block. The approach  of this Secretary of the VA, of Elon Musk, and Donald Trump is ``Fire  first, plan later''; ``Fire first, evaluate later.''

I am disappointed that so many of my Republican colleagues are  seeking to minimize or diminish the human impacts of these cuts,  because I am hearing from veterans, just as I am from people in  Connecticut and all around the country.

I went to Michigan just last week to talk to folks there. Those human  impacts are heartbreaking because these actions are heartless, and they  are impactful not only on the incomes of these people but on their  self-worth, their sense of dignity. They have devoted their lives to  caring for veterans, and now, with the sweep of a hand, they get the  back of a hand from Elon Musk, who has never ever even thought about  wearing the uniform of the U.S. military.

These human impacts include world-class researchers who are looking  into how to predict stroke risk among veterans; enrollment of veterans  into clinical trials for advanced cancer delayed because of the VA's  hiring freeze; openings for new clinics that have been delayed because  the VA can't hire the necessary staff to open their doors; the VA  mental health staff forced to conduct counseling sessions in open  cubicles without privacy, basic privacy, for the veterans who are  talking about their innermost doubts and fears; service lines at VA  hospitals and clinics that have been halted; beds in operating rooms at  VA facilities that have been suspended. We are hearing about VA supply  teams now understaffed and behind on placing critical supply requests  for medication and equipment; support lines for caregivers that have  been reduced; Veterans Crisis Line employees fired and, after a public  backlash, maybe some rehired, as we heard today in a hearing of the  Veterans Affairs' Committee. But the impact is enduring because suicide  prevention has to be done in the moment, and suicide  prevention training sessions have been postponed or canceled.

Earlier this month, the Secretary announced he will be abruptly  canceling the VA Servicing Purchase Program, known as VASP, on May 1.  Now, I know very few of my colleagues have heard about VASP, but it is  a program that enables veterans to get some very temporary, short-term  help so they can avoid eviction from their homes and the homelessness  that we are all ashamed to acknowledge continues to exist in the  greatest country in the history of the world.

Our veterans are on the streets without shelter because they lack  homes, and here is a program designed to keep them in their homes, and  the Secretary is canceling it.

With housing more unaffordable than ever and veterans losing their  jobs, I am at a loss--total, absolute loss--to understand how he can  cancel a critical program that helps veterans undergoing financial  hardship to stay in their homes.

I challenge the Secretary of the VA; I challenge the President of the  United States; I challenge my colleagues across the aisle: Instead of  saying yes blindly to Elon Musk, when he says ``Slash and trash the VA,  fire those thousands of people, and end those programs,'' look at them  not as waste but as an investment.

Yes, if there is waste, let's eliminate it. But as the national  commander of the VFW--Veterans of Foreign Wars--said to us in one of  our hearings, when he was wounded in combat, the surgeon who took the  shrapnel out of his arm did it with a scalpel; he did not cut the arm  off with a chain saw. Let's give up Elon Musk's chain saw, and if there  is waste, do it with a scalpel.

These first 100 days have been disgraceful and shameful, cruel and  dumb, deeply un-American. These VA employees are the ones delivering  healthcare to the people we love and revere.

To my colleagues across the aisle, I just want to remind you in  closing that this is a moment that will define you, your career, your  reputation. It is a moment of profound historic challenges that has  been recognized with massive marches here in the Nation's Capital, in  Connecticut, around our State--New London, New Haven, Westport, New  Britain. I have been to many of them.

Veterans are one of most powerful voices in our country, and I urge  them to use those voices and their faces to say: We need the PACT Act.  We need veterans' healthcare. We need to fulfill our promises.

As VFW commander Al Lipphardt said at that hearing, apply pressure  and stop the bleeding.

These heartless and heartbreaking cuts, firings, freezes are un- American. My Republican colleagues, who have been almost entirely  silent, please do the right thing. Our country has made a sacred  promise. Our duties as Members of Congress is to keep our promises.",2025-04-29,2025-W18

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to these  resolutions that strip away a State's right to protect its residents  from dangerous air pollution.

As a pulmonologist, a lung doctor, I have spent my career caring for  people struggling to breathe--patients with asthma, COPD, and lung  cancer. However, I am also a mother, deeply concerned about the world  we are leaving our children.

I came to Congress after years of treating the consequences of  inaction. I could no longer stand by while politicians ignored the root  cause--the pollution poisoning the air we breathe. The truth is, Madam  Speaker, our air is making us sick, and we have the power and  responsibility to do something about it.

More than 156 million people in this country live in counties with  dangerous levels of ozone and particulate matter, and yet instead of  empowering States to raise the bar on clean air, Republicans are  telling them to stand down. Let me say this another way. Republicans  are telling States they cannot take action to protect their people,  their health, and their future.

They want to prevent States that are at the forefront from using  their authority to cut tailpipe pollution, a move that guts local  authority in favor of polluters. We must let our communities lead.  Repealing these waivers would undermine stronger vehicle emissions  standards that reduce dangerous pollution and are essential to fighting  the climate crisis.

Make no mistake: That would have immediate impact for our  communities, for every family living near a busy highway, every child  using an inhaler, and every senior who can't go outside on a high  pollution day. This is a direct attack on over 50 years of precedent  that recognizes that EPA has the authority and the obligation to allow  States to do what is required to protect their residents.

I am, frankly, stunned that my Republican colleagues in the House  want to undermine States' rights. Repealing these waivers is an illegal  expansion of the use of CRAs, which the Government Accountability  Office and the Senate Parliamentarian have conclusively determined  cannot be used for this purpose. This is government overreach at its  most reckless.

It is a distraction--a deliberate one--from the fact that President  Trump's agenda is failing to meet the needs of working families. It  doesn't lower prescription costs. It doesn't fix our crumbling  infrastructure, and it certainly doesn't improve the air our children  breathe or the water they drink. At the end of the day, every American  deserves the right to breathe clean air.  Clean air shouldn't be political. Clean air shouldn't be anything but  fundamental.

The people of Oregon should know that I see these attacks for what  they are. I hear their concerns, and I will not stop fighting to  protect them, their children, and their future. I will fight to ensure  that science, not politics, guides how we safeguard our communities.                            Parliamentary Inquiry",2025-04-30,2025-W18
Republican,Chuck Grassley,"Boulder, Colorado Attack","Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yet again, I am here to draw attention  and to condemn another outrageous attack that was aimed at the Jewish  community here in the United States--specifically, Boulder, CO.

Yesterday, a deranged individual took a homemade flamethrower and  Molotov cocktails to attack individuals marching for the release of  Israeli hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas. This deranged  individual allegedly yelled the words ``free Palestine.'' He yelled  this during the attack.

Reporting suggests that the individual may have overstayed his visa  that the Biden administration gave him and was then in the country  illegally.

This is the third high-profile attack on the Jewish community in the  last 2 months. This sort of hate is completely unacceptable in our  society, and, of course, we all know it needs to stop.

I commend FBI Director Patel for quickly responding and launching a  full investigation into this targeted attack. I trust that the FBI and  law enforcement will do their job and swiftly find justice for these  victims.",2025-06-02,2025-W23
Democrat,Chuck Schumer,Caribbean Boat Strike,"Mr. SCHUMER. Finally, Mr. President, on the Hegseth briefing of  yesterday, during yesterday's Gang of 8 briefing, I asked Secretary  Hegseth directly will he let every Member of Congress see the full,  unedited tapes of the September 2 boat strike. Secretary Hegseth's  answer? He said: We have to study it.

What the hell has he been doing for the last 3 months? Hegseth and  the DOD have had more than enough time to study this. It is time for  all Members of Congress to see the tapes for themselves.

I told Secretary Hegseth that every Member of Congress, Democrat and  Republican of the House and Senate, wants to see the tapes. Both  parties are united in demanding that the tapes be released. Our  Republican chairman of Armed Services and our Democratic  ranking member of Armed Services made a request together. This is not a  partisan issue. Both parties are united in demanding the tapes be  released not only to Congress but to the American people. The American  people want to have the transparency they deserve.

Hegseth is resisting that transparency. What is he hiding, what is  the DOD hiding, and what is President Trump hiding? Those are the  questions the American people are asking when it comes to Hegseth's  coverup of these tapes, these videos.

At the meeting, I also pressed Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth on the  administration's recent military action in the Caribbean. I wanted to  know: What are their plans? How far are they going? Is Donald Trump  about to drag America into another endless war?

And again, I didn't get any satisfying answers.

When it comes to matters of war and peace, Congress needs the truth;  the American people need transparency. Anything less is a total  disservice to our men and women in uniform and to every citizen of this  country.",2025-12-10,2025-W50
Democrat,Seth Magaziner,Protecting Prudent Investment of Retirement Savings Act,"Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.  I rise in opposition to this bill, which will only hurt the retirement  savings of millions of Americans.

Our Republican colleagues are once again prioritizing culture wars  over working people and threatening the retirement savings of nurses,  teachers, police officers, and healthcare workers, who are just trying  to save for their future with peace of mind.

The bill before us today injects politics into investment decisions  that should be guided by sound financial judgment.

Let me be clear. Environmental, social, and governance risks are  material and pecuniary, and companies that adopt thoughtful policies on  these risks outperform those that don't over the long term.

If an oil company is cutting corners, and it leads to a spill that is  expensive to the company, that hurts shareholders. That hurts people  who are saving for retirement. That is a failure to manage an  environmental risk.

If a company maintains a culture in the office that allows rampant  discrimination that causes lawsuits that are expensive to the company,  that is a social factor. That is a material risk.

If executive pay is structured in a way where it is not tied to  shareholder performance, that is a risk.

As a former State treasurer, I know that ignoring these risks does  not make them disappear.

By the way, the proxy voting process is an important way for  shareholders to tell executives at companies when they think that  something needs to change. They are nonbinding. What this bill would do  is make it harder for shareholders to vote to put even nonbinding items  in front of a board to consider.

I have heard the other side say that this bill does not preclude ESG  factors from being considered if they are material, but that is not  true in practice. What will happen in practice is that SEC bureaucrats  and political appointees will get to choose what is material and what  is not.

Any time an executive, a corporate executive, doesn't like what a  shareholder proposal is about, they can go to the SEC and say: ``Keep  this off the ballot. I don't want to see it.'' It will be up to those  bureaucrats and political appointees to decide what is material and  what is not.

How about we trust the investors? How about we trust the people who  are actually doing the work? How about we trust the plan participants,  the workers, and the retirees? Anyone who has a 401(k) or an IRA will  tell you that they can go on the website and pick from a range of  different plans based on what they think is a good idea for them. Why  don't we trust them instead of trusting bureaucrats and political  appointees to make decisions for everybody else?

Understand why we are here and who this bill helps. This bill helps  corporate executives who do not want to be held accountable by their  own shareholders.

Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, this bill helps executives who do not  want to be held accountable by their own shareholders for material ESG  risks.

It all comes down to time horizons, as Mr. Casten said. When I was  State treasurer, I had 60,000 people who were relying on me for their  retirement. I had people who were 90- or 100-year-old retirees, and I  had first-year teachers who were 23 years old. I owed just as much of a  fiduciary duty to those 23-year-olds as the 90-year-olds.

So long-term factors and ESG factors matter even when corporate  executives who are focused on the short term don't care about them.

This bill claims to be about free markets. It is the opposite. It is  taking choice away from investors and away from retirees and plan  participants and putting it in the hands of bureaucrats and political  appointees.

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.",2026-01-15,2026-W03
Republican,Ann Wagner,Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act,"Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3394) to amend the Securities Act of 1933 to codify certain  qualifications of individuals as accredited investors for purposes of  the securities laws, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3394

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Investment       Opportunities for Professional Experts Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF ACCREDITED INVESTOR.

(a) In General.--Section 2(a)(15) of the Securities Act of       1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(15)) is amended--

(1) by redesignating subparagraphs (i) and (ii) as       subparagraphs (A) and (F), respectively; and

(2) in subparagraph (A) (as so redesignated), by striking       ``; or'' and inserting a semicolon, and inserting after such       subparagraph the following:

``(B) with respect to a proposed sale of a security, any       natural person whose individual net worth, or joint net worth       with that person's spouse or spousal equivalent, at the time       of such sale, exceeds $1,000,000 (which amount, along with       the amounts set forth in subparagraph (C), shall be adjusted       for inflation by the Commission every 5 years to the nearest       $10,000 to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for       All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor       Statistics) where, for purposes of calculating net worth       under this subparagraph--

``(i) the person's primary residence shall not be included       as an asset;

``(ii) indebtedness that is secured by the person's primary       residence, up to the estimated fair market value of the       primary residence at the time of such sale, shall not be       included as a liability (except that if the amount of such       indebtedness outstanding at the time of such sale       exceeds the amount outstanding 60 days before such time,       other than as a result of the acquisition of the primary       residence, the amount of such excess shall be included as a       liability); and

``(iii) indebtedness that is secured by the person's       primary residence in excess of the estimated fair market       value of the primary residence at the time of such sale shall       be included as a liability;

``(C) any natural person who had an individual income in       excess of $200,000 in each of the 2 most recent years or       joint income with that person's spouse or spousal equivalent       in excess of $300,000 in each of those years and has a       reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in       the current year;

``(D) any natural person who is--

``(i) currently licensed or registered as a broker or       investment adviser by the Commission, a self-regulatory       organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934), or the securities division of a State,       the District of Columbia, or a territory of the United States       or the equivalent division responsible for licensing or       registration of individuals in connection with securities       activities; and

``(ii) in good standing with respect to such licence or       registration;

``(E) any natural person the Commission determines, by       regulation, to have demonstrable education or job experience       to qualify such person as having professional knowledge of a       subject related to a particular investment, and whose       education or job experience is verified by a self-regulatory       organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934); or''.

(b) Rulemaking.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission       shall revise the definition of accredited investor under       Regulation D (17 CFR 230.500 et seq.) to conform with the       amendments made by subsection (a).

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3394, the Fair  Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act.

I thank our Financial Services Committee chairman, the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), for his leadership on this bipartisan legislation.

For decades, the SEC's accredited investor definition has served as a  gatekeeper to private investment opportunities, relying almost entirely  on income and net worth thresholds.

This approach has excluded millions of Americans who may not meet  those financial metrics but have the education, licenses, or  professional experiences to make informed investment decisions.

H.R. 3394 modernizes that definition. It directs the SEC to expand  eligibility to individuals who hold certain professional  certifications, relevant degrees, or job experience, criteria that  actually reflect financial sophistication.

This change is long overdue. It will unlock capital for small  businesses, broaden investor participation, and better align our rules  with how Americans build expertise and manage risk in today's economy.

The bill maintains investor protections, while removing arbitrary  barriers that have held back individual investors and early-stage  entrepreneurs alike.

Mrs. WAGNER. In closing, Mr. Speaker, the Fair Investment  Opportunities for Professional Experts Act maintains investor  protections while removing arbitrary barriers that have held back  individual investors and early-stage entrepreneurs alike.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3394, and I yield  back the balance of my time.

Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.",2025-06-23,2025-W26
Democrat,Emilia Sykes,Mental Health Solutions,"Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about an issue that  touches every community in this country: mental health.

More than one in five adults in the United States live with a mental  health illness. These are our friends, neighbors, coworkers, or family  members. For many of us, this is a deeply personal issue.

Whether you live in a big city or a small town, almost everyone has a  person in their life who is struggling, and chances are you know  someone who has struggled or you could be struggling yourself.

In Ohio, we have seen just how urgent this crisis has become, where  we have only about half the behavioral health workforce we need to meet  the demand. In fact, there is just one psychiatrist for every 6,000  Ohioans. That is not just a workforce problem. It is a public health  emergency, a safety issue, and a challenge to our quality of life.

When I came to Congress, I promised to work with anyone from either  side of the aisle to address the challenges that matter most to the  people of Ohio's 13th. That is why I have reintroduced the Mental  Health Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill to provide tens of millions  of dollars annually to expand our behavioral health workforce, helping  to train, recruit, and retain mental health professionals across the  country.

It is a commonsense solution that will bring resources directly to  communities like mine, helping to address addiction, reduce suicide,  and ensure more Americans get the care they need when they need it.

I hope that everyone joins me in passing this bipartisan bill. Our  country demands it.",2025-05-07,2025-W19
Democrat,Lou Correa,Strategic Homeland Intelligence and Enforcement Legislation to Defend Against the Ccp Act,"Mr. Speaker, I think we all agree that the United States' main  competitor is China and the Chinese Communist Party who are intent on  tilting the global playing field to their benefit, undermining our  national standing.

To do this, China is expanding its covert influence, seeking to turn  public opinion and effect policies that are more favorable to China and  against the United States. Additionally, the CCP seeks to exploit  American openness to steal economic secrets and undermine our national  security.

This bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to  establish a working group to coordinate its efforts to address the  threats posed to the homeland by the Chinese Communist Party.

The working group will examine the threats posed by the CCP, identify  ongoing Departmental efforts to address those threats, identify any  gaps in such efforts, and then facilitate coordination across DHS to  holistically address the threats from the CCP.

Mr. Speaker, this bill helps ensure that DHS implements a coordinated  and effective response to the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to  undermine the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Strong for sponsoring this  legislation,  but I must acknowledge that over the past few weeks, the Trump  administration has taken several alarming actions that work to counter  the work we are trying to do today with this legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I urge the Trump administration to work with Congress  and not against Congress' efforts to strengthen America's ability to  compete with China like this bill that aims to do exactly that.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.",2025-03-10,2025-W11
Democrat,Marcy Kaptur,Unfair Tariffs on Canada,"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as more Trump administration tariff news  broke, heading into this past weekend, I rise to ask a genuine  question: Why is the Trump administration doing this ying-yang again?

President Trump's latest 35 percent tariff threat against Canada is  pure economic malpractice. It is reckless, rushed, and devastating to  firms and working families across Ohio.

Canada is Ohio's largest trading partner. Over 100,000 jobs in Ohio  depend on trade with Canada. Our State exports $21 billion in goods  annually to our neighbor to the North, our largest fair-trade partner.

From Toledo Jeep and General Motors to the parts manufacturers in  Sandusky, Lorain, and Defiance, these aren't just numbers. These are  paychecks, pensions, and livelihoods.

The last time this administration tried tariff stunts, $6 trillion in  U.S. wealth vanished in days. Workers were laid off, and Ohio is  already among the top 10 States experiencing rising unemployment. We  have all seen Trump chicken out before, and maybe Taco Tuesday will  come again soon.

Mr. Speaker, people in my region want a job they can count on. They  don't want ying-yang on U.S. trade and tariff policy. Let's get back to  normal.",2025-07-14,2025-W29
Democrat,Eric Swalwell,Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Enhancement Act,"Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Bottles  and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Enhancement Act.

Air travel with children is a nightmare, and I am just talking for  the nonparents who have to deal with them at an airport. For parents,  it is hell. It is like an Olympic sport. It is like going through a  gauntlet dragging little kids who just want to be attached to tablets  or anything but the directions that you are giving to them to hopefully  get them from the entrance of the airport to the plane.

Oftentimes with little kids, you have, in transit with them, a mother  who is breastfeeding. Many of us have experienced going through airport  security where our TSA agents, who are good natured and just doing  their jobs, can really slow down, jam up, clog, and delay this  experience.

For practicality's sake, the last thing you want for your kids to  experience when you are trying to move them from the gate to the plane,  is any interruption or delay. For traveling moms, it is humiliating to  have your breast milk sorted through by TSA agents. It doesn't feel  very safe to have agents open up the breast milk. Too many moms have  shared with me that working moms are often traveling on their own  without their kids, but they are still pumping, pumping and dumping as  they would call it, and are asked by TSA agents, what are you doing  with breast milk if you don't have kids with you, which is another  level of shame that is brought upon the mothers because they already  feel guilty that they are not with their kids.

It doesn't have to be this way.

My friend from New York (Mr. Garbarino), who has helped me shepherd  this bill through the Homeland Security Committee, has given me a good  snicker and a smirk over there because he probably sees me as the least  likely person to bring this bill forward and he is the least likely  ally that I have on the other side, but the two of us are smart enough  to listen to women and families.

Madam Speaker, I will share the origin of this bill because it is a  success story for anybody who believes that they can write to their  legislator and see a change in the laws that govern us. I thank  scientist Emily Calandrelli, a Californian whose advocacy and personal  testimony brought national attention to this issue. She wrote about the  exact experience I described, traveling as a working mother without her  kids and being asked why she had breast milk but no children. Her  experience made it clear to many parents who have faced similar  challenges.

I thank Senator Duckworth for leading the charge in the Senate and  sending us this bill so quickly as well as Representatives Salazar,  Pettersen, and Luna for their unwavering advocacy for traveling  mothers.

I also thank my former colleague, Katie Porter of Orange County, who  introduced this bill in prior Congresses. It is a commonsense bill, and  it is rightfully a bipartisan effort.

Compounding the chaos with the anxiety that mothers face are TSA  screeners who have inadequate or confusing guidelines as to what they  are supposed to do with breast milk. The Bottles and Breastfeeding  Equipment Screening Enhancement Act strengthens and streamlines TSA's  screening procedures so parents can travel with dignity, confidence,  and peace of mind.

It requires TSA to work with maternal health experts to create clear,  science-based guidelines for screening breast milk, formula, and  pumping equipment. It ensures TSA officers receive proper training so  that every parent can travel with confidence that they will not be  forced to discard essential nutritional products.

Again, this is not a partisan issue. It is a parenting issue.  Unsanitary handling of breast milk and formula puts kids at risk.  Mothers who can't pump because TSA held up their equipment can suffer  painful, preventable medical complications. Every parent who has  traveled with young children knows the stress, as I mentioned, that  this creates.

This bill is also about accountability. It directs an independent  body to audit TSA's compliance with its own policies, ensuring that  violations like those experienced by Ms. Calandrelli and by countless  moms who shared their stories do not continue.

Madam Speaker, families deserve better than unnecessary stress at the  airport. They deserve clarity, dignity, and a safe travel system that  works for them, not against them.

Passing this bill now will send it to the President's desk. I can't  promise that passing this bill will make your plane get there on time  or give you the upgrade you are so desperately hoping  goes through or make sure that your kids behave, but it does finally  make our airports a more welcoming place for parents.

I welcome my colleagues' support and encourage them to support this  legislation by voting ``yes'' on S. 260.",2025-11-17,2025-W47
Republican,Addison McDowell,Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, today we take another big step toward  delivering a course correction for our country. The American people  sent us here with a mandate, to fight back and deliver on a promise.  That is what the One Big Beautiful Bill Act does.

Americans should first know what my colleagues in opposition to this  legislation are voting for and what they are voting against.

Not passing this bill means a $1,700 increase in taxes for the  average American family of four. Mr. Speaker, that might not be a big  deal to the elites in Manhattan or San Francisco, but it does mean a  lot to the people of my district in North Carolina.

Not passing this bill means our Border Patrol officers and our Coast  Guard won't have what they need to secure the border and stop the flow  of deadly fentanyl.

It doesn't stop there, Mr. Speaker. Opposing this bill also means  protecting waste over purpose, fraud over fairness, and foreign  interests over American strength.

Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure voters in my district know what  passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will mean for them. It means  they get to keep more of their hard-earned money. It means that small  businesses can spend more money on their employees instead of sending  it to Washington. This bill will make our communities safer by making a  historic investment in our border security. No more dangerous, illegal  aliens parading around with no consequences.

Mr. Speaker, this legislation is one of the most consequential items  we will vote on. It is President Trump's agenda, and it is what we all  told the people back home we would do.

Now the House must get it done. I urge all of my colleagues to vote  in favor of this rule. Let's choose our country over comfort and get  the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to the President's desk.",2025-07-02,2025-W27
Democrat,Jasmine Crockett,Notice of Intention to Offer Resolution Raising A Question of the Privileges of the House,"Ms. CROCKETT. Mr. Speaker, this is a distraction to take away from  the fact that the guardians of pedophiles is literally trying to  protect pedophiles. The President is a convicted felon and an accused  sex offender.

Stacey Plaskett hasn't been accused of either.

What are we actually here talking about? Trump and Epstein were  besties. We have all seen the pictures of them. We saw the birthday  book. So why are y'all more interested in talking about Stacey Plaskett  than Trump's relationship with the man?

When did y'all become so moral? I can remember when y'all wouldn't  sign the discharge petition. All of a sudden, everybody wanted to vote  for this, but you wouldn't sign the discharge petition.

Until we decide that we are going to go after the actual rapists and  pedophiles, miss me with your moral high ground.

Folks who also took money from somebody named Jeffrey Epstein, as I  had my team dig in very quickly: Mitt Romney, the NRCC, Lee Zeldin,  George Bush, WinRed, McCain-Palin, Rick Lazio.

I just want to be clear: If this is the standard that we are going to  make, just know we are going to expose it all, and just know that the  FEC filings are available for everybody to review.

This is absolutely ridiculous. You decide that you want to punish a  sitting Member of Congress because you are concerned about her text  messages. Well, maybe you should be more concerned about those sex  tapes that we still haven't gotten access to. Maybe you should be more  concerned with the fact that the President's name is mentioned in the  files way more than Stacey Plaskett's name.

Listen, I am not saying that anything is right or wrong. But if you  are trying to figure out what is going on with somebody that is a  criminal, then maybe you need to talk to their associates. That is  exactly why maybe she was getting text messages. I am not saying she  was or wasn't, but considering the fact that they were talking to  another associate of the President's, and maybe she needed intel, you  would have to go talk to somebody who maybe knows what he is up to.",2025-11-18,2025-W47
Democrat,Kelly Morrison,Millions Depend on Social Security,"Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to voice a concern from my  constituents, Jeff and Bev.

Last week, Trump's billionaire Commerce Secretary was speaking with  another billionaire about how only fraudsters would complain about  missing a Social Security check. Trump's billionaire Commerce Secretary  said that if Social Security didn't send out checks for a month, his  mother-in-law simply would not call to complain.

At the very same time, I held a townhall with my constituents where  Jeff and Bev, from Bloomington, asked this question: If or when Trump  ends Social Security, Bev and I will be unable to pay our mortgage. We  will become homeless at age 70. What can we do? What should we do?

There are tens of millions of Americans across the country like Jeff  and Bev who depend on that check coming every month. On their behalf, I  ask my Republican colleagues who have majority rule of this Chamber,  what are they going to do to stand up for American families and stop  the billionaires who are dismantling Social Security?",2025-03-27,2025-W13

Republican,"GT Thompson, Jr.",The Colossal Cherry,"Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend  the Wilds Sonshine Factory, a distillery in McKean County, Kane,  Pennsylvania, that makes a great product using sunflowers for that  beverage.

I commend them today for honoring a vital piece of the Commonwealth's  logging and conservation heritage, the Colossal Cherry. The Colossal  Cherry is now an artifact, but at one time it was the largest black  cherry tree in the world. The Wilds Sonshine Factory hosted a  dedication ceremony on August 22 in honor of the Colossal Cherry, which  is also known as the Sheffield Log.

Discovered and preserved through efforts of local historians and  conservation advocates, the Sheffield Log stands as a powerful symbol  of the region's natural history, the resilience of its people, and the  enduring value of sustainable forestry.

It once stood in the woods of the Allegheny National Forest before  being knocked down during the tornado of 1985. It was then formally  homed in Sheffield, Pennsylvania, to mark its sesquicentennial in 1986.  Now, the newly restored Colossal Black Cherry sits at its permanent  home at the Wilds Sonshine Factory.

Mr. Speaker, this rededication is a story worth celebrating. I thank  everyone who took part in the preservation of the Colossal Black  Cherry.",,
Republican,Brett Guthrie,Ndaa Restores Peace Through Strength,"Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have supported the 2026  National Defense Authorization Act. This bill is a generational  investment in our national defense.

House Republicans, alongside President Trump, are investing in our  military-industrial capabilities, securing all servicemembers a well- deserved pay raise, making meaningful strides to secure our southern  border, and so much more.

As a graduate of West Point and the proud Representative of Fort  Knox, I am excited by the commitment this bill makes to Army Reserve  Aviation and the strategic partnerships it creates with local  communities to inspire the next generation of warfighters by preserving  local museums like the Patton Museum.

Make no mistake, this NDAA restores peace through strength, rightly  refocuses our military posture, and puts America first.

Democrat,Jim Clyburn,January 6 Attack,"Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to  co-anchor the CBC Special Order along with my distinguished colleague,  Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland.

For the next 60 minutes, members of the CBC have an opportunity to  speak directly to the American people on the January 6 insurrection  attack, an issue of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus,  the constituents we represent, and all Americans.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay homage to the men and women who 5 years  ago risked their lives protecting the lives of those elected officials  who met in this Hall in fulfillment of their constitutional duties to  peacefully transfer Presidential power after the November 2020  elections.

Mr. Speaker, January 6, 2021, will be forever remembered for the  vicious unprecedented insurrection that took place on that date.

On December 31, 2025, the House Judiciary Committee released the  transcript of its December 17 private 8-hour interview with Special  Counsel Jack Smith, whose investigation into the events of that day led  him to describe January 6 as an event that ``does not happen'' without  President Trump.

Smith testified that Donald Trump is the `` `most culpable and most  responsible person' in the criminal conspiracy to overturn the results  of the 2020 election.'' He continued: ``These crimes were committed for  his benefit. . . . The other co-conspirators were doing this for his  benefit.'' Smith concluded that Trump caused the violence, exploited  it, and refused to stop it.

Mr. Speaker, I was in this Hall on January 6, 2021, and was among  those whisked away to an undisclosed location. My staff huddled behind  barricaded doors that were badly damaged by the mob that was described  by some of my Republican colleagues as ``patriots'' on a tour of the  Capitol.

Our valiant United States Capitol Police and first responders did  everything they could to keep us out of harm's way. Some were beaten,  strangled, and tased. This building, the people's House, was trashed,  damaged, and subjected to despicable acts.

Members of Congress and their staffs feared for their lives. Some of  the insurrectionists waived Confederate battle flags and exhibited Nazi  symbols, and some brave American citizens died. A Republican Senator,  Ron Johnson, said that by and large it was a peaceful protest.

Now, Mr. Speaker, this was not a peaceful protest. It was  unadulterated violence.

The President of the United States and all Members of Congress take  an oath to defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and  domestic. That oath is a recognition of the fact that there will be  times throughout history when we must deal with the enemy from within.

On the second day of his Presidency, President Trump granted blanket  pardons and commutations to nearly 1,600 of the rioters who stormed  this Capitol on January 6, 2021. The President decided that these  perpetrators should be pardoned and not pay for their crimes.

By pardoning these individuals, this President has made a mockery of  the pardon process and smeared the oath he took to uphold the  Constitution. These actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for our  democratic principles and the sanctity of the vote.

The great John Lewis once shared his great fear that ``one day we may  wake up and our democracy is gone.'' John and I often spoke of the  delicacy of our democracy and that its future was far from guaranteed.

On January 6, 2021, we came face-to-face with the reality of this  fragility, but our democracy also prevailed. We were not deterred from  doing our constitutional duty and certifying the legitimate results of  the 2020 Presidential election.

Even during this unrelenting campaign to weaken our laws and impede  justice, Members of this body have stood up for our Constitution. The  exceptional work of the bipartisan January 6th Committee, ably chaired  by Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, illuminated for the  American people the severity of the conspiracies behind the January 6  attack. Congress has also passed critical reforms to safeguard the  legal process for future Presidential elections to help ensure this  never happens again.

Earlier today, the leader of our caucus, Hakeem Jeffries, held a  special hearing to shed further light on the ongoing threats to free  and fair elections and the threats to public safety posed by some of  the violent criminals President Trump has let out of prison.

The threat to our democracy that we witnessed 5 years ago has not  lessened, and our obligations to be vigilant in its defense and  steadfast in our pursuit of a more perfect Union is as important as  ever.

The Constitution that binds this country together is a sacred  document that has guided our pursuit of perfection for nearly 250  years. We came close to derailing that pursuit on January 6, 2021.

If we refuse to acknowledge the facts and give due deference to the  violence that took place 5 years ago, we run the risk of abdicating our  responsibility to the American people to safeguard our Nation's core  principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

The insurrection of January 6 could very well be the worst domestic  attack on our government since the Civil War, which ended in 1865.

That insurrection incented much of my recently released third book  titled: ``The First Eight,'' which chronicles the trials and  tribulations of the eight African Americans who served in Congress from  my home State of South Carolina before me.

The book also highlights the social and political events that  occurred in the aftermath of the Civil War and calls attention to the  violence and lawlessness that occurred during their service and took  our great Nation into a dark place that lasted for nearly a century.

There are 95 years between number eight in their group and yours  truly, number nine. The book is a cautionary tale that reminds us of  the warning of the Spanish philosopher George Santayana that ``Those  who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.''

I fear that the danger John Lewis fretted about is facing us today.  The aftermath of January 6, 2021, continues to test our ability to  protect our freedom and willingness to continue our trek toward a more  perfect Union.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for his  comments and for his friendship for these 36-plus years, 30 years as my  colleague.

Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Clarke), chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, good evening. I am Congresswoman  Yvette D. Clarke, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus for the 119th  session of Congress, and proud Representative of New York's Ninth  Congressional District, located in central and southwest Brooklyn.

I thank my colleagues, Congressman   James Clyburn of South Carolina  and Congressman Steny Hoyer of Maryland, for co-anchoring this  Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour.

I rise tonight with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus  and the House Democratic Caucus to reflect on the solemn anniversary of  the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol.

The deadly insurrection of January 6, 2021, was not merely an attack  on a building, but a direct and violent assault on Members of Congress,  law enforcement, staff, and the very foundations of our democracy.

Today, this evening, we honor the extraordinary bravery of the United  States Capitol Police and other law enforcement officers who protected  our democracy and ensured that the attempt to overturn the 2020  election results failed.

Five years later, it is not lost on members of our Caucus that  efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, through false  claims of illegitimate voting, occurred during a year when we saw  historic participation of Black voters. That participation resulted in  Democratic victories up and down the ballot, as well as the election of  the first Black woman Vice President.

Today, we cannot ignore the reality that efforts to disenfranchise  Black communities are still ongoing. Soon, in the Louisiana v. Callais  case, the Supreme Court will decide whether section 2 of the Voting  Rights Act, which outlaws racial discrimination in our electoral  system, still allows Black and minority voters to challenge racially  discriminatory voting maps in court, making clear that the fight to  protect our democracy is far from over.

We will never forget the horrors of January 6, nor will we turn a  blind eye to the efforts that continue to threaten the promise of equal  participation in our democracy and undermine the very foundations on  which this Nation and its governance has been built.

The January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and the occupants of  the Capitol complex is a day that will live in infamy.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. I  now yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Mfume).

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.

I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).

Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I first thank both of our Members  of Congress who are co-leading this very important Special Order hour.

Five years ago, a violent mob attacked the United States Capitol to  prevent the peaceful transfer of power. Yet, on the first day of Donald  Trump's second term, he pardoned more than 1,500 criminals involved in  that insurrection carried out in his name.

This is just one action amid a comprehensive campaign to erase the  memory of what happened on that day. It is a slap in the face to law  enforcement who selflessly put their lives at risk to defend all of us.

Some of them lost their lives, like Officer Brian Sicknick, a New  Jersey native, who tragically died following injuries he sustained that  day. Many more are still dealing with trauma. In Brian's honor, I  introduced a resolution condemning those blanket pardons.

We must never forget their sacrifice. We cannot let Donald Trump and  his allies rewrite the history of one of the darkest moments in the  250-year history of this Nation.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.

Now I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. I  will now yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Foushee).

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. I  now yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Ivey).

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.

Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, first, I will recognize the CBC  and Chairwoman Clarke and Representatives Clyburn and Hoyer for hosting  this Special Order hour.

Mr. Speaker, five years ago, our Nation watched in horror as the  President of the United States incited a violent attack on this Capitol  to overturn an election that he lost.

At least 140 officers were viciously assaulted and injured, beaten  with flagpoles and fire extinguishers, sprayed with chemicals and  tased, all in defense of our democracy.

In the days and weeks following the attack, we lost five of those  police officers, those brave heroes. We mourn their loss.

The Department of Justice convicted more than 1,000 rioters and had  hundreds of cases pending. With a stroke of a pen on his first day in  office, President Trump pardoned every single one, putting violent  offenders back on our streets.

Since their release, what have some of those pardoned rioters done?  They have been charged with assaulting police officers, making  terrorist threats, and preying on children. That is who this President  set free: violent individuals and child predators.

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle ought to recognize the  darkness this day represents for our country. The Republican majority  must restore checks and balances and finally hold this President  accountable before it is too late.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.

Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his co-anchorship  of these few minutes that we have spent together here on the floor.

Mr. Speaker, you have heard from many of our distinguished colleagues  about the events of January 6, the insurrection that has been misnamed  by many of my colleagues. These issues are of great importance to the  members of the Congressional Black Caucus. In fact, they are of great  importance to our constituents and to all Americans.

When I think about this day, as many of us will be traveling all over  the country--in fact, I am going to be in the hometown of  Representative Kennedy to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day I think  on the 18 of this month--I am thinking tonight about King's letter from  the Birmingham City Jail, which many of us remember was written in  response to a letter that he had received from eight White clergymen  who said to King that they wanted him to leave Birmingham.

They told King that they thought he was a disruptive force, and they  thought that if he were to leave the community, things would be better.  They told King in their letter to him that they did not want him to get  them wrong because they believed in his cause, but they just thought  that his timing was wrong.

Mr. Speaker, King, in his answer to them, said that time itself is  neutral. The time is never right. Time is never wrong. Time is always  what we make it.

He had a concluding thought there that I have been thinking about all  day. King said that he was coming to the conclusion that the people of  ill will in our society are making a much better use of time than the  people of good will.

Mr. Speaker, I want us to think about that. Those people who came to  this building on January 6, 2021, did not have good will in their  hearts nor on their minds. They were people of ill will, and they made  pretty good use of their time. I will close with this.

King said: ``We are going to be made to repent in this generation not  just for the vitriolic words and deeds of bad people but for the  appalling silence of good people.''

Mr. Speaker, I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle who  have  been silent all day that they may live to regret that silence.",2026-01-06,2026-W02

Democrat,Ro Khanna,We Don't Need Another Regime-Change War,"Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm on the  military buildup in the Caribbean, edging us closer to a regime-change  war in Venezuela.

The Trump administration has sent the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft  carrier, our largest aircraft carrier. Mr. Speaker, 10 percent of our  Navy is in the Caribbean, including destroyers and submarines.

We have got 15,000 troops in Florida and Puerto Rico, including  marines who are ready for amphibious landings, and we have F-35s and B- 52s flying across the Caribbean and Venezuelan airspace.

After Iraq, after Libya, after 20 years in Afghanistan, after Yemen,  we do not need another regime-change war. It is time for the American  people to oppose a regime-change war in Venezuela.",2025-12-12,2025-W50
Democrat,Delia Ramirez,Horrific Ice Abuses,"Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, it has been 365 days of Trump 2.0, 365 days of terror,  abuse, and violations of our rights.

After infusing $150 billion into DHS and ICE, people in this Chamber  have chosen to give them even more money, even after seeing what DHS  does with its unlimited resources, even after seeing what they do with  unchecked power.

Let me say what they did to Silverio, what they did to Marimar, to  Keith, to Renee, to Alex, what they did to Illinois resident Nenko  Gantchev in an ICE detention center. Also, Mr. Speaker, what they are  doing right now to my own constituent, Steven, a 14-year-old boy with  autism in a detention center plagued with measles, it is  unconscionable. It is unacceptable.

Many of us are clear: The Department of Homeland Security is the  greatest threat to the homeland right now, and that is why we must claw  back funding for DHS and ICE. It is why we must pass my Melt ICE Act  and end DHS detention and monitoring, disrupt immigration enforcement,  and return taxpayer dollars back to the communities.

We also must immediately start the proceedings to impeach Noem. I  said it before, and I will say it again. She will either quit, she will  get fired, or we will impeach her.

Here is the thing: Our tax dollars should be used to make sure  working people have every single thing they need to thrive, not money  used to execute U.S. citizens.

Let me end by saying this: We brought the Department of Homeland  Security into this world just two decades ago. We also have the ability  and the authority to build a world without it, and I will work every  day to make that happen.",2026-02-04,2026-W06
Democrat,Tim Kaine,National Salvation Army Week,"Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize May 12 to May 18,  2025, as National Salvation Army Week.

Founded in 1865, the Salvation Army has been unfailingly committed to  serving those in need without discrimination. For more than 150 years,  the Salvation Army has provided essential social services, including  disaster relief, food assistance, shelter, rehabilitation programs, and  youth development initiatives in local communities across the United  States.

The Salvation Army serves more than 27 million Americans annually,  offering compassion, hope, and support to the most vulnerable  populations, including individuals experiencing homelessness, veterans,  seniors, human trafficking survivors, and those recovering from  addiction. Across the Nation, the Salvation Army operates shelters,  food pantries, job training programs, and emergency disaster relief  efforts that strengthen communities and improve lives.

The Salvation Army continues to be a trusted partner at the local,  State, and Federal levels, providing critical services that address  poverty, hunger, and natural disasters. Volunteers, donors, and  officers of the Salvation Army exemplify the spirit of service, working  tirelessly to provide relief and opportunity for those in need--and  should be recognized and commended for their commitment to the  betterment of others. I am grateful for the work that the Salvation  Army accomplishes every day and applaud its dedication to social  service.",2025-05-12,2025-W20
Republican,Aaron Bean,-9999,"Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate a milestone  that truly brings a smile. This week, Dr. William Stewart Mitchell III  of Fleming Island, Florida, marks his 100th birthday, a century defined  by faith, family, and devoted service to our Nation.

Dr. Mitchell graduated valedictorian of Hamilton County High School  before entering the Navy in 1943. Recognizing his talent, the Navy  placed him in the B-12 program at Emory University, where he again  graduated valedictorian from dental school. He went on to serve with  the 1st Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, providing essential care as a  naval officer in the Dental Corps. His distinguished career spanned sea  service, Active Duty, Reserve Duty, and retiring as a lieutenant  commander.

Mr. Speaker, Dr. Mitchell has built a legacy of excellence and  dedication to others. Today, I honor him as he celebrates 100 years on  this planet, and I recognize a life that has given this Nation  countless reasons to smile. It is a privilege to share his story with  this Chamber.

Mr. Speaker, I wish Dr. Mitchell a happy birthday.",2025-12-12,2025-W50
Democrat,Richard Blumenthal,Terminating the National Emergency Declared to Impose Global Tariffs,"Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, of all the thrills of living in a  democracy, none is more meaningful than walking into a voting booth and  casting a ballot. I can remember the first time I did it when I came of  age.

I can remember, always--and I see it again and again and again--new  citizens walking out of the courtroom after the naturalization  ceremony, with their certificates of citizenship in their hands and  handing it to the League of Women Voters person who is doing voter  registrations. It is the thrill of their lifetime to be registered.

Of all the rights we have, voting is perhaps the most meaningful and  the most practiced. It is foundational to all the others. It is the way  we preserve the others. And that is why the fight for voting rights-- and blood has been spilled in the effort to secure it--is a storied  bedrock of our American history.

And, now, again--as there has been throughout our history--there are  efforts to suppress that right for political reasons, for political  gain. That is what we have in the SAVE Act, an effort to erect  obstacles and to require documentation that, very simply, Americans-- many of them--don't have.

This measure is a solution--supposed solution--in search of a  problem. There is no widespread voter fraud. Undocumented people,  noncitizens, almost never try to vote. And I am using the word  ``almost'' because I am tempted to say ``never.'' But, of course, you  can't rule out a negative. You can't prove it.

But the fact of the matter is, widespread voter fraud, even  significant voter fraud by noncitizens, is an imaginary, delusional  issue. Some 21 million U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote don't  have the requisite documentation that would be required under the SAVE  Act. To solve the delusional nonproblem, the SAVE Act would deprive  real citizens of the real right to vote--21 million of them. Married  women, younger voters, voters of color--they are the ones who are going  to be impacted. I don't know how they would vote in Connecticut or  elsewhere, but they have a right to vote, and we should not be fooled  by this wolf in sheep's clothing, a measure that masquerades as  preserving democracy.

We should not let our voter rolls be purged by a measure that has  false pretenses. We must protect the right of every eligible citizen to  vote. The best way to do it is to say no to this bill, and I ask my  Republican colleagues to join me in saying no because this issue is  larger than any one of us.

I hear again and again and again from my constituents in Connecticut  about their concern that the right to vote may be restricted. I say to  the people of Connecticut right here and now: I will fight this bill  because it is wrong, because it eviscerates voting rights, and because  it threatens our democracy.",2025-04-30,2025-W18
Democrat,Veronica Escobar,Recognizing the 30th Anniversary of the Paso Del Norte Health Foundation,"Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 30th  anniversary of the Paso Del Norte Health Foundation in El Paso, Texas.

Established in 1995, the Paso Del Norte Health Foundation has worked  to ensure our binational tri-state community has the knowledge,  resources, and support needed to lead healthy and productive lives.

For three decades, the foundation has partnered with countless local  and national organizations to address some of the most critical  challenges in the borderland--from chronic disease prevention,  expanding mental health support, and helping develop the next  generation of healthcare leaders.

The PDNHF has supported local governments, non-profits and  educational institutions to promote health and the well-being of our  community. Over its 30-year history, the PDNHF has helped reduce  smoking, promoted diabetes awareness and increased physical activity  and healthy eating, created a medical forgivable loan fund, programing  to support oral health, support for the community through the COVID-19  pandemic, and support in growing El Paso's quality of life assets.

The community is grateful for PDNHF's investment in our region and  congratulates the board and staff committed to this mission. I ask all  my colleagues to join me in celebrating the incredible legacy of the  Paso Del Norte Health Foundation.",,
Democrat,Jim Costa,Putting Americans First,"Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to say thank you to Steny  Hoyer for an incredible career and for being a role model and my  friend. He is always a class act.

I also rise today to speak for the families who are forced to choose  between groceries, rent, and healthcare because prices keep climbing.  Affordability is equal to economic stability. Let me repeat that:  Affordability is equal to economic stability. Americans are struggling  to pay for groceries, rent, gas, and healthcare. They are drowning  under rising costs while promises to lower the cost of living have  remained unfulfilled by this administration.

On day one, President Trump said he would put America first and lower  costs. Instead, he pardoned violent insurrectionists, a mob that  attacked this Capitol to overthrow a fair and free election. It was an  attack that resulted in the deaths of five law enforcement officers.

We were promised America First, but what we are seeing is that a  majority of Americans, who have been polled on whether we are headed on  the right track or the wrong track, believe that we are on the wrong  track.

This administration has prioritized costly foreign entanglements  without transparency or congressional approval while working families  pay the price at home.

Instead of protecting the economic well-being of Americans, we are  seeing the following: Tariff policies are increasing the costs of  essential goods. My farmers are struggling, as well as American  consumers. Healthcare costs are skyrocketing for millions. Critical  programs that help families stay afloat are under attack. The cuts in  Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, as well as SNAP and other  programs, are taking their toll.

Take healthcare as an example. The enhanced premium tax cuts that  help millions afford coverage are now expired. In California, new  enrollments are down 31 percent last year, and nearly 190,000 families  have canceled coverage because it is no longer affordable. Middle-class  Americans who are earning more than $62,000 are no longer eligible for  the Federal premium tax credits, doubling cancellations from 8 percent  to 16 percent.

Californians are switching to bronze plans to save on premiums, but  these plans carry higher deductibles. For pregnancy care or cancer care  treatment, costs can more than double compared to silver plans.

In my district, over 65,000 families risk losing Medicaid, and  another 22,000 families will face higher premiums and out-of-pocket  costs. Nationwide, nearly 100,000 American families could lose their  coverage each year if Congress fails to act.

Last year, Republicans passed a partisan bill that failed to renew  the essential premium tax credits, forcing millions of Americans to pay  higher costs this year, even though a bipartisan solution is at hand.  Families, therefore, unfortunately, are left waiting.

Americans are also struggling with the rising costs of energy,  transportation, and other critical services. What we need are  bipartisan solutions that create jobs, lower costs, and increase  enhanced premium tax credits so millions of American families can  afford their healthcare.

What we need is bipartisan legislation such as my bipartisan Rural  Homeownership Continuity Act that will reduce financing costs and  bipartisan legislation on permitting reform to get infrastructure like  energy, transportation, and housing projects more quickly approved for  working families.

Mr. Speaker, we need bipartisan solutions, and they are clear.  Congress must act now to ease costs, expand access to healthcare, and  invest in the future of our communities throughout the country.

The cost of living is not a partisan issue. It is not. It is a matter  of fairness, security, and justice. From groceries to gas and from rent  to healthcare, Americans cannot afford to wait any longer.

Mr. Speaker, it is time that we get together. It is time for Congress  to act in a bipartisan effort to renew the sense of Congress as the  people's House that we can work together. It is time, Mr. Speaker, for  Congress to act. America's people, American citizens, and our  constituents must come first.",2026-01-08,2026-W02
Republican,Kevin Kiley,Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act,"Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor of  the SAVE Act to advance the radical proposition that only American  citizens should vote in American elections.

Of course, this isn't radical at all. It is common sense. I think the  vast majority of Americans would be shocked to learn that it elicits  any opposition at all.

In many States in this country, foremost my own State of California,  the administration of our elections is completely out of touch with the  rest of the developed world, falling well short of the standards that  ought to exist in a modern democratic society.

This measure requiring proof of citizenship in order to vote is a  needed corrective. I believe, in my State, it will complement other  initiatives that we are advancing now to require voter ID and to have a  timely vote-counting process in order to restore public confidence in  our election process.

What is at stake is not only election integrity and election security  but democratic legitimacy, ensuring that our people have the ability to  express themselves fully in our own identity as a State in the country  through the democratic process.

I urge passage of this on a bipartisan basis.",2025-04-10,2025-W15
Democrat,Chrissy Houlahan,Removal of the Use of United States Forces for Hostilities Within or Against Venezuela,"Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, it is really devastating to listen to the other side  talking about how we somehow were not supposed to be told when boots  went on the ground before. Somehow, we were lucky enough, by God's  grace, that  nothing bad happened to the men and women in the service of our Nation.  Yet they actually were injured, seven of them.

The U.S. military is being used against Venezuela without  congressional authorization, without transparency, and in ways that  appear only designed to benefit the very powerful amongst us--the oil  companies--and not the Venezuelan people, and certainly not our  American people to whom we are obligated to represent. It is as simple  as that.

The American people don't want their sons or their daughters sent  into harm's way for their missions to Venezuela or to Greenland or to  anywhere else that are undertaken just to enrich corporations and the  most wealthy amongst us and cronies of the President's, and to do  nothing in the process to lower the cost of living, to help families  afford housing or healthcare, or to secure a future for our children.

Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I am struck by the fact that we are at a  place where we have maligned others in the past for brutish  isolationism and for colonial instincts that we have long condemned in  our own adversaries.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of this aisle to vote  ``yes,'' to do our jobs so that we may reaffirm our authority and rein  in reckless action.",2026-01-22,2026-W04
Democrat,Mark Takano,Dismantling the Department of Education,"Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and Representative,  the gentlewoman from Connecticut, Representative Hayes, for yielding  time. I also thank her for putting together this Special Order hour.

The two of us came to Congress from the classroom. We came from the  classroom to the Halls of Congress. The two of us were also locked out  of the Department of Education earlier this year when we were demanding  answers on when President Trump would illegally try to close the  Department.

Since then, we have seen Secretary McMahon fire staff from the  building who investigate and protect the civil rights of students. We  have seen her slash funding for minority-serving institutions. We have  seen her move parts of our education infrastructure to unrelated  agencies, creating more hoops for administrators and staff to jump  through to get the funding they need.

Last week, the Department of Education announced they are moving to  end the SAVE program which some 7 million student loan borrowers rely  on to have affordable repayment plans on their student loans.

Grocery prices are up. Utilities are up. Healthcare is about to jump  for millions of people, and now some student loan borrowers will have  to find money to pay their student loans. The math simply won't work  for millions of Americans and for these students who need to pay off  their loans.

Secretary McMahon has usurped Congress' role by firing staff, holding  up grants that Congress has approved, and running a multimillion-dollar  experiment by shuttering the Department and making six different  Federal agencies do the work of one.

Democrats have worked to conduct oversight for our Nation's students,  but Republicans couldn't care less if title I schools get the funding  they need; if students have their civil rights violated; or if the  promise of a free, quality education is for all students.

Their agenda is one that seeks to privatize and voucherize the public  school system and to make getting degrees and credentials as hard as  possible for those who are not well-off or well-connected.

Students, no matter how complex their needs, how much money they come  from, how much wealth they come from, or the ZIP Code they grew up in,  are entitled to a free, quality education.

Mr. Speaker, if we want to save public education, a free and quality  education for all children, we can't have half of this body ready to  give up their power and conduct no oversight while permanent changes  are being made at the Department of Education.

Secretary McMahon has only appeared before the Education and the  Workforce Committee once this year and has since taken the most extreme  actions and attacks on public education this country has ever seen.

Republicans must join me and my colleagues in conducting oversight  for the students in this country. We are living in a time when more and  more Americans don't feel like the American Dream is in reach. I am  pleading--pleading--with Republicans to join me--to join us--in giving  hope to Americans that the promise of a quality education is still  alive for every child.

We cannot delay or wait until harm is brought to any school district  or teacher or student. This must end. The mission of the Department  must continue. As far as I am concerned and as far as the Democratic  Caucus is concerned, the mission of this Department will continue.",2025-12-15,2025-W51
Democrat,Joshua Gottheimer,Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025,"Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Craig for her  excellent leadership.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan CLARITY Act. This  bill was made possible through a bipartisan effort that I was very  proud to help lead with Chairman Hill and Congressman Steil. It is an  important one because one-fifth of Americans own crypto. My State, New  Jersey, proportionally ranks second nationwide in ownership of  cryptocurrency.

While cryptocurrency has tremendous economic potential, we  desperately need rules of the road to protect consumers, ensure the  success of American entrepreneurs, and ensure that America leads the  way, not other nations around the world, but that America leads the way  in this growing space.

The CLARITY Act takes commonsense steps to make crypto work for  everyday users, including measures to stop snake oil salesmen,  fraudsters, and hucksters, and puts the Trump family's coins under  regulation.

This legislation supports American-led innovation by encouraging  developers and entrepreneurs to build, invest, and create jobs in our  country.

Finally, this bill gives clarity to the SEC's and CFTC's roles in  crypto to work together efficiently and to crack down on scammers and  criminal activity. After years of uncertainty, it finally says who  should oversee what, so that people in this space understand the  direction it is going in and understand who is going to oversee what,  so that consumers can be protected. I can't say that enough.

Do we want this to continue to be the Wild West with uncertainty, or  do we want to have clear rules of the road to protect consumers? Do we  want to do something or nothing? Is it perfect? As you have heard  today, no, it is not perfect. Few pieces of legislation we bring here  are.

The questions are: Will it do good? Will it make sure that we look  after people who are involved in this space? Will it ensure that  America succeeds and grows? Those are the questions.

To do nothing means that we will ensure that Trump's coin has no  oversight. Why would we want that? We will ensure that no consumer is  protected if we do nothing. We want to protect American consumers. That  is our job. This legislation does that.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical  commonsense, bipartisan legislation.",2025-07-17,2025-W29

Democrat,Rick Larsen,Recognizing Lisa Janicki,"Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  celebrate Lisa Janicki's service as a County Commissioner for Skagit  County, Washington.

Commissioner Janicki was first elected to the Skagit County Board of  County Commissioners in November 2014, following a career of more than  thirty years as the Chief Financial Officer for Janicki family  businesses.

During her eleven years in office, Commissioner Janicki has been a  tireless leader in fighting the opioid epidemic across our communities  and Washington state, advocating for policy solutions, programs and  investments to end this scourge and repair the incredible damage it has  caused. She has worked collaboratively with the county's partner  jurisdictions to increase services available for community members in  need of urgent crisis support. She was a founding member of North Star,  a partnership between the county commissioners and government, the  mayors of the four largest cities in Skagit County, and service  organizations to end homelessness and enhance effective delivery of  crisis response,  recovery and support services countywide. Commissioner Janicki also  oversaw the development of the STAR Center providing acute behavioral  health care services to Skagit County, in addition to the county's  first permanent supportive housing development, Martha's Place, and the  Skagit First Steps Shelter.

Commissioner Janicki's heartfelt leadership, strategic foresight, and  compassion are an inspiration to leaders and community members in  Skagit County and across northwest Washington. She has been a  transformational advocate for the people of Skagit County.

Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to commend Commissioner Janicki for her  outstanding leadership and vision, dedication to serving her community,  and the enduring legacy she has helped to cultivate. I ask my  colleagues to join me in expressing our deepest gratitude for her  service.",2026-01-07,2026-W02

Democrat,Adriano Espaillat,Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025,"Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Chair, very often, we take very serious votes on  this floor, but this vote is a deadly serious vote. This is a vote  about life and death.

I represent just slightly over 780,000 constituents. Out of those  780,000 constituents, 524,000 of them are Medicaid recipients, and over  100,000 of them are Medicare recipients, so over 600,000 of the 780,000  constituents who I represent receive either Medicaid or Medicare. In  addition to that, there are 263,000 households that receive food  stamps.

This bill would put their lives and health in danger, Madam Chair.  This is about life and death.

As the Republican majority proposes to cut Medicaid across this  country to give a massive $4.5 trillion, with a capital T, trillion- dollar cut in taxes to the very rich, who would that go to? Fifty  percent of that will go to the shareholders. Forty-four percent of that  tax cut will go to high-end executives.

The fat cat executives are going to get this money, and working-class  and even middle-class people are going to get stiffed with the cuts.

This is about life and death. It is not a simple piece of legislation  that we will pass. There are diabetics who will see the price of  insulin go up. There are people with renal problems and cardiovascular  problems.

Madam Chair, this is about life and death. Vote ``no'' on this bill.",2025-02-25,2025-W09
Republican,Byron Donalds,Safe and Smart Federal Purchasing Act,"Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss without thanking Chairman  Comer for the time on the floor today, and I might have to ask the  chairman to introduce me everywhere going forward. I greatly appreciate  that.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, the Safe and Smart  Federal Purchasing Act.

For background, lowest price technically acceptable is the source  selection method outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or  FAR.

Simply put, the LPTA FAR standard prioritizes price above everything  else.

Focusing on price, instead of other technical or operational factors  in Federal procurement, can result in agencies cutting corners, long- term value being sacrificed, or in its worse aspects, even potential  risks to America's national security.

In my view, the use of the LPTA may not always be appropriate when  Federal agencies purchase innovative technologies and technical  services, and agencies should have the flexibility to pay more for a  superior solution if the circumstances are appropriate.

I will say to the American people that, obviously with all of the  things that we are talking about in Washington around the Department of  Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE, going through and trying  to cut costs, we do have to be mindful that we are getting the best  products for the Federal Government to use because that actually does  yield great results for the American people.

Moreover, we, as Congress, have an obligation to fully understand the  impacts of utilizing the LPTA.

One example of when the LPTA may not be appropriate relates to the  procurement of Chinese drones.

Chinese drone maker, DJI, is the world's largest manufacturer of  personal and professional drones, and Federal agencies to this day  utilize DJI drones, which present a large national security risk.

Why would Federal agencies procure Chinese drones when there are  higher-quality American drones currently available on the market?

That is when the lowest price technically acceptable FAR standard may  come into play.

To provide some additional context, Chinese state-backed DJI  aggressively dropped its prices in 2015 and now DJI drones account for  more than 75 percent of the global drone marketplace, offering its  products in over 100 countries. While a wide range of innovative  American drone products are available, in many cases, the LPTA slides  the Federal procurement preference scale away from American drones in  favor of these Chinese drones merely because they are cheaper.

To emphasize, all companies in China are required by Chinese law to  give the Communist Chinese Party access to all their information upon  request.

In fact, in August 2017, Homeland Security Investigations issued an  intelligence bulletin warning that DJI was providing critical  infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese Government.

Today, the lowest price technically acceptable does not account for  national security implications, so my bill would simply require an  evaluation of potential national security concerns associated with the  LPTA FAR standard.

Instead of just looking at the initial price tag and procuring the  cheapest product and service, it is vitally important that the United  States Government understand the national security implications  associated with its own Federal procurement policies.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Connolly, for co-leading  this bipartisan initiative with me, and I urge my colleagues to support  this commonsense piece of legislation.",2025-03-03,2025-W10
Democrat,Jack Reed,Nomination of Linda McMahon,"Mr. REED. Mr. President, as we celebrate Public Schools Week, Senate  Republicans are preparing to confirm Linda McMahon, another of  President Trump's billionaire patrons, as Secretary of Education, and I  oppose such nomination.

During her confirmation hearing, Mrs. McMahon demonstrated little  knowledge of public education or the basic programs and functions of  the Department of Education. Clearly, the choice of this nominee is not  based on merit.

But that does not matter because Mrs. McMahon was selected to be a  front, as the Agency she hopes to lead is being dismantled by Elon Musk  and DOGE. Indeed, while Mrs. McMahon was at her confirmation hearing,  claiming that she would work to improve the Department of Education,  Elon Musk's DOGE minions were at work firing people, taking back  grants, compromising sensitive data, and laying the groundwork to  eliminate the entire Agency.

And on Valentine's Day, President Trump's Department of Education  threatened to cut Federal funding from public schools, as well as  colleges and universities, if they did not eliminate any program that  the Trump administration deems as promoting diversity, equity, and  inclusion.

During her confirmation hearing, Mrs. McMahon seemed unsure whether  this edict meant that schools can't celebrate or teach classes on  African-American history or host clubs like Special Olympics or Girls  Who Code.

As a reminder, by law, the Secretary of Education may not interfere  with the content that schools teach, nor the academic standards that  they set. Mrs. McMahon doesn't seem to know that.

By the way, while Mr. Musk has been tearing the Department of  Education apart from the inside, Republicans in Congress have passed  punitive blueprints that will cut trillions from government services to  the American people, including education, all to pay for tax cuts for  the richest Americans and Big Business.

In the Senate, the Republicans are calling for an unspecified $9  trillion in cuts. In the House, the Education and Workforce Committee  must provide a minimum of $330 billion in cuts from education and job  training programs. It is no wonder that educators, students, and  families from across the country feel under siege.

We know what this looks like because we see how teachers, students,  and military families are reacting with dismay as our world-class  Department of Defense schools are laboring under another Secretary  intent on politicizing its Department and promoting an indoctrination  agenda authorized by President Trump.

I would like to take a moment to first thank all educators, school  staff, family volunteers, and all community members who tirelessly work  to equip our students for the future. We owe you a debt of gratitude  and so much more than that. We need to recommit to strengthening our  public schools and to investing in them.

In the first part of the 20th century, it was the high school  movement that broadly expanded educational attainment, preparing young  Americans for success in a changing world and evolving economy. This  movement featured professional educators and engaged families and  communities. It was about general knowledge and practical application.

This movement launched the United States as a world economic power.  It was essential to our national defense, and it created the conditions  for the success of the largest expansion of postsecondary education  through the GI bill. The high school movement meant that soldiers  returning from World War II already had high school diplomas and were  ready for postsecondary education.

Head Start, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Adult  Education and Family Literacy Act, the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act, and the Higher Education Act are some of our Federal  laws that work to ensure that opportunities to learn and advance are  not limited by income, race, ethnicity, or disability.

The expansion of public education is a great American story. Yet,  today, it sometimes seems to have been forgotten. Some argue that we do  not need public schools, that we can offer vouchers or education  savings accounts or homeschooling instead. Today, instead of freedom of  inquiry and inclusion, we see policing of what schools can teach, what  students can read, what they can discuss, and how they should think.  This is a recipe for stifling creativity and the development of the  skills needed for an ever-changing knowledge economy.

We politicize and neglect public schools at our peril. They educate  nearly 50 million students--our future. It is time that we treat public  education as the priority it must be if we want a brighter future for  our children and our grandchildren and our country.

We should embark on a new public school movement--one that will  strengthen and support the education profession, one that will ensure  that all communities can provide modern, state-of-the-art facilities,  one that will ensure that all students have the right to read--with  evidence-based reading instruction, school libraries, books at home,  diverse materials, and the freedom to choose what to read.

Today, we are failing our public schools because we are not investing  in them. For example, the average age of our public school facilities  is 49 years. The GAO found that over half of our school districts in  our country needed to replace or update major systems in more than half  of their buildings.

As a nation, we should commit to modernizing our school facilities.  That is why I will be reintroducing the Rebuild America's Schools Act  to invest $130 billion in our school facilities in the communities with  the greatest need.

We know there is a crisis in the education profession. Too many  school districts struggle to hire and retain teachers. Too often, a  career in teaching means financial struggles and little support to meet  student needs.

Additionally, we need a national focus on literacy. In 2024, the  percentage of eighth graders reading below the basic level on the  National Assessment of Educational Progress was the largest in the  assessment's history, and the percentage of fourth graders who scored  below the basic level was the largest in 20 years.

Adults are not doing any better. Recent results of the Program for  the International Assessment of Adult Competencies show that overall  scores in literacy and numeracy have decreased for U.S. adults, with  adults scoring at the lowest level of proficiency in literacy,  increasing from 19 percent in 2017 to 28 percent in 2023.

This is a crisis. Eliminating the Department of Education does  nothing to solve it. Instead of gutting educational funding and  eliminating the Department of Education to pay for tax cuts for the  wealthy, Congress should address the acute literacy crisis for both  adults and children across the Nation.

We should be increasing funding for adult education--at least  doubling it. We should increase resources for schools to provide  evidence-based reading instruction by fully funding title I, increasing  funding for the Comprehensive Literacy Development State Grant Program  and for Innovative Approaches to Literacy grants.

We should double the Pell grant and restore its purchasing power so  students do not have to rely mostly on loans to pay for college.

Sadly, none of this is on Mrs. McMahon's agenda.

I urge my colleagues to join me in ushering in a new public education  movement--a movement to ensure that this generation, as well as future  ones, has the foundation to achieve their full potential and build a  prosperous future. This nominee is not the person to lead such an  effort. All indications are that she will actively work against it. So  I encourage my colleagues to vote no on her confirmation.",2025-02-27,2025-W09
Republican,Ryan Zinke,-9999,"Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in tribute of our friend and  colleague, Doug LaMalfa.

When I arrived in Congress in 2015, I noticed a large man with long  hair. He was a big man, but the biggest thing about Doug LaMalfa was  his heart.

As Secretary, I got the opportunity to tour his district that had  been devastated by wildfires. I walked with him and looked at the  devastation, the despair of people losing their lives and everything  they had, and Doug knew them by name.

He cared. He cared about every Member of this institution, but, more  importantly, he cared about the people he represented. He cared about  their life, their values, and represented them as well or better than  anyone that has ever served in this great body.

Mr. Speaker, today, we mark the passing but also the privilege of  knowing a great man. It is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that we all learn from  Doug LaMalfa and understand that we represent the people.

Democrat,Jimmy Panetta,Housing is A Human Right,"Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I recognize the 40th anniversary of the  Saka Nakodar massacre where four unarmed Sikh students, Ravinder Singh,  Jhilman Singh, Harminder Singh, and Baldhir Singh Multani, were shot  and killed while peacefully protesting the desecration of the sacred  Scripture of Sikhs.

The killing, which took place in the Punjab region of India on  February 4, 1986, was absolutely abhorrent, but the investigation was  definitely deplorable.

The victims' bodies were disposed of in secret. No perpetrator was  ever brought to justice, and reports, commissions, and other inquiries  on the massacre received absolutely no action.

The Saka Nakodar massacre continues to be a dark day for Sikhs in  Punjab but also for Sikhs right here in America.

That is why I recognize the Saka Nakodar massacre and the justice  that awaits not just for the four students and their families but for  the Sikh communities at home and abroad.",2026-02-11,2026-W07
Republican,Brett Guthrie,Electric Supply Chain Act,"Mr. GUTHRIE.  3638.

Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3638, the Electric Supply  Chain Act, sponsored by my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Latta).

This legislation directs the Department of Energy to conduct ongoing  assessments and report to Congress on the components and infrastructure  supply chain needed to secure the reliability and affordability of our  bulk power system.

It is no secret that we find ourselves in the middle of an electric  reliability crisis that is threatening the integrity of our bulk power  systems and an affordability crisis that burdens households with higher  energy bills.

Unfortunately, 4 years of the Biden-Harris administration and  excessive litigation, permitting delays, and far-left regulatory  decisions to attack baseload power sources in favor of expensive and  unreliable wind and solar have handicapped the ability of our bulk  power systems to respond to growing demands for energy.

Historic projections of increasing electricity demand from domestic  manufacturing, onshoring, and AI data centers have exposed systemic  challenges facing our electric sector and the supply chain for  components and infrastructure needed to power the system.

Meanwhile, our overreliance on China for manufacturing and critical  minerals has created a reliance on our own strategic adversary for our  supply chain needs.

Our electric grid is an essential tool for the national and economic  security of our Nation. Simply put, we need to work with the Trump  administration to make it easier to build in our country so that free- market investment for the electric supply chain flow into communities  across the country, driving economic growth and creating good-paying  jobs for households.

That is why the Electric Supply Chain Act will ensure that our  Federal Government remains in a proactive posture to assess, identify,  and address any challenges to our supply chain grid for grid  components. H.R. 3638 takes a comprehensive look at the supply chain  for our electric grid and appropriately incorporates the advice and  views of experts spanning the power sector.

Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Latta), the sponsor of this bill and the distinguished  chairman of the Energy Subcommittee.

Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Weber), the vice chairman of the Energy Subcommittee of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce.

Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.

Mr. Chair, I appreciate my friend bringing up the enhanced or COVID- era premium tax credits that are expiring at the end of this month.  Since we are talking energy tonight, we need to understand that they  were set to expire, without a single Republican vote, to expire them in  the Inflation Reduction Act, which was spent money on the Green New  Deal.

So when you put in context what President Trump said--when the  premium tax credits were set to expire, we had a hearing on that and we  were talking about it. We asked: Why in the world did the Democrats set  them to expire? They said: We thought the price of insurance was going  to go down at the end of 5 years. That is what somebody said in the  committee. The price of insurance has gone up because of the policies  they put in place. The price of energy has gone up because of policies  put in their place.

What President Trump was talking about--I don't know if it was that  exact speech that was referred to, Mr. Chair, but a speech where he had  a chart up to show where high energy prices are. They are in States  with general assemblies that have progressive ideas on energy that have  put restraints on energy that have driven up the price.

Unfortunately, we have friends across the Atlantic we can look at.  They put these kind of policies in place, and Europe has three times  the energy prices that we have. What we are saying over here is that we  need to have policies that lower the prices for everybody, not raise  the cost and just subsidize it, but to lower the cost for everybody.  That is what we are trying to do. That is what we are working to do.

What frustrates President Trump is when we are trying to fix the  problems that were created by the policies of the previous  administration. They say we are not addressing affordability when they  created the affordability crisis, when they made the premium tax  credits expire. They didn't deal with the fact that health insurance  premiums are continuing to rise. Here we are dealing with it and trying  to get it right for the American people.

When you say that wind and solar is cheaper and then complain because  you took away the tax--people aren't doing it because you take away the  tax credits and subsidies. If it is cheaper and more reliable, then you  don't have to subsidize it.

Those are the kind of frustrating things in the context of what  President Trump was trying to say. Since States have a lot of influence  in this, what we are doing here in the first bill is ensuring that  States focus on how do you make it reliable and affordable,  particularly in States like Colorado where my colleague, Mr. Evans, who  put the bill forward, is from. Their rates continue to go up because of  policies of their general assembly in their State. He just wants to  ensure that their State factors in affordability when they make those  kinds of decisions. That is what we are here to talk about.

Then, in order to build again after years of delaying building, we  have a supply chain that has to get reinvigorated. You can sit down and  talk to AI companies and people that need data and need energy.

I am one for every electron on the grid we can put on the grid,  whether it comes from a solar panel or wind or hydrocarbons, as long as  it is not subsidized. We need it all.

My friend from Ohio has a bill saying that we know that it takes too  long to get a generator, takes too long to get a transformer, takes too  long to get turbine blades, and that we have to make sure our supply  chain is in place, and  also make sure that the Department of Energy is focused on it. I know  they are. Secretary Wright is focused on it to make sure there is a  statute that we have Congress saying the supply chain is important.

Delivering energy at an affordable price is a priority. That is what  these two bills today do. That is what this bill does, and I recommend  that my colleagues vote for this bill.

Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition to  the amendment, though I am not opposed to it.

Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment from my colleague,  Representative Houlihan from Pennsylvania.

This amendment requires DOE to evaluate the potential role  transitioning military servicemembers could play in meeting the  workforce needs for the electric supply chain.

Mr. Chair, while our efforts to reshore domestic manufacturing  facilities bolster our national security, it is also important to  recognize the economic benefits of attracting new opportunities for  job-creating industries.

Growing investments in the manufacturing sector create stable and  good-paying jobs for households and drive economic growth in  communities across our country. Our men and women seeking new  employment after transitioning back to civilian life bring incredible  skill sets and expertise to the table that could benefit companies of  all kinds.

By incorporating new consideration for DOE to evaluate the potential  for transitioning servicemembers into the workforce as part of H.R.  3638, we can ensure our veterans have access to good-paying jobs.

Mr. Chair, having served in the military, I know in the military we  get specific skills. We can be diesel mechanics. We can be all these  different things we learn in the military. Sometimes they directly  translate actually, but some others don't. It creates the opportunity  to reach out and find military members who are leaving the military and  who have specific skills for these opportunities.

Mr. Chair, I support this amendment. I was meeting with some people  the other day in this kind of industry. They said if they advertise  $120,000 a year for MBAs, they get a flood of applications. If they  advertise $120,000 a year for skilled truck drivers, they barely get  enough. They don't get enough applications.

There are opportunities for people to make a good living and have a  career. It is not just a wage but a wage that produces for their  families and will let them--he or she--be extremely successful. I  support this amendment.

Mr. Chair, since we are talking military, I must say: Go Army. Beat  Navy on Saturday.

Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.

Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from California for  offering this amendment.

This amendment would incorporate advanced transmission technologies  into the supply chain considerations that the Department of Energy  would also need to assess, as part of their responsibilities in this  bill. In certain circumstances, advanced transmission technologies can  help get more resources out of our current system by expanding the  grid's electric load-carrying capacity.

However, these are not one-size-fits-all technology, and there are  important engineering complexities to consider to ensure the system  operates efficiently. We must ensure they are implemented, when it is  appropriate, and cost-effective so we can secure the grid without  burdening ratepayers with unnecessary investments.

Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.",2025-12-10,2025-W50
Republican,Chuck Grassley,Government Funding,"Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on Thursday, I sounded the alarm as the  lapse in government funding endangered food assistance for 42 million  Americans and rapidly approached. That was November 1, the approach  date. I called on Senator Schumer to end the partisanship and vote for  a clean extension of government funding.

Forty-five Democrats have opposed a clean extension of funding 13  times. Republicans have voted for it 13 times.

The Trump administration is putting a temporary bandaid on the  program, tapping into emergency funds that will cover half a month of  food stamps.

Meanwhile, I have Iowans calling my office, asking me where they can  get food for their families.

This is a sad commentary on the politics in our Nation--in a nation  of abundance.

I always say you are only nine meals away from a revolution. Just  think, if you are a family, you have children, 3 days without any food,  what action you might take if you can't properly feed them. We have  seen those sorts of revolutions in other countries.

So let's feed the American people with the bipartisan cooperation  they deserve and the bipartisan cooperation that has always been a part  of the Food Stamp Program because, over decades ago, two famous  Senators, Dole and McGovern, in a bipartisan fashion, came up with the  idea that why should we have people that are nutrition deficient in the  United States when the Federal Government has warehouses full of plenty  of food. That is the basis for the Food Stamp Program. We should  continue that bipartisan cooperation.

I hope the Democrats will wake up and give families a permanent  solution to the government programs they rely on.",2025-11-03,2025-W45
Democrat,Raja Krishnamoorthi,Recognizing National Roofing Contractors Association and National Roofing Week,"Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  National Roofing Contractors Association headquartered in Itasca,  Illinois, on the occasion of National Roofing Week between June 1-7,  2025.

National Roofing Week honors the efforts of thousands of roofing- related workers and businesses across the country, as well as the  industry's commitment to public service in general. National Roofing  Week is a valuable reminder of the significance quality roofing has on  every home and business in the U.S.

Established in 1886, NRCA is one of the Nation's oldest trade  associations and the voice of professional roofing contractors  worldwide. NRCA has nearly 4,000 roofing company members representing  the entire roofing supply chain. Using its network of roofing  contractors and industry-related members, NRCA is responsible for the  installation of new construction and replacement roof systems on  commercial and residential structures in America. Most of NRCA's  members are small, privately held businesses that provide family- sustaining jobs for thousands of hardworking individuals who are the  backbone of our economy.

Democrat,Mark DeSaulnier,Restoration of Funding for Cancer Research,"Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a survivor of stage IV  cancer to express my astonishment and to object to the Trump  administration's cuts to American cancer research.

Over the last 50 years, the 5-year cancer survival rate for people  like myself has risen from 49 percent to 68 percent. This is largely  because of American taxpayers' investment in the brilliant researchers  at the National Cancer Institute.

The administration's cuts to the National Cancer Institute's spending  by $842 million in its first 7 months alone put that trend in jeopardy.  Just as a return on investment, this is astonishingly bad. For every $1  spent by American taxpayers at NCI, they get almost $3 back. Experts  warn that we will lose a generation of scientists because of this  recklessness.

I urge the administration and my Republican colleagues to reverse  course, maintain our global leadership, and work toward a better future  for the 40 percent of Americans who will be diagnosed with cancer in  their lifetimes.",,
Democrat,George Latimer,Recognizing Local Chambers of Commerce,"Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, we often speak about how Congress can help  small businesses grow, but the true hard work is being done on Main  Streets across this Nation.

In the Sound Shore region of Westchester, businessowners are  advancing their own businesses and finding time to lead local Chambers  of Commerce, implementing programs and events that promote their  business districts. From Mistletoe Magic in Rye to the downtown farmers  market in Scarsdale, sidewalk sales in Larchmont and Mamaroneck, these  entrepreneurs are driving revenue and profits with creativity and  energy.

Let me recognize the work of these local leaders: Catherine White,  New Rochelle; Michael Murphy, Mamaroneck; Brian Jackson, Rye; Ralph  Karkout in Harrison; Cammie Morrissey and Fritz Falanka, Port Chester,  Rye Brook, Rye Town; Gina Proia and Nancy White, Larchmont; Marcy  Berman-Goldstein and Ken Giddon, Scarsdale Business Alliance; Anne Gold  and Marc Jerome, New Rochelle Business Improvement District.

Republican,Chuck Grassley,-9999,"Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my message today is to the  administration and particularly to President Trump, who is very  forcefully enforcing the immigration laws that were not enforced in the  last administration, a message about bringing justice to some people  who have been harmed by the previous administration.

On January 20, President Trump's first day in office, he signed the  Executive order that is called Securing Our Borders Executive Order.  His Executive order properly instructs the Justice Department and the  Department of Homeland Security to ``fulfill the requirements of the  DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005.'' That is music to my ears because I have  been involved in that issue in regard to the kids who have been lost in  this system of immigration that the previous administration has not  been able to follow. As I said, that is music to my ears.

For years, my oversight has sounded the alarm on the Customs and  Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security's failure to  fully implement the 2005 DNA Fingerprint Act.

I have a lot of whistleblowers come to me on different subjects.  Three whistleblowers--Mark Jones, Mike Taylor, and Fred Wynn--disclosed  to their superiors that the Department of Homeland Security wasn't  following the 2005 law. In other words, they were not taking DNA from  the people whom they were supposed to be keeping track of.  Specifically, these whistleblowers disclosed that the government wasn't  collecting the DNA from individuals encountered at the southern border  like the law requires.

As you might expect, because it happens to so many whistleblowers,  instead of being thanked for pointing out this failure, the Department  of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection officials  retaliated against these whistleblowers. That is why you hear me say so  often that whistleblowers are a very--I would like to say they love  their country. They want to see their government just simply enforce  the law. Then we find out, as I am going to show you, how they are  treated like a skunk at a picnic.

Mr. Jones and Mr. Taylor had their law enforcement credentials  removed. After 30 years of Federal service, Mr. Taylor lost his law  enforcement retirement benefits. All three were subject to harassment.

The Office of Special Counsel has the power to investigate and did  investigate and substantiated their whistleblower disclosures and that  retaliation occurred.

President Trump and this administration, moving so forcefully to see  that the laws are enforced, ought to appreciate whistleblowers who are  telling the truth about the government not carrying out the law. In  this case, I am asking President Trump to immediately remedy the  situation of these whistleblowers.

Last year, how I became acquainted with a lot of this--at least the  details of it--I hosted an oversight roundtable with these  whistleblowers. The roundtable exposed that the Department of Homeland  Security and Customs and Border Protection failed to take the DNA of  the individuals charged with the tragic murder of Rachel Morin despite  having three opportunities to  take those fingerprints. Had the Biden-Harris Department of Homeland  Security and Customs and Border Protection done their job, there is a  chance that Ms. Morin would be alive today.

This Executive action couldn't come soon enough. That is why I am  pleading with President Trump or his staff to follow up and make sure  that justice is brought to these three whistleblowers. Then the  President is going to see that the law is enforced. I don't have any  doubt about the President seeing that this law is carried out in the  future because full compliance with the law will make our border  stronger and our citizens safer.",2025-03-06,2025-W10
Democrat,Seth Magaziner,Rewriting History,"Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague,  Representative Stansbury, for bringing us together tonight to discuss  an important and alarming situation.

Every American should be outraged at the Trump administration's  attempt to erase American history and specifically to erase the history  of Black, Native American, Hispanic, and other people of color who have  helped shape this country.

The Department of the Interior under this administration recently  removed a slavery-related exhibit at Independence National Historical  Park in Philadelphia recognizing people enslaved by the Founders. They  removed a sign from Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park mentioning  Native American massacres. They have removed a sign at Bent's Old Fort  National Historic Site in Colorado describing the forced removal of a  Native Tribe and a family's slave ownership.

Why? Why are they doing this? When people try to erase history, they  are often doing it because they want to shape the future. They want to  shape a future in which America does not honor the full diversity that  has made our country the beacon of light that it is in the world. They  do not want people to know about the struggle that went into building  this more perfect Union. They want to build a future that looks more  like the past. We cannot allow that to happen.

This insidious plot to erase American history goes far beyond the  national parks and the Department of the Interior. The Trump  administration has given guidance to Federal agencies to limit the use  of or avoid using 200 words, including ``Tribal,'' ``Native American,''  ``immigrants,'' ``racial,'' ``Black,'' and ``women.''

They are not trying to erase all of our history. In fact, they have  restored a Confederate statue of General Albert Pike here in  Washington, D.C., and ordered a portrait of Robert E. Lee to be placed  in the Pentagon. These are men who committed treason against this  country in the defense of slavery.

This administration has continued to allow its own employees to post  white supremacist language on social media. A 25-year-old DOGE employee  wrote: ``You could not pay me to marry outside my ethnicity,'' and,  ``Normalize Indian hate.'' This came to light a year ago. He is still  employed by the administration.

The assistant chief counsel for ICE had a social media account:  ``America is a White nation,'' and ``'Migrants' are all criminals.'' He  is still employed.

Mr. Speaker, this is not okay. We must fight back, and I thank my  colleague for bringing attention to this matter.",2026-02-04,2026-W06
Republican,Neal Dunn,Welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew,"Mr. DUNN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome his All- Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to the United States this  week. My colleagues and I are honored to host him here in the House of  Representatives and I know my Greek-Orthodox constituents are excited  to have him visit our Nation's Capital. His All-Holiness is a champion  of religious liberty, engaging in dialogues with leaders of Judaism,  Christianity, and Islam. Moreover, he leads a congregation of 300  million church members worldwide and is the longest-serving Patriarch  in the two-millennia history of the Church. We are blessed to have him  here in Washington, D.C. this week.",,
Republican,Troy Balderson,Unlocking Our Domestic Lng Potential Act of 2025,"Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, House Republicans and President Trump  remain firm in our commitment to lowering costs for families and  restoring American energy dominance.

I am proud to represent parts of the Utica and Marcellus shale  formations, where natural gas development has transformed local  economies and strengthened our Nation's energy security. Boosting  natural gas production in Ohio and expanding LNG exports are essential  to our vision of energy dominance.

Under the last administration, President Biden repeatedly undermined  the domestic energy producers, including imposing a ban on new LNG  export permits. This misguided action discouraged investments in  American natural gas and harmed our allies abroad, who are working to  reduce their dependence on Russian energy.

The Unlocking our Domestic LNG Potential Act ends political  interference in the permit process and unleashes America's full energy  potential.

Here are the facts on LNG:

Increasing LNG exports would add over $70 billion to the U.S. economy  and create over 400,000 American jobs by 2040.

American LNG is more than 40 percent cleaner than Russian LNG.

Since we have increased our LNG exports, domestic natural gas prices  have remained affordable and stable.

Under President Trump, we are restoring American energy leadership.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman August Pfluger for leading this  important legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.''",2025-11-20,2025-W47
Republican,Nicholas Langworthy,"Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026","Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule  and ending this shutdown chaos.

For more than 40 days, the American people have endured a painful and  entirely avoidable government shutdown. It was not because of policy  differences but because Senate Democrats and Chuck Schumer chose  politics over people.

While Washington stalled, hardworking Americans paid the price. Our  air traffic controllers went without pay. A system stretched thinner by  the day had a new strain put on that system, which put millions of  lives at risk. Americans depend on them to keep our skies safe.  Families who rely on SNAP and WIC, parents who are just trying to feed  their kids, were left wondering how they would make it through another  week.

At the same time, our border agents and Coast Guard members continue  to serve this country as their own families went without pay. Through  it all, while everyday Americans carried the weight of this shutdown,  Senate Democrats had chance after chance to end it, but instead they  chose to prolong the pain. That is not leadership. That is hypocrisy.

It was never about budgets or priorities. It was about power. It is  not about turning government on. For them, it was about turning  government into performance, where the people paying the highest price  are the ones furthest from Washington.

For more than 40 days, families were used as political pawns and  props while those responsible stood in front of cameras pretending to  solve the crisis that they created. I actually saw a Member from my  home State stand at a food bank, decry the fact that nutritional  assistance was in question, then swear up and down that they would vote  against ending this shutdown. That is the epitome of hypocrisy, and the  American people deserve better than that.

House Republicans did our job. We passed a clean continuing  resolution weeks ago, the same kind of straightforward measure that  should have been agreed to immediately to keep this government open.  Senate Democrats blocked that 14 times, prolonging this shutdown just  to score points to their woke, angry mob.

This measure before us today is the same bipartisan framework they  could have passed 40 days ago. The only thing that has changed is the  political calendar.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule. Let's stand  with the American people, the families, the veterans, and public  servants who have carried the burden of this shutdown and reopen our  government. Let's get this country moving again.",2025-11-12,2025-W46
Democrat,Hillary Scholten,Recognizing the Retirement of Robert Jennings,"Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my  constituent, Robert Jennings, on his retirement from SpartanNash in  Byron Center, Michigan. Mr. Jennings was an outstanding associate of  SpartanNash, with  his retirement marking 25 years of incredible professionalism and  service to his coworkers and community. His commitment to excellence in  his role is to be commended, and it is my honor and privilege to  recognize Mr. Jennings here today.

Through considerable effort, innovation, and persistence, Mr.  Jennings has helped foster an efficient and effective warehouse  environment for associates at SpartanNash. He worked with cross- functional departments to coordinate distribution center operations  while supervising the daily warehouse department in shipping,  selection, loading, and storage. Mr. Jennings was also crucial in  assisting with the training of SpartanNash teams during changes in  procedure, and worked with warehouse leads to coordinate the day-to-day  scheduling of associates. Our West Michigan Community is fortunate to  have lived and worked alongside Mr. Jennings, who has made outstanding  contributions during his time at SpartanNash.

Mr. Speaker, I once again ask my colleagues to join me in  congratulating Robert Jennings on his retirement from SpartanNash. We  commend him for his decades of service. I wish Mr. Jennings, a much- deserved, restful retirement surrounded by family, friends, and  neighbors.",2025-03-27,2025-W13

Republican,Chuck Grassley,Nominations of Joshua D. Dunlap and Eric Chunyee Tung,"Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if I may continue, I want to speak about  a couple of judges that will be before us this week. We will be voting  on a pair of highly qualified circuit court nominations.

Despite the ongoing Democratic government shutdown, the Senate  Judiciary Committee remains hard at work. We are continuing to hold  hearings. We are continuing to advance strong judicial nominees, like  the two that I am about to alert my colleagues to.

The first is Joshua Dunlap, for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  First Circuit. The second is Eric Tung for the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Ninth Circuit. Both will make fantastic circuit judges, and I  urge my colleagues to vote for them.

As Maine Senator Collins detailed last week, Mr. Dunlap graduated  first  in his class from the University of Notre Dame Law School and then  served as a clerk on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.  Since then, he has earned a stellar reputation as an appellate  litigator, throughout his decade-and-a-half tenure in private practice  of law.

Mr. Dunlap noted, during his confirmation hearing, that Mainers-- meaning residents of the State of Maine--I will start that quote over  again:

Mainers are famously independent.

I am confident that we can expect no less from him as a fair and  impartial judge. Indeed, Mr. Dunlap's career demonstrates that he is a  thoughtful and sharp lawyer committed to the rule of law, and, in his  own words, he believes ``the law should be available to all and applied  fairly to every litigant.''

For these reasons, he has earned widespread support, including from  his law school, his coclerks, and his law firm colleagues.

I am confident that Mr. Dunlap will make an outstanding judge on the  First Circuit. I also trust he will take great pride in serving his  State and our Nation.

President Trump and Senator Collins made an outstanding choice in Mr.  Dunlap.

Eric Tung is another great selection. He completed his undergraduate  degree at Yale and graduated with high honors at the University of  Chicago Law School. He clerked for Justice Scalia on the U.S. Supreme  Court, and he also clerked for Justice Gorsuch, both during his tenure  on the Tenth Circuit and upon Justice Gorsuch's elevation to the U.S.  Supreme Court.

Mr. Tung was a Bristow fellow in the Justice Department's Office of  Solicitor General, where he worked on numerous cases before the  Nation's highest Court.

During President Trump's first administration, he also worked as an  assistant U.S. attorney in the Central District of California. As a  Federal prosecutor, Mr. Tung handled a broad array of criminal matters,  including firearm offenses, drug trafficking, and fraud.

In recent years, Mr. Tung has focused on civil litigation and appeals  in private practice. He was appointed by the chief justice of the  California Supreme Court to serve as the sole civil appellate  practitioner on the Appellate Indigent Defense Oversight Advisory  Committee.

In every facet, Mr. Tung has been an outstanding appellate lawyer.  Based on his stellar credentials and his stellar reputation, it is no  surprise that his nomination is supported by his law firm colleagues  and the various coclerks that he has worked with at the Tenth Circuit  and the U.S. Supreme Court.

Like Mr. Dunlap, I believe Mr. Tung will make a phenomenal judge and  serve this Nation honorably and with distinction. I encourage my  colleagues to support both of these fine circuit court nominees.",2025-11-03,2025-W45

Democrat,Gwen Moore,Haiti Economic Lift Program Extension Act,"Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, let me just thank the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for yielding.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the reauthorization of the  Haiti-specific U.S. trade preference programs. Haiti, of course, is  suffering from grave instability and security risks.

As we know, the ransom that Haiti paid to colonial France for its  freedom continues to be at the cornerstone of its instability. I am  telling you, Madam Speaker, that the least and the minimum that the  United States can do to help stabilize the incredibly precarious  situation in a land a stone's throw away from our shores, is to  reauthorize these programs.

President Trump has lifted up the need to fortify economic and  security interests in our hemisphere, and I can think of no better way  to buoy these interests than support the bipartisan HOPE/HEALTH  programs.

Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. These programs are not without need of  reform. However, reauthorization is crucial to the economic growth and  stability and to protect our economic security and interests in our  hemisphere.

Republican,Bruce Westerman,Sinkhole Mapping Act of 2025,"Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 900) to direct the Director of the United States Geological  Survey to establish a program to map zones that are at greater risk of  sinkhole formation, and for other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 900

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Sinkhole Mapping Act of       2025''.       SEC. 2. SINKHOLE HAZARD IDENTIFICATION.

(a) In General.--Subject to the availability of       appropriations made in advance for such purpose, the Director       of the United States Geological Survey shall establish a       program to--

(1) study the short-term and long-term mechanisms that       cause sinkholes, including extreme storm events, prolonged       droughts causing shifts in water management practices,       aquifer depletion, and other major changes in water use; and

(2) develop maps that depict zones that are at greater risk       of sinkhole formation.

(b) Use of Certain Data.--In developing maps under       subsection (a)(2), the Director of the United States       Geological Survey shall utilize 3D elevation data (as that       term is defined in section 2 of the National Landslide       Preparedness Act (43 U.S.C. 3101)) collected pursuant to       section 5 of that Act (43 U.S.C. 3104).

(c) Review of Maps.--Once during each 5-year period, or       more often as the Director of the United States Geological       Survey determines is necessary, the Director shall assess the       need to revise and update the maps developed under this       section.

(d) Website.--The Director of the United States Geological       Survey shall establish and maintain a public website that       displays the maps developed under this section and other       relevant information critical for use by community planners       and emergency managers.

Mr. WESTERMAN.  900, the bill now under  consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Representative Soto's bill, H.R.  900, the Sinkhole Mapping Act of 2025.

Sinkholes are a natural hazard that cost the United States Government  approximately $300 million per year and pose a serious threat to public  safety.

Sinkholes occur when there is a lack of proper external surface  drainage so when a heavy rainstorm comes through and the ground cannot  drain the water properly a void may form underground. From that point  on, it is often simply a waiting game until the ground gives out and a  dangerous sinkhole develops.

This bill would require the Director of the United States Geological  Survey to establish a program that examines the short- and long-term  causes of sinkholes. This research would provide the government with  more accurate data on the costs incurred from these hazards.

The program would also create maps of areas most at risk of  sinkholes, analyze the areas with the greatest risk of experiencing a  sudden sinkhole and make maps publicly available to help community  planners and government agencies prepare for and avoid these  catastrophes.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Soto's bill will help leverage modern  technology and mapping data to gain a better understanding of the  sinkhole hazards facing the country and empower local communities to  prepare for and mitigate these hazards.

Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.",2025-07-14,2025-W29
Democrat,Joe Morelle,Repeal of Senate Notification Requirements Relating to Legal Process on Disclosures of Senate Data,"Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6019.

Last week's bill to fund the government included a provision, added  quietly in the dead of night, that facilitates the transfer of millions  of taxpayer dollars from the United States Treasury to the personal  bank accounts of eight Republican Senators, and not just any Senators.  They were Senators who may have had knowledge of or even participated  in efforts to overturn the 2020 Presidential election, efforts that  culminated in a violent attack on this very institution.

Since many of my Republican colleagues seem determined to forget the  reality of that day, allow me to remind you that, during this attack,  Capitol Police officers were maimed while protecting the lives of the  very Senators now seeking to enrich themselves at the taxpayers'  expense.

Officers lost eyes. They lost fingers. They suffered traumatic brain  injuries and had their spinal disks smashed. One was stabbed with a  metal fence stake. Another suffered a heart attack after being  repeatedly tased. Some tragically lost their lives. Others were so  severely injured that they could no longer continue to serve in law  enforcement.

The plot to overturn the 2020 Presidential election led multiple  grand juries, both State and Federal, to bring felony charges against  its organizers and participants. These charges were based on actions  like promoting fake elector slates, urging State officials to find  votes to change the election outcome, and urging Vice President Pence  to stand just a few feet from here behind that very dais and violate  the United States Constitution.

According to public reports, one of the eight Republican Senators now  eligible for this taxpayer-funded windfall testified before one of  those grand juries. At the conclusion of the testimony, that Republican  Senator reportedly embraced the prosecutor and lauded the work of the  grand jurors as cathartic. That same Senator announced just yesterday  that he intends to seek his payout of tens of millions of dollars from  Federal taxpayers.

It should be clear to everyone here: Under no circumstances should  the power entrusted to us as Members of Congress be used to line your  own pockets, period, full stop. Anyone who voted for this appalling  provision, including all but two House Republicans just last week,  should feel ashamed of themselves.

As these Republican Senators and House Members know, phone records  are among the most routine tools used in criminal investigations. They  do not reveal the content of any conversations. They simply show which  numbers were called, which numbers called them, and when those calls  were made.

They are essentially phone bills. If these Republican Senators  genuinely believe that their civil liberties were violated or if they  are interested in changing the law relating to subpoenas, then they are  better positioned than literally anyone on planet Earth to hold  hearings, draft legislation, and debate proposed changes in the open.  That is not what this is all about. This is about ensuring the law  applies to every other American, just not to them.

Let me repeat that: This law applies only to them, not even Members  of the House of Representatives, nor should it--not to every other  American citizen; just them. This kind of self-serving, self-dealing,  one-sided get-rich-quick scheme at the expense of taxpayers is why  Americans are so disgusted with this Congress, and it is why I expect  that many of those who supported this provision will be dismissed next  November.

This lucrative carve-out masquerading as legislation isn't an  isolated occurrence. It is part of a broader pattern: the weaponization  of the Department of Justice and the United States Treasury to reward  allies and to punish perceived enemies.

Let me briefly highlight just a few other examples.

Earlier this year, the Trump Department of Justice agreed to a $5  million settlement with an estate of a January 6 rioter who was killed  while attempting to violently breach this Chamber just outside those  doors. As the chief of police of the Capitol Police said at the time:  ``This settlement sends a chilling message to law enforcement  nationwide, especially to those with a protective mission like ours.''

According to public reporting, Department of Justice is also  negotiating a settlement of up to $50 million to disgraced former  General Michael Flynn over the purported wrongful prosecution, even  though he confessed to the crimes for which, incredibly, he now says  that he was wrongly prosecuted. You can't make this up.

Other reports indicate that President Trump is seeking $230 million  from taxpayers for himself personally for prior investigations into his  conduct. Let's not forget on day one of this administration when  President Trump issued blanket pardons to over 1,000 criminals  convicted of January 6 crimes, including members of the Oath Keepers  and Proud Boys, who assaulted Capitol Police officers. Just last week,  a militia member who participated in the riot was re-pardoned for a  completely unrelated gun charge--pardoned twice.

What have we heard from congressional Republicans about all of this:  about legalized payoffs to Republican Senators, about get-rich-quick  schemes unfolding within the Federal Government, and about rewards for  friends and retribution against opponents? We have heard absolutely  nothing. The silence is deafening.

Last I checked, this is the United States Congress, not the Russian  Duma. We do not create a protected class of elites who can siphon off  public money, reward their friends, punish their political opponents,  and insulate themselves from accountability. That is not what we are,  or at least we weren't until last week, when nearly every single House  Republican voted for this disgraceful provision of law after rejecting  Democratic amendments to strip it from the bill.

My Republican colleagues had every opportunity to stop this provision  from ever becoming law, but they voted for it anyway, and now they just  want to turn around and say: Just kidding. We didn't mean it.

What are we doing here? Let's review the sequence of events.

Senate Republicans snuck this outrageous provision into a bill to  reopen the Federal Government after months of Republicans insisting  that they would only accept a clean funding bill. I can't tell you the  number of times, with all due respect, that I heard Speaker Johnson say  it over and over again. House Republicans went right along with this.

Now, straight-faced, worthy of an Academy Award, they want to pretend  that the Senate may repeal the payoff they just made law? As we head  into the fourth and, I pray, final year of this majority, I didn't  think anything could shock me more. I was wrong.

The American people are sick and tired of this. They are sick and  tired of watching politicians come to Washington to get rich while  everyday Americans suffer through an affordability crisis that  Republicans don't appear interested in confronting.

They are sick and tired of watching Republicans block a tax credit  that will lower health insurance costs for millions of Americans after  passing a partisan budget that will throw millions more off of  Medicaid, only to turn around and create a slush fund for themselves.

I represent Rochester, New York, the city that Frederick Douglass  chose to make his home and to publish The North Star. Douglass reminded  us: ``The life of a nation is secure only when the nation is honest,  truthful, and virtuous.''

Ask yourselves: Is sneaking this self-enriching provision into what  was supposedly a clean funding bill honest, truthful, or virtuous? I  think we all know the answer.

In fact, I am so opposed to this corrupt provision that I actually  voted against it last week. I look forward to hearing my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle try to explain why they did not.

Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I need to say, as someone who served on the  House Rules Committee for 4 years, that we clearly could have put on  the floor and made in order an amendment to strike this provision from  the bill that had been passed by the Senate.

Most people who took social studies in elementary school understand  the bill has to pass the Senate and the House before it is sent to the  President. Had we had the opportunity, we would have voted on an  amendment. I guarantee it would have passed this House and you would  have had the full support of Democrats to strike that provision, and  then we could have sent it back to the Senate.

We weren't forced to do this last week. There was an amendment made  in the Rules Committee that the Rules Committee Republicans rejected,  which would have made in order an amendment that would have stripped  this provision from the bill.

That should have been done and could have been done. People made a  conscious decision, on the other side of the aisle, not to include that  amendment and make it in order. We shouldn't have to be here today  trying to mop up the mess that has been created.

Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I have enormous respect for my colleagues  and particularly those that serve on the Rules Committee, but this  could have been dealt with last week.

There was no reason to pass this. By the way, Democrats were fighting  for tax breaks and subsidies that makes health insurance more  affordable for millions of Americans who go to work every day. We  couldn't do that because the Speaker and Senator Thune, the majority  leader, insisted it had to be a clean CR. It had to be a clean  continuing resolution with no other provisions, yet somehow this got in  there.

This wasn't clean. There is nothing clean about this. By the way,  last week when we were considering this, had we made the amendment in  order that we seem to be considering right now, it would have passed,  presumably overwhelmingly, if what I am hearing from my colleagues is  true. We could have sent the bill back to the Senate. I am sorry. I  know we didn't want to impose on them and their time to take this out.

By the way, what these Republican Senators are saying was such an  egregious abuse is something that every American is subject to, every  single one of the 340 million Americans blessed to call this country  our home have to go through, except these Senators because they think  it is outrageous.

By the way, if you took this to its logical conclusion, a Senator  that might participate in the overthrow of the United States  Government, let's just say hypothetically was coordinating to do that,  could not have the Department of Justice look at their phone records.  It is the same thing they can do to every other one of the 340 million  Americans, but not these Senators. God, no. They can't have that if  there is some reason to suggest that they might have information that  the Justice Department can't do it.

By the way, that wasn't the rule back when this happened in 2022.  They are doing it retroactively. They are changing the law and going  back 3 years and allowing them to sue the United States taxpayers for  millions and millions of dollars.

Last night, a United States Senator said he intends to sue for tens  of millions of dollars under this provision.

I can't imagine anything that would cause more anxiety to American  taxpayers than to see this debate and understand what happened.

Respectfully, I appreciate it, but we could have dealt with this last  week. We should have dealt with this last week. We shouldn't be here.

I will support the bill, but by the way, there is no guarantee that  the United States Senate is going to take this up. This may all be for  show just to make people feel guilty about having voted for this or  wanting to convince voters back home that they really weren't complicit  in giving this extraordinary bonanza to a handful of elitists who feel  somehow aggrieved by the fact that they had information that might have  actually been really helpful about looking at the potential overthrow  of the 2020 Presidential election.

Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.

Mr. Speaker, I hope today's debate was about more than simply a press  release, about people trying to absolve themselves, and not just  another waste of taxpayer time and money misleading the American people  about the intentions of Senate Republicans.

The Senate should act on this measure. They should act on it today.  Rarely in life is there a second chance to do the right thing.

I urge my colleagues here to do the right thing, and I certainly urge  Members of the Senate to do the right thing, as well.",2025-11-19,2025-W47
Democrat,Sydney Kamlager-Dove,Intervening in Gop's Relationship with President Trump,"Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Speaker, I want to just say that Republicans  have endured a rather lopsided relationship with Donald Trump this  year--dare I say, abusive. I hope you will consider this a Republican  intervention. For the record, these are not attacks. They are just  facts.

Healthcare: Republicans cut $1 trillion from Medicaid with their big,  ugly bill, threatening their own vulnerable constituents, when three- quarters of Medicaid enrollees are in red States, and rural hospitals  across this country are struggling to stay open.

Republicans then shut down the government to avoid a vote on  extending ACA subsidies, only for Trump to later come out in support of  extending these subsidies.

A recent Navigator poll shows that Americans blame Trump and  congressional Republicans for rising healthcare premiums by a 26-point  margin. Surprise: Americans also overwhelmingly blame Republicans for  the shutdown. I see tread marks everywhere.

Redistricting: The drama started when Trump called Greg Abbott and  demanded five more Republican seats in Texas, triggering California's  redistricting efforts that could cost California Republicans five  seats. It is funny how my Republican colleagues were, are, and remain  silent when Texas, Ohio, Missouri, and North Carolina gerrymander, but  throw a tantrum when California punches back.

Chip deal: I don't mean nachos or potatoes. I mean the AI, computing,  and national security kind. For years, my China-hawk Republicans warned  about the competition with the CCP, only for Trump to ignore them and  green-light Nvidia H200 chip sales to China in exchange for a 25  percent fee. What happened to tough on China?

Boat strikes: Republicans have abdicated their constitutional war  powers authority, allowing the Trump administration to carry out  extrajudicial killings off the coast of Venezuela under the guise of  stopping drug trafficking. Meanwhile, Trump just pardoned the President  of Honduras, who was convicted of helping to move 400 tons of cocaine  into the United States. My colleagues need to square the circle for me.  Please do it.

Deficit: Republicans who call themselves fiscal hawks stayed true to  President Trump and got rewarded with $2 trillion added to the national  debt, bringing us to a whopping $38 trillion. How many zeroes are in  that number? Far too many for Americans to afford.

Then, there was the mighty whiplash of the Epstein files. Trump and  Republicans spent an entire year trying to block the release of the  Epstein files, only for Trump to reverse course at the  last minute when he realized the release was inevitable.

Tariffs and affordability: For a full year, Republicans said nothing  while Trump rolled out illegal, arbitrary, and chaotic tariffs that  raised prices across the board. In just 8 months of Trump 2.0, the  average American household spends $700 more on basic necessities. This  season's most popular holiday gifts are up 26 percent since last year.  During the affordability crisis, Trump banned the word  ``affordability'' from Republicans' vocabulary, but ``affordability''  is still in the dictionary and still on people's minds. The economy is  an A-plus-plus-plus hot mess.

Farmers: Earlier this year, Republicans watched quietly as Trump  destroyed USAID, an agency that bought crops from American farmers,  many of whom backed Trump and the Republicans in 2024. When beef costs  reached record highs in October, they watched again as Trump proposed  buying beef from Argentina rather than American farmers. Last month,  Republicans forced a vote denouncing the horrors of socialism. This  week, they are applauding Trump for using it to bail out the farmers  that his administration failed.

Please consider this an intervention and get out of this lopsided  relationship now.",2025-12-10,2025-W50
Democrat,Val Hoyle,South Pacific Tuna Treaty Act of 2025,"Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 531, the South Pacific Tuna  Treaty Act of 2025, will help sustain American tuna fisheries and the  conservation of marine resources in the South Pacific.

This legislation would implement the South Pacific Tuna Treaty, a  multilateral treaty between the United States Government and the  Pacific Island states.

This treaty authorizes the small U.S. purse seine vessel fleet to  fish in specific and exclusive economic zones in the Pacific Island  countries that are part of the treaty. These parties include Australia,  the Cook Islands, Fiji, New Zealand, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,  the Solomon Islands, Tonga, and many more island nations.

The exclusive economic zones of these nations are very close together  and not far from American Samoa. There is little international water  between them.

Purse seine fishing often uses fish aggregating devices, or FADs,  which are large, circular nets that drift independently through the  water for hundreds of miles until they catch fish. They have sonar and  GPS, so the fishing boat knows where they are and when the net is full.

The nature of this fishing method, combined with the proximity of  these countries, means that FADs can be released in international  waters but float through other countries' EEZs while catching fish  along the way. Without access to these EEZs, the U.S. purse seine fleet  cannot retrieve the fish that they catch.

The South Pacific Tuna Treaty provides the U.S. fleet with access to  these lucrative tuna fishing grounds and facilitates cooperation on  various issues. It has been vital for almost three decades, fostering a  mutually beneficial, strategic, and economic relationship between the  United States and the Pacific Island countries.

The treaty was entered into force in 1988, was extended in 1993, and  then again in 2002. Most recently, the parties began renegotiating the  treaty and its annexes in 2009 and reached agreement in 2016.

The bill today proposes adjustments to the South Pacific Tuna Act of  1988 to implement the amended treaty, mainly providing more flexibility  for U.S. vessels and the Pacific Island countries to negotiate access  levels  while ensuring a stable operating environment.

This legislation will enable the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration to implement annual access and fee agreements and new  operational requirements efficiently, provided we still have enough  staff to operate NOAA efficiently.

It will allow the United States and its vessels operating under the  treaty to better utilize these benefits. This bill will benefit U.S.  fisheries and help maintain a strong U.S. presence in the South Pacific  region.

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.",2025-05-13,2025-W20
Republican,Jim Baird,Mathematical and Statistical Modeling Education Act,"Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, the Mathematical and Statistical Modeling  Education Act seeks  to improve the quality of STEM education in America. This bill will  allow us to modernize math curricula and improve K-12 science,  technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.

While this bill directs the National Science Foundation to grant  awards to educational institutions, it does not award any new funding.  As we look at reining in the out-of-control government spending and  bureaucracy, we must work with the resources we already have.

As an animal scientist, I understand the life-changing effects STEM  education can have when it comes to our livestock, creating innovative,  more effective farming techniques, our food quality, and ultimately our  Nation's well-being.

Proper STEM education has an invaluable impact on American  innovation. It equips our students--our future workforce--to tackle the  challenges of our modern digital economy. Modernizing STEM education  also has wide-ranging impacts on our national security.

The United States' ability to create cutting-edge technologies has  been vital to defeating our adversaries, especially as our adversary,  Communist China, continues to make huge investments in STEM to try and  out-compete the U.S. Beating China and maintaining our global  competitive edge begins with strengthening STEM education in K-12  schools.

That is why I am proud to co-lead this bipartisan legislation to  ensure that the United States continues to dominate when it comes to  STEM education.",2025-03-24,2025-W13
Democrat,George Whitesides,Fired By President Trump,"Mr. WHITESIDES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the story of two Federal  scientists who, in their own words, were fired by President Trump.

I am a biologist and was a postdoctoral researcher at the       EPA Office of Research and Development. Most of my research       focused on clean water and human health, such as drinking       water, recreational water, and efforts to prevent pollution.       My research projects included the impact that wildfires have       on drinking water quality. My work is not political, and my       career should never have been politicized. This was my dream       job.

Another scientist, in their own words, said:

I was a biologist for the U.S. Geological Survey. I       conducted wildfire and fuels-related research in Sequoia and       Kings Canyon National Parks, working closely with park       managers to improve the fuel management plan.

Science is the foundation of American leadership and security. These  firings must be reversed.",2025-02-26,2025-W09
Democrat,Patty Murray,Cloture Motion,"Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this week, there are advocates here in  Congress with the American Cancer Society to advocate for cancer  research and prevention. This is lifesaving work, and no one does it  better than our researchers.

In my home State of Washington, we have a lot of incredibly smart  people who have been making a lot of incredible breakthroughs for  patients, and we have a lot of passionate advocates who have been  fighting to support their work. I have lost track of how many times I  have visited the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, but every time, I am just  blown away by the work they are doing. And they aren't the only ones.

This isn't just about advancing science though. It is about saving  lives and finding new treatments and therapies and cures that give hope  to help patients fighting for their lives.

Cancer research has a long history of bipartisan support here in  Congress. But some of my colleagues across the aisle seem to need a  reminder and a wake-up call because under President Trump, we have seen  some reckless moves to undermine medical research, including cancer  research. Research funding has been pulled without reason, without  warning, and without any thought for the consequences.

This administration has tossed clinical trials into chaos, promising  cures into limbo, and threatened to abandon our historic global  research and leadership in medical research. Just this week, a new  report in the New York Times detailed how research into a rare  pediatric brain cancer was totally upended because Trump yanked the  funding. That research is halted and that researcher is forced to move  on to topics that don't rely on NIH funding.

It is worth remembering, for many of our rare, deadly diseases, cures  are not viewed as a payday for private investors, which makes NIH not  just the best hope for finding a cure but the only hope for desperate  patients, at least before Trump came along and stopped funding.

And that new article, which details other research Trump has  sidetracked as well, is just scratching the surface of how bad this is.  I have heard firsthand from researchers who have seen their work  disrupted and students who are considering leaving the United States to  continue their studies.

I have also received heartbreaking updates from patients, like a mom  in my State fighting colon cancer who had her shot at a critical  clinical trial taken away by Trump's chaotic, illegal funding cuts. And  now, R.F.K., Jr., has cut off all Federal funding for mRNA research,  one of the most promising new technologies for cancer treatments. This  is so damaging.

In addition to supporting the research that finds new cures, we also  need to make sure patients can actually access and afford those cures.  That means we have to protect health coverage that helps cancer  patients get care. That is why I am fighting to undo damaging Medicaid  cuts Republicans passed and to extend the healthcare tax credits that  are helping millions of families afford coverage right now.

We have to make a strong case for cancer research and prevention with  facts, science, patient stories, and our voices. And I believe speaking  out can have a real impact here because when I talk to colleagues on  both sides, it is clear there is consensus we should not let years of  leadership fall to the wayside. In fact, in our Senate funding bill,  the bipartisan bill that we passed through the Appropriations  Committee, we were able to reject some of these damaging cuts and make  serious investments in cancer research.

But we do have more work ahead to get these bipartisan medical  research investments signed into law. I will not stop pushing for that.",,
Democrat,Valerie Foushee,January 6 Attack,"Mrs. FOUSHEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished leaders for this  opportunity.

Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago, our Nation witnessed an unthinkable assault  on American democracy when a violent crowd breached the U.S. Capitol  with one purpose: to overturn a lawful election and hold onto power by  force.

Law enforcement officers stood between that mob and the Constitution.  More than 140 brave officers were injured, and several lost their lives  defending this institution. Their courage deserves not just remembrance  but that we remain vigilant in upholding the rule of law.

The attack on January 6 was the result of a President who chose  division over truth, grievance over governance, and chaos over  accountability. That choice continues to threaten our democracy today,  as Donald Trump practices deliberate deception and escalating  extremism.

Democracy is fragile, and it demands our constant defense. It can  only survive when we act to protect it each and every day.",2026-01-06,2026-W02
Republican,Chuck Grassley,Iowa,"Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on my annual tour of Iowa's 99 counties,  I visited recently the Boys & Girls Club of Cedar Valley in Waterloo,  IA. This was during our last congressional State work period. I held a  Q and A with the young Iowans who participate in that afterschool  program. We talked about the importance of those programs, advice on  how to be a good citizen, and celebrating African-American History  Month.

I was impressed by the students and appreciated the opportunity to  hear directly from them. So I encourage Iowans to volunteer with this  organization or any civic organization in need of such volunteers.  Giving your time to others helps keep our communities strong. If there  is anything you can do to benefit the next generation, you should do  it.

Besides this example of the Boys & Girls Clubs, I make a practice of  going to about 10 or 12 high schools a year, and there are always a  couple lessons that I am asked about: how to be a good citizen and  ``What advice you would give to us?''

So I try to explain to these young people that the reason I go around  to meet young people at high schools is because they never come to my  open town meetings. You never get anybody under 18 years of age to do  that.

So I like to tell them that I consider representative government a  two-way street: Those of us elected are one half of it, and our  constituents are the other half of it. If you are going to have  representative government, you have to know what is on the  constituents' minds, and the best way to do that is to have dialogue  face to face with your constituents. Obviously, it is not the only way  you get opinions, but it is the best way to get that opinion.

Then they say: Do you have any advice for us?

I say: In America, you have a chance to either govern or be governed.  You have a chance to rule or be ruled. And I hope, as young people, you  choose the course of helping govern.",2025-04-07,2025-W15
Republican,Mike Haridopolos,Recognizing Arcadio Santiago-Rodriguez,"Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary service of Master Sergeant Arcadio Santiago-Rodriguez, a  proud member of the Army's 65th Infantry Regiment, known as the  Borinqueneers.

During the Korean war, then-Private First Class Santiago-Rodriguez  displayed extraordinary heroism in the face of danger. When his squad  leader was gravely wounded, he swiftly took command, rallying his  fellow soldiers and leading them safely with unwavering courage and  determination.

Later, while evacuating a wounded comrade, he singlehandedly engaged  five enemy soldiers, killing four and capturing a fifth, forcing that  captured soldier to carry the wounded soldier to safety. For his  heroism, he was awarded the Silver Star.

At 101 years old, Master Sergeant Santiago-Rodriguez continues to  inspire us.

Republican,Russell Fry,Recognizing Mayor Marilyn Hatley,"Mr. FRY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an incredible  public servant and a great friend, Mayor Marilyn Hatley of Myrtle  Beach, South Carolina, who is retiring after two decades of public  service.

Marilyn has been a constant force for many years, leading with  strength, dedication, and a genuine heart for the people of North  Myrtle Beach.

She is a pioneer. She has worked harder than anyone. In fact, she is  one of the hardest-working women that I know to make North Myrtle Beach  not just a premier tourist destination but a place we are all proud to  call home.

She has championed beach renourishment, expanded recreational  opportunities, and helped build major infrastructure, all while keeping  North Myrtle Beach on budget with some of the lowest taxes and crime  rates in South Carolina.

Democrat,Jack Reed,Terminating the National Emergency Declared with Respect to Energy,"Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to deliver two statements on the two  resolutions that are before us. First let me comment upon the proposal  S.J. Res. 71, led by my colleagues Senator Kaine and Heinrich, to  overturn President Trump's sham energy emergency.

You would think that, in an energy emergency, the President would be  pursuing the all-of-the-above energy policy his administration has  touted, but instead he is throwing up roadblocks at more than 90  percent of the power set to come online, as his Energy Secretary has  acknowledged. Meanwhile, President Trump has invoked emergency powers  to fast-track dirty fossil fuel projects, primarily to reward the Big  Oil donors whom he reportedly asked to donate a billion dollars to his  campaign.

The fact is, energy prices are a real emergency for the American  people, and we need more energy on the grid to keep up with the  proliferation of AI and data centers. But the truth also is, President  Trump and the harmful actions his administration is taking are actually  restricting supply, killing good-paying jobs, and increasing energy  prices, which have risen at more than twice the rate of inflation this  year under President Trump.

I will highlight two examples of President Trump's reckless actions  in my home State of Rhode Island. Right now, the Rhode Island AFL-CIO  is leading a critical lawsuit against President Trump's cancelation of  the $7 billion Solar for All Program, which was designed to help low-  and middle-income families install solar panels on their homes, saving  those families about $400 each year on electricity costs.

Rhode Island received nearly $50 million under this program to help  thousands of Rhode Island households install and utilize solar energy  while supporting hundreds of good-paying jobs in the State.

President Trump claims to support workers, but he is actually killing  good jobs that would bring affordable energy online for our  constituents. And just weeks after canceling the Solar for All Program,  the Trump administration paused work on Revolution Wind, a nearly  complete offshore wind project off the coast of Rhode Island. This  project is 80 percent constructed, with over $5 billion invested and 45  turbines already installed in the Atlantic Ocean. It supports more than  1,000 local union jobs and is poised to deliver enough low-cost energy  to power 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. State officials  estimate that losing this project could cost New England ratepayers up  to $500 million a year.

I am encouraged that a Federal court in Washington, DC, granted a  motion allowing work on Revolution Wind to proceed and that work has  restarted, but these cynical moves show that the President doesn't  really care about energy prices or supply or jobs; he cares, really,  about pleasing his Big Oil donors.

He is also pleasing China, which is becoming the global leader in  clean energy technology, building almost three-quarters of the world's  solar and wind projects, according to the Global Energy Monitor. And  despite President Trump's claims that China is simply exporting these  technologies and not utilizing them, the New York Times reported that  ``In China, more wind turbines and solar panels were installed last  year than in the rest of the world combined.''

At the same time, President Trump is trying to keep the United States  hooked on expensive oil and gas and dependent on OPEC and other foreign  actors with interests opposed to our own; and while he is doing that,  China is launching into a new age of relatively cheap energy that will  power their data centers and their infrastructure.

Rhode Islanders deserve infrastructure that creates good jobs;  provides affordable, clean power; increases our energy independence;  and reduces climate-destroying greenhouse gases in the process. And it  is clear Trump's energy emergency is a sham, and I am proud to join my  colleagues' efforts to overturn it.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to move to the topic before the  Senate with respect to the War Powers resolution regarding Caribbean  military operations.

I rise to express my deep concern about the Trump administration's  ongoing military operations in the Caribbean and to voice my strong  support for the War Powers Resolution introduced by Senators Schiff,  Kaine, Wyden, and Sanders.

Over the past month, the United States has carried out four lethal  strikes on boats in the Caribbean, reportedly killing 21 individuals.  These attacks have been retroactively explained by the President's  unilateral declaration that the United States is in ``armed conflict''  with unnamed ``non-state armed groups'' throughout the Western  Hemisphere.

He has deployed thousands of U.S. forces, ships, and aircraft to  conduct  these operations--all without congressional authorization and without  any credible explanation to the American people.

Let me be clear. The drug cartels that traffic poison across our  borders are violent and reprehensible. They have devastated families  and communities across our country. We must do everything in our power  through law enforcement, intelligence, and international cooperation to  bring these organizations down. But that is not what this is all about.  These are not police actions or defensive operations; these are  targeted, lethal military strikes using weapons designed for warfare,  not interdiction or law enforcement.

The administration has offered no positive identification for those  killed, nor any information linking the boat crews to cartels. In fact,  they have not proven that these vessels were engaged in drug  trafficking, nor even that they were destined for the United States.

I would note that even if this evidence had been provided, that would  only justify interdiction by law enforcement, not lethal military  strikes.

The justification thus far has relied entirely on the President's  word, and that is not good enough. Our Constitution does not vest the  power to wage war on one man's word. The White House has claimed that  these strikes are allowable under the President's article II powers as  Commander in Chief, but article II is not a blank check. The Framers of  our Constitution deliberately separated the powers of war and peace  between the branches.

James Madison warned:

The executive is the branch most prone to war; therefore       the Constitution has, with studied care, vested that power in       the legislature.

The War Powers Resolution exists for moments like this. It ensures  that before we send American forces into hostilities, the people's  representatives have debated and voted on that decision. It ensures  accountability. It ensures legitimacy.

If we allow these unauthorized operations to continue unchecked, we  will have surrendered Congress's most solemn constitutional duty. We  will have set the precedent that the President--any President--may  initiate military action at will, without oversight, without  transparency, and without the consent of the governed.

We have seen this pattern before. Over the past several years, this  administration has repeatedly tested the limits of Executive power-- ordering strikes in Iran and Yemen and now the Caribbean, while  refusing even a brief consultation with Congress. Each time, the lines  blur a little further. Each time, the balance of power tilts a little  more toward the Executive.

This body, the U.S. Senate, cannot afford to shrug and move on. The  slow erosion of congressional oversight is not an abstract debate about  process; it is a real and present threat to our democracy.

The War Powers Resolution before us does not tie the President's  hands in responding to genuine threats; it simply requires him to do  what every Commander in Chief should: come to Congress, present the  facts, and seek authorization from the people's representatives before  initiating hostilities. That is not weakness. That is constitutional  strength. It is the principle that has guided our Republic for nearly  2\1/2\ centuries.

Finally, I will say this: Even setting aside the constitutional  questions, this campaign is deeply unwise. The notion that we can bomb  our way out of a drug trafficking crisis is not strategy; it is wishful  thinking. Using the U.S. military to conduct unchecked strikes in the  Caribbean risks destabilizing the region, provoking confrontation with  neighboring governments, and drawing our forces into yet another open- ended conflict without a clear mission or exit strategy.

Conflict in the Caribbean or with Venezuela is entirely avoidable,  but the risk that we stumble into war because of one man's impulsive  decision making has never been higher. Our troops deserve better--much  better.

This War Powers Resolution would restore that balance. It reaffirms  that the Constitution has always required that decisions of war and  peace belong to the legislature, not the Executive.

Mr. President, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution and to reassert the fundamental role of Congress in matters  of war.",2025-10-08,2025-W41
Democrat,Ed Case,Introduction of the Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act of 2025,"Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to today to ask for the House's support  for the Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act, which I introduced  with my colleague Congresswoman Jen Kiggans of Virginia. It is the  companion version of the bill introduced in the U.S. Senate by Senator  Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, along with twelve other Senators.

In 1941, more than 250,000 Filipino soldiers responded to President  Roosevelt's call-to-arms in the Philippines and elsewhere and fought  bravely for the U.S. and our allies during World War II. These soldiers  were promised the opportunity to immigrate to the United States along  with their families. However, after sacrificing for our country, many  returned home from the War only to be denied the benefits promised for  their service. Though many of these veterans became proud U.S.  citizens, our immigrant visa backlog, exacerbated by caps on visas from  the Philippines, have forced many of their family members to wait  decades to come to the United States to join and care for them. This  has effectively prevented these aging veterans from reuniting with  their families.

In October 2017, Congress finally awarded the Filipino veterans of  World War II the Congressional Gold Medal to honor their service to our  country, but we must do more as we promised. Additionally, in 2016, the  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services created the Filipino World  War II Veterans Parole Program, a temporary administrative fix that  allows these veterans to request parole for their children or siblings.  Under this policy, they can live in the U.S. pending processing of  their permanent resident applications, which may still take years if  not decades. However, as these veterans near the end of their lives,  they deserve the certainty of a non-revocable permanent solution.

The Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act would address this by  exempting from existing visa caps the visa applications of the children  of Filipino World War II veterans. This would allow them to gain green  cards once their applications are processed and approved, including  careful vetting in line with existing immigration standards. This will  not only assist these veterans in their senior years but also provide a  fitting recognition of their critical service in the War.

I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting these veterans and  helping fulfill our promises to them and their families.",2025-05-23,2025-W21

Republican,Jodey Arrington,Unlocking Our Domestic Lng Potential Act of 2025,"Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, as I listened to the ranking member talk  about China's need for U.S. energy, thank God it is that way and not  the other way around.

If we followed the green new manifesto, with the regulatory assault  on U.S. energy, and kept throwing hundreds of billions of dollars in  distorting Green New Deal energy subsidies, that is exactly what would  happen, we would wake up and be dependent on China for yet one more  critical product.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand alongside Chairman Guthrie and my  fellow west Texan, August Pfluger, in support of the Unlocking our  Domestic LNG Potential Act. America is the world's top exporter of LNG,  a vital pillar of both our economic strength and national security.

In an effort to placate the radical left, which I think was primarily  the motivation, the Biden administration, with its whole-of-government  assault on American energy, froze new LNG export permits with no  economic, environmental, or national security justification. That  reckless decision threatened billions of U.S. investments, undermined  our allies, and harmed energy-producing regions like west Texas.

Thankfully, we now have a President in the White House who is  committed to doing the right thing for the country, for our producers  and consumers, and committed to making American energy great again, not  weaponizing  this authority for purely ideological purposes.

This bill removes politics from the export permit process and secures  America's position as the world's energy superpower.

This is such an important way to honor the legacy of our colleague,  our Ranking Member Gerry Connolly.

He was a champion of our Federal workforce, of transparency, and in  making government work for all the people that we serve.

He believed in the power of Congress and in fighting tirelessly for  the constituents that he served and, of course, for the rule of law and  our Constitution.

He served as a county executive where he fought to expand affordable  housing and to invest in infrastructure, and he always supported public  workers. He delivered for his community. He delivered for the country,  and he left a proud legacy.

Now, Gerry represented the best among us in public service, which is  why we strongly support this bill. We all miss him greatly, and I know  every single member of our committee will work to carry on his legacy.

Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to honor Gerry by supporting this  bill.",2025-06-03,2025-W23
Democrat,Kathy Castor,Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act,"Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this Republican  charade and to stand up for my neighbors back home who deserve quality  and affordable health coverage. That includes over half a million of my  hardworking neighbors across the Tampa Bay area.

Mr. Speaker, 4.7 Floridians, or one in five who live in the Sunshine  State, are doing everything right. They are entrepreneurs. They are  caregivers.

They are part-time workers and small business owners like Linda  Misener and her husband. Their premiums will go from $288 per month to  over $3,200 per month next year. They cannot afford $39,000 for their  healthcare. They are terrified that they are going to lose everything.

David, who is being treated for pancreatic cancer, is unsure how he  will continue treatments and afford everything else.

It is unconscionable that Republicans are ripping away coverage to  fund their tax breaks for billionaires, the wealthy, and the well- connected. Americans deserve so much better.

Mr. Speaker, defeat this Republican bill. Bring the 3-year bipartisan  extension to the floor now.",2025-12-17,2025-W51
