Republican,Bill Huizenga,Remote Access Security Act,"Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from New York  allowing me to speak on this. I rise in support of Mr. Lawler's bill,  the Remote Access Security Act.

Mr. Speaker, America is at a critical juncture in our technology  policy. Do we want to allow our adversaries to weaponize American  technology? Do we want them to dominate us militarily and economically  in the future? Do we want to create a dystopian world and make everyday  Americans subservient to the Chinese Communist Party and their  affiliates, or do we want to make a decisive stand to stop some of the  most advanced technologies from being used against us in every facet of  our lives?

Loopholes currently available in U.S. export control allow the CCP  and others to gain a competitive advantage over American companies,  especially when it comes to cloud services for technologies that would  otherwise not be accessible in physical form. In other words, and in  plain English, you can't buy it, so you shouldn't be able to rent it  either.

The Remote Access Security Act fixes this problem by giving the  administration--all administrations--the authority and flexibility to  restrict China's cloud-based access to our most advanced AI  technologies.

In November 2025, I convened a subcommittee hearing on export control  loopholes which leave American technology vulnerable, and this is where  we extensively discussed issues such as this one. H.R. 2683 was  reported favorably out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee by a vote  of 51-0. Mr. Speaker, we can't do better than unanimous, but that is  showing broad bipartisan agreement on this particular issue.

Today, Congress needs to uphold our responsibility to the American  people to close this loophole and stop the CCP and its affiliates from  leveraging our technologies for their own military modernization  efforts and pursuit of technological dominance. Keeping this coveted  technology out of the hands of the CCP and their affiliates will ensure  that Silicon Valley, not Xinjiang, remains the center of the AI  revolution.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698859/remote-access-security-act,2026-01-12,2026-W03

The Government of the Netherlands has requested to buy up       to two hundred thirty-two (232) AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium       Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and up to eight (8) AIM-      120C-8 AMRAAM guidance sections.

The       estimated total cost is $570 million.

This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO Ally that is a force for       political stability and economic progress in Europe.

The proposed sale will improve the Netherlands capability       to meet current and future threats by ensuring it has modern,       capable air-to-air munitions. The Netherlands already has       AMRAAMs in its inventory and will have no difficulty       absorbing these articles into its armed forces.

The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.

The principal contractor will be RTX Corporation, located       in Arlington, VA. At this time, the U.S. Government is not       aware of any offset agreement proposed in connection with       this potential sale. Any offset agreement will be defined in       negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor.

Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the Netherlands.

There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            transmittal no. 25-72       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:

1. The AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile       (AMRAAM) is a supersonic, air- or surface-launched, aerial       intercept guided missile featuring digital technology and       micro-miniature, solid-state electronics. AMRAAM capabilities       include look-down/shoot-down, multiple launches against       multiple targets, resistance to electronic countermeasures,       and interception of high- and low-flying and maneuvering       targets. This potential sale will include Captive Air       Training Missiles, and AMRAAM guidance sections, control       sections, and containers.

2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.

3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.

4. A determination has been made that the Netherlands can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.

Republican,French Hill,Greater Sanction Pressure on Russia,"Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, in 1958, former Prime Minister  of Great Britain, Harold Macmillan, paraphrasing a remark from Winston  Churchill 4 years earlier, left us with the great expression: jaw-jaw  is better than war-war.

It is because of our great power that our rivals seek to end the  American way of life through direct or gray zone war attacks or by  cyber or economic destruction, and we certainly should routinely jaw- jaw with those great powers about our possible shared objectives and  deep concerns.

However, in the instance of Czar Putin, he has never been interested  in jaw-jaw. He is a creature of his KGB upbringing. There was no jaw- jaw with the Chechens in 1999, and there was no jaw-jaw with the  Georgians, only tanks, in 2008. There was no jaw-jaw, only propaganda,  corruption, and death in Putin's approach to Ukraine during President  Obama's administration.

Under President Obama, Putin conducted his overt and covert actions  in Ukraine with some 10,000 Ukrainians killed in the fighting,  including 2,000 civilians, yet Obama and his European allies simply  looked down at their shoes. In 2014, Putin took Crimea without firing a  shot. He is a disgrace to the rich, cultural history of the Russian  people, and he has thoroughly corrupted a false and bordering-on-insane  historic narrative regarding his threats and ambitions in Ukraine.

America, as the instrumental force inside the transatlantic alliance,  remains ready to stand shoulder to shoulder to back this European  resolve. This is something that neither Obama nor Biden would do. They  simply took the easy way out by agreeing to whatever the weakest  European voice was at the time.

This European attitude of: Here, let me hold your coat, has plagued  and frustrated all American Presidents from Eisenhower to Trump. Jack  Kennedy famously called out their unwillingness to pay for their own  defense stating how wrong it was to let the Europeans live off the fat  of the land in American economic and military security.

Madam Speaker, here is what needs to happen now. The United States  and our European allies must agree that we will not support the immoral  importation of Russian oil and gas. Europe has affordable, effective  alternatives.

The United States and our European allies should work through  sanctions and other forms of economic statecraft to communicate firmly  and consistently to large non-European buyers of Russian oil and gas  that the time to act is now.

Congress should act by immediately passing Congressman Zach Nunn's  bipartisan PEACE Act. This proposal would finally kneecap Russia's  energy revenues, which still total some $200 billion per year. This  would impose secondary sanctions on the country, including on Gazprom  and Rosneft.

It passed out of my committee, the Financial Services Committee, by a  vote of 53-1. It would be the first intensive sanctioning of the  Russian banking industry since the invasion.

Under Congressman Nunn's PEACE Act, the U.S. would take Russian  sovereign assets that have been immobilized and let the Ukrainians use  them to purchase defensive weapons.

Congress should also fully consider, debate, amend, and pass the  sanction legislation offered by Senator Lindsey Graham, which has 84  cosponsors, and its companion bill in the House sponsored by  Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick.

The President should, as a part of a newfound backbone in the G7,  fully implement the REPO Act, which I worked on diligently with former  Foreign Affairs Chairman   Michael McCaul and Senate Foreign Relations  Chair Jim Risch. This measure, signed into law in 2024, puts direct and  immediate heat on Russian sovereign assets held outside the country.

Here again, we need the Europeans to step forward. In the spring of  2024, the Council of Europe actually fully supported this idea with a  100 percent vote.

Congress should also authorize funding for the U.S. Geological Survey  to fully review all Soviet-era geological surveys of Ukraine, both in  the contested Donbas region, as well as free Ukraine, and provide  Congress and the administration with an up-to-date assessment of the  strategic minerals available for Ukraine's further economic  development.

The time for action is now. Apparently, Putin needs more unified  pressure to convince him that, in fact, jaw-jaw is better than war-war.

Let's not look back with regret that Congress did not act in the face  of Putin's corrupt, catastrophic, and contemptuous regime that laughs  in the face of his European neighbors and our American President.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695367/greater-sanction-pressure-on-russia,,
Democrat,Alma Adams,Fighting Dhs Immigration Raids,"Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, my community of Charlotte was under siege by the  Department of Homeland Security's campaign of terror last month. They  called it Operation Charlotte's Web.

Border Patrol agents engaged in extreme racial profiling, excessive  force, and brutal tactics, spreading fear in our community.

It was fear that shattered the car window of a U.S. citizen born in  Honduras. He was thrown on the glass-covered ground in handcuffs after  he already identified himself to agents.

It was fear when more than 30,000 Charlotte-Mecklenburg students, 21  percent of the student body, were absent from school on the Monday  after the raids began because parents were terrified that their  children would be victims of CBP's brutality.

It was fear as businesses shuttered their doors to try and protect  their customers and employees from being wrongfully targeted by these  Federal agents.

Cruelty was the point of their operation, but Charlotte never caved  in to their cruelty. Instead, citizens packed churches for training to  empower themselves to respond to Border Patrol agents. Parents band  together to safely get their children to school, and businessowners  patrolled the streets to protect their neighbors, their customers, and  their employers.

CBP's actions in Charlotte were deplorable and absolutely  unacceptable. I have already reached out to DHS and demanded  transparency on exactly what Border Patrol was doing in Charlotte. I am  still waiting for answers to my questions.

Make no mistake about it. My constituents want answers. I do, too.  They deserve the answers, and I am going to keep fighting for them.

Congress must end these unlawful, un-American, and unnecessary raids  on our communities.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697455/fighting-dhs-immigration-raids,2025-12-03,2025-W49
Republican,Pat Fallon,Recognizing Congressional Patriot Award Recipient Catherine ``trinka'' Taylor,"Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Catherine  ``Trinka'' Taylor of Dallas, Texas and present her with the  Congressional Patriot Award. Trinka has dedicated herself to faithfully  serving our community.

A sixth-generation Texan, Trinka was born in Dallas, Texas, and grew  up in Houston. She attended Rice University before transferring to the  prestigious Cornell University, where she earned her bachelor's degree  in architecture. Her passion for architectural design pushed her to  pursue opportunities in some of our most storied cities like New York  City, Boston, and Dallas. No matter where she lived, her dedication to  upholding conservative values never wavered. For many decades, Trinka  served in leadership roles as an Election Judge, Precinct Chairman,  executive committee member of Southern Methodist University, board  member of the Southwestern Medical Foundation, and as President of the  Park Cities Republican Women.

Trinka has continued to stay involved in our community as a member of  the Texas Federation of Republican Women, Dallas County Republican  Executive Committee, and the Dallas County Council of Republican Women.  Her passion for freedom, opportunity, patriotism, and our nation's  values has pushed her to drive us forward to a better tomorrow. For her  outstanding contributions to the Republican Party, Trinka received the  Betty Marquis Award and was selected by former Texas Governor George W.  Bush to serve on the Nominations Committee for the Governor's Awards  for Excellence in Arts, Humanities, and Science. She also served as a  commissioner of the Texas Commission of the Arts from 1998 to 2002. In  her free time, Trinka enjoys fly fishing, Canoeing, and spending time  with her children and grandchildren. She is a devoted woman of faith  and attends Saint Michaels and All Angels Episcopal Church in Dallas.  Trinka has truly made an incredible impact on the world around us, and  I wish her continued success for many years to come.

It is an honor to bestow my friend Trinka with the Patriot Award for  her exceptional service to the people of North Texas.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690291/recognizing-congressional-patriot-award-recipient-catherine-trinka-taylor,2025-04-28,2025-W18
Republican,Rick Allen,"Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Environmental Protection Agency Relating to ``Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems: Procedures for Facilitating Compliance, Including Netting and Exemptions''","Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Griffith for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, it is a new day in America. I remind my friends that,  just 6 years ago, we had the greatest economy in our lifetimes, and we  achieved energy independence. That is what this day is about.

The days of weakness on the world stage and dependence on foreign  adversaries for our energy needs are over.

I am proud to rise in support of H.J. Res. 35 to repeal the Biden  administration's harmful rule establishing a natural gas tax and help  the United States reclaim energy dominance.

The Biden administration had an all-out war on fossil fuel. On their  way out the door, the previous administration finalized this burdensome  rule to effectively collect taxes on methane emissions released from  oil and gas facilities and funnel that money to their radical climate  allies.

What my Democratic colleagues won't tell you is that our clean  natural gas is a major reason why the U.S. has become a world leader in  reducing carbon emissions.

In partnership with President Trump, House Republicans are  reinstating common sense in Washington. To lower costs for American  families, we must unleash our energy capabilities and utilize the  reliable natural gas right under our feet, not impose these outlandish  taxes on domestic producers.

Republican,"James Comer, Jr.",Protecting Our Nation's Capital Emergency Act,"Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 489, I call up  the bill (H.R. 2096) to restore the right to negotiate matters  pertaining to the discipline of law enforcement officers of the  District of Columbia through collective bargaining, to restore the  statute of limitations for bringing disciplinary cases against members  or civilian employees of the Metropolitan Police Department of the  District of Columbia, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2096, sponsored by Mr.  Garbarino, the Protecting Our Nation's Capital Emergency Act.

The men and women of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department serve  the community every day to keep this District safe and secure.

On January 4, 2023, the D.C. Council passed the Comprehensive  Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022. The act stripped  D.C. police officers of certain employee protections, making the job  more difficult despite rising crime in the District.

When the D.C. Council passed this law, Congress acted swiftly in a  bipartisan, bicameral fashion to overturn it. The House and Senate  passed H.J. Res. 42, which would have overturned the entire D.C. law,  with 14 House Democrats and 6 Senate Democrats joining Republicans in  support of the resolution.

However, then-President Biden vetoed the bipartisan resolution of  disapproval, allowing the harmful policies of the D.C. Council to  remain in effect today.

In another attempt to protect the D.C. police, Representative  Garbarino introduced this bill to repeal certain provisions of D.C.'s  Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act. That bill  passed through the Oversight Committee last Congress in 2024 and was  reintroduced this Congress, again, favorably reporting out of the  Oversight Committee, but now with the full support of the White House.

H.R. 2096 restores D.C. police officers' right to collectively  bargain over disciplinary matters and reinstates clear timelines for  disciplinary investigations.

H.R. 2096 also repeals the D.C. Council's requirement that the time  and place of some adverse action hearings be posted to a public  website.

This public posting requirement enables antipolice activists to  harass officers attempting to pursue their due process in the  workplace.

In summary, this legislation is necessary to support the recruitment  and retention of the Metropolitan Police Department.

Washington, D.C., cannot afford to continue to lose police officers  during the ongoing crime crisis in the Nation's Capital city.

My colleagues recognize the importance of supporting the law  enforcement officers who risk their lives to protect our communities.

By restoring employee protections, this legislation gives the  Metropolitan Police Department officers the due process they need to  confidently do their job.

Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Garbarino), the sponsor of the bill.

Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, before I reserve, I want to make sure that  my colleagues across the aisle know what bill we are actually debating  on the floor, that the bill that pertains to law enforcement in  Washington, D.C. It has nothing to do with their quest to continue to  defend the rioters and illegals in California.

Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I yield myself the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, in closing, I note that H.R. 2096 is endorsed by the  National Fraternal Order of Police. I strongly encourage each of my  House colleagues to support this bill, which will help strengthen law  and order in our Nation's Capital City, which is the responsibility of  Congress and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Again, I encourage passage of H.R. 2096, and I yield back the balance  of my time.

Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

Democrat,Richard Blumenthal,"Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act, 2026","Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, the American people can be forgiven  for wanting to turn off their computers or TVs and feeling a sense of  abhorrence and repulsion at what they are seeing again and again and  again as the video of Renee Good's killing is replayed for them.

What it shows is a horrific tragedy--a mother who was 37 years old,  an American citizen, subjected to alleged murder. I use the word  ``alleged'' because I have spent most of my career in law enforcement,  and the word ``alleged'' before a conviction is always mandatory. But  what is on that tape is there for everyone to see--the absolutely  needless, reckless use of excessive force with a firearm, without any  apparent need for self-defense.

We are seeing a surge of violence in this country that is not only  from private individuals but now from supposed law enforcement--ICE-- which has a responsibility to uphold the law and respect norms that  protect everyday citizens.

We are a country built on due process and the rule of law, and we  were founded on the idea that we resist tyrannical monarchs; that we  fought a war, in fact, against a tyranny that used totalitarian,  Gestapo-type tactics. And now we see them on the streets of our own  country.

Yes, Americans have a right to be repulsed by these videos and  outraged, angry, but also saddened and grief-stricken because the  killing of Renee Nicole Good last week at the hands of an ICE agent  showed the tragic outcome of abuse of power. This death was preventable  and predictable. It was preventable. It needn't have happened.

But it was also predictable because it is only an example of the  rising tide of lawlessness and recklessness on the part of ICE that has  been documented, in fact, by my report on the investigation we did, as  ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and the  report that was the result of that investigation. We released it  several weeks ago, and it can be found at https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/ wp-content/uploads/2025.12.8-ICE-Report-revised-FINAL.pdf.

I released this report, which documents firsthand accounts of 22 U.S.  citizens in 10 different States who were physically assaulted, pepper- sprayed, denied medical treatment, detained, sometimes for days, by  Federal immigration agents. And we did a hearing with a number of those  American citizens who were injured, denied medical care, prevented from  contacting their families or lawyers, some of them for days on end,  while detained under very harsh conditions. And it was graphic; it was  gripping. But it was only 4 or 5 examples of 22 individuals we  interviewed who themselves were only a subset of hundreds of American  citizens who were physically assaulted, detained, and many of them  injured.

This pattern and practice is not coincidental. It is the result of an  apparent policy on the part of this government Agency that involves  agents who are masked, unidentifiable, who turn violent without  provocation, crashing their government vehicles into citizens' cars,  dragging them from those  cars, slamming them to the ground, violently assaulting them, often  leading to lasting injuries, including trauma.

One of the individuals who appeared at our hearing was a veteran who  served and sacrificed for this country in the belief that he was  helping to preserve the very liberties that he was denied when he was  arrested.

Now, every one of these people sought to tell the agents that they  were an American citizen. They offered their passports or their  driver's license or other identification to show they were American  citizens. There was no reason to assault them in this way.

In California, they beat a 79-year-old man so badly that they broke  his ribs, and they slammed another man's head into the ground so hard  that he was concussed. In Illinois, a woman was shot five times, while,  in Indiana, a man was punched in the face and dragged outside his  family home in the early morning hours. It didn't matter whether  children were present; agents acted with reckless disregard for their  safety and well-being. In Idaho, children were taken from a car at  gunpoint and later zip-tied. In Massachusetts, an autistic child was  deliberately taken from her parents and used as bait by law enforcement  to try to lure their parents out of the house.

These detentions were not limited to one State or a few States. They  spanned the Nation--from Idaho to Alabama, from California to Illinois.  And we know there are so many stories that haven't been told because  people fear retaliation and retribution--American citizens fearing  their own government retaliating against them for speaking truth to  power about physical assaults by their own government.

These ICE agents have been trained and they have been recruited by  the Department of Homeland Security, which is complicit in this  misconduct--complicit because it has failed to provide the right  training and perhaps has recruited people who are wrongly in these  roles, and it has failed to either provide protocols or to enforce  them.

What became clear through our interviews and across the stories that  keep emerging is that the Department of Homeland Security does not have  just a few rogue agents. It has become a lawless force as an Agency of  the government. It is engaged in a coordinated, nationwide effort using  the same tactics, the same violence wherever they are deploying.

So after months of investigating these kinds of lawless abuses, I am  really saddened to say that Renee Good's death came as no surprise. It  was predictable, and it was preventable. And also preventable are  the injuries and the deaths and the lawlessness that are happening  every day, right now, in the streets of America, in the neighborhoods  of our great country.

They are a betrayal of the rule of law that is the foundation of our  Nation. It should shock America's conscience, and I believe it has, as  it has shocked mine. These kinds of brazen, abusive, lawless tactics do  not represent our Nation. Americans will have a hard time--and they  should--recognizing our great Nation in what they are seeing hour after  hour, day after day--right now, in realtime--in those abuses and in so  frequently used Gestapo-type tactics.

I initially thought: I don't want to go there. My father escaped  Germany in 1935 and came to America after seeing what was to come in  those same Gestapo-type tactics in Germany. He came here speaking no  English, having not much more than the shirt on his back and knowing  virtually no one. If he had stayed in Germany, he would have seen a  paramilitary force going door to door, rounding up people just like  him, exactly the kinds of tactics we now see unfolding: ICE as a  paramilitary force going business to business, door to door, church to  church, school to school, seizing people, dragging them out of their  cars or homes without much more cause than the fact that they are  people of color or they speak a different language or they are working  in a place where undocumented immigrants are thought to be working.

In this country, now, decades after that time in the 1930s, in the  pinnacle of democracy, what we are seeing is a paramilitary force  stopping people in this same way, searching them and assaulting them.  And the parallels are unmistakable and frightening. We cannot, in this  body or anywhere in our great country, stand idly while our fellow  citizens are rounded up and subjected to this treatment. We should not  be standing idly as any human being, whatever their status, is  subjected to this kind of abuse.

I will continue, on my subcommittee, the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations, the work that we have done, the investigation that is  ongoing right now. We will press for accountability. We will press for  the facts, the truth. And we have a lot of it already. We will not sit  idly and watch as the Nation I love--all of us in this body do--demeans  and betrays our Constitution. We have all taken an oath to uphold it.  So have those ICE agents that are betraying it. Our Constitution will  crumble unless we fight for it.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699087/commerce-justice-science-energy-and-water-development-and-interior-and-environment-appropriations-act-2026,2026-01-14,2026-W03
Democrat,Ron Wyden,Trump Administration,"Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague very much.

I just want to make sure, from a parliamentary standpoint, would the  Senator from Oregon yield for my question?

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, I want to start by  commending my partner from Oregon, who has now been on the floor for  close to 18 hours. What he is doing is ringing the alarm bells about  authoritarianism in America. It is an important public service.

Let me begin by saying, the Wyden family certainly knows a thing or  two about watching a democracy slide towards authoritarian rule. I  wrote in my book about how the courageous women in my family, in the  face of the Nazi takeover of the German republic, recognized the very  real threat of the growing authoritarianism in Germany. They pushed the  rest of the family to recognize what was happening to their democracy  when some of the men didn't want to face reality. Because of the  vigilance of women, I am standing here today in the Senate.

Now, further, on this point, as my colleague knows, during the  protests in Portland this past weekend, Federal agents dragged a 4- foot-6 blind man named Quinn across a driveway and detained him for  over an hour. Apparently, they thought he didn't move out of their way  fast enough. It is hard to imagine--it has been reported in  publications, in the Oregonian and the like--how anyone could see Quinn  as a threat.

As he put it: I think they wanted to make a point, so they picked the  weakest person they could find and made a big show about it.

What Donald Trump and the Vice President are offering us is, indeed,  an authoritarian playbook: Attack the weakest in order to intimidate  the rest of us. That is why it is the obligation of all Americans to  pay attention to all of the discussions on this topic and to speak out  and not yield. The American abolitionists told me that eternal  vigilance is the price of liberty to keep the powerful from stealing  from the many for the few.

Senator Merkley, I am interested in what you think Americans should  do to secure the benefits of liberty for themselves and their families  and future generations and what do you want Americans to take from your  speech today?

Mr. WYDEN. That is correct.

Mr. WYDEN. Senator Merkley, you have said it very well.

It seems to me America is the last bastion of liberty in the world.  There is nowhere to flee to, no mighty republic that stands if American  democracy fails.

I want to commend my partner from Oregon for taking this  exceptionally important stand. This is a message, particularly for all  of America, and it is high time it be made on the Senate floor, and I  commend my colleague.

Mr. WYDEN. I know you have to ask permission. I just want to say that  today has been an extraordinary day for Oregon and for the country. We  look forward to continuing this discussion. And would the Senator  yield?

Mr. WYDEN. Would the Senator be willing to continue this discussion  in the days ahead? Because I think this has been extraordinary. It has  begun to lay out the implications of what this is really all about in  terms of authoritarianism. It is important for our State. It is an  important debate for the country.

Would the Senator be willing to carry out further kind of  discussions? And it might not necessarily be here on the floor of the  Senate, but elsewhere as well?

Mr. WYDEN. My colleague has richly earned a few hours of sleep  tonight, but I am going to make sure that here in the Senate and across  the country, people understand that this is the beginning of further  discussion, not the end.

I want to thank my colleague for taking this time today to play out  what this is really all about in terms of this issue.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696341/trump-administration,2025-10-21,2025-W43
Democrat,Morgan McGarvey,Entrepreneurs with Disabilities Reporting Act of 2025,"Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1621, the  Entrepreneurs with Disabilities Reporting Act of 2025.

As vice ranking member of the House Committee on Small Business, I am  proud to partner with Congressman Stauber, who has done incredible work  in this area to support Americans with disabilities and help to ensure  that every American has the same opportunity to become a successful  entrepreneur.

Mr. Speaker, this is, after all, the fundamental promise of the  American Dream: that any person in this country can work hard, take  risks, and hopefully find success.

Yet, Americans with disabilities, like other underprivileged groups,  see fewer opportunities to make their entrepreneurial dream a reality.  There are 44 million people with disabilities in the United States. In  my home State of Kentucky, approximately 18 percent of people have a  disability. Yet, people with disabilities make up just 6 percent of our  Nation's small business owners. We have to change that.

Far too often, entrepreneurs with disabilities encounter significant  barriers, both physical and intangible, when starting their own  business, including having a harder time getting bank loans and start- up investments, inadequate support services, and insufficient outreach  from Federal programs. We know this is just the tip of the iceberg and  that more barriers exist.

Today, nearly 2 million small businesses are owned by people with  disabilities, but there could be so many more. Here is how: by  improving the public programs that serve differently abled individuals  and implementing policies that make work and entrepreneurship more  accessible, providing accommodations, tackling ableism, and the list  goes on.

Mr. Speaker, to pull this off, our bill would require SBA to conduct  a comprehensive study of the resources that are available to  entrepreneurs with disabilities, examine their effectiveness, and  determine what actions need to be taken to help support these  entrepreneurs.

By conducting this report, SBA will have the opportunity to revisit  the effectiveness of their programs to ensure that our government  better serves people with disabilities who want to start their own  small business.

This bill came together in a way that I think the Founders might have  envisioned. Last Congress, the Committee on Small Business heard from  my constituent Cody Clark, a small business owner, a disabilities  rights advocate, and I think the only person who has ever performed a  magic trick in front of our committee.

He testified on the challenges that entrepreneurs with disabilities  face based on his experience as an entrepreneur with autism, and this  bill was born from his insight and experience.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting this critical legislation for Cody and for every other  American with their own entrepreneurial dream, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Chairman Williams and Ranking  Member Velazquez, for this incredible work and, as Mr. Stauber said,  allowing us to work together in this way.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Stauber for his incredible work in this area  and for his willingness to advocate for so many Americans, including  his own child. It takes tremendous strength and courage. I thank the  gentleman for working with me specifically on this important bipartisan  piece of legislation to ensure that this Congress and the SBA do right  by Americans with disabilities.

Mr. Speaker, entrepreneurship is the hallmark of the American Dream.  It is who we are--a land of opportunity for all. This bill takes a  commonsense, bipartisan step toward improving government services for  entrepreneurs with disabilities.

By requiring the SBA to assess current programs and identify  challenges and barriers that entrepreneurs with disabilities face, we  lay the groundwork for a better, more inclusive society and economy.

Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. If we can  make it easier for more people to start a small business, we will all  benefit.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1621, and I  yield back the balance of my time.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691755/entrepreneurs-with-disabilities-reporting-act-of-2025,2025-06-03,2025-W23
Democrat,Bobby Scott,Empowering Employer Child and Elder Care Solutions Act,"Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2270, the Empowering  Employer Child and Elder Care Solutions Act. Unfortunately, it doesn't  solve anything. It doesn't provide any additional child or elder care.

What it does is take money out of people's pockets because, under  current law, employers must pay hourly workers time and a half for  hours worked over 40 hours in a week. That overtime rate is based on a  worker's regular rate of pay, which includes not only the cash payment  but also non-wage compensation and presently includes the value of  child or dependent care services when employers decide to provide them  as part of the benefit package.

Existing law already provides incentives for these benefits, allowing  employers to deduct them as a cost of doing business and offering tax  preferences for certain child and dependent care assistance.

This bill would change the Fair Labor Standards Act to exclude the  value of these services from the regular rate used to calculate  overtime.

Despite its name, the bill does not require employers to provide any  child or elder care. Instead, it just reduces the cost of overtime if  they provide it. That is the problem. In practice, this bill encourages  employers to keep workers on the job longer rather than expanding  access to affordable care. It increases the time away from families  while offering no assurance that any support for childcare will be  provided. Workers who already receive these benefits will see their  overtime pay reduced.

There is no evidence that these workers who do not receive this  benefit are likely to get the benefit. The only group we know for  certain will be affected is those who already have it, and they will  lose money on overtime. That makes no sense. I don't know how that  solves anything.

I would hope that we would not reduce workers' pay. To do that, we  have to oppose the legislation.

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.  Lee), who is a distinguished member  of the Committee on Education and Workforce.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage people to support the motion to recommit,  which would actually create childcare availability.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the AFL-CIO which  says, in part: `` . . . there is no evidence that reducing the overtime  rate for employees will spur a widespread willingness of employers to  offer reimbursement for child or elder care.''                                     AFL-CIO, Legislative Alert,                                                   January 12, 2026.

Dear Representative: On behalf of the 15 million workers       and 64 affiliate unions represented by the AFL-CIO, I urge       you to oppose the following anti-worker bills scheduled for       consideration on the House floor this week: the Flexibility       for Workers Education Act (H.R. 2262), the Empowering       Employer Child and Elder Care Solutions Act (H.R. 2270), and       the Tipped Employee Protection Act (H.R. 2312).

H.R. 2262, Flexibility for Workers Education Act, would let       employers require workers to attend job-related training       without paying them for that time. The bill allows employers       to label training as ``voluntary,'' even when workers feel       pressured to attend to keep their jobs or advance, and       removes current protections that ensure training closely tied       to a worker's job is paid. As a result, employers could push       essential training outside of regular work hours and off the       clock, increasing unpaid work for low-wage workers.

H.R. 2270, Empowering Employer Child and Elder Care       Solutions Act, would exclude from the calculation of an       employee's regular wage rate any employer reimbursement for       child or elder care when calculating an employee's overtime       rate of pay. Under this bill, employees who receive these       reimbursements would see their overtime wage rate cut.       Reducing a worker's overtime earnings will not help them       afford the cost of child or elder care. Instead, it will make       life harder. And there is no evidence that reducing the       overtime rate for employees will spur a widespread       willingness of employers to offer reimbursement for child or       elder care. Workers need both decent wages and access to       affordable child and elder care. There are ways to achieve       the latter without attacking the former.

H.R. 2312, the Tipped Employee Protection Act, would change       federal wage law in a way that makes pay more unstable for       many low-wage workers by allowing employers to treat almost       any worker as a ``tipped employee'' if they receive even       small or occasional tips over a time period the employer       chooses, whether that is a single day or an entire month.       This could allow employers to pay the tipped subminimum wage       to workers such as baristas, hotel staff, delivery drivers,       salon workers, stadium staff, and other service workers who       do not regularly earn tips. For example, a worker who waits       tables would be paid the full minimum wage for non-tipped       cooking shifts, but under this bill the employer could       average tips earned earlier in the week and use them to       justify paying $2.13 an hour for cooking shifts as well,       which would cut weekly pay. By weakening existing rules that       limit when the tip credit can be used, the bill would result       in reduced take-home pay for workers, give employers greater       control over how workers are classified and paid, make it       harder for workers to know if they are being paid correctly,       and increase the risk of wage theft in industries where it is       already common.

Collectively, these bills nickel and dime workers' pay at a       time when so many struggle to afford the basics. Wages should       be raised, not cut. Please vote no on H.R. 2262, H.R. 2270,       and H.R. 2312.            Sincerely,                                                     Jody Calemine,                                      Director, Government Affairs.

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, this bill does nothing to solve,  as I said, the elder or childcare crisis in this country. It does not  create affordable care, and it does not guarantee a single new benefit  for working families.

What it does do is reduce overtime pay for workers who already  receive these benefits while encouraging employers to keep people at  work longer without fully paid compensation. That means more time away  from loved ones, less money in workers' pockets, and probably more need  for childcare.

If we are serious about supporting families, then Congress should be  expanding access to affordable care, not cutting wages under the guise  of helping workers. We could really do some help by supporting the  motion to recommit and passing the Child Care for Working Families Act.  That would actually lower costs for families and create childcare  opportunities.

Mr. Speaker, I hope we would support the motion to recommit, and I  yield back the balance of my time.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699005/empowering-employer-child-and-elder-care-solutions-act,2026-01-13,2026-W03
Republican,Julie Fedorchak,Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Environmental Protection Agency Relating to ``Review of Final Rule Reclassification of Major Sources As Area Sources Under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act'',"Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my  resolution to repeal the Biden administration's eleventh hour  reinstatement of the ``once in, always in'' rule and to counter some of  the misinformation being shared on this rule by my colleagues on the  other side.

I am a mom of three. When my kids were growing up, they woke up every  Saturday morning to a job list, and they couldn't get their allowance  until they completed the jobs on the list. They were motivated to get  their jobs done by that allowance, and I would have had very little  luck incentivizing them to do their jobs if they never received their  promised reward.

This is a law of human nature. People respond to incentives and  rewards, which underscores the main problem with the ``once in, always  in'' rule. There is no incentive to invest.

This misguided regulation permanently classifies certain industrial  facilities as major sources, major sources of hazardous air pollutants  even after they have made significant investments to reduce the  emissions below the Federal threshold.

Mr. Speaker, think about that for a minute. They invest millions of  dollars to modernize their operations, improve efficiency, and reduce  emissions only for the Federal Government to permanently classify their  business as a major source, stuck with the same costly regulations.

That is not smart policy. That is counterproductive. By refusing to  let businesses reclassify after making progress, after meeting the  standards, this rule removes any real incentive to invest in cleaner  technologies.

Our energy producers in North Dakota have invested $2 billion in  emissions control technology. They have done this because they care  about our communities and environment. In fact, North Dakota exports  thousands of megawatts of electricity every year.

We are the third largest oil- and gas-producing State in the Nation,  and we are one of only four States in the Nation that has never  violated Federal air quality standards. That is not an accident. That  is the result of smart investments, cutting-edge technology, and a  commitment to responsible energy production.

North Dakota is proof that we can grow the economy, power the  country, and protect the environment at the same time.

This bureaucratic rule ignores these successful efforts. It removes  the incentive to innovate and locks facilities into restrictive  regulations, even when they are trying to reduce emissions and operate  more efficiently.

It is not just a problem for North Dakota. This rule affects  manufacturers, energy producers, and small businesses all over the  country. This approach raises costs, discourages innovation, and forces  companies to think twice before making long-term investments in cleaner  technologies.

This is not how to build a stronger economy or a cleaner future, and  it is not how to make things more affordable for Americans.

Our Nation's energy future should be driven by innovation. American  technological innovation have allowed us to reduce emissions more than  any other Nation since 2005, all while achieving record energy  production.

We need a regulatory framework that incentivizes innovation and  rewards it when it happens. That means eliminating one-size-fits-all  regulations like the ``once in, always in'' rule.

Supporting this resolution means supporting American energy jobs,  lower prices, and fostering a regulatory environment where businesses  can thrive while safeguarding the environment.

I want to underscore that this resolution is not about allowing  facilities to maintain high pollutant levels. It is about incentivizing  them to reduce emissions and rewarding them when they do. That is how  we both expand energy production and protect our environment.

I thank Senator  John Curtis of Utah for his leadership on this  resolution in the Senate, and I urge my colleagues in the House to  support this resolution.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691597/providing-for-congressional-disapproval-of-the-rule-submitted-by-the-environmental-protection-agency-relating-to-review-of-final-rule-reclassification-of-major-sources-as-area-sources-under-section-112-of-the-clean-air-act,2025-05-21,2025-W21

Republican,Mike Ezell,Controlled Substance Onboard Vessels,"Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2351) to direct the Commandant of the Coast Guard to update the  policy of the Coast Guard regarding the use of medication to treat drug  overdose, and for other purposes.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2351

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ONBOARD VESSELS.

Section 70503(a) of title 46, United States Code, is       amended--

(1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1) by striking       ``While on board a covered vessel, an'' and inserting ``An'';

(2) by amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:

(d) Memorandum of Understanding.--Not later than 1 year       after the earlier of the date of enactment of this Act or the       date on which the tracking system established under section       706 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2024 (10 U.S.C. 1090 note) is established, the Secretary of       the department in which the Coast Guard is operating when not       operating as a service in the Navy and the Secretary of       Defense shall finalize a memorandum of understanding to       facilitate Coast Guard access such tracking system.

(e) Briefing.--

(1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Commandant shall provide the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House       of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science,       and Transportation of the Senate a briefing on the use, by       members and personnel of the Coast Guard at Coast Guard       facilities, onboard Coast Guard assets, and during Coast       Guard operations, of--

(A) naloxone or other similar medication to treat opioid,       including fentanyl, overdoses; and

(B) opioids, including fentanyl.

(2) Elements.--The briefing required under paragraph (1)       shall include the following:

(A) A description of--

(i) the progress made in the implementation of the updated       policy required under subsection (a);

(ii) the prevalence and incidence of the illegal use of       fentanyl and other controlled substances in the Coast Guard       during the 5-year period preceding the briefing;

(iii) processes of the Coast Guard to mitigate substance       abuse in the Coast Guard, particularly with respect to       fentanyl; and

(iv) the status of the memorandum of understanding required       under subsection (d).

(B) For the 5-year period preceding the briefing, a review       of instances in which naloxone or other similar medication       was used to treat opioid, including fentanyl, overdoses at a       Coast Guard facility, onboard a Coast Guard asset, or during       a Coast Guard operation.

(f) Privacy.--In carrying out the requirements of this       section, the Commandant shall ensure compliance with all       applicable privacy law, including section 552a of title 5,       United States Code (commonly referred to as the ``Privacy       Act''), and the privacy regulations promulgated under section       264(c) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability       Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d-2 note).

(g) Rule of Construction.--For purposes of the availability       requirement under subsection (b), with respect to a Coast       Guard installation comprised of multiple Coast Guard       facilities or units, naloxone or other similar medication       available at a single Coast Guard facility within the       installation shall be considered to be available to all Coast       Guard facilities or units on the installation if appropriate       arrangements are in place to ensure access, at all times       during operations, to the naloxone or other similar       medication contained within such single Coast Guard facility.

Mr. EZELL.  2351.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2351 directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to  update the services policy regarding use of medication to treat drug  overdoses.

This bill also strengthens the Coast Guard's ability to go after drug  traffickers and respond to opioid overdoses. H.R. 2351 amends the  Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, removing ambiguities in the current  law which prohibits the prosecution of cases involving unmanned or  autonomous vessels. This bill will therefore ensure that drug  traffickers responsible can be charged, tried, and convicted.

Mr. Speaker, I thank T&I Committee member, Representative McDowell,  for his leadership on this bipartisan legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 2351, and I reserve the balance  of my time.

Mr. Speaker, this bill will ensure drug traffickers face justice as  they employ new technology and methods to flood our country with  dangerous drugs. It will also give the Coast Guard the parity to police  other armed services with regard to rapid treatment of drug overdoses,  keeping guardsmen safe from accidental exposure.

H.R. 2351 implements changes that will help secure our maritime  border and increase safety on our seas.

Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692169/controlled-substance-onboard-vessels,2025-06-09,2025-W24
Democrat,André Carson,Reintroduction of the Justice for Shireen Act,"Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to reintroduce the Justice for  Shireen Act today. I thank my House Colleagues who joined me in calling  for a report to Congress from the FBI and State Department, in  consultation with the Attorney General, Secretary of Defense and  Director of National Intelligence, on the death of American-Palestinian  Journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh. I send my deep condolences to the Abu  Akleh family for this terrible killing and continue to stand with them  to demand justice and accountability.

Shireen Abu Akleh, an American-Palestinian Journalist, was killed on  May 11, 2022. She was killed while wearing a clearly marked press vest  on assignment, reporting on a military raid that took place in the  Israeli occupied city of Jenin. Shortly after her death, I led a  letter, signed by 58 Members of Congress, to the FBI and State  Department calling for an independent and open investigation led by her  home country, the United States, and 24 Senators have echoed this  request. More than three years later, and we still do not have answers.  It is imperative that Congress receives the information needed to  conduct the necessary oversight. We must ensure no taxpayer dollars  contribute to human rights violations or anyone's death--most  especially an American abroad.

As an American, Ms. Abu Akleh was entitled to the full protections  afforded to U.S. citizens living abroad. As Members of Congress, we  need to uphold the values that our nation was founded on, including  human rights, equality for all, freedom of speech, and freedom of the  press. As Members of Congress, we have a duty to protect Americans  reporting abroad. An Israeli investigation was concluded, finding that  it was indeed an Israel Solider who shot Ms. Abu Akleh in her line of  duty. It is the responsibility of the U.S. to learn all the unanswered  questions leading up to, during and after the fatal shot that killed  Ms. Abu Akleh. Additionally, this bill requires an identification of  any United States defense materials or services that were implicated in  the death of Ms. Abu Akleh. No U.S. weapons or military services by the  U.S. should be used to kill Americans on foreign soil. American  taxpayers should not be paying for any violation of human rights  abroad.

Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in calling for justice  and accountability for Shireen Abu Akleh.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699427/reintroduction-of-the-justice-for-shireen-act,2026-01-30,2026-W05

Republican,Marsha Blackburn,"Providing for Congressional Disapproval Under Chapter 8 of Title United States Code, of the Rule Submitted By the Internal Revenue Service Relating to ``Gross Proceeds Reporting By Brokers That Regularly Provide Services Effectuating Digital Asset Sales''--","Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, last November, the American people  returned President Donald Trump to the Oval Office with a mandate to  restore common sense in government, and in many ways, this common sense  was most needed on the issue of protecting women and girls.

After 4 years where President Biden waged a war on women's sports,  the message from voters was clear: no more biological men competing in  women's athletics, no more stolen records and medals, and no more  invasions of privacy, humiliation, and harm for our Nation's incredible  female athletes.

To be certain, President Trump has delivered on the mandate. On  Inauguration Day, the President issued an Executive order that affirms  the Federal Government's position that there are only two sexes, male  and female.

This is a position grounded in biological reality, not gender  ideology. Last month, the President also signed an Executive order that  bans biological males from competing in women's sports.

It was an honor to join President Trump at the signing ceremony along  with the brave young women and girls who have spoken out for fairness,  safety, equal opportunity, including one of those female athletes,  Tennessee's Riley Gaines.

The terms of the order are simple: If you allow men to compete in  women's athletics, you will lose your Federal funding.

To no one's surprise, the order is getting results. Right after  President Trump signed it, the NCAA, which oversees more than 530,000  student athletes, announced that it would comply with the order.

For more than a decade, the Nation's largest athletic association  allowed men to compete in women's events. It will be a top priority of  mine to ensure that this injustice never happens again and that the  NCAA will fully adhere to the Executive order.

While the vast majority of States are complying, there are some  States, blue States like California and Maine, that are vowing to fight  President Trump over the order.

The message they are sending is clear: Democrats are willing to risk  millions in Federal funding for schools to uphold their radical, far- left ideology that claims there are no differences between men and  women.

The American people know better, and so do the more than 3 million  female high school and college athletes who deserve every single  opportunity to succeed. They work hard; they train hard; they set their  goals; they compete; and they work to succeed.

To celebrate all of these incredible accomplishments from these 3  million high school and college athletes, I am asking for unanimous  consent for my resolution to establish October 10--the 10th month, 10th  day--recognized by the Roman numerals XX, like the female sex  chromosome, as American Girls in Sports Day, setting aside a day to  recognize the accomplishments of 3 million high school and college  female athletes.

In addition to celebrating female athletes, this resolution calls on  sports governing bodies across the country to protect women and girls  in sports. There is absolutely zero reason for Senate Democrats to  oppose this resolution, and here is the reason why: We have a New York  Times Ipsos poll that tells the story on this. Seventy-nine percent of  the American people, including 67 percent of Democrats, want to make  certain that female sports are for girls and women. Those numbers--67  percent of Democrats, 79 percent of all Americans--say they are with  us.

They want to protect women and girls in sports. They want to make  certain that they have the right to compete, the right to train, the  right to do team building, and the right to succeed and be recognized  for it.

Res. 21; further, that  the resolution be agreed to; the preamble be agreed to; and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.

Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I find my colleague's comments so very  interesting, and I think it would have served him well to actually read  the resolution. So I am going to read part of it so that my colleagues  know what this does because it does talk about celebrating these  athletes.

Here you go:

Whereas athletic participation has an important, positive       impact on young girls, improving their physical health, self-      confidence, and discipline;

Whereas women have been responsible for some of the       greatest athletic feats in the sports history of the United       States, from the Olympic games to professional competition;

He wanted to make certain that some of these greats like Pat Summitt  and our Lady Vols are recognized. Absolutely. That is what we are  doing:

Whereas female athletes have served as inspirations for       generations of women and girls;

And then we talk about title IX. We talk about:

Whereas there are fundamental biological differences       between men and women that put women at a competitive       disadvantage in sports and jeopardize their safety during       competition;

And 79 percent of the American people agree with this.

Then we go through:

Whereas, since 2003, biological men have displaced women       and girls from 950 championship titles, medals, scholarships,       and records they should have rightly won, including at least       28 women's sports titles in volleyball, swimming, mountain       biking, track and field, weightlifting, and cycling.

We look at the policies that have been enacted to protect women and  the imperative to make certain they are athletically protected and then  setting up October 10 as the day that would be American Girls in Sports  Day and continuing to recognize that year after year.

Now, my colleague from Connecticut probably knows that this issue of  protecting women and girls in sports is very, very popular in  Connecticut. One of Connecticut's biggest track stars is a Conrad High  School senior there, a male-to-female athlete who holds the State's top  2023-2024 rankings in the girls outdoor high jump, long jump, and  triple jump according to athletic.net.

Then you look at--there are two individuals, two boys who identify as  female, they competed on a Connecticut high school track team from 2017  to 2020, and there were--and I want to be sure we look at what this  does to girls who are trying to compete. This is why this issue is so  popular.

Here are the stats. There were 93 times when a girl was denied an  individual or relay championship because of these two male athletes who  were competing as females--93 times. A girl who had trained, who had  worked out, who sought to win, to represent her team--they were denied  because two boys were competing as females. Ninety-three times.

There were 52 times when a girl was denied the advancement to a  championship meet. Now, think about that. We all have children. We know  the heartbreak when someone has trained and trained and trained, not  just for days or weeks or months but for years, and they are denied the  ability to move forward because there is a boy competing in a female  category.

There were 39 times when a girl was denied an opportunity to advance  to finals, 17 times when a girl was denied an All-New England honor, 11  times when a girl lost a meet record, and 23 girls--23--were denied a  Connecticut State Open team championship.

In other words, allowing these two boys to compete as females and  compete against girls denied girls opportunities and awards 235 times.  That is one State.

So I would remind my colleagues they are on the wrong side of this  issue. Seventy-nine percent of the American people say it is wrong for  men to compete in women's athletics. Sixty-seven percent of Democrats  say it is wrong to have men compete in women's athletics.

It is lost opportunity. It is lost recognition. It is lost success  for women.

What ever happened to people on the left that supported women's  rights, women's safety, supported title IX? Obviously, they have thrown  it to the wayside.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688449/providing-for-congressional-disapproval-under-chapter-8-of-title-united-states-code-of-the-rule-submitted-by-the-internal-revenue-service-relating-to-gross-proceeds-reporting-by-brokers-that-regularly-provide-services-effectuating-digital-asset-sales,2025-03-04,2025-W10
Democrat,Chuck Schumer,Social Security,"Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on Social Security, a few days ago, Vice  President JD Vance claimed that 40 percent of people calling to get  their Social Security ``are committing fraud''--40 percent. First, it  was Elon Musk calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme. Then Donald Trump  spent 10 minutes in his congressional address talking about checks to  150-year-olds, which we all know is a lie. And now the Vice President  has picked up the ax and is coming for Social Security too.

We need to be very clear: What the Vice President said was malicious  disinformation. His statement is factually incorrect. In the words of  the Washington Post, it is ``absurdity on its face--the kind of twisted  logic that turns up at the end of a long game of telephone tag.''

Well, we all know what game they are playing. Donald Trump and his  inner circle are howling about fraud with the hopes of discrediting  Social Security entirely. Never mind there is no rampant fraud within  Social Security; they just want to cut people's benefits. Never mind  that it is popular--overwhelmingly popular--with Democrats,  Republicans, liberals, conservatives, rural people, suburban people,  urban people.

Why are they doing this, then? Why are they going after something  that has been as sacred as Social Security since Franklin Roosevelt put  the program together? Why? It is simple: So they can cut taxes for the  rich.

This is a heist. If JD Vance had any intellectual honesty, he would  acknowledge he was wrong when he said ``40 percent of the people who  are calling are actually committing fraud,'' but I am not holding my  breath.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689776/social-security,2025-04-08,2025-W15
Democrat,Shontel Brown,Northeast Ohioans Are Getting Squeezed,"Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I have just come back from our  district work period in northeast Ohio, and let me tell you, Madam  Speaker, there is nothing better than being home being in our churches,  in our union halls, and our community centers listening to the people I  serve.

Let me tell you what I heard, Madam Speaker. It was crystal clear.  People are getting squeezed.

Groceries--a very old fashioned word--are too expensive. Gas is too  expensive. Housing is way too expensive, and Trump's chaos and  corruption are making it all worse.

I heard how tariffs are jacking up prices, crushing small businesses,  and threatening workers. I heard how the one big, ugly bill is about to  make utility bills, student loans, and grocery costs skyrocket, all to  give the richest Americans more tax breaks.

I heard how the President's cancellation of community safety funding  will make our neighborhoods less safe, and I heard how his attacks on  unions at the VA and FEMA will ripple right into the private sector,  hurting working men and women everywhere.

Donald Trump's latest stunt, firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa  Cook, is illegal, reckless, and a straight-up power grab designed to  give him control of the Fed and raise costs for families.

An independent Federal Reserve is the bedrock of American prosperity.  If you undermine it, retirement savings vanish, mortgage rates climb,  and life gets more expensive for everyone.

Madam Speaker, this is bigger than economics. This is about freedom.  Take a look around our country. We have military patrols in American  cities, political investigations of the President's critics, mass  detentions without due process, Federal agents hidden behind masks,  museums ordered to rewrite history, the government bullying private  companies and universities, and banners of the President's face that  would even make Kim Jong-un blush.

This is a toxic agenda, and the President knows it. That is why he is  changing the rules in the middle of the game. Need I remind you, 4  years ago, he demanded Georgia find him votes? Now, he is demanding red  States find him more seats in Congress.

All this for what? So Donald Trump can enrich himself and his  billionaire allies while everyday, hardworking Americans pay the bill.

I just have to ask, Madam Speaker: Where are the so-called  constitutional conservatives? Will even one of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle find the courage to stand up? Have they not  learned that cowering before this man only works until he decides you  are expendable?

It may be easy to look away when people are without welfare status,  when they suffer, or when people you don't like are targeted, fired, or  erased. It may be easy when the victims live in places like Cleveland,  Chicago, or Washington, but be clear: It never ends there.

As a Black woman, I know who the cruel and oppressive executive  orders and policies punish first, but I also know this: Once it starts,  everyone is punished.

This is the moment to defend our economy, to defend our Constitution,  and to defend our freedoms and elections.

Madam Speaker, let me close with this. Last week, President Trump  said: I have the right to do anything I want to do. I am the President  of the United States.

He said it and laid it on the table in plain sight for all of us to  see. He wants no checks, no balances, not from the courts, not from  Congress, and not from the voters.

It is time to wake up, America, before it is too late.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694808/northeast-ohioans-are-getting-squeezed,,

Democrat,Gregory Meeks,Made-In-America Defense Act,"Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4216. This bill directs the  Department of State to conduct an annual review in consultation with  the Department of Defense of what weapons and technologies can be moved  from the FMS-only list to be eligible for direct commercial sales.

It also requires helpful reporting to Congress on the process and  evaluation of these changes. Importantly, it does not modify or  undermine Congress' oversight or visibility into the proposed arms  transfers.

The context behind this bill is very important. Our country provides  defense articles and services to our allies and partners via foreign  military sales, often abbreviated to ``FMS.'' U.S. FMS cases offer a  unique approach, which include not only the most capable military  platforms to our friends but what historically has been known as the  total-package approach.

This refers to the fact that the United States, via FMS sales,  provides not only the military hardware itself, but a total package  that includes training, repairs, and maintenance support, as well as  capacity building for that nation's military.

Our adversaries, quite simply, do not and often cannot provide both  such exquisite technologies but also the whole suite of support that  comes with them. The advanced technology, as well as the total-package  approach and our diplomatic influence, values, and position sets us  apart.

While FMS transfers are fit for many cases and situations, some  foreign partners have sought to expand their defense purchases via  greater direct commercial sales from U.S. firms. While these steps need  to be taken carefully, the review required by this bill is a smart step  in the right direction which I support.

This legislation provides a useful directive while maintaining  congressional prerogatives and oversight over armed sales. I hope that  all of my colleagues will join me and support this bill.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694810/made-in-america-defense-act,,
Republican,Robert Aderholt,Recognizing the Tombigbee Electric Cooperative's Achievements,"Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight the completion  of Tombigbee Electric Cooperative's commitment to bring reliable, high- speed fiber internet access to more than 100,000 residents in Northwest  Alabama.

Tombigbee Electric Cooperative was established to meet the need for  electricity among citizens in the rural areas of Northwest Alabama.  Since its founding in 1941, Tombigbee has demonstrated an unwavering  dedication to serving its community and strengthening the area it  surrounds. Over the decades, the cooperative has provided safe and  provide safe and reliable electric power and fiber-to-the-home  internet.

In 2017, Tombigbee Electric Cooperative set forth an ambitious goal  to provide high-quality, high-speed internet service to 100,000 people  across Northwest Alabama. Today, that goal has been achieved.

Through the installation of more than 4,200 miles of fiber and a  total investment of $145 million, made possible by $37 million in state  and federal grants, as well as a $100 million investment by the  cooperative itself, Tombigbee Electric Cooperative has delivered on its  promise to bridge the digital divide for rural Alabamians.

Mr. Speaker, this milestone represents more than the completion of a  project, it signifies a lasting investment in the prosperity and  potential of rural communities. Thousands of citizens will now reap the  benefits of this achievement, including expanded educational  opportunities, strengthened economic development, improved access to  health care, and an enhanced quality of life for countless families and  businesses.

Tombigbee Electric Cooperative has demonstrated that when vision,  leadership, and commitment to community are combined, meaningful  progress can be made.

This accomplishment serves as a reminder that rural America must  never be left behind. I commend Tombigbee Electric Cooperative for its  steadfast dedication and leadership, and I look forward to seeing the  continued benefits this investment will bring to the people of  Northwest Alabama.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696050/recognizing-the-tombigbee-electric-cooperatives-achievements,2025-10-06,2025-W41
Democrat,Maggie Hassan,Support for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025,"Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pass into law a lifesaving  bipartisan legislation that will enable us to keep fighting the opioid  and fentanyl epidemic, an epidemic that has destroyed families and  devastated communities all across our country.

Our country faces many challenges, and I am sure we will continue to  debate in the coming weeks how to address those, but today we will  advance, on a bipartisan basis, lifesaving legislation that we know is  working to combat fentanyl.

New data from earlier this summer found that drug overdose deaths  dropped 27 percent last year, compared to the prior year. Since the  advent of the opioid crisis, we now have a much better sense of what  works to prevent and treat addiction, the resources we need to do so,  and the light that exists on the other end of this terrible tunnel. But  we can only get there if we keep up the fight.

The SUPPORT Act of 2018, signed into law by President Trump during  his first term, established vital addiction treatment infrastructure.  Reauthorizing this bipartisan law is essential to our addiction  prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts. For example, the act  includes funding for addiction treatment for pregnant women and funds  for training and equipment to help first responders in this fight.

The original SUPPORT Act passed the Senate with 98 votes, and this  bipartisan reauthorization passed the House with 366 votes.

Now the Senate will send it to the President's desk.

While we have made progress in this fight, we cannot be complacent.  While there are still too many families and communities ravaged by  addiction, we cannot despair. Nothing less than people's lives depend  on us acting.

2483 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.

Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, the Senate just passed a major bipartisan  package to reauthorize the SUPPORT Act, and it is headed to President  Trump's desk. Today is proof that despite our differences, bipartisan  progress is possible.

I am particularly pleased to be here with my colleague and chair of  the HELP Committee Senator Cassidy, who has been instrumental in this  fight and who will speak in just a moment.

To our first responders, know that training and equipment are coming  to help make your job easier.

To our healthcare providers, know that resources are coming to help  people get and stay in recovery.

To those battling addiction, know that support is on the way.

I am deeply grateful to a number of my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle, and I am looking forward to Senator Cassidy's comments just  now. I am also grateful to Senator Sanders for working with me on  getting this done as well as the advocates who knew we could not give  up in this fight.

This package will save lives, and I look forward to continuing to  make available every tool we have to stop fentanyl.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695792/support-for-patients-and-communities-reauthorization-act-of-2025,,

Democrat,Richard Blumenthal,Healthcare,"Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, as everyone in this Chamber knows and  everyone in our great Nation knows, we are in the midst of a healthcare  crisis. Now, the word ``crisis'' probably is the most overused term in  the political lexicon, but the American people know that this crisis is  real and urgent because they know, if you don't have your health, you  don't have anything. That old saying epitomizes the importance of  healthcare when it affects our children, who can't get healthcare for  themselves; our seniors, who also depend on others; and everyday  Americans across the country, who are at their kitchen tables tonight  or at their workplaces or are with their families, wondering: When will  it happen? When will I get sick, not just with a virus or the common  cold? When will there be a healthcare crisis for me?

And it happens to everybody. Nobody is invincible. Everybody needs  healthcare, and it should be regarded as a human right.

We face an imminent and real and present crisis right now for  millions of Americans who will no longer be able to afford healthcare  insurance, beginning in days or weeks, because premiums are  skyrocketing. They will rise by double or triple what they are now.  Insurance companies are already raising premium rates. Americans are  beginning a period of open enrollment. In Connecticut, it begins on  November 1, when they will have to make choices--literally, in effect,  writing checks to insurance companies and saying: I am going to afford  this plan. But many Americans will find no plan affordable if we fail  to provide for them an extension of the healthcare tax credit that has  enabled them to afford health insurance up to now under a measure that  we passed and the President signed.

My Republican colleagues continue to ignore the needs and interests  of the American people by blocking our efforts to fix this imminent,  immediate crisis. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives is  out of town, the President is out of touch in Asia, and we are left  with the clock ticking. Time is not on our side.

Let's be very clear. Republicans control the House of  Representatives, which hasn't shown up to work in over a month, but  they continue to be paid; Republicans control the Senate; and maybe  most importantly, the Republicans control the White House. This  government shutdown is happening on President Trump's watch. It is on  him. These skyrocketing healthcare costs are happening on his watch  too.

Instead of fighting for the American people, President Trump and  Republicans have spent the past year seeking to strip millions of  Americans of healthcare, food assistance, student loan support, and  much more that is vital to their quality of life and, for many of them,  their very survival.

Democrats have been sounding the alarm over the ongoing threats to  healthcare and the impact it will have on every American, but  Republicans seemingly--I say ``seemingly''--refuse to listen. I think  they are listening but are in denial because instead of working with  Democrats to prevent Americans from being crushed by impending medical  debt, Republicans have wasted valuable time blocking every single  Democratic effort to lower costs for families.

To be clear, if Republicans refuse to join Democrats in protecting  the American people from massive increases in their healthcare costs,  millions of people will suffer, and healthcare premiums will rise to  incomprehensible levels.

Just this week, Connecticut launched a window-shopping tool that  allows residents to preview their healthcare options for next year. It  allows consumers to see how costs compare to next year's costs. Very  frankly, the options are preposterous.

For example, a couple in their sixties living in Hartford, CT--our  capital--making $100,000 a year will go from paying $260.38 to  $2,614.60. That is for the same plan. It is an Anthem plan. They are  going from the cost this year of $260.83 to, next year, $2,614.60. By  the way, they are getting nothing more. It is the same plan. There is  no additional coverage, and they are paying over $2,500 more each  month.

It is, in effect, a Republican healthcare tax on a family in their  sixties making $100,000 a year--that is a middle-class family--in  Hartford, CT.

Let me give you another example. A family of four living in Hartford  and making $159,767, roughly $160,000 a year--the average salary for a  family of four in our State--would be forced to pay $1,159.52 more.  They go from $796.65 this year to $1,956.17 next year. I don't know how  they can afford it. The simple answer is, probably they can't. And that  family will be at risk of financial catastrophe without healthcare  insurance coverage.

Already--let me just emphasize, already--healthcare debt is the major  cause of bankruptcy in this country. It hurts our whole economy. So  even if you don't care about a family of four living in Hartford or a  couple in their sixties, even if the humanitarian impacts are  impervious to you, think about the economic consequences. Think about  your pocketbook, not theirs. Bankruptcy will increase along with the  suffering.

These price hikes, the taxes on healthcare, are absolutely absurd and  abhorrent. It is incomprehensible to expect any American enrolled in  one of these plans to have the disposable income necessary to keep  their coverage. This added cost is money that could be used to cover  weeks' worth of groceries, heat, rent, or mortgage.

This added cost is money that many individuals and families simply  don't have. They won't pay these prices because they simply cannot.  Instead, many will be forced to go without health insurance, which  raises the costs for everyone.

Very bluntly, these rates will not just impact people enrolled in the  ACA marketplace. If Republicans have their way, the entire healthcare  system will feel the effects, and every individual trying to receive  care, regardless of what kind of insurance they have, will be impacted.  The ripple effect is coming to you. Even if you don't have an ACA plan,  even if you are paying some part of your employer's insurance cost,  this rising tide will truly lift everybody's boat in terms of costs.

Republicans are making Connecticut families and Americans across the  country choose between affordable healthcare or putting food on the  table or heating their homes this winter or buying clothes for their  kid. It is cruel. It is unnecessary. It will undoubtedly cost people  their health and their lives.

Open enrollment is less than 5 days away now in Connecticut. Time is  not on our side. We have no time to waste. If you don't feel this sense  of urgency, listen to your constituents.

I choose to stand with them--with small business owners, with working  families, with everyday Americans who will be crushed by these costs,  and their futures will be crippled--at least financially.

It is paramount in my mind that Republican colleagues listen to those  constituents, to those small business owners, to those families and  millions of Americans and healthcare professionals who have been  speaking truth to power.

This government shutdown can end tonight if we choose the path  forward to guarantee an extension of the healthcare tax credits and add  it to the government funding measure that is now before this body.

The House of Representatives needs to come back to do its job.  President Trump will come back from Asia. The American people deserve a  real solution that preserves Americans' healthcare.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696436/healthcare,2025-10-28,2025-W44
Democrat,Jim McGovern,"Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendments to H.R. Consolidated Appropriations Act, Providing for Consideration of H.J. Res. Disapproving the Action of the District of Columbia Council in Approving the D.C. Income and Franchise Tax Conformity and Revision Temporary Amendment Act of and Providing for Consideration of H.R. Critical Mineral Dominance Act","Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes and for his riveting presentation,  and I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, before I say a word about the rule or the bills in front  of us, this is the first full day that we have convened since two  Federal officers shot and killed another American citizen in  Minneapolis, Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse who took care of our Nation's  veterans.

Alex was on a public street. He was exercising his First Amendment  rights while filming Federal agents. He was exercising his Second  Amendment rights as a law-abiding, concealed-carry gun owner. He was  doing what any decent person would do: helping a woman off the ground  after she had been shoved down by a Federal officer. For that, he was  punished with death, shot by his own government.

This wasn't an isolated tragedy, Mr. Speaker. It was the second  public killing of an innocent American in Minneapolis tied to Homeland  Security. Renee Good, a mother of three, was shot by ICE on January 7,  mere weeks before the murder of Alex Pretti.

Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission,  named after our former colleague, the only Holocaust survivor to serve  in the United States Congress, I have spent years documenting and  standing up to human rights abuses carried out by authoritarian regimes  against their own people.

Let me say this plainly: A functioning democracy does not execute  people in the street. That is the kind of thing you see in North Korea,  Mr. Speaker, or Iran; not in the United States of America.

It is beyond the pale. In my view, this administration and those at  the Department of Homeland Security, in particular, should not get  another cent until there are some serious actions taken. I personally  believe we should abolish ICE and start all over. At a minimum, there  needs to be some serious, systemic reforms made, which brings us to  today's rule debate.

Over the weekend, the Senate acted on the government funding bills  House Republicans sent them 2 weeks ago, except for a short-term CR  that continues DHS funding at the current levels for the next 1\1/2\  weeks.

I want to be crystal clear about where I stand: I am voting ``no''. I  will not stand by and give any more money to Stephen Miller and Kristi  Noem to bankroll an out-of-control operation that is terrorizing  communities and shredding the Constitution.

We are watching masked, armed agents force their way into homes  without judicial warrants. We are seeing blatant violations of the  Fourth Amendment. We are witnessing agencies act with impunity. We are  hearing about kids getting kidnapped on their way to school and  grandparents dragged from their homes. We are listening as government  officials smear dead Americans as domestic terrorists instead of  answering basic questions about what happened.

Mr. Speaker, I am not interested in business as usual, not for 2 more  weeks, not for 2 more seconds.

A Federal judge recently described ICE's conduct in January as an  extraordinary pattern of defiance of court orders. They said ICE ``has  likely violated more court orders in January 2026 than some Federal  agencies have violated in their entire existence.'' That should give  every single Member of this House pause. It is certainly my red line,  and I think it ought to be a red line for this whole body.

Mr. Speaker, it is not just DHS funding. This package also gives a  massive increase in funding to the Pentagon. Why are we writing a blank  check for the so-called Department of War while this administration  threatens allies, breaks the law, and treats Congress like an  afterthought? Why are we giving Pete Hegseth more money than the  administration even asked for while we get fewer answers, fewer  guardrails, and fewer constraints on reckless action?

On top of all of this, Republicans have jammed in a measure to repeal  D.C.'s new tax law. Let me just tell my colleagues, this would blow a  $600 million hole in D.C.'s budget, over half a billion dollars gone  because Republicans in Congress want to meddle in local governance when  they can't even manage a budget of their own.

I mean, they just added $4 trillion to the national debt in their one  big, ugly bill. Let that sink in. I mean, it is ridiculous. The Mayor  and the chairman of the D.C. Council warned that this would throw a  huge wrench into D.C.'s current tax filing season and force people to  refile their taxes. That is insane.

If this bill becomes law, they would be ripping away D.C.'s new child  tax credit, money that would go directly to families to help them put  food on the table and reduce childhood poverty. Republicans talk a big  game about family values, and then they turn around and take money out  of kids' pockets. It is shameful. By the way--you can't make this stuff  up--this measure had no hearing and no markup. I say, so much for  regular order.

When I asked the Oversight Committee chairman yesterday basic  questions about D.C.'s budget, he had no answers. He had no idea how  big D.C.'s budget is or how much D.C. spends on the Metro, schools, or  infrastructure improvements. He had no idea how much money D.C. raises  in local taxes and how much of a budget shortfall their outrageous bill  would cause. These are the most basic questions  that you could possibly ask about whether to overturn D.C.'s tax law,  and he couldn't answer them. He had no clue.

Let's be honest about what this is. It is powerful people in  Washington telling local communities: Sit down and shut up. We know  better. Then they leave working people to clean up the mess.

The final bill in this rule is another massive giveaway to mining  CEOs and polluters that lets them gut their own regulations. It is the  same pattern. It is the same pattern every single time: more power for  the strong, more pain for the vulnerable, more protection for insiders,  and more excuses for lawlessness. Enough is enough.

Mr. Speaker, I am voting ``no'' on this rule, ``no'' on this  underlying package, and ``no'' on all these bills. I reserve the  balance of my time.

I want to respond to the gentleman from Georgia, who comes down here  with the same old, tired MAGA talking points when it comes to ICE and  Homeland Security.

He comes down here to confuse people, to somehow imply that Democrats  don't want to lock up violent criminals. On the contrary, we do. That  is what we were promised that the worst of the worst would be pursued  and would be held accountable. However, that is not what is happening.  That is not what is happening.

In Minnesota, ICE agents have been intimidating people in hospitals,  forcing hospital management to issue protocols for employees on how to  best engage. Our doctors and nurses ought to be focused on tending to  patients and not dealing with ICE agents. It is despicable. I mean,  agents showed up to a Minnesota hospital with a man who immigrated here  legally. Just 4 hours after his arrest, he had at least eight skull  fractures in addition to life-threatening brain hemorrhages.

When people have exercised their First Amendment rights to protest,  ICE meets them with only more abuse, beating peaceful protesters and  dousing them in pepper spray.

Mr. Speaker, we have all heard by now the horrifying story of Alex  Pretti, an innocent American citizen, an intensive care nurse who was  brutally murdered by Federal agents. This wasn't an isolated incident.  The administration has shot 13 people during immigration enforcement  operations since September.

I am going to say that again, 13 people have been shot by the  Department of Homeland Security. Four of those shootings were fatal.  Those are four people who would be with us today if not for the insane  administration's cruel oppression of our communities. I mean, ICE  agents are not protecting our borders. They are ambushing our  communities, decimating our families, and taking innocent lives.

Mr. Speaker, Republicans nearly tripled ICE's budget last summer with  their big, ugly bill; and all that money ought to be clawed back. As  far as the appropriations package before us, again, I refuse to send  another cent to Stephen Miller or Kristi Noem. She ought to be  impeached, and he ought to be fired immediately. They are undermining  our Constitution, and the Department that they run is murdering  American citizens on the street.

We are hearing about young children being kidnapped. We are hearing  about off-duty police officers being detained by ICE. We are hearing  about ICE going after people because of the color of their skin. That  is what we object to. Let's go after the criminals.

By the way, we are not the party that pardoned all the  insurrectionists on January 6 and said that the slate is clean. By the  way, those people go on to murder innocent people, to rape women, and  molest children.

There is a difference here. We want to go after the violent  criminals, those who have committed terrible crimes. That is what we  were promised, and we were lied to. We have had it.

Mr. Speaker, the Florida man who just spoke characterized the murder  of two Americans by ICE agents as unfortunate. It is not unfortunate.  It is goddamned unacceptable, and everybody should be outraged by that.

He also bragged about the fact that he has been in Congress for 10  months, and the government has been shut down twice. I hate to be the  one to remind the gentleman, but the last time I checked, his party is  in control of everything: the White House, the Senate, and the House.  You run the show. Maybe November will be a month of reckoning. Let's  hope so for the sake of this country.

Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to make in order amendment No. 47 to the Senate  amendments to H.R. 7148, which would allow for an up-or-down vote on  whether to cut the $75 billion Republicans gave ICE in their big, ugly  bill and use those funds to undo some of the big, ugly bill's  disastrous healthcare cuts.

Mr. Speaker, last year, Republicans voted to kick more than 15  million people off their healthcare--15 million Americans--through an  over $1 trillion cut to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.

Republicans claimed that this was for deficit reduction, but we know  that wasn't true. That was a lie. According to the nonpartisan budget  experts at the Congressional Budget Office, their big, ugly bill added  $4 trillion to the national debt, in part, by giving ICE boatloads of  cash to run roughshod through American cities with zero safeguards.  This must end.

If Democrats defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment  to repurpose these ICE funds toward lowering healthcare costs, which  Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins voted for just  last week. I challenge my Republican colleagues in this body to do the  same.

Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Amo), the sponsor of this  amendment.

Mr. Speaker, I am confused. I mean, the gentleman wants to say that  the Republicans are not in control, even though they control the White  House, the House, and the Senate. Yet, the Republicans were in control  to throw 15 million people off of healthcare. Republicans were in  control to add $4 trillion to the debt. The Republicans were in control  to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion. The Republicans were in control to give  ICE unlimited amounts of money with no guardrails. Now, they are  telling us they are not in control? I am confused.

Let me just say this. My colleagues across the aisle can't have it  both ways. Again, I hope that the Republican control of this House and  of this Senate is short-lived because, quite frankly, this country  cannot stand another 2 years of this, where if a person is rich and  well-connected and a friend of the President, they get all kinds of  sweetheart deals. If they are not, if they are a hardworking, middle- class family, they get screwed. People have had it. They see through  this.

To say that my colleagues are not in control when they have been  cutting programs that have helped poor children, that have helped  middle-class families, when they have given tax breaks to  multimillionaires and billionaires, give me a break.

Mr. Speaker, I thought the gentleman was asking me a question and  that we would have a conversation. I will tell him that we don't want a  shutdown. We want them to reel in an out-of-control ICE agency that is  killing American citizens right before our very eyes. That is what we  want.

I don't understand for the life of me why that is such a heavy lift  from my Republican friends, but that is what we are asking for. We  don't want to shut the government down. That is not who we are.

By the way, again, Republicans are responsible for the last shutdown.  They went on vacation rather than stay in Washington to try to  negotiate a deal.

Here we are. All we are asking for is let's reel in this out-of- control agency, and my friends find that too difficult to comprehend.

Lois Frankel).

Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. I support  the five bills that received bipartisan support, but I cannot vote for  a package that includes funding for the Department of Homeland Security  without immediate action to stop the ongoing violation of human rights  and law by ICE. They have turned into thugs, and it has turned our  country, America, into a place that many of us don't recognize.

Donald Trump promised to take violent criminals off the streets.  Instead, his immigration enforcement has become a campaign of cruelty  against peaceful people, tearing families apart, hollowing out  businesses, and paralyzing neighborhoods with pepper spray and fear.

Mr. Speaker, the crisis is national in scope. It is not just the  headlines of the cold-blooded murders in Minnesota.

The Department of Homeland Security has detained hundreds of  thousands of decent people this year, often  in unspeakable conditions and without a fair process. That includes  over 10,000 people in my home State of Florida, including a mother torn  away from her child while nursing her baby. These people are largely  good, decent mothers and fathers who are workers contributing to our  communities.

We do need to take the time for bipartisan immigration reform, but  today--today--we must rein in ICE. That includes ending masked  enforcement with roving patrols, requiring judicial warrants, mandating  body cameras, ending total immunity, and repurposing the billions of  dollars that are being used to menace our communities.

Security does not require brutality. Enforcement does not require  lawlessness, and our immigration policy should reflect our values, not  force us to abandon them. We can secure our borders without terrorizing  our neighbors, and I will not support funding that enables cruelty.

Congress must act now to impeach Kristi Noem and rein in ICE.

Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, under the Republican rule, we don't have  regular order anymore. We should be debating appropriations bills one  at a time. They bunch everything together.

Mr. Speaker, not only do they bunch things together, but they don't  even call for amendments anymore. This is the most closed Congress in  history. The Rules Committee and this House of Representatives has  become a place where democracy goes to die. My friends should be  ashamed of what they are doing to this institution.

Mr. Speaker, that was a lot of words to justify the most closed  Congress in history.

Mr. Speaker, 83 percent of the rules have been closed. That is 8 out  of 10. Republicans don't even call for amendments anymore, and people  know that it is a waste of time to come to the Rules Committee because  they have already been tipped off that there are going to be no  amendments in order.

Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of Democratic amendments have been rejected.  A big chunk of Republican amendments have been rejected. I am sorry  that Republicans' rank and file are such cheap dates when it comes to  legislating, but they cave all the time and they vote for these crappy  rules that are totally closed, so that is a bunch of bullshit. Let's be  honest. That is what we are talking about here. That is not an accurate  assessment of what is going on here.

This is the most closed Congress in history. Republicans should be  ashamed.

Mr. Speaker, I remind my Republican friends, who kind of just go  along to get along, that Mr. Arrington, who is a chairman, had 71  percent of his amendments blocked.

I will go right down the list.

Congresswoman Mace had 76 percent of her amendments blocked.

Congressman Steube had 79 percent of his amendments blocked.

I could go right down the list. These are all Republicans who just  routinely get blocked.

Enough. Enough. This is a ridiculous argument. The bottom line is a  lot of words to justify the most closed Congress in history.

Leger Fernandez).

Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak up against  Kristi Noem's Department of Homeland Security. Speaking up is what we  must do when we see that the Constitution is violated and the moral  fabric of our Nation is brutalized the same way that they are  brutalizing our communities and killing our citizens.

Whether it is in New Mexico or Minnesota, fear has become a policy  for ICE and CBP, and cruelty has become their strategy. They take money  that is taxpayer money that could be used for affordable housing,  healthcare, and bringing down the cost of living, and they are spending  it to terrorize our communities.

Following the Constitution, respecting the First, Fourth, and 14th  Amendments should not be optional. It should never be up for  negotiation. We should make it a requirement and make sure that they do  not have immunity because then they act with impunity. We should not  give another penny to the Department of Homeland Security until we get  accountability.

Mr. Speaker, I urge that we vote against this rule.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, listening to the debate by my Republican  colleagues, I know Republicans want to pretend like they are not in  control because that absolves them of responsibility and  accountability. They don't want to own their own record because they  know their record sucks. They want to pretend like they are not in  control because if they pretend like they are in control, if they  acknowledge that they are in control, then they will be held  accountable in November.

Look at what they have promised compared to what they have done so  far:

Tax breaks for billionaires; they make sure their big donors are  taken care of while they screw over regular people.

$40 billion to Argentina; hurting our farmers and ranchers, importing  more beef from South America.

Bombing Venezuela, threatening to invade NATO allies.

Meanwhile, prices are not down. Prices are up because of the stupid  tariffs and lousy economic policies.

They promised to release all of the Epstein files. They still haven't  done that. In fact, they are covering up for the President of the  United States.

People are struggling more than ever because Trump's economy sucks.  They are making it easier for the elites, easier for the billionaires,  easier for the Epstein class, and harder for everybody else.

Maybe that is why even Republicans are finally acknowledging MAGA was  all a lie. Of course, their members only acknowledge that after they  leave. Let's listen to Trump's former top ally, Marjorie Taylor Greene.  Here is what she said: ``I think people are realizing it was all a lie.  It was a big lie for the people. What MAGA is really serving in this  administration, who they are serving, is their big donors.''

Look at who Republicans have helped. They have been in charge for a  year. They have helped Big Oil. They have helped Big Banks. They have  helped Big Tech.

Look who was in the front row at Trump's inauguration: billionaires.  That is all he cares about. Look at their promises to go after ``the  worst of the worst'' when it comes to immigration, another broken  promise. Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem are not going after the worst  of the worst. They are going after kids, VA nurses. They are deporting  veterans, for God's sake.

We are sick and tired of the broken promises and the lies. Enough. I  talk to Republican colleagues all the time who privately confess to me  that this is a disaster, and then they come on the floor and talk to  the press and say everything is beautiful. That is just not reality.

This President and this administration are taking this country in the  wrong direction. We have people that are being murdered in our streets  by U.S. Federal agents. When is enough going to be enough? I can't  believe this. Go along to get along, I get it. Everybody over there is  afraid of the guy in the White House, but maybe you should be more  afraid of your constituents. Maybe you ought to listen to your  constituents because they are sick and tired of this BS. They have had  it. They want Congress to be a body that fights for them, that fights  to improve the quality of life for average people. They want this body  to be a place where we debate important issues passionately, and we  skip all the crazy debates we have on trivial matters.

We can do so much better, but it requires my friends on the other  side of the aisle to kind of grow a spine, to stand up and to say and  do the right thing.

This is nuts what is happening: People being murdered in our streets;  Federal agents crashing into people's homes without a judicial warrant;  former off-duty police officers being detained by ICE; people with  brown and black skin being detained routinely by ICE. This has to stop.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule.  Let's get to the negotiating table. Let's do something to reel in this  out-of-control agency. Going along to get along is no longer an option.

Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

Democrat,Eleanor Norton,Introduction of the Improving Reentry for District of Columbia Residents in the Bureau of Prisons Act of 2025,"Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Improving Reentry for  District of Columbia Residents in the Bureau of Prisons Act of 2025.  This bill would require the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to place  D.C. residents serving sentences for D.C. Code felonies in BOP  facilities within 250 miles of D.C. Under the National Capital  Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997, individuals  serving sentences for D.C. Code felonies are in BOP custody.

Currently, more than 2,000 D.C. residents are serving sentences for  D.C. Code felonies, and they are in BOP facilities across the United  States. While Congress will not provide funding to BOP to build a new  facility for these D.C. residents, there are more than enough existing  BOP facilities within 250 miles of D.C. to house all these D.C.  residents. Under this bill, BOP could place a D.C. resident outside 250  miles upon the request or consent of a resident, and BOP could place a  D.C. resident outside 250 miles without consent in extraordinary  circumstances.

This bill would help D.C. residents in BOP maintain relationships  with family and support networks and reenter the community after  prison.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690140/introduction-of-the-improving-reentry-for-district-of-columbia-residents-in-the-bureau-of-prisons-act-of-2025,2025-04-24,2025-W17
Democrat,Jared Huffman,-9999,"Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, there were few people in the Congress that  tangled with Doug LaMalfa more than me. There is probably some  competition for that honor among House Democrats, but I was certainly  right up there.

Yet, I can tell you as we honor Doug today, I know plenty of people  who disagreed with him, but I don't know anyone that disliked him. When  you hear these qualities about his authenticity, his warm sense of  humor, just how relatable he was, that is all very, very true.

I go back almost 20 years with Doug because we were in the State  legislature together. A lot has been said about his sense of humor,  which is also very, very true. I want to just share something that I  always think of with Doug because it speaks to the type of humor which  is really, I think, something that tells you about the man. There are  plenty of people who have a great sense of humor at other people's  expense. Doug LaMalfa had a very gentle and disarming sense of humor.

One of our colleagues together in the State assembly was our former  colleague and the current mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass. I will  always remember how Doug used to crack her and me up by calling her  Bassomatic. That was the nickname. His staffers back here are far too  young to remember the ``Saturday Night Live'' skit in which Dan Aykroyd  puts a bass in a blender and makes this gross smoothie and drinks it.  It was funny, and that is the kind of thing that Doug would pull up  spontaneously and crack everyone up. I loved that.

I will tell you, Karen Bass loved it too. She liked it so much that  she went up to Doug's district when she became speaker of the assembly,  and I remember he just not only welcomed her there--this is a person he  had very little in common with, a southern California urban African- American member that voted together with him almost never, but Doug  gave her the VIP tour of his farm and of the Sacramento Valley and rice  country. He got her up in a combine and had her do things that I am  sure she will never forget. I think he loved every minute of that.

That is how I am going remember Doug. He was a great guy. I am  certainly thinking and sending best wishes to his family and everyone  who loved him.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698736/9999,2026-01-08,2026-W02
Republican,Steve Scalise,Recognizing Ben Napier,"Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, this week, we say good-bye to a longtime  member of my staff and also a long-known face here on the floor of the  House, Ben Napier.

Ben started his career on the Rules Committee, and he has been a part  of Team Scalise for nearly a decade. Starting as floor assistant and  working his way all the way up to the position he serves today: floor  director of the House of Representatives for the last 6 years.

Nobody knows the ins and outs of floor procedure better than Ben, and  he is a trusted presence and a familiar face on the floor to all  Members. Ben has had a hand in every piece of legislation that has  crossed the floor in the last 9 years and has shepherded nearly every  House Republican through the process of getting bills to the floor.

Ben has been an integral part in setting and carrying out the House  agenda during our time in the majority and has overseen major  legislative wins, touching everything from tax reform to energy policy  to crypto modernization.

Ben has been a trusted adviser and a critical team player. His  departure will be felt by everyone on Capitol Hill, but I know he will  excel in his next chapter.

I thank Ben for his years of dedicated service to the Capitol family.

Democrat,Derek Tran,Recognizing Black April,"Mr. TRAN. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to mark the most solemn  time of the year for the people of the Vietnamese diaspora. ``Black  April,'' ``Thang Tu Den,'' is not just a solemn day in history, but it  is a reminder of the day when we lost everything: our homes, our  livelihoods, and our beloved country.

It was 50 years ago, on April 30, 1975, that South Vietnam fell to  the Communist regime. American troops airlifted 6,000 American and  Vietnamese people to safety. Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese  refugees would follow, most of them boarding boats on uncharted waters,  not knowing what awaited them on the other side of the journey.

In Vietnam, the conditions under the Communist regime grew more  brutal. Many were imprisoned in concentration camps, losing not just  their homes but their freedom, their dignity, and, in too many cases,  their lives.

This is a painful day, a day for reflection, for remembrance, and for  mourning. Over 58,000 United States soldiers and more than 250,000  South Vietnamese soldiers gave their lives in service. These brave men  and women made the ultimate sacrifice, and they deserve our continued  and unwavering gratitude.

We mourn not only those who fought for freedom but the countless  innocent lives lost during the war, those who perished at the hands of  the Communist regime and the aftermath and the brave souls who were  lost fleeing repression on boats. We have no choice but to honor those  precious souls who were lost by giving the most we can to this life  that we have been blessed with.

I share my own story with hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese  Americans born to parents who fled our homeland with nothing. Boat  people did not let the hardship of the journey define the life that  they built in America. We have built communities that are unparalleled  in strength, prosperity, and commitment to preserving our history.

Mr. Speaker, as we reflect on the past 50 years since the fall of  Saigon, we do so in solemn remembrance but in celebration of what we  have built together. From the ashes of war, we have risen.

We celebrate today the trailblazers who have risen from this legacy:  generals and admirals in the U.S. military, award-winning scientists,  titans of business, educators, doctors, and artists. Our community has  nurtured leaders in all walks of life, turning adversity into  opportunity in just five short decades.

Many of these people are children of refugees or refugees themselves,  and they represent just a few of the countless contributions that  Vietnamese Americans continue to make across every sector of society.  Our journey from tragedy to triumph has only just begun, and the story  of our people will continue to inspire generations to come.

As the first Vietnamese American to represent Orange County's Little  Saigon community in Congress, I am humbled by the responsibility to  carry this history forward. Little Saigon, home to the largest  Vietnamese diaspora in the world, is a beacon of hope and a reminder of  the resilience that has defined our community.

I stand on the shoulders of the Vietnamese leaders in California and  across the country who have paved the way for future generations to  succeed. I am proud to be the third Vietnamese American ever elected to  Congress, following Congressman Joseph Cao of Louisiana and  Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy of Florida.

I am reminded every day of our strength, our determination, and our  unyielding commitment to preserving our history and to ensuring that no  Communist regime can rewrite our history.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in not only remembering  the hardships we face, but also in celebrating the incredible  resilience of the Vietnamese people. Let us honor the lives of those  who sacrificed everything for freedom: The United States Army veterans  and the veterans of the former Republic of Vietnam. As we commemorate  this solemn milestone, let us reaffirm our commitment to the values  that matter most: democracy, human rights, and our unshakeable will to  be free.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690347/recognizing-black-april,2025-04-29,2025-W18
Republican,Jodey Arrington,Unlocking Our Domestic Lng Potential Act of 2025,"Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, as I listened to the ranking member talk  about China's need for U.S. energy, thank God it is that way and not  the other way around.

If we followed the green new manifesto, with the regulatory assault  on U.S. energy, and kept throwing hundreds of billions of dollars in  distorting Green New Deal energy subsidies, that is exactly what would  happen, we would wake up and be dependent on China for yet one more  critical product.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand alongside Chairman Guthrie and my  fellow west Texan, August Pfluger, in support of the Unlocking our  Domestic LNG Potential Act. America is the world's top exporter of LNG,  a vital pillar of both our economic strength and national security.

In an effort to placate the radical left, which I think was primarily  the motivation, the Biden administration, with its whole-of-government  assault on American energy, froze new LNG export permits with no  economic, environmental, or national security justification. That  reckless decision threatened billions of U.S. investments, undermined  our allies, and harmed energy-producing regions like west Texas.

Thankfully, we now have a President in the White House who is  committed to doing the right thing for the country, for our producers  and consumers, and committed to making American energy great again, not  weaponizing  this authority for purely ideological purposes.

This bill removes politics from the export permit process and secures  America's position as the world's energy superpower. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill and prevent future administrations from  threatening America's energy dominance. I thank the chairman again for  his leadership.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697087/unlocking-our-domestic-lng-potential-act-of-2025,2025-11-20,2025-W47
Democrat,Emilia Sykes,Recognizing Akron Rites of Passage Institute,"Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Akron Rites of  Passage as the Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champions of the  Week.

Led by 13 elders in the community, AROPI, as it is also known, is an  African-centered organization established for the purpose of educating,  training, and empowering its participants in African-centered rites of  passage, process, rituals, customs, and practices.

Its further purpose is to promote all aspects of healthy growth and  development of individuals, families, and the community of African  descent in Akron, Summit County, and surrounding areas.

Five years ago, the Akron Rites of Passage Institute introduced a  community initiative called the Legacy Building Project to support the  ongoing growth, development, and long-term sustainability of the  African American community.

Terrence Shelton, a co-chair of the project, also served as the  copresident of the Akron's Rites of Passage Institute. Earlier this  month he laid out plans for a new African-American cultural center and  museum complex on behalf of the program. The building will house a  museum, a business incubator, and center to teach people about trading  and investing as a means to building economic wealth in the community.  He envisions museum exhibits highlighting Akron sports legends,  scientists, and artists like LeBron James, Gus Johnson, Rita Dove, and  Woodrow Nash.

Democrat,Yassamin Ansari,Trump Immigration Policies,"Ms. ANSARI. Mr. Speaker, last week, I traveled to El Salvador, along  with three of my colleagues, to see firsthand the chaos unleashed by  the Trump administration through its unconstitutional and illegal  deportations of U.S. residents to third-party countries.

I represent a beautifully diverse district in which 64 languages are  spoken and where families of immigrants like mine thrive. I have heard  more about this issue from my constituents than any other during my  time in Congress.

In El Salvador, we met with the U.S. Ambassador and demanded that the  Trump administration facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia in  compliance with the 9-0, unanimous Supreme Court decision of the United  States and the lower Federal court judges.

Mr. Abrego Garcia and many other wrongfully deported individuals were  sent to El Salvador with no due process and no legal recourse just for  being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

It is outrageous and indefensible that the Trump administration  continues to defy a Supreme Court ruling to return this man to his  family. In fact, it is a full-blown constitutional crisis.

There are other people--including Andry Jose Hernandez Romero, a  makeup artist and legal asylum seeker, and Merwil Gutierrez, a teenager  who was mistakenly picked up by immigration enforcement--languishing in  El Salvador.

Now, the Trump administration is admitting to deporting a 2-year-old  U.S. citizen with cancer. It is cruel, it is despicable, and it is  totally illegal, no matter what Stephen Miller or Tom Homan may say.

These cases are not just about these specific people or children sent  on planes to foreign prisons by the U.S. Government. Our entire system  of justice hinges on the rights afforded to us by the Constitution, the  rights of due process, access to legal representation, and the ability  to be heard in a court of law.

It is a dark day for our democracy when the Federal Government  snatches people off of the streets, flies them out of the country  secretly in the dead of night, and sends them to a foreign prison to be  detained indefinitely with no legal recourse or chance to prove their  case.

Who is to say that it couldn't be you or me next? I will continue to  speak out for due process and our constitutional rights.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690509/trump-immigration-policies,2025-04-30,2025-W18
Democrat,Gabe Amo,Rhode Island State Police Centenary,"Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, with admiration and appreciation, I wish to  recognize the 100th anniversary of the Rhode Island State Police. For a  century, these tireless men and women in uniform have traveled the  highways and byways of our state to ensure the safety of our  communities. They have lived up to their creed of honor, integrity,  fairness, excellence, courage, honesty, and devotion to duty.

On April 2, 1925 the Rhode Island General Assembly created the  ``Rhode Island Department of State Police.'' It was the first such  organization in our state dedicated to ensuring safety, order, and  security for Rhode Islanders. What began with just 21 officers  patrolling on Indian-brand motorcycles has grown into a modern,  technologically advanced law enforcement agency committed to the  highest standards of public service.

From the earliest days of policing rural roads to the current use of  cutting-edge technology, the agency has continually evolved to meet the  challenges of each era while striving to maintain the trust and respect  of the public it serves.

Even their uniforms made an impression--most notably in 1986, when  their distinctive attire earned national recognition and was featured  on the David Letterman Show.

Over the course of the agency's esteemed 100 year history, the  dedicated men and women of the Rhode Island State Police have worked  tirelessly to ensure Rhode Islanders' safety. And I know that for the  next one hundred years they will continue to serve justice, help  stranded motorists, and keep our communities safe. As they mark their  centenary during national law enforcement week, I join every Rhode  Islander in thanking the Troopers of the Rhode Island State Police for  their 100 years of public service.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692219/rhode-island-state-police-centenary,2025-06-09,2025-W24
Republican,Bryan Steil,Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act,"Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the GENIUS Act. The  legislation brings clarity, consumer protections, and American  leadership to the evolving world of payment stablecoins.

Stablecoin legislation has been in the works for over 4 years and has  been called for by Democratic and Republican administrations. The  status quo fails to protect consumers from fraud. That is an untenable  situation in a market growing by the billions.

For too long, the United States has operated without a clear Federal  framework for dollar-backed payment stablecoins, leaving consumers  vulnerable to fraud, innovators in limbo, and our global  competitiveness at risk.

That is why I am proud to have introduced stablecoin legislation in  the House and worked alongside my colleagues in the Senate to make the  legislation reaching the President's desk as strong as possible. That  is why I am urging a ``yes'' vote on the GENIUS Act.

The bipartisan, bicameral legislation creates a robust framework for  payment stablecoin issuance in the United States. It encourages the  innovation and development of Web3 businesses here in the United  States. It establishes clear rules to ensure that consumers are  protected and businesses have clear regulations to responsibly  participate in the digital asset ecosystem.

By requiring issuers to maintain a one-to-one reserve in cash and  high-quality liquid assets like U.S. Treasuries, consumers know what  they are getting and are protected.

GENIUS has strong anti-money laundering, operational risk, and  governance standards in place to prevent abuse, reinforce market  integrity, and create an even playing field with other financial  institutions.

By passing the GENIUS Act in the House and sending it to the  President's desk, Congress will be sending a clear message: The United  States will dominate the future of financial innovation. We will  protect consumers, support innovation, and defend the central role of  the U.S. dollar in global commerce.

With this bill, we are not just responding to a moment. We are  building a foundation for the future of finance in the Web3 world.

Payment stablecoin legislation is critical to this foundation. If we  want to become the digital asset hub of the world, we must enact a  comprehensive  framework for the digital asset ecosystem.

I urge my colleagues to support both the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY  Act and send a message that America leads in financial innovation and  does so with integrity, strength, and a firm commitment to protecting  the people we serve.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693840/guiding-and-establishing-national-innovation-for-us-stablecoins-act,2025-07-17,2025-W29

He was a great friend and an incredible advocate for his district. He  did his very best for his constituents. He never gave up. He focused on  wolves, water, forests, and fire.

Tim worked to bring attention to the many challenges  students face, including food insecurity, homelessness, and lack of  childcare.

Democrat,George Latimer,Making Americans Less Healthy,"Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the Trump  administration's Environmental Protection Agency is quietly denying us  protection from forever chemicals.

While Secretary Kennedy claims he will make America healthy again,  the EPA announced it would overturn historical reporting requirements  on toxic substances known as PFAS. Exposure to small amounts has been  linked to cancer, fertility issues, and immune system failure.

This year alone, the EPA has delayed enforcement on drinking water  limits for PFAS, fired EPA scientists researching new forever  chemicals, terminated grants for PFAS studies, and approved pesticides  known to have PFAS.

Across the political spectrum, legislators have come together to  protect our children from dangerous PFAS chemicals. Now this  administration is allowing them to be used on cereal grains, peas,  beans, tomatoes, oranges, almonds, and more.

Not only is this administration making our groceries more expensive,  but they are making our groceries less healthy. We must stand together  against these actions. Our children's health depends on it.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697919/making-americans-less-healthy,2025-12-11,2025-W50
Democrat,Kelly Morrison,In Memory of Mark and Melissa Hortman,"Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today alongside my colleagues from  the State of Minnesota to honor the lives of Melissa and Mark Hortman,  who were shot and killed in an unspeakable act of political violence  last week.

Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman was truly the best of  us. She was exactly the kind of person you would want to run for  office. She was a dedicated public servant who got up every day  determined to make life better for all Minnesotans.

She was a brilliant legislator and a tough negotiator. She was often  the smartest person in the room, but you wouldn't know it because she  was so humble. She was a generous friend, a good neighbor, and a mentor  to me and to so many others. She saw the dignity in all people and  treated everyone with respect. She led with humility, humor, and  compassion.

Her Catholic faith informed her work and she kept the beautiful  prayer of St.  Francis of Assisi tucked in her wallet as a guiding principle: Make me  a channel of your peace.

Melissa led us through some of the State's most difficult challenges,  often with a divided legislature, and the tributes that have poured in  from her former colleagues from both sides of the aisle speak to her  character and her leadership style.

She knew how to get things done and she did it with determination,  respect, and pragmatism. She built bridges across the aisle and she  kept her diverse caucus together to usher through some of the most  consequential legislation in our State's history. Her work and legacy  undoubtedly improved the lives of Minnesotans for generations to come.

Let us heed the words of Melissa and Mark's children who wrote in  their beautiful tribute to their parents, ``The best way to honor our  parents' memory is to do something, whether big or small, to make our  community just a little bit better for someone else.''

Let us all honor Melissa and Mark by leading with kindness and  compassion, by prioritizing civility and humility in our service, and  by always striving to make our communities just a little bit better for  someone else.

Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of us to join in a moment of  silence in honor of Melissa and Mark Hortman.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692786/in-memory-of-mark-and-melissa-hortman,2025-06-23,2025-W26

Republican,James Risch,Arms Sales Notification,"Mr. RISCH. Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is still available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the Record the notifications that have been  received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such  an annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign  Relations Committee, room SD-423.

(i) Prospective Purchaser: Government of Australia.

(ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 17-12.

Date: June 23, 2017.

Implementing Agency: Air Force.

(iii) Description: On June 23, 2017, Congress was notified       by congressional certification transmittal number 17-12 of       the possible sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of up to five (5) Gulfstream G-550 aircraft       modified to integrate Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance,       Reconnaissance, and Electronic Warfare (AISREW) mission       systems, Global Positioning System (GPS) capability, secure       communications, aircraft defensive systems; spares, including       whole life costs of airborne and ground segments; aircraft       modification and integration; ground systems for data       processing and crew training; ground support equipment;       publications and technical data; U.S. Government and       contractor engineering, technical and logistics support       services; flight test and certification; and other related       elements of logistical and program support. The estimated       total cost was $1.3 billion. Major Defense Equipment (MDE)       constituted $.04 billion of this total.

On August 26, 2020, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 20-0J of Australia's request       for the inclusion of the following non-MDE items and       services: spares and repair/return parts: consumables and       support equipment; publications and technical documentation;       maintenance, training and training equipment; U.S. Government       and contractor flight test and certification, aircraft       modification and integration, engineering, technical and       logistics support services; and other related elements of       logistical and program support. These additional items       resulted in an increase in non-MDE cost of $500 million,       causing a revised total cost for non-MDE of $1.76 billion.       Major Defense Equipment (MDE) remained $.04 billion. The       total estimated case value increased by $500 million to $1.8       billion.

This transmittal notifies the addition of the following       non-MDE items: follow-on sustainment support of the Royal       Australian Air Force's Gulfstream G-550 aircraft modified       with airborne intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and       electronic warfare (AISREW) mission systems; and other       related elements of logistics and program support. The       estimated total cost of the new items is $230 million. The       estimated total case will increase by $230 million to a       revised $2.03 billion. There is no MDE associated with this       sale.

(iv) Significance: The proposed sale will support       Australia's efforts to modernize its electronic warfare       support capability and increase interoperability between the       U.S. Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force.

(v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States. Australia is one of the most important U.S. allies in       the Western Pacific. The strategic location of this political       and economic power contributes significantly to ensuring       peace and economic stability in the region. It is vital to       the U.S. national interest to assist our ally in developing       and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense capability.

Law- Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act; Providing for Consideration of H.R. Undersea Cable Protection Act of and Providing for Consideration of H.R. Securing America's Critical Minerals Supply Act,"Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand in support of  the SAVE America Act.

Consider the simple realities of life. In this country, you are  required to show an ID to drive a car, to board an airplane, or to cash  a paycheck. These are routine requirements for everyday participation  in our society. Yet, for the most fundamental act of a self-governing  people, the right to vote, that same standard of verification is  missing.

Let us be clear. Despite the rhetoric, this is not about creating  hurdles at the polling place. It is about the integrity of the  registration process. As Americans, our right to vote is sacred, but  that right is only as strong as a system that protects it. When one  single illegal vote is cast, a legal vote is diluted. When a foreign  national influences an election, the voice of an American citizen is  silenced. This isn't a hypothetical concern. It is a matter of  protecting the value of everyone's choice.

The SAVE America Act is guided by one simple principle: Only  Americans should decide American elections.

Across this country, we have seen noncitizens identified on voter  rolls. This is a vulnerability we can no longer afford to ignore. By  passing this act, we provide the public with the one thing our  political system needs most: trust--trust that the process is secure;  trust that the rules are followed; and trust that every legal vote  counts.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me. Let us unify around the  democratic principles that built this Republic. Let us pass the SAVE  America Act to keep our elections exclusively in the hands of the  American people.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699946/providing-for-consideration-of-s-veterans-accessibility-advisory-committee-act-of-providing-for-consideration-of-hr-law-enforcement-innovate-to-de-escalate-act-providing-for-consideration-of-hr-undersea-cable-protection-act-of-and-providing-for-consideration-of-hr-securing-americas-critical-minerals-supply-act,2026-02-11,2026-W07
Democrat,Chuck Schumer,Stablecoins,"Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, finally, I want to say a little bit  about last week.

There are those on the other side of the aisle now shedding crocodile  tears that, last week, the minority asserted its right not to proceed  to a bill that has zero legislative text. Imagine--imagine--they said,  the nerve of the Democrats not voting for a bill when there is no text.  How crazy can they be?

We asserted our rights very simply to continue the legislative  process to allow time to reach agreement. The majority, in an act of  political stubbornness but also stupidity, asked people to vote on a  bill they had never seen. They tried to force a vote before Senators  even had text to know what they were voting on. And then they get upset  that we all voted no?

They shouldn't be surprised--least of all, my good friend the  Republican leader, who said in his first speech as majority leader:  ``One of my priorities as leader will be to ensure that the Senate  stays the Senate.''

Well, in the Senate, we have always had the text of the bill before  we vote on it. I say that to my friend the majority leader.

Democrats were perfectly, perfectly appropriate, fair, and correct in  asserting our rights. If this Senate is to work, the majority must  allow it to work.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690962/stablecoins,2025-05-12,2025-W20

(2) by adding at the end the following:

``(c) No Additional Funds Authorized.--Funds authorized       under subsection (a) may, as provided in appropriations Acts,       only come from within amounts authorized to be appropriated       to the Secretary to carry out the duties of the Federal Duck       Stamp Office.''.

Republican,Mike Ezell,Expressing Support for Local Law Enforcement Officers,"Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan  resolution honoring the brave men and women who serve in local law  enforcement.

These officers work tirelessly to protect and serve, putting their  lives on the line every day to uphold the rule of law.

As a former sheriff, a son of a police officer, and a 42-year career  police officer, I have walked in their shoes. I know the toll it takes  on them. I know the long hours, sleepless nights, and time spent away  from family. I know this stuff.

I know what it means to respond to a tragedy, to console a grieving  victim's family after a horrendous crime has happened to them involving  tragic accidents. I have seen things most Americans will thankfully  never have to experience.

When others run away from danger, law enforcement and first  responders run toward it. They fight crime, protect the innocent, and  too often, make the ultimate sacrifice.

During my time in Congress, Mississippi has lost too many heroes: In  June 2023, Madison Police Officer Randy Tyler was shot and killed while  responding to a hostage situation. In January 2024, George County  Sheriff's Deputy Jeremy Malone was shot and killed during a traffic  stop on a rural highway. In August 2024, Summit Police Patrolman Troy  Floyd was shot and killed during a regular, routine traffic checkpoint.  Earlier this year, Hinds County Sheriff's Deputy Martin Shields, Jr.,  was shot and killed after responding to a domestic violence dispute.

These officers represent the best of our State and our Nation. Fallen  heroes like these officers are being honored this week during National  Police Week as thousands of law enforcement officers come to the  Nation's Capital together here in Washington. That is why there is no  better time for us to pass this resolution and make it clear that we  stand for law enforcement.

My resolution expresses our gratitude to local law enforcement and  their families for their service and sacrifice. It calls for stronger  partnerships between officers and the communities they protect, and it  honors the memories of those who never came home.

We have seen targeted, ambush-style attacks on law enforcement  officers. We have seen departments struggle to recruit and retain  talented officers because they were vilified for deciding to serve  their communities.

Mr. Speaker, this is the time for Congress to take the lead. It is  time to make clear that we stand with the men and women of local law  enforcement who protect each and every one of our communities with  honor and courage.

I am proud that this resolution passed last Congress with  overwhelming support. This police week, I urge my colleagues to join me  in voting for this resolution to send a clear message that Congress  backs the thin blue line.

Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

Democrat,Kathy Castor,Providing for Consideration of H.R. Breaking the Gridlock Act,"Ms. CASTOR of Florida. On behalf of the over half a million  hardworking neighbors back home and across the Tampa Bay area, I rise  in strong support of the extension of the lifesaving and cost-saving  ACA tax credits.

Families are being crushed by inflation and high healthcare costs,  and they need the savings that the ACA tax credits provide. Mr.  Speaker, 4.7 million Floridians, one in five who live in the Sunshine  State, depend on the ACA. It is estimated that without the tax credits,  over 1.4 million Floridians will lose their health insurance entirely.

They are entrepreneurs. They are caregivers. They are cancer  patients. They are part-time workers. They are small-business workers  who have seen their premiums more than double, and they deserve so much  better.

That includes Yohanna, a small business owner in Tampa and the mother  of a daughter with Down syndrome, who without enhanced tax credits  defaults to an insurance plan where every visit will cost her $150 for  a copay. It includes Matthew, a truck driver from St. Petersburg, whose  premiums rose from $64 a month to $736 per month.

We need to extend these tax credits, and we need to do it now.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698595/providing-for-consideration-of-hr-breaking-the-gridlock-act,2026-01-07,2026-W02
Republican,John Rose,Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025,"Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the SAVE America  Act because nothing matters more than securing our elections. Our  Republic depends on it.

Free, fair, and honest elections unmoored by fraud or suspicion are  fundamental to our constitutional Republic. The right of citizens to  have their votes properly counted without illegal dilution is vital to  determining the rightful winner.

This legislation is straightforward. It requires proof of citizenship  for voter registration and voter ID for Federal elections. It ensures  only American citizens participate in American elections and provides  States with tools to determine and verify the citizenship and maintain  accurate voter rolls.

There is only one reason not to pass this, and we all know what that  is. Some in this Chamber oppose anything that interferes with their  effort to control elections and consolidate power.

Congressional Democrats sat silent as the Biden administration  allowed millions of illegal immigrants into the United States. I fear  the intention was to garner votes. However, my colleagues across the  aisle now have an opportunity to prove me wrong by supporting this  widely popular legislation.

The SAVE America Act reinforces that voting is a right only of  citizens, not just anyone within our borders. Opposition to this act  makes sense in that context, but that is precisely why we must pass it.

We have a duty to the American people to preserve their voice,  protect their vote, and secure their sovereignty, and we must save the  Republic from forces that would undermine our most sacred democratic  institution. I urge my colleagues to pass the SAVE America Act.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1700015/veterans-accessibility-advisory-committee-act-of-2025,2026-02-11,2026-W07
Democrat,Suzan DelBene,Recognizing Anusha Arora for Scientific Excellence,"Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Anusha Arora  on being the Gold Medal recipient at the Washington State Science and  Engineering Fair for her project titled ``Smart Strings: A Novel Low- Cost Multimodal System for Intelligent Sensory Feedback through  Artificial Intelligence.'' The Washington State Science and Engineering  Fair aims to advance the studies of STEM in grades 1-12 through the  State of Washington. They work to provide opportunities for students to  display their projects and provide support and guidance for the  operation of science and engineering fairs throughout Washington State.

Additionally, Anusha had the opportunity to represent Washington  State at the 2025 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.  For more than 70 years, thousands of students from various science fair  networks have explored their passion for scientific research at the  world's largest pre-college science competition. Students from more  than 75 countries, regions and territories competed across 21 different  STEM disciplines. This year, Anusha competed among the top young  scientists from around the globe and was selected as a Grand Award  Winner in the category of ``Technology Enhances the Arts.'' Anusha  Arora attends Interlake High School in Washington's 1st Congressional  District.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Anusha  Arora and this victory for science education in Washington. Her work  demonstrates not only exceptional scientific excellence, but a deep  commitment to addressing real world challenges.

Republican,"GT Thompson, Jr.",Recognizing State College Kiwanis Club,"Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the State College Kiwanis Club for reaching a remarkable  milestone, 100 years of service to children and families in our  community.

Since 1925, the club has lived out Kiwanis International's mission of  improving the world one child and one community at a time.

Children are our future, and too many face challenges they cannot  overcome alone. It is our responsibility as a community to step in, and  the State College Kiwanis has done just that.

Through initiatives like its annual blueberry sale, the club provides  over $30,000 in scholarships and grants each year. Over the past  century, they have raised more than $1 million to support organizations  such as Centre Volunteers in Medicine, the Tides Program, the Jana  Marie Foundation, and Centre Safe.

Their impact goes far beyond fundraising. Whether promoting literacy,  supporting youth mental health, or investing in dental care, their work  ensures our children have the chance to thrive.

Democrat,Jimmy Panetta,Disaster Related Extension of Deadlines Act,"I rise in support of H.R. 1491, the Disaster Related Extension of  Deadlines Act, authored and introduced by my friend, the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).

I thank the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for doing an  excellent job in summarizing not just the issue but the solution with  this bipartisan legislation, for it is this type of legislation that  would ensure that tax deadlines remain aligned in disaster zones and  that those who have survived natural disasters are not penalized by  confusing collection notices or a shortened tax lookback period.

Now, currently, taxpayers have a 3-year lookback period after a  filing deadline to claim a refund or missed credits. However, when the  IRS extends filing deadlines for those affected by natural disasters,  the deadline for the lookback period is not extended. This leads  taxpayers, as you can imagine, Mr. Speaker, in disaster areas to lose  out on money that they are owed because their lookback period is  shorter than expected.

This bill would fix that, by aligning the lookback period with the  postponed tax deadline for disaster zones. Additionally, this bill  solves the problem of misaligned deadlines and confusing collection  notices after a natural disaster.

Since current law requires the IRS to send a notice and demand for  payment of tax within 60 days of processing a tax filing, individuals  in disaster zones who file early but wait to pay often get confusing  notices and demands for payment. These notices are sent long before  payment is due and also cause panic and confusion during the difficult  task of disaster recovery.

This bill, again, would fix that issue by requiring the IRS to take  into account tax deadlines postponed because of disasters when issuing  collection notices. It can take years to financially recover from a  natural disaster, as many of us in this House have experienced with our  constituents. Ensuring  those who are recovering can claim what they are owed and do not have  to worry about confusing collection notices is the absolute least that  we can do.

This bill is an easy win, and it is the type of policy that makes  government work and improves people's lives that we should be focused  more on in Congress. This bill is an example of how government should  help people. We are providing a plan based on a law that would help the  government better serve people, especially in a time of need.

This is why we should come together and support the bipartisan  Disaster Related Extension of Deadlines Act. I urge my colleagues to  support this bill that would help our government be better in helping  those constituents in times of need all across this country.

Mr. Speaker, I want to say briefly in closing that, as you have  heard, this legislation has tremendous bipartisan support and will  remove burdensome processes at the IRS to make government work better  for our constituents after a disaster.

I appreciate Mr. Murphy talking about his district in North Carolina  and the devastation that his constituents have experienced. In the 19th  Congressional District, I am at the edge of the continent as well, on  the west side of the continent, all the way across the country from Mr.  Murphy's district, but we, too, are at the tip of the spear when it  comes to floods, fires, storms, and other natural disasters. That is  why I think, as you heard from Mr. Murphy, and I agree, that this is  not a partisan issue.

Never should disaster assistance be a partisan issue. This has full  bipartisan support because full financial recovery after a natural  disaster can take years. Aligning tax deadlines from the IRS is the  absolute least that we can do for our constituents who are rebuilding  their lives.

Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank my colleagues, Representative Murphy  and Chairman Smith, for their work on this bill, and I encourage my  colleagues to support H.R. 1491, the Disaster Related Extension of  Deadlines Act.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689313/disaster-related-extension-of-deadlines-act,2025-03-31,2025-W14
Democrat,Robert Garcia,District of Columbia Policing Protection Act,"Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this bill, which would overrule rules  implemented by D.C.'s elected leaders on when Metropolitan Police  officers should pursue a fleeing car.

Our debate here is a perfect example of why D.C. needs self-rule. We  should be clear. High-speed chases are deadly. They often end in  needless deaths, injuries, and devastating property damage.

Over 3,000 people died in police car chases in the U.S. between 2017  and 2022. Half of those deaths were innocent bystanders not involved in  the chase. I will repeat. Half of the people who have died in police  car chases were innocent bystanders. That should alarm every single one  of us.

Across the country, Republican-led States have recognized the dangers  of high-speed cases. States like Texas, Florida, and Tennessee have all  implemented tighter standards to limit pursuits of violent criminals or  imminent threats. They know the risks are too high for people who are  innocent or could get caught up in one of these car crashes. That is  the best practice, and D.C. is following the same path.

But my Republican colleagues want to interfere. They want to lower  the standards to allow for more chases and more innocent people getting  hurt.

I will remind us that this District is dense. Sidewalks oftentimes  are small. Streets are tight. There are a lot of folks who live here.  We should not have a one-size-fits-all policy for D.C. We should allow  the people of D.C. to decide when a car chase is appropriate.

Congress should not require D.C. police to use tactics that the  community does not want. D.C. residents should be empowered to decide  when to authorize their police to use dangerous tactics.

Under current D.C. law, pursuits are allowed if a fleeing suspect has  committed a violent crime, for example, or poses an imminent threat to  public safety and if the pursuit can be done in a way that minimizes  the risk to innocent people.

We should not lower these standards, and certainly not with zero  community input and no consultation with the D.C. Council, Mayor, or  other folks who are actually trying to manage this city.

There are many tools, we know, that police officers can use to track  suspects and make arrests. We should let the Council, the Mayor, and  the police work together with the D.C. police to balance public safety,  pedestrian safety, and proportionality. If D.C. residents don't like  it, they can vote their elected officials out of office.

Today, Congress is again injecting itself as some sort of super city  council to write laws for Washington, D.C. As a former mayor of 8  years, I worked with over 700 amazing men and women of a police  department who were heroic in the work that they did. I know that, in  conversations with our chief, our police officers, and our community,  these decisions are best left to our communities to write the laws of  when these police chases should actually go into effect.

While I appreciate the author and my friend, this bill, I believe, is  unnecessary. It undermines home rule, and it will make D.C. less safe.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins) also  for his service in law enforcement. I know that he is trying to help  and trying to move public safety forward. I know that is his intention,  but I just want to clarify a few things.

It has been mentioned that this committee or this bill has somehow  been heard by a committee. We have not held a hearing on these bills.  To clarify, our hearing on D.C. is actually tomorrow. There has been no  coordination with the Mayor or the D.C. Council. They oppose this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I will clarify. It has been mentioned a few times when  we have debated this bill that there are somehow 14 criteria that  officers have to consider before engaging in a pursuit.

The law is very clear. The suspect must have ``committed or attempted  to commit a crime of violence, or poses an imminent threat of death or  serious bodily injury,'' and the pursuit is ``necessary to protect  another person'' from ``serious bodily injury''; and not likely to  cause injury to others; and ``all other options have been exhausted or  do not reasonably lend themselves to the circumstances.'' That is  actually what the law says.

I just wanted to note that. I am not sure what those 14 criteria are.

Norton).

I strongly oppose this bill. D.C.'s elected leaders have set clear,  commonsense limits on high-speed chases and limits that save lives. I  just remind folks that States like Texas, Florida, and Tennessee  recognize the danger and restrict pursuits to violent crimes or  imminent deaths, and D.C. follows that same practice.

Mr. GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.

Republican,"Robert Bresnahan, Jr.",Mid-Atlantic River Basin Commissions Review Act,"Mr. BRESNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to introduce H.R. 3428, the  Mid-Atlantic River Basin Commissions Review Act.

This legislation will bring much-needed oversight and clarity to the  activities and funding streams for the Delaware River Basin Commission,  Susquehanna River Basin Commission, and the Interstate Commission on  the Potomac River Basin.

The river basin commissions in the Mid-Atlantic work across State  lines to regulate the river systems within a watershed. Since their  inceptions after World War II, the rivers they manage have grown in  importance as our populations have grown and water usage has increased.

Millions of people rely on these rivers for water and wastewater  needs, including my constituents in Pennsylvania's Eighth Congressional  District.

These commissions also play a role in protecting rivers from  pollution and ensuring the ecosystems remain vibrant and resilient.

As their roles have grown, Congress has not always had insight into  the exact responsibility and tasks the river basin commissions are  undertaking.

My legislation directs the Government Accountability Office to  conduct a study and compile recommendations for the Mid-Atlantic river  basin commissions to ensure they have proper ethics policies in place,  conduct an inventory of their Federal responsibilities, and look to see  if any of their responsibilities have become duplicative since their  inceptions.

My legislation then directs these river basin commissions to report  back annually on how they are complying with these recommendations. GAO  is the gold standard for Federal reports and has conducted numerous  reports and studies of government agencies. In fact, according to the  GAO, 75 percent of their recommendations are implemented over a 4-year  period.

I trust this proper oversight will help these river basin commissions  find ways to improve their services to their citizens and the rivers  they serve.

Republican,Mike Haridopolos,Breaking the Gridlock Act,"Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here this afternoon  to talk about what is so important to all of us, and that is  healthcare, not just health insurance.

A clean, 3-year extension brought by the minority would send $110  billion directly to insurance companies.

As the chairman just mentioned, a recent GAO report showed that 23  out of 24 fraudulent enrollees were approved and received taxpayer  subsidies directly to insurance companies. The GAO even reported that  they were not required to provide documentation, such as Social  Security numbers or income verification. It was money sent directly to  insurance companies from taxpayers.

Democrats said healthcare would be affordable, yet since the  implementation of this bad idea, premiums are up 80 percent. At the  same time, nearly 20 percent of the individual market claims are denied  by insurance companies.

In 2024, 87 percent of the revenue made by insurance companies  selling ACA exchange claims came from taxpayer dollars.

To quote an article from The Wall Street Journal, Democrats sold  ObamaCare on the false pretenses that it would make healthcare  affordable. Let me say that again: false pretenses. Extending the  subsidies would perpetuate that fraud.

We passed a bill before Christmas that would reduce costs by 11  percent, and that was from the CBO. The CBO said that, and we are not  exactly the biggest fans of that unique organization. Our plan would  actually fight fraud, which was highlighted in the GAO report.

Finally, we would actually give choice to individuals as opposed to  this one-size-fits-all debacle. We want healthcare, not a plan to  simply fund insurance companies.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698796/breaking-the-gridlock-act,2026-01-08,2026-W02

Democrat,Sheldon Whitehouse,Terminating the National Emergency Declared to Impose Duties on Articles Imported From Canada,"Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here in support of Senator  Kaine's effort to get this body to take a public view on President  Trump's mad declaration that we have a border emergency with Canada  happening right now.

I can tell you that if I go home to Rhode Island and ask people what  the emergency is in their lives, I wouldn't get one person who said:  Oh, we have got a real emergency with Canada. They are a huge threat.  That whole Canada situation, boy, that is dangerous.

This is nutty stuff, and it is dangerous stuff economically. Just in  Rhode Island, Canada is our largest international trading partner.  Twenty-two percent of Rhode Island's exports are to Canada, and we  import from Canada as well. And when the tariffs get reciprocated by  our Canadian friends after this ridiculous behavior from President  Trump, then that is going to affect all Rhode Islanders.

We buy a lot of energy, for instance, from Canada, and that is going  to raise costs for Rhode Island families. It is a direct hit to  people's pocketbooks. And as has been pointed out, this is just a shady  way to hit Americans in the pocketbook, to raise revenue so that this  phony-baloney budget resolution we are about to have to deal with can  open up revenues that they can then use as a justification for lowering  taxes for the billionaires and the big corporations who already pay way  too little in taxes.

Some billionaires pay no income taxes at all. The corporate share of  America's revenue has gone from about 30 percent of America's revenue  down to single digits. That is just a huge sucking sound pulling out of  America's revenue the revenue of the corporate entities, and it is not  the mom-and-pop flower store. It is the huge multinational that goes  and pretends that it is doing its business in Ireland or the Cayman  Islands or someplace and hides profits.

This is a tax racket against the American people that is now being  propped up and made worse by a tariff racket against the American  people. And the excuse is one of the dumbest ones ever: that the  emergency is fentanyl.

Well, Rhode Island was at the heart of the opioid epidemic. That is  why I worked with Senator Portman to pass the CARA bill, the biggest  addiction recovery response bill this body has ever passed. I take this  issue deadly seriously--not the President. Not the President.

Mr. President, 0.2 percent of the fentanyl in America comes across  the enormous Canadian border. If you did it like per mile of the  American border, it would be immeasurably small. And over this fake  excuse that there is a huge fentanyl problem, 0.2 percent, they are  going to dump enormous new expenses on American families.

People have called this a sales tax, and it kind of is because what  it does is it raises prices. It raises prices because the money that  the Federal Government takes in has to be recovered, and it gets  recovered from families, from people who are paying higher prices for  imported goods or higher prices for the domestic freeloaders who are  going to raise their prices to match the imported goods just the way  the fossil fuel industry raised their prices to match the foreign  prices of fuel after the Ukraine invasion and so gorged themselves that  they made the biggest profits off the American people in the history of  corporations.

It was the biggest gouge ever by the scoundrels of the fossil fuel  industry, and now we are opening the door for this to happen across all  industries.

American families are going to be hurt, and they are going to be hurt  hard. And it just puts revenues on the books that the Republicans can  then use to go and do what they really want to do here, which is to  make sure that all their billionaire cronies, everybody who is  surrounding Trump, all the pals in the Cabinet, and all the ones who  write the big checks to the super-PACs and who fund Republican  politicians don't have to pay taxes anymore.

It is ``Leona Helmsley Day'' here in the Senate. Taxes are just for  the little people.

Democrat,Jim Clyburn,January 6 Attack,"Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to  co-anchor the CBC Special Order along with my distinguished colleague,  Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland.

For the next 60 minutes, members of the CBC have an opportunity to  speak directly to the American people on the January 6 insurrection  attack, an issue of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus,  the constituents we represent, and all Americans.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay homage to the men and women who 5 years  ago risked their lives protecting the lives of those elected officials  who met in this Hall in fulfillment of their constitutional duties to  peacefully transfer Presidential power after the November 2020  elections.

Mr. Speaker, January 6, 2021, will be forever remembered for the  vicious unprecedented insurrection that took place on that date.

On December 31, 2025, the House Judiciary Committee released the  transcript of its December 17 private 8-hour interview with Special  Counsel Jack Smith, whose investigation into the events of that day led  him to describe January 6 as an event that ``does not happen'' without  President Trump.

Smith testified that Donald Trump is the `` `most culpable and most  responsible person' in the criminal conspiracy to overturn the results  of the 2020 election.'' He continued: ``These crimes were committed for  his benefit. . . . The other co-conspirators were doing this for his  benefit.'' Smith concluded that Trump caused the violence, exploited  it, and refused to stop it.

Mr. Speaker, I was in this Hall on January 6, 2021, and was among  those whisked away to an undisclosed location. My staff huddled behind  barricaded doors that were badly damaged by the mob that was described  by some of my Republican colleagues as ``patriots'' on a tour of the  Capitol.

Our valiant United States Capitol Police and first responders did  everything they could to keep us out of harm's way. Some were beaten,  strangled, and tased. This building, the people's House, was trashed,  damaged, and subjected to despicable acts.

Members of Congress and their staffs feared for their lives. Some of  the insurrectionists waived Confederate battle flags and exhibited Nazi  symbols, and some brave American citizens died. A Republican Senator,  Ron Johnson, said that by and large it was a peaceful protest.

Now, Mr. Speaker, this was not a peaceful protest. It was  unadulterated violence.

The President of the United States and all Members of Congress take  an oath to defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and  domestic. That oath is a recognition of the fact that there will be  times throughout history when we must deal with the enemy from within.

On the second day of his Presidency, President Trump granted blanket  pardons and commutations to nearly 1,600 of the rioters who stormed  this Capitol on January 6, 2021. The President decided that these  perpetrators should be pardoned and not pay for their crimes.

By pardoning these individuals, this President has made a mockery of  the pardon process and smeared the oath he took to uphold the  Constitution. These actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for our  democratic principles and the sanctity of the vote.

The great John Lewis once shared his great fear that ``one day we may  wake up and our democracy is gone.'' John and I often spoke of the  delicacy of our democracy and that its future was far from guaranteed.

On January 6, 2021, we came face-to-face with the reality of this  fragility, but our democracy also prevailed. We were not deterred from  doing our constitutional duty and certifying the legitimate results of  the 2020 Presidential election.

Even during this unrelenting campaign to weaken our laws and impede  justice, Members of this body have stood up for our Constitution. The  exceptional work of the bipartisan January 6th Committee, ably chaired  by Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, illuminated for the  American people the severity of the conspiracies behind the January 6  attack. Congress has also passed critical reforms to safeguard the  legal process for future Presidential elections to help ensure this  never happens again.

Earlier today, the leader of our caucus, Hakeem Jeffries, held a  special hearing to shed further light on the ongoing threats to free  and fair elections and the threats to public safety posed by some of  the violent criminals President Trump has let out of prison.

The threat to our democracy that we witnessed 5 years ago has not  lessened, and our obligations to be vigilant in its defense and  steadfast in our pursuit of a more perfect Union is as important as  ever.

The Constitution that binds this country together is a sacred  document that has guided our pursuit of perfection for nearly 250  years. We came close to derailing that pursuit on January 6, 2021.

If we refuse to acknowledge the facts and give due deference to the  violence that took place 5 years ago, we run the risk of abdicating our  responsibility to the American people to safeguard our Nation's core  principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

The insurrection of January 6 could very well be the worst domestic  attack on our government since the Civil War, which ended in 1865.

That insurrection incented much of my recently released third book  titled: ``The First Eight,'' which chronicles the trials and  tribulations of the eight African Americans who served in Congress from  my home State of South Carolina before me.

The book also highlights the social and political events that  occurred in the aftermath of the Civil War and calls attention to the  violence and lawlessness that occurred during their service and took  our great Nation into a dark place that lasted for nearly a century.

There are 95 years between number eight in their group and yours  truly, number nine. The book is a cautionary tale that reminds us of  the warning of the Spanish philosopher George Santayana that ``Those  who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.''

I fear that the danger John Lewis fretted about is facing us today.  The aftermath of January 6, 2021, continues to test our ability to  protect our freedom and willingness to continue our trek toward a more  perfect Union.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for his  comments and for his friendship for these 36-plus years, 30 years as my  colleague.

Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Clarke), chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, good evening. I am Congresswoman  Yvette D. Clarke, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus for the 119th  session of Congress, and proud Representative of New York's Ninth  Congressional District, located in central and southwest Brooklyn.

I rise tonight with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus  and the House Democratic Caucus to reflect on the solemn anniversary of  the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol.

The deadly insurrection of January 6, 2021, was not merely an attack  on a building, but a direct and violent assault on Members of Congress,  law enforcement, staff, and the very foundations of our democracy.

Today, this evening, we honor the extraordinary bravery of the United  States Capitol Police and other law enforcement officers who protected  our democracy and ensured that the attempt to overturn the 2020  election results failed.

Five years later, it is not lost on members of our Caucus that  efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, through false  claims of illegitimate voting, occurred during a year when we saw  historic participation of Black voters. That participation resulted in  Democratic victories up and down the ballot, as well as the election of  the first Black woman Vice President.

Today, we cannot ignore the reality that efforts to disenfranchise  Black communities are still ongoing. Soon, in the Louisiana v. Callais  case, the Supreme Court will decide whether section 2 of the Voting  Rights Act, which outlaws racial discrimination in our electoral  system, still allows Black and minority voters to challenge racially  discriminatory voting maps in court, making clear that the fight to  protect our democracy is far from over.

We will never forget the horrors of January 6, nor will we turn a  blind eye to the efforts that continue to threaten the promise of equal  participation in our democracy and undermine the very foundations on  which this Nation and its governance has been built.

The January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and the occupants of  the Capitol complex is a day that will live in infamy.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. I  now yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Mfume).

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.

I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).

Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I first thank both of our Members  of Congress who are co-leading this very important Special Order hour.

Five years ago, a violent mob attacked the United States Capitol to  prevent the peaceful transfer of power. Yet, on the first day of Donald  Trump's second term, he pardoned more than 1,500 criminals involved in  that insurrection carried out in his name.

This is just one action amid a comprehensive campaign to erase the  memory of what happened on that day. It is a slap in the face to law  enforcement who selflessly put their lives at risk to defend all of us.

Some of them lost their lives, like Officer Brian Sicknick, a New  Jersey native, who tragically died following injuries he sustained that  day. Many more are still dealing with trauma. In Brian's honor, I  introduced a resolution condemning those blanket pardons.

We must never forget their sacrifice. We cannot let Donald Trump and  his allies rewrite the history of one of the darkest moments in the  250-year history of this Nation.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.

Now I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. I  will now yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Foushee).

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. I  now yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Ivey).

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.

Kaptur).

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.

Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, first, I will recognize the CBC  and Chairwoman Clarke and Representatives Clyburn and Hoyer for hosting  this Special Order hour.

Mr. Speaker, five years ago, our Nation watched in horror as the  President of the United States incited a violent attack on this Capitol  to overturn an election that he lost.

At least 140 officers were viciously assaulted and injured, beaten  with flagpoles and fire extinguishers, sprayed with chemicals and  tased, all in defense of our democracy.

In the days and weeks following the attack, we lost five of those  police officers, those brave heroes. We mourn their loss.

The Department of Justice convicted more than 1,000 rioters and had  hundreds of cases pending. With a stroke of a pen on his first day in  office, President Trump pardoned every single one, putting violent  offenders back on our streets.

Since their release, what have some of those pardoned rioters done?  They have been charged with assaulting police officers, making  terrorist threats, and preying on children. That is who this President  set free: violent individuals and child predators.

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle ought to recognize the  darkness this day represents for our country. The Republican majority  must restore checks and balances and finally hold this President  accountable before it is too late.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.

Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his co-anchorship  of these few minutes that we have spent together here on the floor.

Mr. Speaker, you have heard from many of our distinguished colleagues  about the events of January 6, the insurrection that has been misnamed  by many of my colleagues. These issues are of great importance to the  members of the Congressional Black Caucus. In fact, they are of great  importance to our constituents and to all Americans.

When I think about this day, as many of us will be traveling all over  the country--in fact, I am going to be in the hometown of  Representative Kennedy to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day I think  on the 18 of this month--I am thinking tonight about King's letter from  the Birmingham City Jail, which many of us remember was written in  response to a letter that he had received from eight White clergymen  who said to King that they wanted him to leave Birmingham.

They told King that they thought he was a disruptive force, and they  thought that if he were to leave the community, things would be better.  They told King in their letter to him that they did not want him to get  them wrong because they believed in his cause, but they just thought  that his timing was wrong.

Mr. Speaker, King, in his answer to them, said that time itself is  neutral. The time is never right. Time is never wrong. Time is always  what we make it.

He had a concluding thought there that I have been thinking about all  day. King said that he was coming to the conclusion that the people of  ill will in our society are making a much better use of time than the  people of good will.

Mr. Speaker, I want us to think about that. Those people who came to  this building on January 6, 2021, did not have good will in their  hearts nor on their minds. They were people of ill will, and they made  pretty good use of their time. I will close with this.

King said: ``We are going to be made to repent in this generation not  just for the vitriolic words and deeds of bad people but for the  appalling silence of good people.''

Mr. Speaker, I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle who  have  been silent all day that they may live to regret that silence.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698554/january-6-attack,2026-01-06,2026-W02
Republican,Pete Sessions,Recognizing Christopher Aaron Mcgowen with A Congressional Veteran Commendation,"Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privilege to rise today  to present Christopher Aaron McGowen of Nacogdoches, Texas, as a  recipient of the 2025 Congressional Veteran Commendation in recognition  of his outstanding service to both his country and his community.

Aaron, a proud son of Nacogdoches, answered his country's call to  service in February 1992, when he entered the United States Army as a  Combat Medic. During his military career, he distinguished himself  through professionalism, courage, and selfless service. His commendable  service was recognized with numerous decorations, including the Bronze  Star Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal,  the National Defense Service Medal, the Combat Medic Badge, the  Parachutist Badge, the Driver and Mechanic Badge, and the Operation  Enduring Freedom Campaign Medal. These honors stand as a testament to  his steadfast commitment and the vital role he played in safeguarding  the lives of his fellow soldiers.

Following his honorable discharge, Aaron continued his life of  service by dedicating himself to veterans and his community. While  living in Washington State, he became an active member of the Combat  Veterans Motorcycle Association, contributing countless hours to  fundraising efforts that provided construction projects for disabled  veterans, ensuring safe homes and greater mobility for those who  sacrificed for our freedoms. He further demonstrated his compassion and  solidarity by volunteering at local VA hospitals and participating in  funeral escorts to honor fallen service members and veterans.

In 2022, Aaron returned to his hometown of Nacogdoches, reuniting  with his high school sweetheart, Melissa Milford McGowen, and resumed  his mission of community service. As a member of the Nacogdoches Lions  Club, he has worked tirelessly in the Vision Screening Program and  collaborated with the Nacogdoches County Veterans Service Officer to  ensure local veterans receive the resources and care they deserve.

His commitment deepened further in May 2023, when he assumed  leadership within the Nacogdoches Hero Foundation as Chair of the  Action Committee. Through this role, Aaron has made significant  contributions to projects that directly support veterans, law  enforcement officers, first responders, and their families, improving  lives and strengthening the bonds of community.

Christopher Aaron McGowen embodies the highest ideals of service,  both in uniform and as a citizen leader. His legacy is one of valor,  compassion, and unwavering devotion to others. It is an honor to  recognize him today with the 2025 Congressional Veteran Commendation.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696272/recognizing-christopher-aaron-mcgowen-with-a-congressional-veteran-commendation,2025-10-17,2025-W42
Republican,Brett Guthrie,Don't Mess with My Home Appliances Act,"Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1075, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4626) to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act  to prohibit the Secretary of Energy from prescribing any new or amended  energy conservation standard for a product that is not technologically  feasible and economically justified, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. GUTHRIE.  4626.

Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4626, the Home  Appliance Protection and Affordability Act, sponsored by my colleague  from Georgia's 12th District. This legislation modernizes energy  efficiency authorities to lower costs for households and protects  consumer choice.

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, or EPCA, was established in  1975 amidst the oil crisis of the 1970s. EPCA gave statutory authority  to the Department of Energy to regulate and set minimum efficiency  standards for a list of covered products, including stoves, water  heaters, and dishwashers, as well as certain commercial equipment.

At the time, Americans were dealing with the aftermath of the oil  embargoes that led to mile-long gas lines and fuel rationing. The  initial establishment of energy efficiency regulations was a matter of  energy security.

By reducing consumption through the use of innovative technologies,  we can insulate families from the harm caused by adversarial nations  restricting access to critical energy resources.

Madam Speaker, 50 years later, EPCA has remained largely unchanged,  but under Democratic administrations, the focus of conservation efforts  shifted from energy security to green policies that advance the far- left agenda.

During the same period, the United States has become the premier  energy-producing nation, while home appliances have simultaneously  become vastly more efficient.

During the 4 long years of the Biden-Harris administration, however,  the Department of Energy used EPCA authorities to regulate a host of  everyday products like dishwashers, freezers, and dryers. But these  regulations were neither based on what consumers need or focused on  affordability. They were rooted in ambitious climate goals.

While EPCA requires regulation to be economically justified and cost  effective, the Biden-Harris administration bent the rules so that  households and businesses may not see any efficient savings for  decades.

In fact, the Biden-Harris Department of Energy regulations on dryers  could take up to 46 years to see efficiency benefits, even though  household appliances are replaced every 8 to 9 years on average.

Americans are already paying 34 percent more for their energy bills  than they were in 2010. Households simply cannot afford more expensive  mandates coming out of Washington.

At a time when Americans are struggling to pay their bills because of  inflation caused by the Biden-Harris administration's spending spree,  the Home Appliance Protection and Affordability Act takes important  steps to provide necessary relief to hardworking families. Decisions  about home appliance should be left to American families, not  bureaucrats in Washington.

The Home Appliance Protection and Affordability Act institutes  commonsense accountability at DOE to protect consumers from  overregulation. Importantly, this bill will foster continued innovation  in energy efficiency technologies. Refocusing EPCA's authorities on  cost-effective efficiency standards will lower costs while continuing  to improve household appliance performance.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  4626, the Home Appliance Protection and Affordability Act to protect  consumer choice, to modernize EPCA authorities, and to lower costs for  American families.

Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, we are working on affordability. This whole bill is  about affordability. If we look, because of the current Biden-Harris  appliance policies, there is a 28 percent increase for refrigerators, a  25 percent increase for air-conditioners, and a 28 percent increase for  dishwashers.

The argument is they are going to pay more up front, but they are  going  to make it back in efficiency over time. A refrigerator takes 6 years  and sometimes, depending on which model you buy, 46 years to recoup the  increase in the value. These are Department of Energy numbers. It is up  to 10 years on refrigerators.

The question is: Do people want to pay a fourth more for a  refrigerator in the hopes that over the next 10 years they will get  that money back? It is just not realistic, and that is why we are  fighting for affordability.

When we look at the energy prices being up, we can look at a map of  the United States and see in which States they are up. They are higher.  They are higher in States that have policies like this. They come  particularly from blue States in our country. Local governments have  put the affordability crisis in their cities. State governments have  put the affordability crisis in their States.

I remember being in California just last year and putting gas in a  rental car. I looked over and I think I was paying well over $5 there  when I was paying about $2.50 in Kentucky. I remember looking over at  the guy next to me, and I said: Do you guys have any idea what the rest  of the country pays for gasoline?

It is just astounding. The policies have increased affordability, and  they come here and say we are causing the affordability crisis. With  the energy crisis, we are trying to keep power online, to keep it from  going offline so we can have affordability.

This is all about affordability. It is not about just having an  affordable product to buy. It is about buying a product of your choice.

I don't think we ever argued that anything in the Biden-Harris  administration meant that people were going to go in and take their  appliances out. When appliances only last 7 to 10 years and then they  are replaced, people are going to pay a fourth more. That is what we  are trying to fight. People are going to pay a fourth more and recoup  it in probably a longer time than that appliance has a useful life. It  is just not a good investment. It just doesn't make sense.

We think that EPCA should be reformed so that they do make decisions  based on what is affordable and what gives the best choice to the  consumers in America.

I proudly support this bill. I thank Mr. Allen for sponsoring it. I  encourage its passage.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1700166/dont-mess-with-my-home-appliances-act,2026-02-24,2026-W09
Republican,James Lankford,Nationwide Injunctions,"Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about two separate  issues that seem to be confusing in our current climate at this point.

The first of those is something called nationwide injunctions. Now,  for folks that don't track this issue of nationwide injunctions, they  have no idea what this means. I would tell you it is a fairly recent  thing.

We have three branches of government. Any civics student in middle  school knows that. We have the legislative branch, we have the  executive branch, and we have the judicial branch. All three have  unique roles. The legislative branch that we are in right now--we write  the law. The executive branch executes the law. The judicial branch  interprets the law.

Now, we know there is a difference between the House and the Senate.  The Senate has a responsibility and the House has a responsibility, and  they are different, but they are both in the legislative branch.

The judicial branch also has different pieces as well, just like the  legislative branch. There is the Supreme Court. We know that. It is  right across the street. There are nine Justices that sit there, and  they are the final decision makers on what the law says. But there are  also daughter courts. There are circuit courts below the Supreme Court,  and below the Supreme Court, there are district courts. District courts  are scattered all over the country, and those individual, small  district courts that are scattered all around the country--those  individual courts make a decision on the person that is in front of  them.

Now, again, this is fairly simple civics. When you have a Federal  case in front of you, you go to the district court, and you file, and  you get time in front of a judge. It may take time to be able to get  there, but they make a decision on what is in front of them. That is  what district courts do. They don't make decisions on something that is  in a different State. The fine judges that are in Oklahoma make  decisions about the case that is in front of them in Oklahoma. They  don't decide a case in Indiana because they are not in Indiana and it  is not a case filed in front of them; it is only the case filed in  front of them in Oklahoma.

Now, if there is a dispute about that, it can be appealed, and it  goes up to a circuit court, and it takes in a region. If there is a  dispute even there, they take it on to the Supreme Court.

It is pretty simple--until the last several decades. You see, prior  to 1960, there was no such thing as a nationwide injunction. No one  even considered that. But we started seeing this beginning point where  a district judge in a court in a single State would hear a case and  say: This is so big, I am not going to let this go to the circuit court  or to the Supreme Court. In my lower--in fact, lowest--court in the  Federal structure, I am going to decide for the entire country, not  just the person in front of me.

There were just a few that happened at that time, and the Supreme  Court kind of looked away because they seemed like big cases. But then  it started to rise.

During the George W. Bush administration, there were six nationwide  injunctions that were done in these local district courts. Under  President Obama, there were 12 nationwide injunctions that were issued.  Then under President Trump, the first term, there were 64 nationwide  injunctions.

More and more individual district courts decided: I have an opinion,  and I am not going to decide about the case in front of me; I am going  to decide about the entire country.

Under President Biden, there were 14 nationwide injunctions that  happened. In fact, President Biden's Solicitor General--the one who  actually argues to the Supreme Court--warned that nationwide  injunctions halt legal government actions and policies.

See, this is not a Republican-Democrat thing; this is a  constitutional thing. This is the U.S. Constitutional structure to say:  What is the role of lower courts? What is the role of a circuit court?  What is the role of the Supreme Court?

We as people in our Nation honor the constitutional construct. For  me, it is exceptionally important that the courts are blind to these  issues and that they take action on the case in front of them and not a  case that is not in front of them.

Senator Grassley has introduced a bill to rein in the use of  nationwide injunctions. His legislation is called the Judicial Relief  Clarification Act. It makes it very simple. It is an important piece of  legislation to decide how we are going to handle cases like this. It is  very simple: Courts decide the cases in front of them. That had been  the practice up until the early 1960s. We need to get it to be back to  that practice again.

It is not a Republican issue and not a Democrat issue. It is a  constitutional issue.

Nationwide injunctions are a backdoor way for judges to actually  write legislation and to bring the decision of the executive branch to  a halt.

The executive branch does have checks and balances, as does the  legislative branch, as does the judicial branch. Those checks and  balances are clear. If the executive branch does something inconsistent  with the Constitution, it goes to our Federal courts and quickly works  its way up through the district court, circuit court, to the Supreme  Court. The Supreme Court is the one who checks the executive branch,  not each district court around the country. It is the Supreme Court. We  need to be able get back to that process in the days ahead. That needs  to be done.

So I am looking forward to seeing Senator Grassley's legislation  actually move.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691654/nationwide-injunctions,2025-05-22,2025-W21
Republican,Jeff Crank,World War II Women's Memorial Location Act,"Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2290) to provide that the memorial to commemorate the sacrifice  and service of the women who worked on the home front to support the  efforts of the United States military during World War II may be  located on the National Mall, and for other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2290

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``World War II Women's       Memorial Location Act''.       SEC. 2. LOCATION OF COMMEMORATIVE WORK.

Notwithstanding section 8908(c) of title 40, United States       Code, the commemorative work to commemorate the commitment       and service of the women who worked on the home front during       World War II authorized by section 702 of division DD of the       Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note;       Public Law 117-328), may be located within--

(1) Area I, as depicted on the map entitled ``Commemorative       Areas Washington, DC and Environs'', numbered 869/86501 B,       and dated June 24, 2003; or

(2) the Reserve.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act, the term ``Reserve'' has the meaning given       such term in section 8902(a)(3) of title 40, United States       Code.

Mr. CRANK.  2290, the bill now under consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2290, the World War II  Women's Memorial Location Act, led by Representatives Dingell and  Fulcher.

During World War II, more than 18 million women stepped up to serve  this country on the home front. While many Americans recognize the  image of Rosie the Riveter, their work went far beyond the factory  floor. My grandmother served as a Rosie the Riveter, stepping up to  fight on the home front, as well. Women became welders, code breakers,  pilots, medical professionals, truck drivers, and community caretakers.  Their contributions were essential to the Allied victory, supporting  our troops overseas and redefining women's roles in American society.

In 2023, Congress authorized the creation of a memorial to honor the  women who worked on the home front during World War II. Under the  Commemorative Works Act, placing that memorial on The National Mall or  in the surrounding area requires an additional act of Congress. H.R.  2290 provides that authority, ensuring this memorial can be located in  a place of national prominence alongside other monuments honoring  wartime service and sacrifice.

This bill is bipartisan and straightforward. It properly recognizes  the contributions of millions of American women whose work was  essential to victory in World War II. By authorizing this memorial to  be placed on or near The National Mall, we affirm their legacy and  ensure future generations will learn from their examples of patriotism,  responsibility, and service.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 2290, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I am  prepared to close, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, this bill is about ensuring that the  contributions of millions of women on the World War II home front are  remembered alongside other monuments in Washington, D.C. This bill  commemorates America's wartime service and sacrifice. H.R. 2290  guarantees that future generations will see their stories represented  in a place of national prominence.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure,  and I yield back the balance of my time.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697726/world-war-ii-womens-memorial-location-act,2025-12-09,2025-W50

Democrat,Rashida Tlaib,Stop Body Camera Paywalls,"Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, we all know the public deserves full  transparency when it comes to holding police accountable for  misconduct. Instead, States and cities all across our country have  started adopting new laws to charge the public hundreds of dollars in  fees to view or access police body camera footage.

These videos are public records and are essential for accountability  and justice for victims of police violence. Putting this footage that  should be publicly available behind a paywall makes achieving  accountability much more difficult for our residents, especially those  who won't be able to afford it, and they tend to be the ones more  frequently abused by police.

That is why I am introducing the Stop Body Camera Paywalls Act to  prevent any State or unit of local government that creates a paywall  for access to these public records from receiving Federal law  enforcement grants.

Again, we must make sure that we have transparency, especially when  it comes to Federal law enforcement grants. This bill is a necessary  step in a wider effort to end police impunity for abuses and ensure the  utmost transparency, accountability, and justice for our communities.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698994/stop-body-camera-paywalls,2026-01-13,2026-W03
Democrat,Patty Murray,Alex Padilla,"Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to the  U.S. Senate, a place where people are elected by their constituents to  come here to be their voice--every one of us, Republicans and  Democrats, elected by the people whom we represent to come here and be  their voice and to do the job.

What is that job? To make sure that we are being their voice and  speaking out for them. And part of that has to be asking questions.  Part of that has to be demanding accountability, has to be getting  information so we can do the best job possible.

It is unacceptable that a U.S. Senator, in his own home State,  elected by millions of people, went to ask a question for his  constituents, to get an answer, and was brutally thrown to the ground  and handcuffed. That is wrong, and I cannot believe that we don't have  Senators on both sides of the aisle calling this out as outrageous.

This is what a democracy is about. It is about us coming to the U.S.  Senate, speaking out, asking questions, getting information so we can  be their voice.

What happens when that voice is stifled? What happens when that voice  is thrown to the floor and handcuffed? Our democracy is lost.

I have been here for more than 32 years. I have come to this floor  often to speak out, to be angry, to be a voice for my people. I have  never come this close to having tears in my eyes as I speak to both  sides of this aisle about this horrendous incident that occurred.

We are a democracy, but we can lose that democracy. It can be gone  unless all of us speak out and forcibly reject what happened to a U.S.  Senator and to send the message that in this democracy it is just, it  is right, it is part of our responsibility to speak up, to ask  questions, and to be able to have the knowledge we need to represent  the people that we come here for.

We use our voices, we use our votes to be a part of this democracy,  not violence. When violence is done by someone representing this  administration in a forceful way against a U.S. Senator, how does any  one of us go home and tell our constituents that they can be part of a  democracy, speak out about what they believe in?

This is so wrong. This is so wrong. I hope others speak up and speak  out and, as a voice, we say we want our democracy to succeed. And in  order to succeed, we need to be able to use our voices and to use our  votes and to ask questions without being forcibly thrown to the ground,  without being arrested by speaking up.

I say to the entire country: We have a democracy. We will lose it if  we can't use our voices. We will lose this democracy. None of us should  be silent. None of us.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692471/alex-padilla,2025-06-12,2025-W24
Republican,"Ralph Norman, Jr.",Recognizing David Mcmahon,"Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional  public servant, David McMahon, whose career reflects unwavering  leadership, unwavering patriotism, and a true commitment to the  security of America.

Dave has spent much of his life and service to the State of South  Carolina. He grew up in Charleston and today oversees the TSA  operations at the Charleston International Airport along with five  other airports all across South Carolina. He has served as a Federal  security director since January of 2020, managing operations and  directing security efforts all across our great State.

Dave's record of service is both extensive, and it is remarkable. He  has served as an honorary commander with the U.S. Coast Guard Base  Charleston through the Joint Base Charleston Program and has made  equally significant contributions to national security policy through  service and working on various groups.

Dave has had a distinguished record of service. Prior to his time  with the Coast Guard, Dave served as the deputy Federal security  director for Minnesota at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International  Airport. He also played a pivotal role as a primary field leader for  Super Bowl LII.

From assistant Federal security director roles to active director  positions, Dave has consistently delivered strong leadership and  results wherever he was placed. Notably, in the early days of TSA, Dave  helped federalize six airports while serving as a crisis management  coordinator.

His lengthy service record goes on. Prior to joining the TSA, Dave  served more than 4 years as a deputy sheriff with the Dane County  Sheriff's Office in Wisconsin. He also served our country for 12 years  in the United States Army, a tenure which included a combat tour in  Saudi Arabia and Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division.

His military roles included criminal investigator, patrol supervisor,  SWAT/sniper team lead, SWAT/police sniper instructor, and military  police officer basic instructor. Dave also taught criminal justice for  Central Texas College while stationed in Okinawa, Japan.

Dave's life is one truly defined by his service. His commitment to  our community, to our great State, and to our Nation has been  unlimited. Above all, Dave's family has always been his greatest source  of strength. Dave has been married to his wife, Jeanette, for over 39  years, and together they have raised two sons who continue their  father's proud tradition of service as members of the United States Air  Force.

Apart from his public service, Dave enjoys being with family and  spending time outdoors. Dave McMahon is truly a man of strong  character. At every moment, he has continually shown up with integrity,  with professionalism, and with a commitment to making his community  safer. He represents the very best of public service.

On behalf of the people of South Carolina, I am proud to acknowledge  Dave McMahon for his decades of service, his steadfast leadership, and  the example he sets for all of those who follow in his path. As a  father, as a soldier, as a public servant and steadfast South  Carolinian, his story is a reminder of the impact one individual can  have when they devote their life to the security and well-being of  others.

On behalf of our great State of South Carolina's Fifth Congressional  District, I thank Dave McMahon and wish him Godspeed in his well- deserved retirement years.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698763/recognizing-david-mcmahon,2026-01-08,2026-W02
Democrat,Seth Magaziner,Rescissions Act of 2025,"Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, more than any other day I have been in  Congress, the cruelty of the Trump administration and the Republican  majority is on display. They are asking us to rubber-stamp Elon Musk's  cuts to PEPFAR, which saves millions of lives treating people with HIV,  funding for clean water, funding to fight malaria, funding to help  people starving from famine.

Donald Trump and Republicans are doing this at the same time they are  giving trillions of tax cuts to the rich. While they are at it, they  are also cutting educational programming for children, like PBS.

Why are they doing this? It is not to reduce the deficit because this  $9 billion is a fraction of a fraction of the tax cuts they are trying  to pass for billionaires. These are the richest people in the world  taking food and medicine away from the poorest children in the world.

I have news for Elon Musk and Donald Trump and the billionaires: No  matter how much money you have, no matter how many poor people you take  food and medicine away from, it will not fill that hole inside of you.

To my colleagues in the House: History will judge us today. You have  the chance to be heroes. Vote ``no.''",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692518/rescissions-act-of-2025,2025-06-12,2025-W24
Republican,Laurel Lee,Supervision System That Improves Public Safety and Supports Successful Reentry,"Ms. LEE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Safer  Supervision Act, a bipartisan bill backed by Federal law enforcement,  probation officers, and public defenders. This broad coalition shares a  common goal: a supervision system that improves public safety and  supports successful reentry.

Today, more than 110,000 Americans are on supervision. Probation  officers are carrying caseloads so large that it is difficult to focus  on the individuals who truly need the greatest oversight.

The Safer Supervision Act restores individualized judicial  decisionmaking, creates a responsible path to early termination, allows  treatment-based responses, and focuses resources where they make the  greatest impact.

This is smart-on-crime reform that strengthens safety and supports  second chances.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Safer Supervision  Act.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697108/supervision-system-that-improves-public-safety-and-supports-successful-reentry,2025-11-20,2025-W47
Republican,Virginia Foxx,Recognizing the Siamese Twins Museum,"Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Siamese Twins Museum,  dedicated to Eng and Chang Bunker, located in Mount Airy, North  Carolina.

Born in Thailand in 1811, which was then referred to as ``Siam,'' Eng  and Chang were the first documented Siamese twins. Early in their adult  lives, they traveled around the entire world working in show business,  but decided to settle in the United States.

After becoming naturalized American citizens and following a short  stint in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, Eng and Chang, along with their  wives and children, made the decision to move to Mount Airy in 1854.

They settled on Mount Airy because they sought better farmland and  believed that the area presented many educational opportunities for  their children. They each had 13 children. Soon after moving to Mount  Airy, the two brothers became very successful in farming and were  regarded as upstanding members of their community. Their many  descendants have become very successful and prominent citizens also.

Mr. Speaker, the Siamese Twins Museum tells their story and does an  excellent job of highlighting their lives through artifacts and  interactive displays. Not only does Mount Airy house this museum but  also the Andy Griffith Playhouse and Museum. Of course, Mount Airy is  the prototype for the famous Mayberry series starring Andy Griffith.

Mr. Speaker, Mount Airy is a wonderful place to visit, and I  encourage everyone to do so.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697642/recognizing-the-siamese-twins-museum,2025-12-09,2025-W50
Democrat,Sheldon Whitehouse,253rd Anniversary of the ``gaspee'' Raid,"Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I take the Senate back to June 9 of  1772, and I read from Rory Raven's ``Burning the Gaspee.''

A handful of longboats glided across the water on a       moonless night. The men--some at the oars, other nervously       fingering muskets or clubs or handspikes--were silent as they       drew closer and closer to the silhouette of a schooner a       short distance away. A white British ensign fluttered from       the schooner's topmast in a humid breeze.

A sentry on deck peered into the darkness, catching sight       of the approaching boats.

``Who comes there?'' he called.

The men in the boats bristled at the sentry's English       accent.

``We mean to come aboard,'' replied a big man in the lead       boat. ``You cannot,'' the sentry shouted back. ``You cannot       come aboard.''

A moment later, the schooner's commanding officer came on       deck. Roused from his bunk, he stood at the rail in his       shirtsleeves. Raising a pistol, he warned the men not to come       closer.

Another man in another boat rose to his feet and declared,       ``I am the sheriff of the county of Kent''--

That would be Kent County, RI--

``I am the sheriff of the county of Kent, God damn you. I       have a warrant to apprehend you, God damn you. So surrender,       God damn you.''

The officer drew his sword and repeated his warning. Some       of the sailors under his command joined him, weapons at the       ready.

In one of the boats, a man turned to the friend seated next       to him, saying, ``Reach me your gun--I can kill that       fellow.''

The gun was handed over. Shouldering the musket, the man       took aim and the shot echoed over across the waters.

The officer doubled over and fell.

The officer involved was Lieutenant Duddingston of the Royal Navy.  The ship he was on was the HMS Gaspee, a naval vessel deployed as a  revenue cutter to harass the trade of the Rhode Island Colonials.

There is a bit more of a story around this because before the  challenge to the Gaspee that led to that shooting, the Gaspee had been  harassing other Rhode Island shipowners. One of them was a very  prominent individual.

The Gaspee seized a boat called the Fortune, and this reading is from  the chapter ``The Dark Affair, The Gaspee Incident'' from ``An Empire  on the Edge'' by Nick Bunker.

Unwilling to trust a local judge, he sent the Fortune round       to Boston, a step of doubtful legality that only made matters       worse. Unwittingly, the Gaspee had antagonized a family of       Rhode Islanders who embodied all the values for which the       colony stood.

The rum [on board] belonged to the Greenes, Quakers with a       farm or two, a saw-mill, and a forge for making anchors. The       navy had not the slightest idea who they were or why it might       not be wise to upset them. But one of the men who owned the       cargo was Nathanael Greene, who would soon shed his Quaker       beliefs to become the youngest general in George Washington's       army and his closest aid from Bunker Hill to Yorktown. As       Greene wrote soon after the arrest of the Fortune, the loss       of her cargo created ``such a Spirit of Resentment that I       have devoted almost the whole of my time in devising measures       for punishing the offender.''

Well, of course, Nathanael Greene was not only George Washington's  aide-de-camp and administrative officer, but he was also deployed to  lead the southern campaign in the South, which caused Lord Cornwallis  to write home to his wife to say:

That damn Greene is more dangerous than Washington.

So the Gaspee launched that spirit of resentment that led to a  General Greene more dangerous than Washington, a Rhode Islander.

The story of that day is fairly simple. On July 9, 1772, another  ship, the Hannah, is making her way north toward Providence when the  Gaspee comes after her, seeking to stop and board her and seeking to  seize her cargo.

Well, the Hannah was having none of it and continued sailing north,  so the Gaspee gave chase. In the course of the chase, the captain of  the Hannah steered the vessel over a sandy spit that sticks out where a  river comes into Narragansett Bay at a place called Namquit Point and  delivers a column of sand.

Now, the captain of the Hannah knew those waters well, and he knew  the depths well, and he slid over the shallows in his lighter boat. The  big-armed Gaspee coming along behind foundered on the sand in a falling  tide and was stuck. The despised Gaspee and the despised Lieutenant  Duddingston became a target.

The Hannah continued up to Providence that night. It was owned by the  Brown family, who ended up giving their names to Brown University, were  prominent merchants in 1772, and they rallied several longboats full of  men who that night, presumably after some refreshment, rode down from  Providence--miles down--to where the Gaspee was stranded.

That is where that incident began. It was those men in those  longboats on that moonlit night who decided they were going to rid  their beloved Narragansett Bay of the wretched and detested Gaspee, so  they ended up shooting the captain of the vessel, Lieutenant  Duddingston. He survived his wounds. They took the vessel. They  captured the crew. They took everybody ashore. They saw that medical  care was given to Lieutenant Duddingston. They came back out, and they  set fire to the Gaspee.

This painting, which hangs in my office, is a depiction of the Gaspee  on fire that night. As the fire burned, it came to the powder magazine,  and the powder magazine exploded. The Gaspee was blown to smithereens  across Narragansett Bay, and that was the end of her.

Now, the episode got rather lost to history. I will put it in a time  context. This is June 9 of 1772. This is more than a year before the  Boston Tea Party up in Boston Harbor. On that occasion, Massachusetts  Colonials painted their faces and boarded a civilian vessel and pushed  tea bags off it into Boston Harbor. That was Massachusetts.

Rhode Island's effort a year and a half before was to trick the  military vessel into grounding herself, come down the bay in longboats  at night, shoot the captain, capture the crew, and blow the boat up.

What more did we need to do to be in the history books? Well, we are  getting there. I give this speech every year.

Rory Raven wrote ``Burning the Gaspee.'' ``The Burning of His  Majesty's Schooner Gaspee'' by Steven Park. Makes an entire book.

And I just read ``An Empire on the Edge,'' from an entire chapter on  the Gaspee incident.

What happened afterwards is nearly as interesting as the destruction  of the Gaspee. King George was furious. Parliament was furious. An  enormous bounty on the heads of the men in those longboats was offered  by the King--over $100,000 in today's money.

And officials were sent from England to go and put on a trial. Find  these men, try them, and hang them. No one would talk.

About 60,000 people lived in Rhode Island back then, but it was a  close community, gathered mostly around the shore, a very prosperous  community because of its trading. And nobody would talk.

There was never any satisfaction to King George for his rages.

14, 2023]   Boston Tea Party? Rhode Island Says its Rebellion was First--and Just                                as Important                              (By Dan Diamond)

You'd be forgiven for thinking you know this story.

American colonists, itching for independence, stormed a       British vessel. A spark in New England helped ignite a       national revolution.

But this was not the Boston Tea Party.

Eighteen months before colonists dumped tea in Boston       Harbor--an event that marks its 250th anniversary this week--      Rhode Islanders attacked and destroyed a British navy ship       off the coast near Providence, furious with what they saw as       the crown's overreach.

The burning of the HMS Gaspee on June 10, 1772, was the       first major armed act of rebellion by the American colonists,       Rhode Island historians and officials maintain. And the       resulting fallout--with King George III demanding that the       perpetrators be held accountable in a showdown between the       colonial legal system and the British courts--helped unify       the colonies for the war to come.

``[T]his is a Matter in which the whole American Continent       is deeply concerned and a Submission of the Colony of Rhode       Island to this enormous Claim of power would be made a       Precedent for all the rest,'' founding father Samuel Adams       wrote to Rhode Island's deputy governor in January 1773.

But the Gaspee affair, which shook the colonies and rattled       the crown, has been largely forgotten outside of Rhode       Island. It's been overlooked in U.S. history classes and       remains little studied by historians of the American       Revolution. The Washington Post reviewed six high school and       college U.S. history textbooks and found no mention of the       burning of the Gaspee, even as multiple pages were devoted to       later--and, in the minds of many Rhode Islanders, lesser--      events such as the Boston Tea Party.

``Nobody knows that well before anybody pushed a tea bag       off a civilian ship in the Boston Harbor, Rhode Islanders       blew up a military vessel,'' Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.)       said in a recent interview in his office--sitting in front of       a painting that depicts the burning of the Gaspee.

The senator from Rhode Island has repeatedly given speeches       that celebrate the Gaspee raiders, and he's denounced the       attention paid to Massachusetts, saying that leaders of his       neighboring state have spent centuries spinning their own       history.

``They got drunk, painted themselves like Indians and       pushed tea bags into the Boston Harbor, which we in Rhode       Island think is pretty weak tea compared to blowing up the       goddamn boat and shooting its captain,'' Whitehouse told The       Post. ``But you know, all those Massachusetts people went on       to become president and run Harvard . . . so they told their       story, and their story, and their story.''

Rhode Island-based historians agreed that the Gaspee affair       is a case study in how important chapters in history become,       well, history. The state's own firsts--Rhode Island, for       example, was the first colony to declare independence from       Britain on May 4, 1776, two months before the other 12       colonies--tend to get relegated to footnotes in national       stories about the revolution.

``So much focus is put into Massachusetts history, and       Rhode Island gets overlooked,'' said Kathy Abbass, the       principal investigator of the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology       Project, which is working to locate the wreckage of the       Gaspee off the shore of Warwick, R.I. ``Partly that's because       the early histories were written by professors at Harvard and       Yale, which set the tone for all the histories that came       later.''                           The attack on the Gaspee

There's little dispute over the events leading up to the       burning of the Gaspee--only how historically significant they       were.

In Rhode Island, as across the colonies, residents were       bristling at the taxes, fees and other burdens imposed by a       British parliament an ocean away. That parliament, meanwhile,       grew frustrated by what leaders saw as Americans' efforts to       evade the responsibilities of being part of the British       Empire.

``The British were trying to raise money by capturing       vessels that were sneaking stuff in and not paying duty,''       Abbass said. ``And yes, of course we were smugglers [in Rhode       Island]--there's no doubt about that.''

Commanded by Lieutenant William Dudingston, a Scottish       naval officer, the Gaspee sailed into Narragansett Bay in       early 1772, seeking to enforce trade laws that the American       colonists were increasingly flouting. The British ship began       to abruptly board colonial vessels off the coast of Rhode       Island and seize their cargo, such as barrels of smuggled       rum. Accusations soon proliferated that the Gaspee's crew was       stealing sheep and hogs from local farmers, and cutting down       their fruit trees for firewood.

Rhode Islanders compared Dudingston to a pirate, sued him       in a local court (which found against him) and even sought       his arrest. But the British warned that anyone who attempted       to interfere in the Gaspee's work would be executed.

``Let them be cautious what they do; for as sure as they       attempt it, and any of them are taken, I will hang them as       pirates,'' British Adm. John Montagu wrote to Rhode Island's       governor in April 1772.

Then came June 9.

A small ship called the Hannah, reportedly owned by Rhode       Island entrepreneur John Brown, was headed toward Providence.       It refused the Gaspee's exhortations to stop--probably       because the Hannah carried illegal cargo--and the British       gave chase. But the Hannah's captain, a local man named       Benjamin Lindsey, knew the area better than Dudingston, and       he led the Gaspee into waters that had receded because of the       daily tides. The British ship ended up stuck on a sandbar,       waiting for the tides to change again hours later.

The Hannah successfully slipped away to Providence, where       Lindsey quickly recounted his tale to Brown, one of the       city's leading merchants, who was a member of the loose       resistance movement known as the Sons of Liberty and part of       the family that helped found Brown the Ivy League university       that would later bear its name.

Brown was also a smuggler--one of Rhode Island's most       notorious, Abbass said--and had been nursing a grudge against       Dudingston and his ship.

Learning that the Gaspee was temporarily marooned, ``Mr.       Brown immediately resolved on her destruction,'' Ephraim       Bowen, a local man who was among the several dozen men who       joined Brown, would recount decades later.

As many as 60 men gathered in the Providence harbor that       evening, launching boats and muffling their oars to quietly       row out to the Gaspee under cover of darkness. As they       approached the ship, a confrontation began--with one of the       Gaspee raiders asserting that Dudingston was a criminal who       had evaded the local law, Bowen recounted--that led to       Dudingston being shot in the groin and arm and all of the       ship's crew being taken from the vessel.

The Rhode Islanders burned the Gaspee to the water line       early on the morning of June 10. Then the gunpowder on board       exploded, sending pieces of the ship flying.

As news of the attack made its way to London, British       leaders seethed. In a royal proclamation, King George III       offered a reward of up to 1,000 pounds sterling--more than       $150,000 in today's currency--to anyone who could help       identify and convict the ``outrageous and heinous Offenders''       behind the ship's burning. He also established a commission       to conduct a formal inquiry, and the British vowed to       transport any colonists indicted in the attack to England for       trial and, almost certainly, execution.

But no arrests were ever made. Rhode Islanders refused to       volunteer information about the Gaspee raiders, and local       officials found ways to slow or stymie the British       investigation. Colonial leaders further argued that anyone       involved in the Gaspee's burning should face a jury of their       peers in America. A Rhode Island sheriff even arrested       Dudingston as he recovered from his wounds, charging him for       the Gaspee's previous seizures of cargo.

Meanwhile, the nation's founding fathers exchanged fervent       messages about the Gaspee's burning and the British response,       setting up the committees of correspondence that helped them       coordinate strategies in the years to come.

Adams, particularly, warned that Britain's determination to       pursue the Gaspee affair, and the discussion of the       deployment of troops, could lead to a cascade of events that       might spark ``a most violent political Earthquake through the       whole British Empire if not its total Destruction,'' he wrote       in January 1773 to Rhode Island's deputy governor, Darius       Sessions.

``I have long feard that this unhappy Contest between       Britain & America will end in Rivers of Blood,'' Adams wrote.                    An `uncelebrated burning' is forgotten

Most of the Rhode Islanders involved in the burning of the       Gaspee successfully concealed their identities from the       British and even other colonials, helping confound the       crown's probe. In some ways, their effort to hide was too       successful: Even today, about half the men who burned the       Gaspee are unknown.

But as the American Revolution began to slip out of living       memory, Rhode Islanders tried to lay a claim to the first       shot fired.

``The first blood that was shed in the revolutionary       contest, by that very act begun, stained her deck, and it was       drawn by a Rhode Island hand,'' William Hunter, a former U.S.       senator from Rhode Island, said in an address on July 4,       1826--50 years after the signing of the Declaration of       Independence. ``Yes, the blood of Lieutenant Duddington was       the first blood drawn in the American cause.''

Those efforts to highlight the Gaspee affair had limited       success. In the fight over the American legacy, Rhode Island       would end up largely nudged to the side--a casualty of a       battle between larger states, chiefly Massachusetts and       Virginia, that were disproportionately home to some of the       era's most influential figures.

``There was a very busy group of Boston-based intellectuals       who were eager to frame Boston as the driver of the       revolution and Bostonians as the inheritors of the legacy of       the revolution,'' said Nat Sheidley, a historian who runs       Revolutionary Spaces, a Boston-based organization that runs       public programs about colonial America--including this week's       anniversary of the tea party. He added that America's elite       leaders initially downplayed a number of revolutionary       events, such as the destruction of tea in Boston's harbor,       fearing that it would undermine the sense of order in the       young nation.

``But by the 1830s, it felt a little bit safer to go       there,'' Sheidley said. ``And so that's the moment where . .       . the name `Tea Party' is invented, and it becomes       popularized as a story of what led us to the revolution.''

A century later, a 1922 New York Times article detailed       ``the uncelebrated burning'' of the Gaspee and asked why the       Boston Tea Party had developed a ``much stronger hold'' upon       Americans.

``[A]s an exhibition of daring the tea party was literally       a tea party and nothing more compared with the Gaspee       incident,'' Jonathan A. Rawson Jr. wrote in the Times.                     The Gaspee affair's place in history

Even today, some historians are largely unfamiliar with the       Gaspee or suggest that its burning was a regional matter, The       Post found. But in Rhode Island, lore about the Gaspee is       thriving. For 57 years, local volunteers have held an annual       celebration--known as Gaspee Days--featuring a parade to       celebrate the burning of the ship, which is increasingly       joined by government officials, reenactors and thousands of       residents.

``Declare your independence from bank fees!'' reads one ad       from a local credit union in last year's 250th anniversary       booklet.

Other efforts abound. Rhode Island's secretary of state       offers free Gaspee posters on demand. A Brown University       instructor created a virtual reality app that allows users to       be immersed in a reenactment of the story. A license plate       depicting the burning of the Gaspee became available to state       drivers this fall--and it looks ``wicked cool,'' said John       Concannon, a retired pediatrician who is Gaspee Days'       historian.

It's all part of a larger state goal: to ensure that the       burning of the Gaspee is never forgotten again. Historians       who have studied the event said that it merits more mention,       particularly in textbooks.

``The thing about the Gaspee that is important was that the       king took notice,'' said Abbass, who has written about other       colonial attacks on British vessels that preceded the burning       of the Gaspee but provoked negligible reaction from the       crown.

The king's intervention also led to a British attempt to       circumvent the colonial courts, causing alarm and ultimately       backfiring on the crown, Concannon said. He argued that       several articles in the Declaration of Independence,       including the right to a jury of one's peers, stem from the       Gaspee affair--a more significant contribution to that       document than made by the Boston Tea Party, he said.

That's one reason this weekend's latest celebration of the       events in Massachusetts continues to vex Rhode Islanders.       When it comes to the founding of America, Concannon said, the       burning of the Gaspee is ``just as important.''

Philip Bump, Azi Paybarah and Dan Lamothe contributed to       this report.

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. And you can recognize the picture I just showed you,  it is in the article, and it does quite a good job of putting into  context this rebellious act by Rhode Island that took place nearly a  year before the Boston Tea Party and yet is mostly overlooked by  historians.

Here is another version of the Gaspee aflame before it explodes, and  here are the men in the longboats coming away from it having lit that  fire.

So it is important enough that I thought I might try a poetical hand  to it. I have read this before, and I will read it again.

Listen, my colleagues, and you shall see

How Rhode Islanders blew up the dread Gaspee.

Great Britain was fearsome, she ruled the sea,

But Rhode Islanders burned with the fire to be free.

So when George sent his frigate to tax our coast,

And its arrogant captain was heard to boast

That he'd soon have Rhode Island under his sway,

Well, a course was set for a fateful day.

Narragansett Bay sparkled bright and blue June 9 of 1772,

The trading ship Hannah was making her way

With cargo for Providence that fine day.

King George's Gaspee pursued in chase,

But the Hannah decided to give her a race.

Away fled the Hannah with wind in her sails,

As the Gaspee's cannon fired from its rails.

Evading the Gaspee's cannon balls,

The Hannah sailed for the Namquid shoals.

Fast and light, Hannah crossed the shallow,

But when the Gaspee attempted to follow,

She ran aground on the Warwick shore,

In a falling tide, and could move no more.

That night dark longboats with muffled oars,

Came slipping quietly down the shore,

To rid our Bay of the dread Gaspee,

And show old King George that Rhode Island be free.

The battle was fierce off Warwick Neck.

When the gunsmoke cleared from the Gaspee's deck,

The Rhode Islanders had her as their prize,

And her crew bound up in chains and ties.

When the crew was ashore, Pawtuxet's Rangers

Assured they'd present us no further danger.

Back to the Bay, in the dark of the night,

Went the Gaspee Raiders to set her alight.

The fire spread through the Raiders' prize,

'Til a blast filled the Narragansett Bay skies.

The fire had reached the Gaspee's magazines,

And her gunpowder blew her to smithereens.

Away sped the raiders into the dark,

Leaving in the embers freedom's spark.

``I want their names!'' King George demanded,

And ordered the Raiders be apprehended.

But his call for hangings came to naught:

His nooses hung empty; no charge was brought;

Because never a traitorous tale was told.

Rhode Island stood steady, silent, and bold.

The spark that was struck in the Gaspee Raid

Lit a flame that still burns in our hearts today.

And the lesson from then is a lesson now,

That every American still will avow.

``However majestic your powers may be,

You should heed our warning: don't tread on me.''

So that is the tale of the Gaspee. And one day it will get its  appropriate notice in history.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691707/253rd-anniversary-of-the-gaspee-raid,2025-06-02,2025-W23
Democrat,Chuck Schumer,Prescription Drugs,"Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on drug pricing, a few hours ago,  Donald Trump signed a new Executive order he claims will ``almost  immediately'' bring down the costs of prescription drugs. Americans  should hold their applause because Donald Trump's announcement is  little more than a photo op masquerading at reform, just as he said he  would bring down costs on day one, and it didn't happen--the same thing  here. ``Almost immediately''? Give me a break.

In case Donald Trump has forgotten, this announcement is like what he  already tried to do in 2020, with little success. So Americans are  right to be skeptical until they actually see their prescription drug  costs go down more.

Donald Trump can say he is doing an Executive order, but we all know  the odds are overwhelming that that Executive order will fail.

The real way to make drug price reform happen is to do what Democrats  do and what Donald Trump is loath to do: Roll up your sleeves and do  the hard work of passing legislation. That is what we did. That is why  insulin is $35 for senior citizens. That is why 20 of the most widely  used drugs' prices have plummeted, because we negotiated with Medicare.  That is why no family pays more than $2,000 total for all their  prescription drugs. We worked hard, we legislated, and we got prices  down.

Donald Trump does a photo op, says it is going to come down  immediately, but, obviously, this is a half-baked political stunt that  is unlikely to bring any meaningful change.

Today's announcement is so typical of Donald Trump's Presidency: He  promises a golden age, but, in reality, Americans get fool's gold.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690954/prescription-drugs,2025-05-12,2025-W20
Republican,Bruce Westerman,Recognizing Ms. Jayden Coffey,"Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional  young leader from my district, Jayden Coffey, a student at Cass Job  Corps in Franklin County, Arkansas, and the latest recipient of the  Westerman Award--a quarterly honor given to students who demonstrate  outstanding character, leadership, and service.

Jayden is a shining example of what hard work, humility, and  dedication to others can achieve. At Cass, she serves as the shop  foreman in the paint trade department, where she leads by example and  fosters excellence among her peers. Beyond her trade, Jayden is an  active member of campus leadership. She serves as Secretary of the  Student Government Association and as Vice President of her dormitory.  roles in which she consistently promotes a culture of respect,  accountability, and teamwork.

What truly sets Jayden apart is her servant leadership--an approach  rooted in humility and a deep commitment to others. Her excellent  people-skills and ability to inspire and motivate those around her make  her a trusted leader among students and staff alike.

Jayden's commitment to her community is evident both on and off  campus. She has volunteered her time at the local food pantry and  played a key role in a student-led campaign to collect non-perishable  items for blessing boxes in the community of Ozark, Arkansas, ensuring  those in need have access to essential resources.

Jayden is also blazing trails in traditionally male-dominated fields.  She is currently the only female member of the Fire Crew at Cass, where  she recently passed the Pack Test and earned her Red Card for wildland  firefighting. She participates in daily physical training to prepare  for her upcoming Fire detail and is a dedicated member of the Camp  Crew. Her passion for public service and emergency response will  continue after graduation, as she plans to pursue advanced training in  Fire and Rescue.

Jayden Coffey represents the very best of Arkansas' youth--resilient,  service-driven, and ready to lead. It is my honor to recognize her  today before this body and to commend her as a model citizen and  recipient of the Westerman Award.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692255/recognizing-ms-jayden-coffey,2025-06-10,2025-W24
Democrat,LaMonica McIver,"Education is of Great Importance to Congressional Black Caucus, Congress, and Constituents","Mrs. McIVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise and stand here today not as a  politician, but as a daughter, a mother, and a product of public  schools. I am here because I know what education can do, what it did  for me, what it has done for millions of children across this country,  and I cannot sit quietly as one of the cornerstones of our democracy is  chipped away.

What we are witnessing with the dismantling of the Department of  Education isn't just a bureaucratic decision. It is dangerous. It is a  decision that tells every child in this country that their future  doesn't matter, that their dreams are negotiable, that their ZIP Code  should determine the quality of their education.

Let me be clear, that is not just wrong, it is vicious because when  we give up on our schools, we give up on our communities. When we  defund education, we are defunding hope. We are telling a little girl  in the south ward of Newark, a little boy in the Borough of Roselle, or  a student living in Jersey City that their potential has limits, that  they weren't meant to retire.

However, I know better, because I have seen what happens when we  invest in our kids. I have seen how a great teacher can change the  course of a life. I have seen how a Pell grant can lift up a family. I  have seen young people go from classrooms with broken chairs to  boardrooms and executive suites because someone believed in them.

I have often said that education is the one thing no one can take  away from you, but right now Trump and his billionaire buddies are  trying to take away the very structure that ensures our kids get that  education in the first place.

It isn't about politics. This is about values. This is about who we  are as a country. Do we invest in the next generation or do we abandon  them? We are better than this. Our children deserve better than this.

I cosponsored H.R. 433, the Department of Education Protection Act,  to prohibit the use of congressional appropriated funds for any  reorganization or dismantling of the Department of Education. I urge my  colleagues across the aisle in this room to fight for our schools,  fight for our teachers, fight for every child who dares to dream beyond  their circumstances because they are watching, and they are counting on  us.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689640/education-is-of-great-importance-to-congressional-black-caucus-congress-and-constituents,2025-04-07,2025-W15
Democrat,Suhas Subramanyam,Social Security Customer Service,"Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, 74 million Americans depend on Social  Security, but because of the Trump administration's actions, customer  service has completely collapsed. The agency faces 6 million backlogged  cases, 12 million delayed field-office transactions, and some of the  worst wait times in history.

Why is this happening? It is because the Trump administration pushed  out 7,000 Social Security employees. That is 12 percent of their  workforce. Offices were reorganized overnight, hiring was frozen, and  thousands of workers were reassigned.

This has real-life consequences for my constituents, like a 75-year- old stroke victim who hasn't received his check for months because he  can't drive or use a computer, or an immigrant who may lose his job  because a name correction appointment is weeks away, or the retiree who  waited hours just to schedule an appointment on the phone.

Social Security is not a political experiment. It is a promise. The  American people paid into the system and earned these benefits. They  shouldn't have to fight their own government to receive them.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698683/social-security-customer-service,2026-01-08,2026-W02

Mr. McCLINTOCK.  616.

Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 616, the Foundation of the  Federal Bar Association Charter Amendments Act of 2025.

The Federal Bar Association was founded in 1920 as a nonprofit  organization. In 1954, Congress chartered the Federal Bar Association  as a congressionally chartered organization under title 36.

The FBA seeks to strengthen the Federal legal system and  administration of justice by providing services to Federal  practitioners, the Federal judiciary, and the public.

The FBA serves the Federal legal community by promoting standards of  professional competence and ethical conduct, providing educational  programs to the public and the profession, and facilitating the  administration of justice. The FBA is also committed to bringing civics  education programs to classrooms across the country.

Over the years, it has become necessary for the FBA to update its  bylaws. Because the FBA is a congressionally chartered organization, it  takes an act of Congress to make changes in its charter to permit the  FBA to update those bylaws.

S. 616 amends the FBA's current charter in several ways: It removes  the requirement for the FBA to be incorporated and domiciled in  Washington, D.C.;

It allows the board of directors to choose the location of the  principal office;

It specifies that the FBA's bylaws establish membership requirements,  responsibilities of the board of directors, and the election of  officers;

It prohibits a director or officer from contributing or participating  in political activities;

It prohibits loans to members and employees; and

It specifies that in the event of dissolution, any remaining assets  are to be distributed by as provided by the board of directors.

Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of S. 616, and I yield  back the balance of my time.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697185/foundation-of-the-federal-bar-association-charter-amendments-act-of-2025,2025-12-01,2025-W49
Republican,Nicholas Langworthy,Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  rule to consider H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The stakes for the American people could not be higher. We are  rapidly approaching a fiscal cliff. If we do nothing, the Trump tax  cuts, the most progrowth tax reforms in generations, will expire.

That means higher taxes on nearly every American. That means a gutted  child tax credit. That means small businesses will lose the tools they  need to survive and to thrive. That means less take-home pay for  working families that have already been crushed by the Biden-era  inflation.

This isn't some hypothetical scenario. This is the Democrats' game  plan. They want to raise taxes. They want to punish success. They want  more people dependent on government and fewer people building  independent lives. Republicans will not let that happen.

With H.R. 1, we are stepping in to lock in the Trump tax cuts  permanently and to provide targeted new relief to the workers and the  families who keep this country running: seniors, tipped workers, and  those putting in overtime to get ahead.

Mr. Speaker, this bill also takes a critical step to protect and  strengthen Medicaid, a vital program for millions of Americans.

Let me be very clear about something: This isn't anything radical. We  are restoring the same commonsense work requirements that President  Bill Clinton signed into law in the 1990s, one of the most popular  things he did.

Back then, a Democratic President worked with a Republican Congress  to say that if you are able-bodied and adult without dependents and  receiving government assistance, you should be expected to work, train,  or volunteer and participate in the economy. It worked. Poverty  dropped, employment rose, and millions of Americans moved from welfare  to work and independence.

Democrats today have abandoned that model. They want permanent  government dependency. They will oppose any form of accountability, and  they will vilify anyone who dares to suggest that opportunity should  come with responsibility. Republicans are standing up for what works  and what is right.

We are saying Medicaid must remain a lifeline for the truly  vulnerable: children, seniors, people with disabilities, and low-income  parents.

However, for able-bodied adults without kids, yes, you should try to  work, just like in the 1990s, just like under President Bill Clinton.

This isn't extreme. It is not partisan. It is proven policy that  respects both taxpayers and lifts people up.

Mr. Speaker, this bill delivers economic relief, fiscal sanity, and  basic fairness. It secures the future of our economy and our safety  net.

Let's choose the path that has been tested and proven to work. Let's  approve this rule. Let's pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and let's  get this country back on track.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693239/providing-for-consideration-of-senate-amendment-to-hr-one-big-beautiful-bill-act,2025-07-02,2025-W27
Democrat,Wesley Bell,No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025,"Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not just as a Member of Congress  but as the son of a police officer and as someone who spent nearly two  decades working in the justice system as a public defender, defense  attorney, judge, and as a prosecutor. I know what it means to uphold  the law, and I know what it looks like when the rule of law is under  attack.

This bill is not about judicial efficiency or fairness; it is about  power, raw, political power. The people who once cheered nationwide  injunctions when they served their agenda now want to eliminate them  because judges had the audacity to hold this administration  accountable.

It is a direct assault on judicial independence and many of my  Republican colleagues know it, but too many won't say it out loud for  fear of political retribution or a primary financed by Elon Musk. This  is not conservative, it is not constitutional, and history will  remember.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689721/no-rogue-rulings-act-of-2025,2025-04-08,2025-W15
Democrat,Luz Rivas,Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families,"Ms. RIVAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Leader Jeffries and Chair Ledger  Fernandez for hosting this important discussion on the disastrous  impact Republican cuts to Medicaid would have on women and children  across the country.

In the middle of the night, Republicans on the Rules Committee will  consider a bill that contains the largest cuts to Medicaid in our  country's history. This outright assault on healthcare will result in  13.7 million Americans losing their health coverage, including many of  the 370,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in my district.

This includes people like Yvette from Van Nuys who said that she  wants to retire without spending a large portion of her pension on  medical coverage.

I also heard from Joe from Panorama City who, without the help of  Medicaid, would not be able to afford medical treatments for his  children.

Cutting Medicaid will be a disaster for families across the country.  I stand with my House Democratic Caucus colleagues in protecting it  from Republicans' cruel and extreme budget.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691409/gop-tax-scam-hurts-women-and-families,2025-05-20,2025-W21
Democrat,Nydia Velázquez,Artificial Intelligence Wisdom for Innovative Small Enterprises Act,"Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.

Madam Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 5784, the AI-WISE Act.

Four years ago, AI burst into mainstream focus with the launch of  OpenAI's ChatGPT. When I first tried this tool, I was shocked. I knew  then and there that AI had the potential to revolutionize the way  American firms operate and do business.

AI, like all emerging technology, comes with risks. AI outputs are  prone to bias, discrimination, misinformation, and omissions. Safety  and cybersecurity vulnerabilities can render AI deployers open to  adversarial attacks. We don't even fully know this risk because we  cannot predict AI's trajectory, so new risk could come up as it evolves  and adds capabilities.

We have all seen reports of GenAI gone wrong, with episodes ranging  from customer service chatbots at car dealerships offering to sell  pickup trucks for $1 to general purpose chatbots advising small  businesses to break the law.

In other words, a small business using a flawed AI model risks steep  reputational and legal harm. Many of these incidents are attributable  simply to AI's current technological immaturity and the growing pains  that come with its ongoing evolution. This is why AI literacy is  crucial for small businesses to keep up with their larger competitors  considering and adopting AI.

The AI-WISE Act will direct SBA to create online AI literacy  resources for entrepreneurs, so they have the tools to make sound  choices on AI adoption and use. It will also direct the SBA to keep  their resources updated on innovations in AI technology through an  expert working group. Finally, the bill will allow the SBA resource  partners to develop specialized and localized assistance to best  educate their communities.

I thank my colleagues, Ms. Scholten and Mr. Downing, for  collaborating over the last 2 years to bring this bill to the floor.  Furthermore, let me convey my gratitude to Chairman Williams; his staff  director, Lauren Holmes; and all the floor staff for seeing this bill  through today. It is greatly appreciated.

Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I commend Ms. Scholten and Mr. Downing  for their dedication to our Nation's innovative small enterprises, and  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5784.

Faith is a member of Girl  Scouts of the Sierra Nevada, Troop 1306, and has exemplified  extraordinary leadership, innovative problem-solving, and a  demonstrated commitment to making a lasting, positive impact, by  earning the most prestigious award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award.

Gold Award Girl Scouts are recognized as trailblazers who are willing  to tackle the most pressing challenges facing their communities and the  world with measurable, sustainable, and far-reaching results. To earn  the Girl  Scout Gold Award, high school-age Girl Scouts must identify and  investigate an issue they care about, devise a plan, and then lead a  team of experts and community members to implement a project that  produces lasting change. Over the course of 1 to 2 years, Gold Award  Girl Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and  leadership, distinguishing them from their peers. Through their  resourcefulness and perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to  truly make the world a better place.

Faith McCrea created ``Emotions through Art,'' designed to help  students who experience anxiety and depression when dealing with the  pressures of school. Faith began by researching art therapy and how it  can help people who are dealing with negative emotions. Applying her  research on art therapy techniques, Faith's project helped students  express their negative emotions through art using colors and shapes.  Faith presented the color wheel to students and taught them how they  can use art to express and influence their emotions. She uploaded art  videos to YouTube for people to watch when they are feeling upset, and  she also passed out brochures that she designed with resources on how  to seek professional help if they need it.

On behalf of the 2nd Congressional District of Nevada,  congratulations to Faith McCrea for achieving the highest distinction  in Girl Scouts, the Gold Award.

Democrat,Joe Morelle,Recognizing Rose Bonnick,"Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Caribbean American  Heritage Month to recognize an exceptional public servant from  Rochester, New York: Rose Bonnick.

Born in Jamaica, Rose is a proud member of the Caribbean American  community and a tireless advocate for equity and opportunity. As a  Monroe County Legislator and Community Affairs Coordinator for New York  State Senator Jeremy Cooney, she has dedicated her career to amplifying  underrepresented voices and advancing policies that create a lasting  impact. Whether championing local initiatives or supporting statewide  policy efforts, she brings passion and dedication to every role she  undertakes.

Rose is known for her unwavering commitment to uplifting her  constituents, addressing systemic disparities, and building a stronger,  more inclusive Rochester. She embodies the very essence of public  service, leading with empathy and an unshakable belief in the power of  community.

Long before she held public office, Rose was deeply embedded in the  Rochester community through her longstanding work helping Jamaican  immigrants navigate complex landscapes of services and programs. She  became affectionately known among family and friends as a ``community  connector''--someone with a unique ability to guide others through the  hoops and ladders of life. Her knowledge of local systems and her  natural inclination to serve positioned her as a trusted resource and  advocate, particularly for new arrivals seeking stability and  opportunity.

She consistently creates spaces for engagement, education, and  empowerment, fostering the next generation of civic leaders. Her vision  of a more just and equitable society is not just spoken--it is actively  pursued through her daily work and presence in the community.

This Caribbean American Heritage Month, it is with deep respect and  admiration that I recognize Rose Bonnick. Her advocacy continues to  uplift and enrich our community, leaving a lasting impact for  generations to come.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692570/recognizing-rose-bonnick,2025-06-13,2025-W24
Democrat,Greg Landsman,Cuts to Healthcare and Food Assistance,"Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my constituents  and the thousands of folks that have called our office begging Congress  not to cut their healthcare or their food assistance all to pay for tax  cuts for the wealthy.

One of the calls came from a single mother who just moved to  Cincinnati to escape domestic violence. She is raising a daughter with  disabilities and relies on Medicaid and food assistance. She relies on  both to survive.

There is a 62-year-old woman on a fixed income. Food assistance is  the only way she has enough food.

These stories matter because Trump and congressional Republicans are  pushing this bill that cuts $300 billion from food assistance and over  $1 trillion from healthcare. Mr. Speaker, 16 million Americans will  lose their healthcare. Why? To pay for tax cuts for the superwealthy  and big corporate investors.

Democrat,Cleo Fields,Ending of Dei Programs Through Executive Order,"Mr. FIELDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about something that  happened on January 20.

On January 20, the President of the United States took the oath of  office at this Capitol. Shortly thereafter, he signed several executive  orders.

One executive order was Executive Order No. 14151. That executive  order ended all DEI programs. The argument that DEI initiatives  constitute reverse discrimination fundamentally misunderstands both the  history and the purpose of these programs.

DEI initiatives emerged as thoughtful, evidence-based responses to  documented inequities suffered by rural communities, minorities, women,  the poor, and the disabled. These programs represent America at its  best, acknowledging our Nation's shortcomings and tireless work to  overcome them.

The ratification of the 14th Amendment in 1868 codified equal  protection as a constitutional principle. Yet, Americans soon  discovered that simply declaring equal protection didn't automatically  create it.

The real challenge was in translating these legal guarantees into  everyday justice through their implementations. When the landmark  Supreme Court decisions in 2023 and 2024 further restricted race- conscious university admissions and workplace policies, they  accelerated a retreat from this understanding.

The history of DEI efforts in America is not some partisan agenda. It  is part of our Nation's ongoing work to ensure that America's promise  extends to every American. In 2025, as we face renewed attacks on these  principles, we must renew our commitment to this work.

Let me be clear: Diversity, equity, and inclusion are not about  guarantees and preferences; they are about removing barriers. They are  not about lowering standards; they are about ensuring that the  standards we apply don't inadvertently favor some groups while  disadvantaging others who are equally qualified.

When our military, for example, embraced diversity and inclusion, it  didn't become weaker. It became the most formidable fighting force in  human history.

When our businesses embraced diverse talents and perspectives, they  didn't become less competitive. They gained access to broader markets  and built the strongest economy in the world.

When our universities created more inclusive learning environments,  they didn't sacrifice excellence. Instead, they became global leaders  in research and education.

The world is always watching us to see what we will accomplish, but  now more than ever before, they are watching us to see who we will  become.

I still believe in an America where a child's potential isn't limited  to his ZIP Code, the color of his skin, their gender, or other factors  beyond their control.

I believe in an America where we can acknowledge our imperfect past  while working together toward a more perfect future.

Most of all, I believe in the fundamental goodness and fairness of  the American people.

When we move beyond slogans, when we truly see each other as fellow  citizens on one shared journey, we find that what unites us is far  greater than what divides us.

While the temptation is great, we cannot let this moment divide us.  We were never meant to be the divided States. We were created as and  have thrived for over 250 years as the United States.

Mr. FIELDS. Mr. Speaker, one of the problems I think that many people  have with DEI programs--which is one of the same problems they had with  affirmative action, if you recall--they viewed it as two parallel  lines, where you took a person who was less qualified and you elevated  him to the level of somebody who was more qualified.

That is not DEI. That was not affirmative action. Instead, people  should look at it as a circle and every single person within the circle  are all qualified to do the job, but there is just one single problem:  There are folks in the circle, although they are qualified, they never  get chosen. There are women in the circle who never get chosen simply  because they are female. Hispanics, Blacks in the circle don't get  chosen simply because of the color of their skin. People need to view  it as: Everybody in the circle is qualified, but DEI comes in and grabs  people who are not chosen only because of the color of their skin or  because of their sex.

Mr. FIELDS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.

What is interesting is when the President signed that executive order  to do away with three words: diversity, equity, and inclusion, it sent  universities in a tailspin. They didn't know what to do. In fact, the  President himself ended a program--and I am glad the gentleman from  Illinois serves on the Agriculture Committee. I am glad that you and  others wrote letters and he restored the program that gave  young scholars scholarships to go to college, 1890 universities. He  said that it was a DEI program, and then later he reversed it. It was a  program where these kids had to score high scores on the ACT in order  to qualify. They had to have high GPAs.

Not to mention the impact it has had on businesses. There are  businesses that have ended their DEI programs simply because of that  executive order.

Mr. FIELDS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.

Democrat,Seth Magaziner,Release Food Aid Sitting for 9 Months,"Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise for the 40th time to call  on the Trump administration to restore lifesaving food aid for  malnourished children.

When kids are starving to death, their organs break down. Even if we  are able to feed them conventional food, they cannot digest it. It  takes specialized nutrition to bring them back to health, including the  nutrition manufactured by Edesia Nutrition in North Kingstown, Rhode  Island, in my district, where thousands of boxes of emergency food aid  have been sitting in a warehouse since Donald Trump and Elon Musk froze  the program back in January.

They continue to promise that the program is going to come back  online any day now and that those boxes will be shipped, but it has  been 9 months.

Starving children cannot survive on promises. They cannot survive on  words. They cannot survive on tweets, purchase orders, or RFPs. They  need this food aid to move.

The administration needs to keep its word and act with urgency, and I  will speak on this floor every day until they do.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695582/release-food-aid-sitting-for-9-months,,
Democrat,Jonathan Jackson,No Tax Dollars for Terrorists Act,"Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.  I rise in support of H.R. 260, and I thank my dear friend  and honorable colleague, the Honorable Tim Burchett from the great  State of Tennessee, for his remarks.

Mr. Speaker, oversight of U.S. policy toward Afghanistan does not  have to be a partisan issue. We can all agree that we do not want  American dollars sent to Afghanistan to be diverted to the Taliban.  However, we must do so in a way that does not further alienate those  partners already reeling from the Trump administration's foreign  assistance freeze, which terminated nearly all humanitarian assistance  to Afghanistan, despite its compliance with U.S. law and policy.

Mr. Speaker, I am glad that Mr. Burchett was willing to work with  Democrats to address many of our concerns about this legislation. I am  also glad that this legislation contains important amendments offered  by the Honorable Representative Kamlager-Dove to require additional  reporting on the Haqqani Network, and Representative Keating to ensure  that the strategy required by this bill prioritizes Afghan women and  girls, as well as our Afghan allies. These amendments, adopted with  bipartisan support during the markup, underscore that there remains  considerable areas of bipartisan consensus in the House about our  Afghanistan policy.

Unfortunately, there is not a consensus about what the Trump  administration is doing on Afghanistan because they won't tell us. The  State Department has ignored multiple bipartisan requests from this  committee, dating back to February, for more information about the  deals it is making with the Taliban and the Haqqani Network. Despite  the fact that the Republican-led Congress enacted a law codifying the  Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, Secretary Rubio is disabling  the infrastructure supporting our Afghan allies and leaving Congress in  the dark.

Likewise, Secretary Rubio has abolished the Special Envoy for Afghan  Women and Girls, even as this administration lifted the Rewards for  Justice bounties on the leaders of the Haqqani Network, a group with  the blood of U.S. troops on their hands.

Mr. Speaker, we urgently need more information and assurances from  the Trump administration about their priorities in Afghanistan and now  Iran. I hope my colleagues on the other side will stand up for our  committee's oversight responsibility. For now, we are glad to have the  opportunity to work together on this legislation.

I thank, again, the Honorable Congressman Tim Burchett and all his  great bipartisan advocates. I encourage my colleagues to join me in  supporting  this measure.

Mr. Speaker, our Afghan allies risked their lives for America. The  United States must continue to do everything it can to support our  partners on the ground providing assistance to Afghan civilians,  including women and children, while also ensuring U.S. foreign  assistance isn't being diverted into the hands of the Taliban.

There remain considerable areas of bipartisan consensus in Congress  when it comes to our Afghanistan policy. This legislation will lean on  that consensus to help bolster our committee's oversight power and take  a step toward delivering to our Afghan allies the support that they  deserve.

Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me and support this bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692739/no-tax-dollars-for-terrorists-act,2025-06-23,2025-W26
Republican,Pat Fallon,Recognizing Congressional Patriot Award Recipient Corbett Howard,"Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Corbett Howard  of Celina, Texas, and present him with the Congressional Patriot Award.  Corbett has dedicated himself to faithfully serving our community.

Corbett was born in Roswell, New Mexico. He received his Bachelor of  Arts in History and Political Science from Southern Nazarene University  and graduated from Engineer Officer Candidate School in Fort Belvoir,  Virginia. After graduation, Corbett commissioned in the United States  Army and served with the Military Assistant Command, Vietnam (MACV) as  an advisor for the South Vietnamese Army. For his meritorious service,  he was awarded the Bronze Star, Air Medal, and Vietnam Cross of  Gallantry.

Corbett was first elected to the Celina City Council in 1999. In  2002, he was elected to serve as the Mayor of Celina and was reelected  twice. Under Corbett's leadership, Celina transformed economically  through increased job growth and critical business investments. As a  result of his advocacy for Celina residents, he was recognized as a top  influential leader in Collin County. After his tenure as mayor, Corbett  served as the Executive Director of the Celina Economic Development  Corporation for ten years. He also served on the Board of the Upper  Trinity Regional Water District and the McKinney Urban Transit  District. He is the past President of the Preston Trail Rotary Club and  the current Chairman of Government Affairs for the Celina Chamber of  Commerce. Corbett currently serves as the Market President of Lamar  National Bank and is a board member of the Military Warriors Support  Foundation, which donates homes and cars to wounded veterans. A devoted  man of faith, he attends the Stonebriar Community Church in Frisco,  where he has led Bible study classes for over 33 years. I am proud of  the work Corbett has accomplished, and I wish him continued success for  many years to come.

It is an honor to bestow Corbett with the Patriot Award for his  exceptional service to the people of North Texas.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690167/recognizing-congressional-patriot-award-recipient-corbett-howard,2025-04-28,2025-W18
Democrat,Richard Blumenthal,-9999,"Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today, marks the 60th anniversary of  the day that President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the Social Security  Amendments of 1965, establishing Medicare and Medicaid--cornerstones of  American healthcare. These programs provide millions, including 1.5  million people in Connecticut, with access to comprehensive and  affordable healthcare.

Nothing is more important than our health. As the saying goes, if you  don't have your health, you don't have anything; and if you don't have  healthcare coverage, which for most Americans guarantees treatment,  diagnoses, effective healthcare, you don't have your health.

I am here--I wish I could say--to celebrate these vital programs,  but, really, I am here to defend them, to defend them against deep and  damaging cuts made by Senate Republicans and the Trump administration.  Their budget decimates Medicaid benefits. It threatens rural and  pediatric hospitals. It increases health insurance premiums for the  majority of Americans. Let me repeat: It increases premiums paid by  everyday Americans--the majority of our fellow citizens.

Health insurers are already proposing a median premium increase of 15  percent in 2026. That will be the largest in 5 years, and that is just  an estimate. You know, if you have had any experience with health  insurers, that if they are estimating 15 percent, it could well, in  fact, likely be higher. These cuts are not about eliminating fraud or  waste in the Federal government; they are about delivering tax breaks  to billionaires on the backs of working Americans.

This bill is an absolute disgrace. The American people should hold  every Member who voted for it accountable when they are next up for  election.

It is the biggest Medicaid cut in our history. Over 900,000 people in  Connecticut rely on Medicaid for their health insurance coverage; 30  percent of them are children.

In fact, in Connecticut, Medicaid covers 41 percent of births and 68  percent of people living in nursing homes. The majority of people in  nursing homes, in other words, depend on Medicaid, and they could well  be thrown out of those nursing homes.

Under this bill, up to 158,000 people in Connecticut will lose  Medicaid, and 53,000 will lose their ACA coverage. Even those who keep  their health coverage will see reduced benefits and strained providers  as the State struggles to make up the difference. People in Connecticut  are lucky because there will be an effort to make up the difference,  but many other States won't have that ability.

Just to be clear, these cuts are going to have an impact on everyone  because the Medicaid Program is a huge source of funding for all  hospitals. All hospitals depend on Medicaid. Even if you are not there  with Medicaid coverage, the quality of care that you will receive will  suffer as a result of these cuts. So even if you have private health  insurance, your nearest hospital could close. You may have to wait  longer for an appointment to see a doctor. Your out-of-pocket costs may  increase. Hospitals will attempt to recoup that lost funding on your  back. They have no choice. They have to stay open, and they have to  cover their costs.

To make matters worse, my Republican colleagues refuse to extend the  ACA enhanced premium tax credits. And 112,000 people in Connecticut  rely on these credits to lower their monthly premiums. They are a  lifesaver. They are a lifeline to health insurance coverage.

Without the extension, 10,000 children are at risk of losing  essential services, and 81 small business owners in the State will see  their premiums skyrocket. Premiums will rise for small businesses as  well as individuals.

These numbers are staggering. They are stunning. But they fail to  capture  the human costs, the impact on everyday people who look out the window  in the morning as they have their first cup of coffee or see their  children at night for dinner as they come home and wonder what will  happen in the event of a healthcare emergency--not even an emergency.  What will happen in the event of the flu, COVID, or any of the other  kinds of healthcare challenges that may arise?

So the net result here in human terms is couples forgoing children,  grandparents losing independence, people seeing preventable deaths,  skipped checkups, burned out healthcare workers. That is the real cost,  the human cost, the impact on people's state of mind, their level of  anxiety, their ability to focus on work because of physical pain they  may have because of illness but also anxiety about how that illness is  going to be covered by health insurance.

These cuts aren't just numbers. They are children, they are families,  they are grandparents, people with disabilities, your neighbors, your  friends, and probably you at some point.

Republicans knew the consequences. There was no mystery here. They  knew the data. They chose cruelty. These cuts are cruel, and they are  stupid. They are dumb because we all know that preventing health  emergencies, providing diagnoses, catching illnesses early, and  providing care and treatment early, in the long run, saves money for  all of us.

It is unforgivable that they decided to turn their backs on millions  of Americans, including their own constituents whose health and well- being is on the line.

Since this bill passed, of course, some Republicans are trying to  walk back their vote--buyer's remorse. They had mixed feelings at the  time, perhaps. They are supporting tweets like repealing the Medicaid  provider taxes or boosting rural hospital funds because they see that  those rural hospitals in their own States are going to be closing. They  know the impact of Medicaid cuts on hospitals in all areas and people  in every part of their States.

But those efforts are doomed to failure. They fall short. The rural  healthcare fund doesn't come close to offsetting the losses rural  providers will face from the cuts of Medicaid, just to give you one  example. That is why I have joined Senator Wyden and Senator Schumer in  introducing a bill that will repeal the health provisions in the ``Big  Blatant Betrayal.'' It is not a Big Beautiful Bill; it is a ``Big  Blatant Betrayal.'' This measure would extend the ACA premium tax  credits.

Again, Medicaid cuts are reprehensible and reckless. Cutting the ACA  premium tax credits affects hundreds of thousands of people in  Connecticut and millions around the country, everyday middle-class and  working Americans who have to cover healthcare bills.

I am going to keep fighting against any legislative efforts that put  the interests and desires of billionaires over the needs of working and  middle-class Americans.

This ``Big Blatant Betrayal'' is, in fact, simply cruel and stupid,  and I hope my Republicans colleagues will join us in these efforts to  truly walk back and compensate for the disastrous impact, the  devastating affect it will have on families and working people all  across this great country.

I am honored to yield to our distinguished leader.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694385/9999,2025-07-30,2025-W31
Republican,Glenn Grothman,America Cannot Have Unlimited Immigration,"Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, Congress is leaving and won't be back  until next week. If it is like every other weekend, a lot of what you  see on television is going to be incidents going on in Minnesota  affected by the immigration situation.

I remind my colleagues and the American people that we are a Nation  of immigrants, but every year we naturalize about 800,000 new folks.  That is about five times what it was when I was a child. Mr. Speaker,  16 percent of the people in our country were not born in America. That  is the highest it has been since before 1890.

We have nothing to apologize for that we are not letting enough  people in this country. However, sadly, there are too many elected  officials who, in essence, want to get rid of the immigration laws.

Democrat,Adelita Grijalva,Protecting Healthcare for Millions of Americans,"Mrs. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Rivas and Randall  for leading on this very urgent healthcare issue.

Millions of Americans who depend on the Affordable Care Act are  selecting their plans right now, and what they are seeing are  healthcare options that they cannot afford due to Republicans' refusal  to extend premium assistance.

I am here today speaking on behalf of my constituents in southern  Arizona and those throughout the Nation. I am here for the parents that  are going through their monthly budget trying to figure out what they  can give up just to be able to pay for these premiums. I am speaking  for those who have the horrible feeling in the pit of their stomachs  because they know the risk of being uninsured, being one hospital visit  away from bankruptcy.

My Republican colleagues and, certainly, Donald Trump might not  understand this, but health insurance is not a luxury. It is a  necessity.

The facts are clear. Republicans paid for their trillion-dollar tax  giveaway for the wealthy by cutting healthcare, plain and simple.

Over 10 million people will lose their Medicaid, and now millions  more could lose their health coverage because they can't afford their  premiums.

Mr. Speaker, 22 million people, including 400,000 Arizonans with  marketplace coverage, are already seeing their healthcare premiums  skyrocket. These cuts mean the closure of rural hospitals in Arizona,  job losses in our healthcare sector, higher healthcare costs for those  with private insurance, and the overall stress to an already stretched  thin healthcare system.

The State of Arizona has estimated the impact of Medicaid cuts alone  to be $34 billion over the next 10 years.

For every $1 billion tax cut there is an estimated loss of 36,000  jobs across multiple industries. While the economic impacts will be  devastating throughout the State, the most immediate impact will be on  those going without needed healthcare.

Already a community health center in my district is feeling the  impact of the healthcare cuts. In 2025, they saw significant cuts in  their Ryan White part B funding.

Due to these cuts, some positions had to be eliminated and workflows  realigned, including the loss of medical case management and treatment  adherence support.

The impacts are real. For instance, a 29-year-old woman was diagnosed  with HIV during her pregnancy. She is a mom of two young kids, 7 and 1  years old. She has struggled with mental illness, depression, and  cognitive delay. Because she lacks daily adherence support for her  lifesaving Valley fever medication, she has been hospitalized three  times due to sepsis related to the condition.

Another 18-year-old with HIV who works as a landscaper has not been  able to get back on his medication due to the loss of insurance. His  employer does not provide insurance, and he makes too much money to  qualify for Medicaid. Now the health center team is trying to get  support from pharmaceutical companies for this individual.

These are the types of stories of real people that simply want to  live their lives. Illness and disease do not discriminate, neither  should Congress. Americans have had enough of cutting programs that  Americans need for basic survival, enough of the attempts to repeal the  Affordable Care Act, enough Republicans' skyrocketing costs.

It is up to Donald Trump and the Republican Party to decide if they  will join Democrats to restore these tax credits or whether they will  keep making life unaffordable for hardworking Americans. I urge the  Senate to act immediately and take up the premium extension bill passed  by the House.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698664/protecting-healthcare-for-millions-of-americans,2026-01-08,2026-W02
Republican,Kevin Kiley,Guidance Out of Darkness Act,"Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, the basic premise of this bill,  which I am happy to cosponsor, is that we should not have secret laws  in the United States.

A major opportunity that we have right now is to modernize our  government and to rein in the inexorable growth of the administrative  state, restoring power to our elected representatives, States, local  communities, and the American people themselves.

When we think about the administrative state, we think about all the  regulations that are churned out, one after another, and compiled in  the ever-growing Federal Register. The reality is, that is just the tip  of the iceberg. Layered on top of all of that are these so-called  guidance documents. These are memos, Dear Colleague letters, bulletins,  all manner of what is referred to as ``regulatory dark matter.''

With respect to the ranking member, this is not a melodramatic term.  It is actually quite appropriate. In physics, ``dark matter'' refers to  the mysterious substance that makes up about 85 percent of the mass of  the universe, but no one really knows what it is. Similarly, all of  these guidance documents make up a great deal of the regulatory  activity in our country, yet the agencies themselves can't even manage  to track them down. How is an individual or a small business supposed  to find out what this particular interpretation of the law is and how  it will affect them, let alone how Congress is supposed to figure out  how the laws that we have passed are ultimately being enforced and  administered?

This is a commonsense measure that says that all of these guidance  documents, which have real teeth when it comes to the enforcement of  regulations, need to be compiled in one place that is searchable and  accessible to every American citizen. It is a positive step for  transparency and toward restoring government by the people.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688392/guidance-out-of-darkness-act,2025-03-03,2025-W10

Democrat,Nikema Williams,Welcoming George Glezmann Home to Georgia's 5th Congressional District,"Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome my  constituent George Glezmann home from more than 2 years of wrongful  detention by the Taliban in Afghanistan.

George is home with his family in Atlanta in large part because of  the tireless efforts of his wife Aleksandra. A devoted Delta airplane  mechanic, George has an infectious zeal for life, travel, and  experience, and I know he is eager to return to a life of normalcy and  autonomy.

I also want to highlight the challenges that come from extended  wrongful detention: George has numerous medical conditions that arose  from lack of ongoing care, and his assets have been put in  conservatorship. The financial instability that came from George's  detention has resulted in him and Aleksandra losing access to stable  housing, a challenge exacerbated by George's ongoing conservatorship.

I am so pleased that George is back with his family, and words cannot  fully celebrate the work Aleksandra put in to bring her husband home. I  look forward to George's swift return to normalcy and autonomy with his  loved ones, back in Atlanta where he belongs.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691683/welcoming-george-glezmann-home-to-georgias-5th-congressional-district,2025-05-23,2025-W21
Democrat,Peter Welch,Recognizing Henry's Diner,"Mr. WELCH. Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the 100th  anniversary of an iconic Vermont institution, Henry's Diner. Henry's  Diner has provided delicious food, welcoming ambience, and classic  consistency to the Burlington, VT, community since 1925.

Henry's Diner was founded in 1925 by Henry Couture, a beloved  Burlingtonian and entrepreneur. At the time, diners were perceived as  lower-class, and women hardly ever ate at them. But Mr. Couture  dedicated himself to building an institution that was welcoming to  everyone. He included special touches to attract female patrons, and  the diner grew into a place frequented by all. Today, you can find  anyone from day laborers to college students to politicians enjoying a  meal under the original railroad cart ceiling.

Henry's 100-year tenure has not been without its challenges. A fire  in 1969 necessitated a months-long closure and heavy renovations to the  business. Still, care was taken to preserve as much of the original  diner as possible, and Henry's successfully reopened the following  year.

In the early 90s, a McDonald's opened directly across the street from  Henry's. Some feared this signaled a cultural shift and could spell the  end of the historic diner. However, the McDonald's closed years ago  while Henry's remains standing proudly on Bank Street. During COVID-19,  like many other Vermont businesses, the diner weathered staffing  shortages and temporary closures.

In the face of all these difficulties, Henry's has persevered. For a  century now, Henry's has remained a place where people from all walks  of life can gather over hearty food and a hot cup of coffee. The values  that characterize Henry's--community, kindness, and acceptance--are  Vermont values, and our state would not be the same without Henry's  sitting in the heart of Burlington.

Henry's has changed ownership multiple times across its history and  was most recently bought by Patricio Ortiz in 2024. Despite changing  hands, each owner has carried on the quality service that has made  Henry's so beloved. I wish the Ortiz family nothing but success in  continuing Henry's legacy and look forward to another 100 years of good  food and great company.

Thank you, Henry's Diner, for feeding the hearts and souls of so many  Vermonters.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694323/recognizing-henrys-diner,2025-07-29,2025-W31
