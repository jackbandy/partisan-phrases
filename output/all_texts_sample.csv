Democrat,Jacky Rosen,Recognizing the Significance of Jewish American Heritage Month and Calling on Elected Officials and Civil Society Leaders to Counter Antisemitism,"Ms. ROSEN. Madam President, I want to begin by thanking my colleague  from Florida for his bipartisanship and his partnership, including to  pass this bipartisan resolution to recognize Jewish American Heritage  Month by unanimous consent.

I also want to take a moment to speak about the horrific murders that  took place last night. Like so many other Jews in America and around  the world, I woke up this morning heartbroken by the news of yet  another unspeakable act of anti-Semitic violence that occurred late  last night, this time--this time--in our Nation's Capital, less than 1  mile from where I am standing this very moment. This shooting occurred  outside of the Capital Jewish Museum, where the American Jewish  Committee was holding a large event. And the shooter went there  specifically to target and kill Jews and people whom he perceived to be  Jewish.

This is anti-Semitism--plain and simple. There is no justification in  the world for carrying out or condoning this violent and vile hate  crime. It is pure anti-Semitic violence.

My heart is shattered for the two Israeli Embassy workers who were  killed, Yaron and Sarah--taken from us far, far too soon. Both were  committed to public service, social action, peace, the betterment of  the world. They were a young couple in love.

I have read reports that Yaron was planning to propose to Sarah next  week in Israel.

They were cruelly taken from us far too soon at the beginning of  their lives. May their memory be a blessing, and may their killer be  brought to swift justice.

It is a tragedy that these innocent lives were cut short by hate, and  it continues to be a tragedy that these incidents continue to occur in  the United States and all over the world.

Over the last few years alone, we have seen anti-Semitic hate and  extremist violence. It has done nothing but increase across this  country. All over America, Jewish people, we have been threatened,  beaten, verbally accosted. We have been killed just because of our  faith, just because of whom they are--because of whom we are.

We have seen horrendous anti-Semitic incidents and attacks on Jewish  communities, at schools and on college campuses, and Jewish-owned  places of business, and on synagogues and places of worship.

And incidents of anti-Semitism in the United States and globally have  risen dramatically since Hamas's brutal terrorist attack on October 7.  All of it--all of it--is wrong and has no place in our country, no  place in our society, no place in the world.

Those who commit these egregious acts, they want to send a message.  They want to terrorize Jews. They want to scare Jews. They want to  intimidate us. And it is vital that we all stand up together and send a  clear and forceful message, and the message is this: We will not be  afraid.

We will not be afraid.

We cannot be silent. There is desperate need to confront dangerous  and growing anti-Semitism in our country and around the world to show  that bigoted efforts to intimidate us will not work. We cannot be  afraid. We cannot be silent.

That is why I am here on the Senate floor today. By passing this  resolution and recognizing Jewish American Heritage Month, we are not  just celebrating the numerous accomplishments and contributions that  Jews have made to our country, we are sending the message back, a  message that Jewish people have a place in America; that this is our  home as well; that our lives, that they have value and they have  meaning, just like anyone else; and that our country stands with it.

So I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for allowing this  resolution to pass, and I want to thank Senator Scott of Florida for  his partnership in the effort to counter anti-Semitism and hate  everywhere.

Res. 246 submitted earlier today.

Ms. ROSEN. Thank you, Madam President. Again, thank you to all my  colleagues for passing this important resolution unanimously today.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691646/recognizing-the-significance-of-jewish-american-heritage-month-and-calling-on-elected-officials-and-civil-society-leaders-to-counter-antisemitism,2025-05-22,2025-W21
Republican,Brian Jack,"Providing for Consideration of H.J. Res. Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Department of Energy Relating to ``Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer Gas-Fired Instantaneous Water Heaters''; Providing for Consideration of H.J. Res. Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Environmental Protection Agency Relating to ``Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems: Procedures for Facilitating Compliance, Including Netting and Exemptions''; and Providing for Consideration of H. Con. Res. Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025","Mr. JACK. Mr. Speaker, in addition to the budget resolution, which I  support, I rise today in support of the rule for H.J. Res. 20, a  resolution authorized by the Congressional Review Act that will enable  our Congress to repeal a job-killing Biden administration regulation  that would ban and eliminate noncondensing tankless water heaters, an  American product made by blue-collar American workers in the heart of  my congressional district in Georgia.

This regulation was passed in the midnight hours of the Biden  administration on December 26, after Christmas and weeks after  Americans soundly rejected the Biden-Harris regulatory regime  administration, putting in peril the livelihoods of hundreds of my  constituents the day after Christmas.

To put this into perspective, noncondensing tankless water heaters  account for 40 percent of our country's tankless water heater market. A  majority of those noncondensing tankless water heaters are manufactured  in my congressional district by an incredible company called Rinnai  America Corporation.

These water heaters are the most advanced and efficient noncondensing  tankless water heaters on the market. Perhaps most importantly, Rinnai  America is the only company that builds noncondensing tankless water  heaters on American soil.

Rinnai America is headquartered in my hometown of Peachtree City, and  3 years ago, it opened a state-of-the-art facility in Griffin, Georgia,  two cities I proudly represent in this Congress.

Over 500 of my constituents are working to manufacture and market the  very water heaters the Biden administration attempted to outlaw. This  job-killing regulation imposed by the Biden administration is yet  another painful example of the left's war on hydrocarbons.

The purpose of this regulation is to try to single out and eliminate  an American manufacturer of noncondensing tankless water heaters.  Effectively, the Biden administration and the government were trying to  alter the market on their own by picking winners and losers, which is  something that consumers should do, not unelected nameless bureaucrats.

Mr. Speaker, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent  an enormous amount of time the past few weeks trying to convince  Americans they are the party of blue-collar American workers.

Well, in the spirit of bipartisanship, I encourage my Democratic  colleagues to join me in support of this resolution to protect and  champion hundreds of blue-collar American jobs in the heart of our  country. To my Republican colleagues, let's join together as a team and  end this war on hydrocarbons now.

President Trump's White House has explicitly endorsed this  resolution, and I urge all of my Republican colleagues to join us and  vote for this critical legislation to empower consumer choice and  champion American manufacturing.

I will close by saying, we expect this vote later this week. I hope  everyone in this House joins me in support of this legislation in  defense of blue-collar American workers.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688098/providing-for-consideration-of-hj-res-providing-for-congressional-disapproval-of-the-rule-submitted-by-the-department-of-energy-relating-to-energy-conservation-program-energy-conservation-standards-for-consumer-gas-fired-instantaneous-water-heaters-providing-for-consideration-of-hj-res-providing-for-congressional-disapproval-of-the-rule-submitted-by-the-environmental-protection-agency-relating-to-waste-emissions-charge-for-petroleum-and-natural-gas-systems-procedures-for-facilitating-compliance-including-netting-and-exemptions-and-providing-for-consideration-of-h-con-res-concurrent-resolution-on-the-budget-for-fiscal-year-2025,2025-02-25,2025-W09
Republican,Pat Fallon,Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026,"Mr. FALLON. Madam Chair, this year's NDAA builds on an outstanding  year for our military and ensures our servicemembers are a lethal and  ready force and that they are going to be a force that is going to be  able to project power and will be capable of confronting threats from  our southern border to our eastern flank.

This NDAA continues to root out the Biden-era policies that detracted  from our main goal, which, of course, is winning and fighting our  Nation's wars and, even better, deterring, so we don't have to fight  them in the first place.

DEI is gone. Merit is back. Standards are high. Our servicemen and - women will, once again, be the most highly trained, ready fighting  force the world has ever known.

In the last year, recruitment and retention soared. As a result, this  NDAA gives the services the end strength they need to build and sustain  a force equal to any mission. Not to rest on a great year for  recruiting, we are expanding access for our military recruiters at  secondary schools and other institutions of higher learning.

As our men and women in uniform are our priority, the NDAA authorizes  a 3.8 percent servicemember raise, and that is much-needed. It also  extends special pay authorities to attract and retain the best talent  in some of the most critical career fields.

Additionally, we are enhancing the subcommittee's oversight of the  Military Health System and remain committed to addressing the  persistent shortage of childcare for our servicemembers through  expansion of childcare pilot programs.

Finally, this NDAA continues to deliver on our long-term goals of  increasing quality of life because that is the one thing that is most  important. The chairman has done a fabulous job at that, so this NDAA  will continue to prioritize servicemembers and their families.

Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695131/streamlining-procurement-for-effective-execution-and-delivery-and-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2026,,
Republican,Jefferson Shreve,Indiana--College National Football Champions,"Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, last night the country watched something  nobody predicted: Indiana, national football champions. Our Hoosiers  beat Miami 27-21, and finished a perfect season and brought the title  home to Indiana.

I say that as a proud IU alum, former chairman of our IU Alumni  Association, over 800,000 living alumni strong. My wife, Mary, and I  have been cheering on our Hoosiers since our college days.

We will be talking about this play for a long time: Fourth and five,  Fernando Mendoza puts his head down, bounces off defenders, spins,  stretches, and powers in for the touchdown.

Coach Curt Cignetti took over just two seasons ago. There were no  shortcuts and no gimmicks. It was just work and belief.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate IU's president Pam Whitten, our AD Scott  Dolson, every player and coach, and our Hoosier fans who never gave up.

Coach Cignetti said of the season: ``It would be a helluva movie,''  and he is right.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699173/indiana-college-national-football-champions,2026-01-20,2026-W04
Democrat,Val Hoyle,Economic Populism,"Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I am Val Hoyle, and I represent the  central and south coasts of Oregon. I am a proud third-generation union  member with a background in sales and international trade, and I came  to Congress to fight for working people.

My family's path to the middle class was made possible because of the  labor movement. My grandfather emigrated from Ireland and worked as a  union laborer building bridges. It was hard work in unsafe conditions.  Those conditions are significantly better because of the building  trades unions.

My father was a firefighter and became president of his union to  fight for better wages and safer working conditions. The contract that  he and his team negotiated while management tried and failed to break  his spirit took his members from poverty wages to a family-wage job.  IAFF Local 789 is still working under that contract 40 years later.

Mr. Speaker, I grew up going to union halls and picket lines and with  my father fighting to elect proworker candidates. Naturally, I became a  member of UNITE HERE Local 26 as a union waitress during the AIDS  crisis, where fellow union members had the dignity of healthcare and  death benefits when they needed them because we belonged to a union. I  am proud to say that my son is a Teamster.

I understand what is at stake for the working people of this country  and my district because it is my story, too, and I came to Congress to  fight for everyday people to have a fair shot, live in dignity, and  make a fair wage while they work hard to provide for their families.

That is why I believe in economic populism, which is not just about  talking at people. It is about listening to them and truly representing  them. The fact is that workers feel left behind and that the two-party  system doesn't represent them.

Republicans have tied in with billionaires and restricted the rights  of workers to organize and have union representation wherever possible  while they are telling them that their enemy is their neighbor.

Too many Democrats show up on a job site seemingly from a sense of  noble obligation with wonky academic explanations about why everything  is fine, even when everyday Americans can't make ends meet. I had an  operating engineer tell me last week that he thinks that both parties  are pissing on his leg and telling him that it is raining.

We have to understand that working people do not want a handout. They  want a good job, a pathway to the middle class, and a comfortable  retirement. Those opportunities have slipped away for too many people.

When people tell us that they are struggling to afford prescription  medications, we can't turn around and tell them that they are wrong. We  need to listen to them and hold Big Pharma accountable.

When people tell us that they see government as overly bureaucratic  and complex, we can't dismiss that experience and say that it is all  fine. We need to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly.

Of course, addressing waste, fraud, and abuse is important. We also  need to make sure that our veterans, our seniors, and the most  vulnerable among us receive the benefits that they have earned and not  break government under the guise of efficiency.

Democrats are the party that champion and protect the things that  working people rely on, like the Affordable  Care Act, Social Security, stronger unions and workplace protections,  the 40-hour workweek, overtime pay, public education, and strong  consumer protections. However, we need more Democrats whose filter for  what they do in Congress is: Will this help working people, as opposed  to giving lipservice in some disconnected way?

We should all be fighting hard against corruption and for a real path  to the middle class. Young people want to be able to work one job and  afford to buy a home and raise a family, and that is not the reality  for too many Americans.

That is what Democrats should stand for and be working for every day.  Our party must embrace economic populism and fight to revive the  American Dream, standing up for working people and giving them a chance  to succeed.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689078/economic-populism,2025-03-25,2025-W13
Democrat,Valerie Foushee,January 6 Attack,"Mrs. FOUSHEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished leaders for this  opportunity.

Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago, our Nation witnessed an unthinkable assault  on American democracy when a violent crowd breached the U.S. Capitol  with one purpose: to overturn a lawful election and hold onto power by  force.

Law enforcement officers stood between that mob and the Constitution.  More than 140 brave officers were injured, and several lost their lives  defending this institution. Their courage deserves not just remembrance  but that we remain vigilant in upholding the rule of law.

The attack on January 6 was the result of a President who chose  division over truth, grievance over governance, and chaos over  accountability. That choice continues to threaten our democracy today,  as Donald Trump practices deliberate deception and escalating  extremism.

Republican,Bruce Westerman,Critical Mineral Dominance Act,"Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1032, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4090) to codify certain provisions of certain  Executive Orders relating to domestic mining and hardrock mineral  resources, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. WESTERMAN.  4090.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4090, the Critical  Mineral Dominance Act.

This legislation addresses one of the most urgent challenges facing  our Nation today: our growing and unnecessary dependence on other  nations for the critical minerals that drive our economy and sustain  our national defense.

The United States has never been more reliant on hard rock minerals  than it is today. Copper is the backbone of our electricity grid.  Nickel, cobalt, and lithium go into the batteries that power our  communications devices and back up critical infrastructure such as  hospitals and data centers. Rare earth elements make possible the  cutting-edge technologies that enable our economy to innovate and our  military to keep us safe.

The global mineral race is not optional. Over the next 15 years,  demand for copper and rare earth elements is expected to rise by 50  percent; cobalt, 150 percent; and lithium, up to 500 percent. Shortages  of all the above could be upon us within a decade.

Yet these minerals are right here under our feet. We have the safest,  most sophisticated, efficient, and environmentally friendly mining  technology and workforce anywhere in the world. The United States  should be the world's mineral supply chain. The only reason we are not  is because of our outdated, shortsighted Federal policy that hinders  domestic mining.

President Trump recognized the dangerous gap between America's  mineral needs and mineral production. Upon returning to office a year  ago, he signed three executive orders to help close that gap.

The first directed Federal agencies to correct or rescind regulations  that unduly burden domestic mining and instructed the Secretary of the  Interior to accelerate geologic mapping.

A second executive order required Federal agencies to prioritize  mineral development on viable Federal lands.

The third directed Federal agencies to assess the economic costs and  national security risks of our dependence on foreign minerals.

H.R. 4090, sponsored by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber),  would codify the natural resources-related provisions of these EOs and  require additional reporting from the Department of the Interior.

The reports will, for the first time, reveal the true costs that  mineral dependence imposes on the U.S. economy. They will clarify the  scope and location of America's vast mineral deposits.

During markup, the Natural Resources Committee worked in a bipartisan  manner to strengthen the bill, adopting two minority amendments that  required DOI to report to Congress on barriers to byproduct mineral  production on Federal lands and to examine projects with the potential  to produce hard rock minerals from coal ash and coal byproducts.

Mr. Speaker, the alternative to American mineral dominance is buying  foreign minerals from supply chains controlled by the Chinese Communist  Party. That is where we are now: mineral dependence. Mineral dependence  benefits no one except the CCP. Mineral dependence does not help the  environment. It does not drive economic growth. It doesn't make us or  our allies safer.

American mineral dominance will create thousands of new mining and  mineral-related jobs. It will establish the United States as the hub of  the world's mineral market. It will secure critical mineral access for  the U.S. military and for our allies.

Mr. Speaker, we need these minerals to build a better future. Our  choice is whether to lead the world in meeting that need as only we can  or to cede that responsibility to corrupt regimes, systems, and foreign  enemies we know will abuse it. The American people have made their  choice. It is time for us to honor it.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Stauber for his work on this legislation. I  urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4090, and I reserve the balance of  my time.

Mr. Speaker, there seems to be a lot of agreement on this issue.  There is the fact that we need more critical minerals in the United  States, and the demand for that is not going away. We need it for  economic security. We need it for national security. The rub seems to  be where these critical minerals and elements are going to come from.  What we are promoting is that they come from America.

The other argument seems to be that we need them but not in our  backyard. That has been the position of our country for far too long.

Mr. Speaker, instead of not in our backyard, it is much better in our  backyard because we have better labor standards, better environmental  standards, and better health and safety standards.

God has blessed our country with these deposits of minerals really  from sea to shining sea. We just need to be getting them out of the  ground here, creating American jobs while doing that, creating more  American jobs and more wealth while we refine those ores into metals  and then manufacturing from that.

That is what our vision is. We want to see Americans use American  resources to promote American security and American economic growth. I  wish we could all agree on that, but that is what this bill will help  to promote.

Mr. Speaker, if you read the bill, there is absolutely nothing in the  bill  about allowing foreign mining companies to come into the U.S. and  exploit our Federal lands, to bypass all Federal regulations, and  create scenarios like may have happened in some other country. Those  are just scare tactics to continue this idea of not in my backyard.

We all want these things. We all recognize that we need these things.  We have to have these critical minerals. We have to have these rare  earth elements, but the mindset is that we will just get them from  somewhere else. We will ship off our environmental issues to some other  country and let them deal with it instead of dealing with them here in  America, where we, again, have the most stringent rules, have the  highest expectations, protect human rights, protect the environment,  and promote occupational health and safety.

Show me some place in the world that does that better than we do. It  is certainly not Communist China, where all of these rare earths and  critical minerals are coming from right now.

Mr. Speaker, in preparing for this floor debate, I should have asked  my staff to bring posters of smoke and mirrors because it would be  fitting for the arguments that we are hearing that seem to try to  distract us from everything but the real issue. That issue is that we  are not producing the minerals and elements here in our country that we  need for our economy and our defense, and China is dominating those  markets.

Now, I agree with the gentlewoman from New Mexico: We should be  processing these mined materials here in the United States. We have to  ask ourselves the question: Why aren't we processing more minerals in  the United States? Number one is that we can't get new mines. Why do we  need a processing facility if we can't get the material we need to go  through the processing facility?

The other one is that we can't permit a new processing facility in a  timely manner and build it in a cost-competitive manner because of our  overburdensome permitting and regulatory processes and laws that we  have here in the United States.

This is the argument why we need permitting reform, why we need to  speed up the process, and why we need to give certainty to investors  that we can build here in America again.

When we talk about refining metals, let's talk about copper. In 1995,  we produced three times more copper than China. Today, they are  producing 10 times more copper than we are. We have two copper  smelters. They have 50. It is not because we don't know how to build  copper smelters, don't have copper deposits, or don't want to produce  copper in the U.S. It is the fact that there have been so many  obstacles and barriers put in place that it has driven that industry  overseas to other places.

It is time we bring it back here and do it in a more environmentally  responsible manner--again, with human rights protections, health and  safety protections, environmental protections, and the standards of the  United States. It is time we start doing this in our backyard and not  exporting our issues to other countries while we turn a blind eye to  it.

Mr. Speaker, let's look at the issue at hand here. I want to address  the policy issue and the weakness in the argument that we could  restrict mining companies to 10 percent Chinese ownership. That is a  bad policy decision.

It is a bad policy decision, Mr. Speaker, because if you are the  Chinese Communist Party and see a mine is getting ready to happen in  the United States, and it is going to be done by a company that is  traded publicly, you could go buy 10.1 percent and stop the project. We  don't need that kind of policy.

Plus, that policy doesn't apply to the jurisdiction of this bill. If  a policy like that needs to be designed, then it needs to go through  the Financial Services Committee.

Also, don't think, Mr. Speaker, that our opposition on this--being  China, for the most part--will not play dirty. What they do is when  they see any kind of mining project or processing facility considered  in the United States, they dump product onto the global market, driving  the price down to make the economics such that nobody would invest in  that project.

Fortunately, that is being addressed. Just this week, the  administration announced something called the vault, which will be a  repository for critical minerals. It will be similar to our Strategic  Petroleum Reserve. We will have strategic critical mineral reserves.

We need to be able to produce those critical minerals here in the  United States to put in that reserve, which will insulate against  foreign bad actors dumping in our markets to drive the prices down to  make projects not economically viable.

Again, the real issue here is that we need this material in America,  sourced by American mining companies, processed in America, and going  into American manufacturing. We can partner with our allies around the  world to help make this happen, but when we look at where the deposits  are, they are here in America. We have to produce oil and gas where the  oil and gas deposits are. We have to mine copper where the copper  deposits are.

Again, we are blessed to have all of those things here in our  country, but we are not utilizing them. Because we are not utilizing  them, we are allowing our adversaries to control the markets.

It is not just an economic issue. It is a national security issue.  That is why we need legislation like this legislation. That is why we  need permitting reform.

We talk about building processing facilities in America. We passed  the bipartisan permitting reform bill, but, unfortunately, many of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted against that.

The Senate is considering that now. Hopefully, the Senate will pass  that bill in a bipartisan manner, like we did in the House, but with a  larger bipartisan group. We can get it to the President's desk so we  can create certainty, so we can start building more processing and  manufacturing here in our country, and so we can utilize these abundant  resources that we have.

Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for speakers.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, I will reiterate the fundamental fact of  this debate. In the 21st century, America's economy, military,  healthcare, communications systems, and transportation infrastructure  depend on hardrock minerals.

There is no scenario where the United States and the rest of the  world aren't competing to purchase these critical minerals. The only  question is whether we are all competing for minerals mined here in the  United States or in mines controlled by our foreign adversaries.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, in 2024, the United States  was 100 percent net import reliant for 15 nonfuel mineral commodities.  Additionally, of the 60 minerals identified as critical by USGS, the  United States was 100 percent net import reliant for 12, and at least  50 percent net import reliant for an additional 30.

Mining them here is better for our economy, our national security,  our allies, and the environment. H.R. 4090 will help close America's  mineral production gap and begin to end our dependence on foreign  minerals.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699695/critical-mineral-dominance-act,2026-02-04,2026-W06
Democrat,Jonathan Jackson,Saying Good-Bye to A Giant,"Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, today we say good-bye to a  giant, a leader, a warrior for justice. Today, we mourn the passing of  my dear friend and brother in service, Congressman Sylvester Turner.

Mr. Turner was more than a colleague. He was family. He carried the  weight of his community on his shoulders, never once complaining, never  once backing down from a fight when the people needed him. He walked  these Halls not for power, not for prestige, but for purpose. That  purpose was clear: to uplift the forgotten and fight for the unseen and  to ensure that every child, no matter the ZIP Code they were born in,  had a fair shot at success.

His legacy will be defined by his lifelong fight for civil rights,  economic justice, and opportunity for all, but perhaps some of his most  visionary work was cofounding the Congressional Diversity, Equity, and  Inclusion Caucus that he, Congressman Fields, and I took on together  with urgency and purpose.

Sylvester knew that representation wasn't just a box to check, it was  the foundation of our democracy itself. He fought to break down  barriers, to build pipelines of opportunity, and to ensure that  government truly reflected the people it served.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688667/saying-good-bye-to-a-giant,2025-03-06,2025-W10
Democrat,Bobby Scott,Promoting Responsible Oversight to Eliminate Communist Teachings for Our Kids Act,"I rise in opposition to H.R. 1069, the so-called PROTECT Our Kids  Act. This bill would add a new stipulation that disqualifies public  schools from receiving Federal funds under the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act if the school receives contributions, materials, or other  resources from China or an individual or entity acting directly or  indirectly on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of  China.

The bill gives no guidance on what ``acting directly or indirectly on  behalf of'' means or how you are supposed to know and how a parent's  contribution to a school program should be evaluated, and really, are  you supposed to scrutinize all parents' contributions or just those  from parents of Chinese-American students?

H.R. 1069 would specifically prohibit Federal funding for any school  that operates the program sponsored by the Confucius Institutes or  Confucius classrooms. It is worth noting that although there may have  been a lot of programs in the past, right now there may be as few as  five Confucius Institutes in this country serving K-12 students. The  provisions of this bill will have to be administered not by those five  school systems, but every school district--15,000 school districts-- will have to administer the provisions of this bill.

As written, the bill would create significant administrative burdens  to our schools and chill community investment in our children. For  example, the bill would disqualify a school from receiving Federal  funds by simply accepting donations from a Chinese immigrant if it  turns out the immigrant is acting indirectly on behalf of the  Government of the People's Republic of China. That is if you can find  out.

The bill bestows upon the Secretary of Education the sole discretion  of deciding if an individual is acting indirectly on behalf of the  Chinese Government, the very department which the Trump administration  is actively dismantling. Without any additional funding or dedicated  help, schools would have to become investigators and determine if an  individual who wanted to donate to the school or participate in  parents' contributions could possibly be tied to the Chinese  Government. The justified fear of losing critical Federal funds would  almost assuredly lead schools to eye any well-meaning donations  skeptically, sowing distrust in our neighbors.

Now note, there is no limit to this level of funding. It doesn't say  contributions over $1,000 or over $10,000. It is any contribution. It  must be said that there is no credible evidence to support the claims  that China is exerting any inappropriate or undue influence over  America's K-12 public schools. Even the report from the group Parents  Defending Education, which makes these allegations, offers speculation  rather than verifiable incidents or actual influence.

However, even if we are able to verify that China poses a credible  threat to our K-12 schools, this bill, as written, does nothing to  actually address any national security threats. Instead, it seeks to  punish schools for accepting educational materials or participating in  cultural exchange programs. Actually, our schools would be the victims  of the undue foreign influence, but instead of deterring the bad  actors, the bill seeks to punish the victim and, in effect, punish our  students. The bill is, therefore, poorly written, poorly  tailored, misdirected, and ultimately counterproductive and not a  targeted national security measure.

Similar to H.R. 1005 and H.R. 1049, which we considered yesterday,  H.R. 1069, if passed, would force school districts already facing  shortages of teachers, counselors, and support staff to divert critical  time and resources from instruction to completing bureaucratic  paperwork. This is the very definition of an unfunded mandate. It  imposes obligations on 15,000 school systems without offering any  capacity or funding to meet that obligation.

Lastly, we have to note that the Trump administration is in the  process of trying to abolish the Department of Education, with key  responsibilities being shifted to other agencies. We are left with a  chaotic patchwork of authority and no one apparently left to actually  administer the provisions of this bill.

For those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I recommend a ``no'' vote on the bill  and reserve the balance my time.

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.

Mr. Speaker, when you hear the title, PROTECT Our Kids Act, you  wonder what this bill is all about. You might think it protects kids  from guns, protects kids from bullying, or protects kids maybe from  online predators; but no, this is from the foreign influence of China.

There is no credible evidence of any improper influence in K-12  schools, yet this is what the bill is about. It imposes sweeping  penalties that do nothing to enhance national security. It only harms  students. The apparent target of this legislation seems to be the maybe  five school districts that have Confucius Institute programs, but it  applies the provisions of the bill to 15,000 school systems in America.

All of this unfolds while the Trump administration works to dismantle  the Department of Education, leaving critical responsibilities  scattered throughout agencies. This bill wastes critical resources  without any apparent benefit.

Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697533/promoting-responsible-oversight-to-eliminate-communist-teachings-for-our-kids-act,2025-12-04,2025-W49

On behalf of the many  Eastern Orthodox Christians who call New Jersey home, including my  constituents at St. George Greek Orthodox Church in Clifton, I offer my  heartfelt congratulations and express deep admiration to His All- Holiness for his ongoing efforts to foster peace, understanding, and  stewardship of our shared planet.

Leading the church since 1991, His All-Holiness serves as a spiritual  guide for more than 300 million faithful Orthodox Christians around the  world. His commitment to engaging with communities and governments  around the globe, regardless of faith, has made him one of the most  recognizable and respected religious figures of our time.

While in the United States, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew will be  awarded the prestigious Templeton Prize for his outstanding  contributions to the advancement of science and spirituality.

Democrat,Alex Padilla,"By Mr. Padilla (For HimsMcelf, Mr. Cormick, Mr. Gallego, Mrs.Thank Senators Gallego, Cormick, and Britt for Introducing This","Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  bipartisan Housing Unhoused Disabled Veterans Act, which I introduced  today.

Let me begin by expressing my sincere appreciation for veterans and  members of our Armed Forces who have answered the call of duty and  sacrificed for our Nation. I firmly believe that those who serve our  country with honor, courage, and distinction deserve our Nation's  enduring gratitude. That  is why I have always been committed to supporting all those who have  fought for our Nation's freedom.

Currently, many disabled veterans are unable to access housing  programs for veterans because of how income is defined. The more severe  a disability is, the more disability benefits a veteran receives. Yet,  because of the way total income has historically been determined, this  means that veterans receiving the highest amount of disability benefits  often cannot access the housing assistance they need.

Congress must ensure that every veteran has access to stable housing.  While progress has been made in reducing veteran homelessness, there is  still more that we must do. Addressing these challenges requires a  coordinated effort between Federal, State, and local agencies and  strong partnerships with nonprofit veteran service organizations and  community leaders. We must do our part to remove redtape and make it  easier for veterans to be housed.

I remain committed to supporting policies that expand and increase  access to VA homelessness programs for veterans in need. I want to  thank Senators Gallego, McCormick, and Britt for introducing this  bipartisan bill with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us in  supporting solutions that ensure no veteran is left without a safe  place to call home.                                  ______",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690059/by-mr-padilla-for-himsmcelf-mr-cormick-mr-gallego-mrsthank-senators-gallego-cormick-and-britt-for-introducing-this,2025-04-10,2025-W15
Democrat,Marc Veasey,-9999,"Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Robert  ``Bob'' LeGrand, a pioneering figure in Texas basketball who passed  away on July 19.

From 1976 to 1987, Coach LeGrand, also known as ``Snake,'' led the  UTA men's basketball team, guiding them to their first 20-win season  and a historic NIT berth in 1981.

Snake was known for his energy, his drive, his showmanship, and his  humor. His legacy goes far beyond the wins. He helped the University of  Texas-Arlington Movin' Mavs wheelchair basketball program start, and he  was also very active in the Fort Worth chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi.  Coach LeGrand, or Snake, as everybody affectionately called him, was  someone everyone loved.

Madam Speaker, you would see him in downtown Fort Worth, and you  would see him in Arlington holding court with his sense of humor.  Regardless of your background, Snake was someone whom you embraced. He  is going to be missed. He was figuratively and literally speaking a  towering figure in our community. He will be greatly missed.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a milestone in the life  of Derrick Thompson, city council president of the city of Mount Vernon  on his 50th birthday celebrated this week. He will be doing the  celebrating on Saturday night of his journey so far. He is a graduate  of the Mount Vernon Public School System and now a professional in  education in that very same school system. Twice-elected to the Mount  Vernon City Council, he is serving for the second time as its presiding  officer.

Happy Birthday to Derrick. There is much more ahead for him and the  people he serves. We salute Derrick from the floor of the House of  Representatives.                    Saluting the Community of White Plains

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, the city of White Plains, Westchester  County's seat of government, is a dynamic city of over 60,000 people,  with major corporations headquartered there, such as Heineken USA,  Atlas Air, and Danone North America; a shopping mecca with major  regional businesses; as well as small businesses and large national  stores such as Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale's, and Nordstrom's. There is  a vibrant community with restaurants, entertainment, and more.

There is also a vibrant network of neighborhoods that link the  residents of the community: Battle Hill, Fisher Hill, Gedney Farms,  Rosedale, Reynal Park, Highlands, North Street, Carhartt, Gedney  Meadows, and more. They are linked by an organization that is the envy  of other communities in Westchester: the White Plains Council of  Neighborhood Associations. The group meets monthly to discuss the  concerns of each of the diverse neighborhoods, and they meet with local  elected officials to address the issues that arise. They link together  for the active and festive elements of community life, and it reaches  into the larger whole.

Let me salute the current leaders of the association: President  Michael Dalton, Vice President Sharon Woodford, Treasurer Tom Osbeck,  and Secretary Michael Sanchez, along many other active local  association presidents.

From the floor of the House of Representatives, we salute their  community-minded activism.                          Recognizing Tajian Nelson

Republican,Michael Rulli,National Coal Council Reestablishment Act,"Mr. RULLI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Latta for his leadership, and I  rise in support of H.R. 3015, the National Coal Council Reestablishment  Act.

Mr. Speaker, for decades, the National Coal Council was a powerful  voice for coal and a timeless champion for American workers and  American communities. Coal fueled the factories, powered our homes, and  helped build the greatest economy this world has ever known. It is  ridiculous to neglect this.

I feel today is a Paul Revere moment, where we are calling to  everyone to realize that the meltdown is coming. What I mean by that is  the grid is going to melt down. Simply, all one has to do is go back in  time three Christmases ago, when the American grid pretty much was  hours away from melting down.

Mr. Speaker, look at California and Texas. Look at the meltdowns that  have happened there. The grid is not stable.

The grid needs to be redone, and every coal plant that I toured in  Ohio said three Christmases ago, the call was: We need more generated  power, and we need it right now, and there was no more to give.

All we have to do is look at is the opposition party wants to  celebrate the European Union, and what does the European Union do?

They look for power from countries like Russia, like China, and like  India to use their coal-powered, generated plants to support their  grid. However, in America, we cannot wait to put coal factories out of  business. Just like in my district, with the Sammis factory, Joe Biden  couldn't wait to celebrate putting 800 jobs in the garbage and putting  our grid at jeopardy.

Paul Revere would be turning in his grave if he saw the jeopardy that  these people are putting our country through by putting the grid up  against the wall.

We have to take into consideration what could come in the future. I  do want to take a moment, and I want to thank President Trump and his  executive order that he knows that this bipartisan committee for coal  was established over the last 30 years, and it was a bipartisan  approach to make sure that national security, which is our grid,  because if our grid melts down, there is no security.

Particular to my district, I have seven or eight investors who, right  now, want to invest in new coal. They  want to make sure that the artificial intelligence companies and the  data mining companies come to Ohio. However, if there is no energy,  then nobody is coming to Ohio.

Today, more than ever, let's worry about national security, let's  worry that we can keep these lights on, and let's worry that this grid  is protected for our grandchildren who are not even born yet, so when  they say that this is a meaningless bill, it couldn't be further from  the truth.

This is the bill for national security. This is the bill that  President Trump signed into executive order. Today is the day that we  codify this into law.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues today to have a ``yes'' vote.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695766/national-coal-council-reestablishment-act,,
Democrat,Hillary Scholten,Public Service Recognition Week,"Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the tireless  dedication of our public servants.

Michigan is seeing the real-time impact of President Trump's and Elon  Musk's mass firings. I have heard and seen people's fears firsthand at  my townhalls because civil servants are the quiet force behind the  services that hold our communities together.

When a farmer in west Michigan loses a season's worth of crops, it is  the USDA employee who helps them adjudicate a crop insurance claim,  making sure they can recover and keep food on our tables.

Public servants are the problem-solvers, neighbors, and first  responders in times of crisis. They protect our food supply, ensure  veterans receive their benefits, and respond when disaster strikes.  These are the people who have devoted their careers to making our  country better.

We must continue to honor and support our public servants, not only  during Public Service Recognition Week,  but every week. Let us do right by them and the American people they  serve.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690734/public-service-recognition-week,2025-05-06,2025-W19
Democrat,Jill Tokuda,Maui Minute on Hud's Office of Community Planning and Development,"Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike,  came together to pass the American Relief Act of 2025, securing $12  billion to rebuild communities devastated by disaster. We made a  promise to North Carolina, Florida, Texas, and Maui.

Mr. Speaker, that promise isn't just being broken. It is being ripped  apart. What a slap in the face for those constituents when that funding  to rebuild homes, businesses, and communities gets delayed or even  withheld because the Musk-Trump administration plans to gut HUD's  Office of Community Planning and Development, the very team responsible  for getting billions of relief dollars to where they belong. It will be  essentially eliminated. That isn't streamlining or efficiency. That is  sabotage.

This week, I am proud to have led a bipartisan letter, signed by 47  Members of Congress, calling on this administration to not cut these  critical positions.

Mr. Speaker, opioid overdoses have become an epidemic in this  country. Last year, over 100,000 Americans lost their lives to  overdose, and fentanyl poisoning is the driving force behind that.

Mr. Speaker, it is not just the country at large that has experienced  this problem. In my own district, we have seen an over 1,000 percent  increase in the rate of fentanyl poisoning and deaths.

Mr. Speaker, I had the most difficult day in my over 20 years in  public office recently when I had to console one of my constituents, a  mother who lost both of her sons on the same day to the same fentanyl  poisoning event.

We must give our law enforcement the tools to combat this problem.  This bill does exactly that. It permanently reschedules fentanyl and  its analogues as a schedule I narcotic, and it gives our law  enforcement agencies the tools that they need to begin dealing with  this problem.

Democrat,Alma Adams,Fighting Dhs Immigration Raids,"Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, my community of Charlotte was under siege by the  Department of Homeland Security's campaign of terror last month. They  called it Operation Charlotte's Web.

Border Patrol agents engaged in extreme racial profiling, excessive  force, and brutal tactics, spreading fear in our community.

It was fear that shattered the car window of a U.S. citizen born in  Honduras. He was thrown on the glass-covered ground in handcuffs after  he already identified himself to agents.

It was fear when more than 30,000 Charlotte-Mecklenburg students, 21  percent of the student body, were absent from school on the Monday  after the raids began because parents were terrified that their  children would be victims of CBP's brutality.

It was fear as businesses shuttered their doors to try and protect  their customers and employees from being wrongfully targeted by these  Federal agents.

Cruelty was the point of their operation, but Charlotte never caved  in to their cruelty. Instead, citizens packed churches for training to  empower themselves to respond to Border Patrol agents. Parents band  together to safely get their children to school, and businessowners  patrolled the streets to protect their neighbors, their customers, and  their employers.

CBP's actions in Charlotte were deplorable and absolutely  unacceptable. I have already reached out to DHS and demanded  transparency on exactly what Border Patrol was doing in Charlotte. I am  still waiting for answers to my questions.

Make no mistake about it. My constituents want answers. I do, too.  They deserve the answers, and I am going to keep fighting for them.

Democrat,Salud Carbajal,Republican Budget Betrayal,"Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise on behalf of the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus. A number of members are going to come to  provide testimony tonight about what we perceive is a betrayal of our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle of the American people with  the recently passed budget resolution that really is going to provide  tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans in exchange for cuts in vital,  essential programs for working- and middle-class families.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here with my colleagues from the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus to call out the partisan Republican  budget resolution that passed last night for what it is. It is a rip- off of the American people. Their budget proposes reckless spending to  support billionaires and make everyday Americans foot the bill.

It cuts over $1 trillion, including $880 billion from Medicaid, in  order to partially pay for trillions of dollars in tax cuts for the  wealthiest people.

These tax cuts would not go to help everyday Americans. Instead, they  would go to the richest 1 percent.

Apart from that, it also increases the deficit and the national debt  to the tune of $4 trillion.

What happened to fiscal responsibility?

This is a betrayal of the American working middle-class families.  There are 80 million people in this country who rely on Medicaid. In my  district alone, over 236,000 people on Medicaid are at risk of losing  their healthcare. This includes nearly 100,000 children and 24,000  seniors.

Not only that, but the budget resolution would also go after the  Affordable  Care Act again, and it is projected to raise annual health premiums by  roughly $1,200 for 20 million people. It would force 7 million  Americans to lose their health insurance.

This budget resolution does nothing to deliver on the current needs  of the American people. As inflation continues to grow and threats of  trade wars persist, the cost of necessities like groceries, childcare,  and housing will continue to increase putting a greater burden on  American families.

Their budget resolution also earmarks $200 billion to supercharge  mass deportations that go beyond violent criminals.

Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, under this plan, we can expect even  higher prices for food and goods, and it further worsens our workforce  shortages. The reality is that undocumented workers make up 14 percent  of construction workers and roughly 42 percent of our agricultural  workforce.

Mr. Speaker, instead of helping everyday Americans, the cuts would go  to the richest 1 percent. This is a terrible circumstance.

Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Espaillat for his remarks.

Before I yield to our next speaker, I wanted to reiterate: Make no  mistake, under this plan we can expect even higher prices for food and  goods, and it further worsens our workforce shortages.

The reality is that undocumented workers make up 14 percent of  construction workers and roughly 42 percent of our agricultural  workforce.

Farmworkers help feed our Nation and allow grocery stores to stay  stocked with affordable fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, this  reality is not what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want  to admit.

On Monday I offered an amendment to the budget resolution so we can  move forward the bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act to provide  farmworkers with legal status so they can continue to work on our farms  in this country.

Not only is this the right thing to do, but providing farmworkers  with legal status helps provide stability and keeps our stores stocked  with affordable groceries and domestically grown food, also helping  American growers.

Instead, the Rules Committee blocked my amendment, and not a single  amendment was made in order. We need to do better than this and deliver  on lowering costs for the American people.

I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reconsider  this reckless plan that would benefit billionaires at the expense of  everyday Americans.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary  life and tireless service of Mary Ann Keckler, a remarkable advocate  for her fellow veterans and their families. Hernando County, and indeed  all of Florida, were fortunate to benefit from her decades of selfless  dedication. Mary Ann served as Disabled American Veterans (DAV)  Commander for Hernando County No. 67, and from 2018 to 2019, she held  the position of State DAV Commander. Her commitment extended to the  national level, serving on the National DAV Executive Committee from  2023 to 2024. In recognition of her exceptional volunteer efforts, she  was named National DAV Volunteer of the Year in 2014.

For more than 25 years, Mary Ann devoted her time to the James A.  Haley Veterans' Hospital (JAHVH), logging over 11,000 volunteer hours.  She played a pivotal role in the creation of both Fisher House I and  II, providing families of hospitalized veterans a place to stay during  long-term care. She was also instrumental in founding the monthly  Operation Helping Hand dinners at JAHVH SCI, ensuring that veterans and  their families received nourishment, fellowship, and support.

Beyond her service, Mary Ann was a loving mother and grandmother, a  loyal friend, and a fierce advocate for those in need. Her legacy is  one of compassion, leadership, and unwavering commitment. Through her  tireless work, countless veterans and their families have been  uplifted, comforted, and empowered. Her life reminds us all of the  importance of standing alongside those who have sacrificed so much for  our country.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1800

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Solidify Iran Sanctions Act       of 2025''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

(1) The Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-172; 50       U.S.C. 1701 note) requires the imposition of sanctions with       respect to Iran's illicit weapons programs, conventional       weapons and ballistic missile development, and support for       terrorism, including Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps.

(2) The Government of Iran has acquired destabilizing       conventional weapons systems from the Russian Federation and       other malign actors, and is funneling weapons and financial       support to its terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East,       threatening allies and partners of the United States, such as       Israel.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

It is the policy of the United States to fully implement       and enforce the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-      172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note).       SEC. 4. REPEAL OF SUNSET.

Section 13 of the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law       104-172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note) is amended--

(1) in the section heading, by striking ``; sunset'';

(2) by striking ``(a) Effective Date.--''; and

(3) by striking subsection (b).

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1800, the Solidify Iran  Sanctions Act of 2025.

The Iran Sanctions Act was enacted back in 1996. For 29 years, this  law has acted as the cornerstone of U.S. efforts to address the Iran  regime's malign influence. From its support to terrorist proxies to its  dangerous nuclear program, the impact of the regime's provocative  actions continues to be felt far and wide.

These sanctions are more important now than ever. As this  administration pursues a last-ditch effort to address the threat posed  by Iran's nuclear program diplomatically, these sanctions continue to  provide much-needed leverage to address the full range of Iran's malign  activity. They are a vital and necessary tool not only to deny Iran all  paths to a nuclear weapon and to cut off its enrichment capabilities  but also to counter Iran's malign influence abroad, including its  ongoing support to terrorist proxies like the Houthis.

What we see across the region and beyond is that the threat Iran  poses to the United States and our partners and allies is becoming more  and more entrenched. We need a policy response that is durable and  shows that we are committed, day in and day out, to choking off any  financial support to Iran's malign activities.

That is why, today, the House is considering the Solidify Iran  Sanctions Act, which would eliminate the upcoming 2026 sunset from the  Iran Sanctions Act.

We need to send Iran a clear and simple message. They cannot wait out  our sanctions. Our sanctions will not expire on some arbitrary date.  The only way to make U.S. sanctions go away is to stop the sanctionable  conduct and not threaten the United States' national security interests  or our allies, period.

The fact that we are considering this bill under suspension of rules  is hugely significant. It shows that eliminating this sunset is not a  partisan issue. Republicans and Democrats agree that we need durable,  long-lasting, and long-term pressure on Iran.

On October 7, the world witnessed the horror of Iran-backed terrorism  as Hamas brutally murdered over 1,200 innocent people in Israel.

Iran has been sponsoring Hamas for years. They were sponsoring  terrorists on the battlefield that I and many of our colleagues  participated in, just as it has been sponsoring Hezbollah and the  Houthis to attack Israel just over this past weekend, amassing  ballistic missiles, building armed drones, and expanding its nuclear  weapon program at an alarming rate.

The Iran threat is wide-ranging and multifaceted, and the Iran  Sanctions Act is the foundation of our tools to combat this threat. We  know this threat isn't going away anytime soon, so let's stop fooling  ourselves that a sunset makes any sense on these provisions.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in bringing our statutes  in line with the strategic reality on the ground.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690688/solidify-iran-sanctions-act-of-2025,2025-05-05,2025-W19
Democrat,Val Hoyle,Redesignation of Paterson Great Falls Nhp Facilities,"Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  249, a bill that would ensure that the name of Congressman Bill  Pascrell, Jr., will forever be etched into the landscape of the city  that he so passionately served.

This legislation would rename two beloved landmarks within Paterson  Great Falls National Historical Park, the Scenic Overlook Trail Bridge  and Overlook Park, as the Bill Pascrell, Jr. Scenic Overlook Trail  Bridge and the Bill Pascrell, Jr. Overlook Park.

These places offer sweeping views of the Great Falls, a symbol of  American ingenuity, labor, and power.

There could be no more fitting a tribute to a man whose career  reflected those same qualities. For decades, Bill Pascrell fought for  the people of Paterson and the State of New Jersey. Anyone who visited  Paterson, as I have on many occasions, knew that he lived, ate, and  breathed Paterson. That man loved Paterson and was Paterson.

Mr. Speaker, it is also fitting that, on the week that we honor  police officers, who put their lives on the line to protect and serve  us, this is the time that we will pass this bill honoring Bill  Pascrell. He never backed down from standing up for working people and  for first responders. From the halls of city hall to Congress, he was a  tireless advocate for working families, veterans, public health, and  local infrastructure. Yet, what defined him was his unshakable belief  in the potential of his hometown, a city that helped build America and  the city that he never stopped believing in.

By renaming these park features in his honor, we are not just  commemorating his public service. We are linking his legacy to a  history of American industry, immigration, and a resilience that Great  Falls represents.

Bill Pascrell deserves this legacy. He was a legacy. He had a great  sense of humor, and when he walked in, everyone knew he was in the  room. We miss him dearly here, and his name belongs in this place not  only in the official record, but in the very landscape of the community  that he loved.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691126/redesignation-of-paterson-great-falls-nhp-facilities,2025-05-13,2025-W20
Republican,Anna Luna,Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025,"Mrs. LUNA. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues are spending a lot of time  lecturing the American people on how this is going to require them to  show their papers. Last time I checked, during COVID they demanded that  if you simply wanted to go to a funeral, be with your loved one  while they are dying, or get married, then you have to show your  papers. In fact, in New York  City, Mr. Speaker, they were literally asking you for your COVID  passport.

Yet the SAVE America Act, a commonsense piece of legislation that  requires two things, voter ID, plus proof of citizenship, is being  labeled by people in the Senate and people in this very Chamber as Jim  Crow-era laws.

Let me remind the American people of history. It was the Democratic  Party who championed the Jim Crow-era laws. And this is the farthest  thing from it. In fact, Mr. Speaker, if you are doing that, then you  are insulting over 70 percent of your voters, Democrats, who believe  that voter ID is the best way to secure an election.

Then we have the argument that we have from BlueAnons saying that  Trump is trying to steal the election, and orange man bad, and this is  somehow going to fix the midterms. However, the fact is that if we are  going to play that game, then you would want voter ID and you would  want to secure the elections.

So please support this legislation.

I do not believe that Barack Obama in showing his voter ID was  engaging in Jim Crow-era law or pushing that type of perspective. And  for the same people who are advocating saying that Kristi Noem and ICE  will demand your personal information and you will be under  surveillance, might I remind them that they actually all authorized the  reauthorization of FISA, unreformed, that violated our constitutional  rights.

This is pretty simple. If you are not an American, Mr. Speaker, then  you do not get to vote in our elections. This not a free-for-all  country. A majority of Americans support this. A majority of the world  has voter ID in place. It is not racist.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues and the House Administration  Committee for doing this. I support all of my colleagues, and I urge  them to vote for this piece of legislation.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1700010/veterans-accessibility-advisory-committee-act-of-2025,2026-02-11,2026-W07
Republican,Bruce Westerman,Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Bureau of Land Management Relating to ``North Dakota Field Office Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan'',"Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 672, I call  up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 105) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Bureau of Land Management relating to ``North Dakota  Field Office Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management  Plan'', and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.

The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.

Mr. WESTERMAN.  Res. 105.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 105, led by  Representative Fedorchak of North Dakota.

This Congressional Review Act resolution reverses a resource  management plan, or an RMP, finalized in the waning days of the last  administration that locked up more than 4 million acres of land in  North Dakota.

Astonishingly, this RMP blocked coal leasing on 99 percent of coal  deposits in North Dakota and prohibited oil and gas leasing on an  additional 44 percent of Federal land.

North Dakota is a top 10 coal-producing State and the number 3 oil  and gas producer in the Nation. According to State estimates, North  Dakota produces 400 million barrels of oil, 1.1 trillion cubic feet of  natural gas, and 27.5 million tons of lignite coal annually.

To put this in perspective, North Dakota produces enough natural gas  to heat 15 million homes for an entire year, equivalent to 100 billion  kilowatt hours of electricity.

U.S. electricity consumption is projected to hit an all-time high  this year, and electricity demand will grow by as much as 128 gigawatts  through 2029. Fueled by new data centers and AI, these estimates of  electricity demand are five times higher than earlier forecasts.

The United States should be the world leader in energy and mineral  production. We are blessed with abundant resources. We have the  brightest minds, and we maintain the most rigorous and clean production  standards in the world. Yet, the anti-American energy policies pursued  by radical environmentalists in the previous administration crippled  communities reliant on energy jobs, weakened us on the global stage,  and enriched adversarial nations that were able to cash in as we took a  back seat in the global energy market.

The road to energy dominance and meeting this growing demand runs  through North Dakota. Advancing this CRA is the first step in helping  to unleash American energy and reinvigorate America's beautiful coal  industry, as President Trump has called for in his recent executive  orders.

This CRA is important not just to the people of North Dakota but also  our collective American energy and mineral security. If you have ever  worried about your electricity bill or wondered if prices at the pump  might cancel a family vacation, then you should care about reversing  ill-advised lockups of our energy and mineral resources.

Energy production is critically important to the Western way of life,  sustaining small rural communities and generating much-needed economic  activity. Passing this CRA will save an estimated 12,000 jobs in North  Dakota just in the coal industry alone.

This CRA is also crucial to prevent an estimated loss of $34 million  annually in State revenues from oil and gas production. These funds are  used to finance K-12 public education in the State.

What does this mean for children in North Dakota? Failing to pass  this CRA could result in a $441 reduction in the amount of funds spent  on each child's education annually. This means fewer after-school  programs, outdated textbooks, and more teachers having to reach into  their own pockets to fund basic schoolroom supplies.

It should come as no surprise that the previous administration  finalized this RMP over the strong objections of the State of North  Dakota. The State's concerns were ignored. Instead, the BLM plowed  ahead with this harmful RMP.

Good land management requires local buy-in and support. This RMP is  not supported by North Dakotans. The only people who support this plan  are the radical environmentalists who called the shots under the  previous administration.

I commend our current Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, who is  spearheading the administration's efforts to restore energy dominance  and listen to rural America. Secretary Burgum was the Governor when  this RMP was finalized, and he led the charge in opposing this Biden- era preservationist plan.

I have full confidence that under the leadership of President Trump  and Secretary Burgum, the BLM will emerge as an agency that works for  North Dakotans and all those rural Western Americans who live closest  to the lands.

I applaud Representative Fedorchak for her leadership on this effort  on behalf of her constituents to right this wrong. I also recognize  Senators Cramer and Hoeven, as well as my former House colleague and  good friend, Governor Kelly Armstrong, for their work in supporting the  CRA.

This CRA allows us to turn the page on a disgraceful chapter of  radical environmentalism pursued at the expense of the American people.  H.J. Res. 105 removes the bureaucratic barriers designed to prevent the  use of our abundant natural resources. It is an important step  necessary to unshackle American energy and minerals and unleash the  full potential of our great natural resources.

Mr. Speaker, what is ironic is the fact that Secretary Burgum, when  he was the Governor of North Dakota, vehemently opposed this resource  management plan, but the prior administration just brushed him off.  They didn't care what he thought or what the people of North Dakota  thought, just like they didn't care what the Governor of Montana  thought, what the Governor of Alaska thought, and what the people who  lived in Montana and Alaska thought.

All they cared about was what their NGO and environmentalist friends  in Washington, D.C., New York, and Los Angeles thought about lands in  faraway rural places and how they wanted to impose their will on what  happens in these rural areas where our resources abound.

Isn't it ironic that the resource management plans for the three  States that we are talking about are Alaska, Montana, and North Dakota,  States with very large landmasses, with abundant resources, and not a  lot of people? That is the definition of rural America.

The previous administration was attacking rural America, and they  used these misguided resource management plans as their tool to do  that.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, as we wrap up today on this final RMP, I  include in the Record this GAO report that found that the RMP is  subject to the CRA.                                                    U.S. Government                                           Accountability Office,                                      Washington, DC, June 25, 2025.      Matter of U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land           Management--Applicability of the Congressional Review Act           to North Dakota Field Office Record of Decision and           Approved Resource Management Plan      File B-337175                                    DIGEST

The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land       Management (BLM) issued the North Dakota Field Office Record       of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan (North       Dakota RMP). The North Dakota RMP replaced the 1988 North       Dakota Resource Management Plan and provides directives and       guidance for the management of BLM-administered lands across       North Dakota.

The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires that before a       rule can take effect, an agency must submit the rule to both       the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as the       Comptroller General. CRA adopts the definition of ``rule''       under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) but excludes       certain categories of rules from coverage. We conclude that       the North Dakota RMP meets the APA definition of a rule, and       no CRA exception applies. Therefore, the North Dakota RMP is       a rule subject to CRA's submission requirements.                                   DECISION

On January 14, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Interior       (Interior), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), issued the North       Dakota Field Office Record of Decision and Approved Resource       Management Plan (North Dakota RMP). We received a request for       a decision as to whether the North Dakota RMP is a rule for       purposes of the Congressional Review Act (CRA). As discussed       below, we conclude that the North Dakota RMP is a rule for       purposes of CRA.

Our practice when issuing decisions is to obtain the legal       views of the relevant agency on the subject of the request.       Accordingly, we reached out to Interior to obtain the       agency's views. We received Interior's response on April 18,       2025.                                  BACKGROUND       BLM Public Land Management

Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976,       as amended (FLPMA), BLM is responsible for developing,       maintaining, and, when appropriate, revising ``land use plans       which provide by tracts or areas for the use of the public       lands.'' BLM land use plans, referred to as ``resource       management plans'' (RMPs), establish goals and objectives to       guide future land and resource management actions implemented       by BLM. Pursuant to FLPMA, BLM established procedures for the       development, revision, and amendment of RMPs.

The objective of resource management planning is to       maximize resource values for the public through a rational,       consistently applied set of regulations and procedures which       promote the concept of multiple use management. An RMP       generally establishes land use designations; allowable       resource uses, resource conditions, goals, and objectives;       program constraints and general management practices; areas       to be covered by more specific plans; and other related       information.      North Dakota Resource Management Plan

BLM determined that its 1988 North Dakota RMP needed       revision to address significant changes in resource       conditions, evolving demands for land use, advances in       technology, updated policies and program guidance, and the       availability of new scientific data since the original RMP       was developed in 1988. On July 28, 2020, BLM issued a notice       in the Federal Register initiating the process to revise the       1988 North Dakota RMP.

On January 8, 2025, following a comprehensive planning       process, including public scoping and comment, data analysis,       alternative development, environmental review, stakeholder       engagement, and selection of a preferred management approach,       BLM approved the North Dakota RMP through a Record of       Decision (ROD) incorporated into the document. The ROD states       that it represents the agency's final decision, issued after       completing procedures required by FLPMA, environmental       reviews in accordance with the National Environmental Policy       Act (NEPA), and considering public comments.

The North Dakota RMP provides directives and guidance on       how 58,500 acres of BLM-administered surface land and 4.1       million acres of BLM-administered mineral estate, mostly       split estate, across North Dakota will be used and managed       over the next 20 years. More specifically, it establishes       various land uses for recreation, motorized vehicles, oil and       gas leasing, renewable energy projects, grazing, wildlife       habitat protection, and cultural preservation.      Congressional Review Act

CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires federal agencies to submit a       report on each new rule to both houses of Congress and to the       Comptroller General for review before a rule can take effect.       The report must contain a copy of the rule, ``a concise       general statement relating to the rule,'' and the rule's       proposed effective date. CRA allows Congress to review and       disapprove rules issued by federal agencies for a period of       60 days using special procedures. If a resolution of       disapproval is enacted, then the new rule has no force or       effect.

CRA adopts the definition of ``rule'' under the       Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which states that a rule       is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or       particular applicability and future effect designed to       implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or       describing the organization, procedure, or practice       requirements of an agency.'' However, CRA excludes three       categories of rules from coverage: (1) rules of particular       applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or       personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or       obligations of non-agency parties.

Interior did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the       Comptroller General on the North Dakota RMP. In its response       to us, Interior provided additional information about the       North Dakota RMP but did not state a position as to whether       it is a rule under CRA.                                  DISCUSSION

To determine whether the North Dakota RMP is a rule subject       to review under CRA, we first address whether it meets the       APA definition of a rule. As explained below, we conclude       that it does. We then consider whether the North Dakota RMP       falls within any CRA exceptions. We conclude that it does       not. As such, the North Dakota RMP is subject to review under       CRA.      The North Dakota RMP is a Rule under APA

Applying APA's definition of rule, the North Dakota RMP       meets all of the required elements. First, the North Dakota       RMP is an agency statement as it was issued by BLM, a federal       agency.

Second, the rule is of future effect as it is to be used to       guide the use of the public land       for the next 20 years. Decisions made in the North Dakota RMP       became effective on January 8, 2025, when the Record of       Decision was signed. As of that date, according to BLM, the       North Dakota RMP will guide management of BLM-managed public       lands in the planning area for the next 15 to 20 years for       the benefit of current and future generations. Therefore, the       North Dakota RMP has future effect.

Finally, the North Dakota RMP implements, interprets, or       prescribes law or policy, because it designates areas of BLM-      administered land for certain purposes in accordance with       BLM's responsibilities for land use management under FLPMA.       The North Dakota RMP establishes a broad framework for land       use management, governing approximately 58,500 acres of BLM-      administered surface land and 4.1 million subsurface acres of       BLM-managed land and minerals across North Dakota.       Specifically, it designates various land uses for the public,       including recreation, motorized vehicle access, oil and gas       leasing, renewable energy development, grazing, wildlife       habitat conservation, and cultural preservation.

Our conclusion here is consistent with our previous       decisions finding that similar land use plans and RMPs       implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. For       instance, in B-238859, Oct. 23, 2017, we found that an       amendment to the Forest Service's Tongass Land and Resource       Management Plan (Tongass Amendment) implemented law by       establishing new criteria for the sale of timber to non-      agency parties. We explained that with the Tongass Amendment,       the Forest Service set forth its policy for timber sales and       thus implemented its statutory responsibility under the       National Forest Management Act.

Similarly in B-329065, Nov. 15, 2017, we concluded that       four RMPs issued by BLM prescribed policy by establishing       available uses for the areas that each RMP covered. We noted       that each RMP implemented provisions of FLPMA and other       applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. The same can       be said for the North Dakota RMP as issue here. The North       Dakota RMP implements FLPMA and prescribes policy by       designating or foreclosing specific activities or land use on       BLM-administer land. As such, the North Dakota RMP meets the       third element of APA's definition of a rule. Having satisfied       all the required elements, the North Dakota RMP meets the APA       definition of rule.      CRA Exceptions

We must next determine whether any of CRA's three       exceptions apply. CRA provides for three types of rules that       are not subject to its requirements: (1) rules of particular       applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or       personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or       obligations of non-agency parties.

(1) Rule of Particular Applicability

Consistent with our previous decisions, the North Dakota       RMP is a rule of general applicability, rather than       particular applicability. In B-238859, Oct. 23, 2017, the       Forest Service proffered that its Tongass Amendment was a       rule of particular applicability because it applied to a       single national forest. We disagreed, noting that the Tongass       Amendment governed all natural resource management       activities, all projects approved to take place, and all       persons or entities using the forest. As such, it was a rule       of general applicability. Likewise, the North Dakota RMP       establishes land use designations that govern all activities       conducted by any person or entity on BLM-administered land       and subsurface estate managed by the North Dakota Field       Office, making it a rule of general applicability.

(2) Rule of Agency Management or Personnel

The North Dakota RMP is not a rule of agency management or       personnel. We have previously held that rules that fall into       this category relate to purely internal agency matters.       Because the North Dakota RMP is concerned with public use of       the areas it governs rather than management of BLM itself or       its personnel, it does not meet CRA's second exception.

(3) Rule of Agency Organization, Procedure, or Practice             that does not Substantially Affect Non-Agency Parties

Lastly, the North Dakota RMP is not a rule of agency       organization, procedure, or practice that does not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties.

We have previously explained that this exception was       modeled on the APA exception to notice-and-comment rulemaking       requirements for ``rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice[.]'' The purpose of the APA exception is to       ensure ``that agencies retain latitude in organizing their       internal operations,'' so long as such rules do not have a       substantial impact on non-agency parties.

Following this interpretation in the CRA context, we have       only applied CRA's third exception to rules that primarily       focus on the internal operations of an agency. For instance,       in B-329926, Sept. 10, 2018, we found that updates to a       Social Security Administration (SSA) hearing manual governing       SSA adjudicators' use of information from the internet       qualified as a rule of agency organization, procedure, or       practice. There, the manual outlined procedures for SSA       employees to follow in processing and adjudicating benefits       claims. Because the manual was directed to and binding only       on SSA officials without imposing new burdens on claimants,       we concluded that the manual met CRA's third exception.

In contrast, rules that are directed at and primarily       concerned with the behavior of non-agency parties do not fall       within this category. Thus, in B-274505, Sept. 16, 1996, we       declined to apply CRA's third exception to a Forest Service       memorandum on the Emergency Salvage Timber Sale Program,       because it was not limited to the Forest Service's methods of       operations. Instead, the memorandum established the standards       by which program determinations would be made, thus directly       affecting the area for and number of timber sales that would       result in contracts. In essence the memorandum went beyond       how the Forest Service organized its internal operations.       Similarly, in B-238859, Oct. 23, 2017, we declined to apply       CRA's third exception to the Tongass Amendment, because it       was directed at land and resource use by non-agency parties.

Here, the North Dakota RMP does entail some changes to       agency procedure as it introduces new internal directives,       practices, and procedures necessary to carry out these       policies. However, like the Forest Service memorandum in B-      274505 and the Tongass Amendment in B-238859, the North       Dakota RMP is not limited to changes in internal agency       operations. Instead, the North Dakota RMP is directed at, and       concerns itself primarily with, the behavior of non-agency       parties. Therefore, the North Dakota RMP does not qualify as       a rule of agency organization, procedure or practice.

We must also consider whether the North Dakota RMP       substantially affects the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties. When analyzing this aspect of CRA's third exception,       ``the critical question is whether the agency action alters       the rights or interests of the regulated entities.'' Along       similar lines, courts have determined that ``[a]n agency rule       that modifies substantive rights and interests can only be       nominally procedural, and the exemption for such rules of       agency procedure cannot apply.''

In previous decisions, we have consistently concluded that       where an RMP designates use by non-agency parties in the       areas it governs, it has a substantial effect. For instance,       in B-275178, July 3, 1997, we reached this conclusion by       noting that the Forest Service's RMP provided a ``management       prescription'' giving general direction on what may occur       within an area allocated to a particular land use       designation. Similarly, in B-329065, Nov. 15, 2017, we       concluded that four BLM RMPs had a substantial effect on non-      agency parties where the plans limited the use of public land       and prohibited mining and operation of off-highway vehicles       in the areas they governed.

Consistent with our caselaw on other RMPs, the North Dakota       RMP has a substantial effect on non-agency parties.       Specifically, it governs when and where the public may engage       in activities such as recreation, motorized vehicle use, oil       and gas leasing, renewable energy development, and grazing,       thereby altering their substantive rights and obligations.       Accordingly, the North Dakota RMP fails to meet CRA's third       exception.                                  CONCLUSION

The North Dakota RMP is a rule for purposes of CRA because       it meets the definition of a rule under APA and no CRA       exception applies. Therefore, the North Dakota RMP is subject       to CRA's requirement that it be submitted to Congress and the       Comptroller General before it can take effect.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, when we talk about lawsuits, there are  already lawsuits that are being created because of this bad resource  management plan that the former administration put in place.

After we do the CRA and we prevent this administration or future  administrations from putting a similar resource management plan in  place without it coming back to Congress, then maybe the current  administration and Secretary Burgum can write a new resource management  plan that actually makes sense, that actually takes into account  America's need for energy, and that actually listens to the people in  these States where these resources reside. While they are doing that,  the previous resource management plan would be in existence.

Again, it is just fear-mongering to say that there will basically be  no rules if this resource management plan gets removed under the  Congressional Review Act.

Again, I thank the gentlewoman from North Dakota for her leadership  on this important issue. The North Dakota RMP will have devastating  ramifications not just in North Dakota but beyond. This CRA which  rejects the failed energy policies of the previous administration is in  alignment with the current administration's executive orders on  unleashing American energy and reinvigorating America's coal industry.

In combination with the provisions that Republicans enacted through  the reconciliation bill, this CRA will ensure that American energy  remains affordable, reliable, and abundant.

America's future is bright as we unleash responsible natural  resources development to meet our energy and mineral leads, to create  jobs, and to drive economic growth across the country.

Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this resolution, and I yield back the  balance of my time.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694908/providing-for-congressional-disapproval-of-the-rule-submitted-by-the-bureau-of-land-management-relating-to-north-dakota-field-office-record-of-decision-and-approved-resource-management-plan,,
Democrat,Marcy Kaptur,Manufacturing Jobs Lost Due to Trump Tariffs,"Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the 68,000  manufacturing jobs lost across our country in 2025 as a direct result  of President Trump's reckless tariffs and DOGE cuts.

Why did he visit Detroit yesterday when his insistence on continuing  these tariffs actually cuts investment in American manufacturing? It is  all backward, and it puts America backward and America's workers  backward.

In December, manufacturing jobs continued an 8-month decline that  began after President Trump falsely promised these new tariffs would  lead to an economic resurgence for American workers.

Instead, his broad across-the-board tariffs have driven prices up for  everyday goods and all supply chains. Tariffs create uncertainty in the  job market, leaving hardworking families worse off.

When manufacturing jobs disappear as costs rise, Ohio families feel  it. Lost jobs and rising costs are not an abstract economic theory for  us. They are a harsh reality. Thousands of families I represent have  been touched. Another company just closed in Fulton County.

Mr. Speaker, let's make manufacturing more competitive, not less.  Let's create jobs in the USA.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699062/manufacturing-jobs-lost-due-to-trump-tariffs,2026-01-14,2026-W03
Republican,Jim Baird,"Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy Relating to ``Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Commercial Refrigerators, Freezers, and Refrigerator- Freezers''","Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for giving me this  opportunity to speak.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 75. Once again, I join my  House colleagues in working to overturn another last-minute, so-called  energy efficiency standard from the previous administration.

In reality, the Biden administration imposed standards that are  nearly impossible for commercial refrigeration equipment manufacturers  to meet. According to estimates from the Biden Department of Energy,  the final rule will cost approximately $8 billion. This will be borne  by those purchasing equipment, many of whom are small businesses. The  payback period for certain commercial refrigeration equipment under  these standards is up to 93.9 years. That is right, nearly 94 years.

To make matters worse, the Department of Energy's test procedures do  not align with real-world conditions. The DOE's estimate of the CRE  door openings in an hour often undercounts the real number of door  openings. This means the appliance's interior temperature may rise  above safe food-storage conditions, jeopardizing food safety.

Once again, the left's pro-Big Government, Green New Deal agenda  harms the little guy. The Biden Department of Energy implemented a  policy that threatens small businesses, harms consumers, and drives up  costs, even as many Americans continue to struggle under the long-term  effects of the Biden administration's inflationary economic policies.

That ends now. I am proud to join my House Republican colleagues in  standing up for America's consumers and small business owners across  the country. With this bill, we are continuing to deliver on the  mandate of the American people to cut burdensome red tape and ensure  American consumers and small businesses can thrive.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this underlying bill.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689131/providing-for-congressional-disapproval-of-the-rule-submitted-by-the-office-of-energy-efficiency-and-renewable-energy-department-of-energy-relating-to-energy-conservation-program-energy-conservation-standards-for-commercial-refrigerators-freezers-and-refrigerator-freezers,2025-03-26,2025-W13

Democrat,Emilia Sykes,Congratulating Daniela Scheffler,"Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Daniela Scheffler  for winning the 3,200 meter race at the Ohio Division I Track and Field  Championships, earning her first State title, and recognizing her as  Ohio's 13th Congressional District's Champion of the Week.

As a senior at Lake High School in Uniontown, Ohio, Daniela ended an  exceptional high school track career, setting records and winning  several awards along the way. On the road to her first State title last  month, Daniela set the record for the 1,600 and 3,200 meters at the  Federal League Track and Field Championships, the State qualifier meet.

As a testament to her hard work and dedication on the track, Daniela  signed an offer with North Carolina State University, where she will be  continuing her track and field career.

We are proud of Daniela. Even though she will be far away from home  at college, we will be cheering her on as she finishes her career.

Democrat,Emily Randall,Pregnant Students' Rights Act,"Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Scott for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 6359, a bill  that claims to protect pregnant students but actually mandates that  they get less, not more information about their rights.

If the sponsor of this bill and the majority party actually believed  in supporting student parents, then they would take real action, not  just grandstand on the House floor because the March for Life is this  weekend.

The bill before us today requires the dissemination of incomplete  information, but it also comes after House Republicans have worked  alongside the Trump regime to dismantle and weaken the Department of  Education and protections for students who file complaints around Title  IX violations, among other things.

It has dismantled subsidized loan programs and financial aid. It has  decimated Medicaid, the number one payer for births in this country, in  order to pay for tax breaks for the ultrawealthy and fund ICE's violent  reign in our communities.

If we believed in supporting student parents, we would put more money  into childcare subsidies, more money into financial aid, and more money  into food assistance so that the women in college, the people who are  students who get pregnant, who have a tough decision to make, would  have all of the resources and support they need to make the decision  that is right for them.

It is not our job to tell a student what decision is right for them.  It is not our job to tell any high school graduate that they need to go  to college, right? I hear Republicans say that all the time. I tend to  agree. I believe that students deserve all of the options and all of  the support to make the choice that is right for them.

Yet mandating incomplete information while gutting the programs that  would allow a pregnant student to choose to stay pregnant and to choose  to complete school is a fallacy. It is political theater, and it is  doing a disservice to the students who we are purporting to support.

I have had a chance to work with a lot of students who have become  pregnant, both from around the time I was in junior high, when a friend  of mine had a pregnancy scare, to a time when I was in college, to  being a volunteer in the bay area where I was on a rapid response line  in case someone needed to take a bus 3\1/2\ hours from their college  campus into the city. That is because that was the only place they  could access either maternity care, OB/GYN care, or access abortion  care. We have not funded healthcare in rural communities across the  country. We have gutted programs that provide actual support for  pregnant people.

This is a joke. This let's make sure they get an email with all of  the information. It is unserious.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill  and to take serious action to support students, pregnant or not.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699315/pregnant-students-rights-act,2026-01-22,2026-W04
Republican,Ben Cline,Congratulating Salem High School,"Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the extraordinary  accomplishments of the Salem High School debate team, which recently  claimed its second consecutive VHSL Class 4 State championship with a  decisive 32-8 victory over Dominion High School. This victory marks the  20th State title for legendary Head Coach Mark Ingerson, 18 in speech  and forensics and now 2 in debate.

Salem's dominance was on full display as the team captured individual  State championships in three of four events. Senior captain Claire  Rawlins led the way with a perfect 6-0 record in Lincoln-Douglas  debate, tackling the timely question of artificial general  intelligence. With four career State titles and a remarkable 29-3  record, Claire's leadership is unmatched.

In public forum, seniors U.V. Singh and Grayson Smith went  undefeated, while sophomore Dylan Hancock earned Salem's first-ever  congressional debate title with near-perfect speaker scores. Several  other Spartans, including medalists Rebekah Steinweg, Luke Stovall,  Kody Hinnant, and Abby Jones also delivered outstanding performances.

Also competing for Salem were Charlie Bain, 12th grade, and Nesa  Garcia-Perez, 10th grade, in congressional debate, and Leah Johnson,  10th grade, and Ashley Toapanta, 10th grade, in policy debate. Students  London Basham, Harper Rocovich, and Caroline Loveday also competed  admirably at the regional and State semifinal levels.

Special thanks go to Assistant Coach Rachel Wurster for her guidance  and commitment to these students.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor the Salem High School debate team  for their achievements, integrity, and the example they set for  academic excellence in Virginia and beyond.            Congratulating the Skyline High School Wrestling Team

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  the Skyline High School wrestling team on winning the 2025 Class 3  State wrestling championship, the first State title in the school's  history.

Under the leadership of Head Coach Kyle Symons and Assistant Coaches  Joe DiVello, Brian Scott, Alan Kroh, Jon DiVello, and Josiah Huston,  Skyline's 13 wrestlers delivered a historic performance, scoring 218  points and sending six athletes to the finals.

Congratulations to individual State champions Paden Alyea, Parker  Withers, and Josiah Sykes. In addition to the State champions,  medalists also included Jacob Buffum, Vinny DiVello, Joey DiVello, D.J.  Mabie, Cody Salomon, and Carter Huston, with strong performances from  Cody Davis, Aiden Boyles, Ryan Williams, and Tytus Drake.

Skyline defeated two-time defending champion Staunton River by 39.5  points, a testament to their talent, teamwork, and resilience.

Thanks to Coach Symons, his staff, and the incredible Front Royal  community, Skyline has made history. I am proud to honor their  achievements today.

Congratulating the Spotswood High School Boys' Basketball Team

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the incredibly special  achievement of the Spotswood High School Boys' basketball team, which  captured the State championship title for the first time in 32 years.

This remarkable victory is a testament to their talent, hard work,  and perseverance. Under the leadership of Coach Edwards, rightfully  named VHSL Class 3A Coach of the Year, these young men came mentally  prepared and demonstrated the power of teamwork and determination to  bring home the school's second State trophy.

Their success has united our community in pride and celebration. We  congratulate the following team players: Cam Pacheco, senior guard  named Player of the Year; Tyler Sprague, named first-team Class 3A all- State; Landon Davis; Rylan Baker; Reese Fisher; Will Parlee; Tsenat  Tesfay; Cayden Price; Camden Langridge; Colin Regan; and Brennyn  Stobbs.

We congratulate the Spotswood Trailblazers on this historic win. They  have made Spottswood proud. We can't wait to see what they accomplish  in the future.                        Honoring National Police Week

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week to  recognize the brave men and women in law enforcement who serve our  communities, our Commonwealth, and our Nation with honor and courage.

These officers are our friends and neighbors, men and women who wake  up each day, put on the badge, and willingly face danger to keep others  safe.

Earlier this week, in Bridgewater, I joined members of local law  enforcement and Commonwealth's Attorney Marsha Garst to honor those who  lost their lives in the line of duty. Since 1776, nearly 27,000  officers have made the ultimate sacrifice, including 165 last year and  25 so far this year. Their service and their sacrifice must never be  forgotten.

Mr. Speaker, the men and women of law enforcement represent the very  best of our communities. We are safer because of their commitment, and  we are grateful for their service. To every officer who serves, we  thank them, support them, and will continue to stand with them.                   Celebrating National Small Business Week

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, last week was National Small Business Week, a  time to celebrate the millions of small businesses that form the  foundation of our economy and our communities. These men and women  aren't just entrepreneurs. They are job creators, innovators, and the  embodiment of the American Dream.

House Republicans and President Trump are fighting to make sure they  have the tools they need to thrive. That starts with making the 2017  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent. Those tax cuts are critical for small  businesses, with over 26 million relying on the 20 percent deduction to  grow, invest, and hire.

Democrat,"Frank Pallone, Jr.",Hydropower Licensing Transparency Act,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3657, which will provide  transparency into the hydropower licensing process at the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC.

Today, FERC is responsible for issuing licenses for hydropower dams,  but it is often dependent on other regulatory entities, such as the  Army Corps, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine  Fisheries Service, or State water agencies, to provide information and  approvals that FERC relies on to issue licenses. It can also be  dependent on the dam developer itself to give FERC necessary  information.

With all these different entities involved in the process, it is  often difficult to monitor from the outside and understand where things  stand on a particular project.

This bill helps to bring more transparency to the process. It  requires an annual report to Congress on the status of each license  application and outstanding actions that are required of regulatory  agencies or the applicants themselves. This is particularly important  now because 15 percent of the electric capacity at hydropower dams will  come up for relicensing in the next decade.

Forecasts for electricity demand also seem to be increasing by the  day, and that is why it is critically important that we have  transparency into where the hangups are in the hydropower licensing  process.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Schrier for her hard work on this  bipartisan bill. I also thank Representative Fulcher, Chairs Guthrie  and Latta, and Republican committee staff for accommodating  commonsense, bipartisan amendments to the bill, such as expanding it to  cover new hydropower projects.

Democrat,Kathy Castor,Foreign Adversary Communications Transparency Act,"Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Dingell for yielding  the time, and I thank Chairman Bilirakis for moving the bill forward to  the floor today.

I rise in strong support of H.R. 906, the Foreign Adversary  Communications Transparency Act. This bill would require the Federal  Communications Commission, the FCC, to publish a public list of  entities with ties to foreign adversarial governments, such as China,  Russia, North Korea, and Iran, especially if they have a license or  authorization that is tied to our communications networks.

Along with Representative Wittman, I serve on the bipartisan Select  Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and  the Chinese Communist Party. Last Congress, the committee released a  bipartisan report on maintaining America's economic and national  security interests. The report found that the widespread adoption of  certain People's Republic of China-developed technologies in the United  States poses a significant risk to national security and threatens  long-term U.S. technological competitiveness.

Our committee report recommended that we enact the FACT Act to shine  a light on companies connected to foreign adversarial governments like  the CCP and to ensure greater accountability and transparency in our  critical communications networks.

Our bill passed the House unanimously by voice vote in the last  Congress, but it didn't quite get over the finish line. We really have  no more time to wait, Mr. Speaker.

Republican,Ryan Zinke,"Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Bureau of Land Management Relating to Public Land Order No. 7917 for Withdrawal of Federal Lands; Cook, Lake, and Saint Louis Counties, Mn","Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, as a former Secretary, I don't think anyone  in this body has spent more time on Twin Metals reviewing the science  than I have, so I think we should separate the hype from the science  and the bull from fact.

First of all, why are we here and why is it important at all?

Well, this behind me are a few things we need critical minerals for:  particularly our military, medical, and supply chain.

What do all these have in common? The MQ-9 Reaper, the Javelin  missile system, the Virginia-class submarine, the Tomahawk, the night  vision, and Amron, what do they have in common? Those minerals are  found in Twin Metals in the great State of Minnesota.

Now, is it in the boundary waters? Is it in the area that is  protected around it? No, it is not.

I have seen these wonderful pictures of canoeing, of waters, of  streams, of lakes, and they are absolutely beautiful. The problem is  that is in the boundary waters. That is not where the mine is.

Then, oh, Deb Haaland--I respect Deb Haaland. I had her in committee,  Mr. Speaker. I asked her one question after a few: What minerals were  in the mine area which she rescinded and put a moratorium on? I was  amazed at her answer. She couldn't name one. So let's follow the  science.

I agree. There is a place to mine, and there is a place not to mine.  I think probably I stand on the conservation side as much as any  Member, but I have actually read the documentation. I have actually  read the mining plans. I have a degree in geology and looked closely at  it. Do you know what. There are good projects, and there are bad  projects. We don't mine like we used to.

In Montana we have Virginia City. They took a paddleboard up the  river stream, took everything, turned it around. We don't mine like  that anymore.

We use science now, and when you look at the science and  documentation on this mine, it uses the best technology.

Oh, by the way, water, it is a closed-circuit. What does that mean?  That means effluent doesn't travel outside. Its reuse is compressed.  When you do mine, what you do is you put core samples in. That core  sample will tell you how much overburden you have to remove. After the  core samples, then you have a mining plan that tells you where the  material is moved. In this case it is not an open-pit mine. It is  subsurface.

I would invite my colleagues to look at the science and look at the  water tables. They say 100 percent of the mines in the past were  pollutants. They are not pollutants if you have a mining plan that  undergoes the scrutiny that this one has.

Lastly, I will speak about the law. Notification and memo are not the  same thing as a rule. Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that people actually  look at the mining plan and read it, just like reading the law, what  the law says. It is not a trick. I am not here tricking anyone.

What I am saying is this: Once again there are good places to mine,  and  there are bad places to mine, but you have got to go with the science  and not the hype. When a mine is not located in the wilderness, it is  not located in the buffer, it is located in a Forest Service holding,  which by nature, which by law is multiple use, then mining is an  appropriate use in it.

Mr. Speaker, on the basis of this, we are facing a crisis in our  country because foreign adversaries hold our critical minerals, which  are critical to everything we do in medical and in our military.

Secondly, follow the science and not the hype. I understand political  gerrymandering and fundraising and showing pictures of wonderful canoes  going across, and, oh, we are going to mine right in the middle of the  wilderness area, but that is not the case.

Mr. Speaker, I ask and I urge my colleagues to support this. It is a  good mine. It is a good project.

By the way, it doesn't approve anything. You still have to go through  the process. So approving this act today you are not going to start the  mine tomorrow. They still have to go through the process. It is about  process, and that is what makes decisions good or bad is going through  the process.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699276/providing-for-congressional-disapproval-of-the-rule-submitted-by-the-bureau-of-land-management-relating-to-public-land-order-no-7917-for-withdrawal-of-federal-lands-cook-lake-and-saint-louis-counties-mn,2026-01-21,2026-W04
Democrat,Andy Kim,Establishing the Congressional Budget for the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2025 and Setting Forth the Appropriate Budgetary Levels for Fiscal Years 2026 Through 2034,"Mr. KIM. Madam President, I rise today to tell the stories of the  nearly 2 million New Jerseyans who rely on Medicaid for their critical  care. I do this because their care is at risk. I do this because the  care of more than 72 million Americans across our country enrolled in  Medicaid is at risk. They are at risk because Republicans in the House  and the Senate have chosen to take away their care so that Elon Musk  and the very richest Americans can pay a little less in taxes.

That is the choice they have thrust upon the American people. It is a  choice that I don't believe they truly understand, so I would like to  take some of my time today on the floor to explain what happens when we  choose Elon Musk's well-being over the people we have sworn to serve.

To truly understand this, you need to understand that for tens of  millions of Americans, Medicaid is their lifeline from the womb to  their final years.

In New Jersey, nearly one out of three births is covered by Medicaid.  But even before that birth takes place, mothers receive prenatal care  covered by Medicaid. That means that for millions of parents across the  country, the first images they see of their child in those early  ultrasounds are because of Medicaid. It means that prenatal vitamins  that provide the folic acid necessary to ensure proper development are  because of Medicaid. It means that if there is a complication in a  pregnancy, those parents can focus on their health and the health of  their unborn child, not whether or not they will be able to cover the  costs of their care. That is because of Medicaid.

So when Republicans are saying we need to cut Medicaid, remember that  it is Elon Musk who wins and those expecting parents who lose.

When those children are born into the world, tens of millions rely on  Medicaid. Nationally, about 40 percent of children are enrolled in  Medicaid or CHIP. In New Jersey, one-third of children--one in three  kids in my State--are enrolled in Medicaid.

As a father of a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old, I can tell you that the  most important thing is knowing that your kids are healthy.

There are a lot of things that are outside of your control as a  parent. You can do everything right, but sometimes you just need help.  Kids get sick, and having that assurance that they can get the care  they need is an important thing.

When you take away Medicaid, you are not just taking away care, you  are taking away the peace of mind that parents deserve. You are taking  away the ability for parents to look their kids in the eye and say: It  is going to be OK.

I wanted to share with you two stories that have stuck with me. I  heard from Nicole, a mother from New Jersey who has a developmentally  disabled son, Jordan. Jordan is 24. His mother said that a Medicaid cut  would be ``catastrophic.'' She said that the care she receives from  Medicaid is ``vitally important.''

That sense of importance and urgency I heard from Nicole I saw echoed  from Jamie from Hazlet. Jamie's son David was born paralyzed,  nonverbal, and he is relying on a feeding tube. Jamie told reporters  that one of David's medications ``can cost up to $1,000 a month.'' She  said that if Republicans are successful in cutting Medicaid, ``we would  have to choose--are we going to eat? pay the bills? or keep him  alive?'' She said, ``It is a life-or-death situation.''

So when Republicans are talking about cutting Medicaid to hand tax  cuts to the wealthiest Americans, the choice they are making is to  leave people like Nicole and Jordan, like Jamie and David behind.

At some point, our children grow up and leave, but even then, so many  across this country rely on Medicaid for their basic care. In New  Jersey, one in seven adults between the ages of 19 and 64 is covered by  Medicaid.

When you look at the choice ahead of us between care and tax cuts for  the superrich, I want you to think about Caroline from Mount Holly.  Caroline called my office asking that I oppose this budget plan. When  she outlined her reason for not cutting Medicaid, she spoke in the  clearest possible terms:

I will die if there are cuts to Medicaid.

Caroline is disabled. Her daughter takes care of her through the  Managed Long-Term Services and Supports Program.

She ended her message by saying:

Please, I need help. A lot of us need your help.

These are the people that need help, not Elon Musk, not the  billionaires.

It is people like Caroline from Hackettstown. Caroline called my  office because her brother is on Medicaid. He is scheduled to get heart  surgery in the next couple of months--something that is scary enough  when you have the certainty of healthcare. But Caroline doesn't have  that if her brother's Medicaid is cut.

She said:

I'm really scared for him. I'm really scared for my parents       who are about to retire. . . . I'm scared for myself, someone       who also has multiple health issues and is trying to keep       down a full-time job despite it all.

These are the people that need help.

Our neighbors who sometimes need the most help are those who are  disabled. In New Jersey, one out of every three working-age adults with  a disability is on Medicaid.

Just last month, I invited Kevin Nunez--a disabled New Jerseyan and  an advocate for his community--down to the Capitol. Kevin relies on  Medicaid for his care, his caregiver, his basic quality of life. I  brought him to the Capitol because I wanted Donald Trump to have to  face someone whose healthcare he was threatening to take away.

But it wasn't just Kevin there at the Capitol; we saw his caregiver  Edna there. The work she does every day is truly incredible.

We should support our caregivers, should honor their service, and  cutting the funding that allows them to do their job is not the way to  do that.

Kevin is 1 of more than 15.5 million people across America with a  disability who are covered by Medicaid. He is 1 of approximately 4.5  million people who use Medicaid for home care workers like Edna.

The choice we are facing is abandoning those Americans like Kevin and  Edna, who just need basic care, or giving another tax cut to those at  the very top. For me, that is not a choice.

Finally, as we go through adulthood and age, Medicaid becomes more  important than ever. Seniors across our Nation are relying on Medicaid  for the care they need to live. Sixty percent of nursing home residents  in New Jersey use Medicaid to pay for care. When seniors are on a fixed  income, like so many of them are, Medicaid can be the difference  between life or death.

Annie, a teacher in New Jersey, called my office recently. Her mother  is on Medicaid--71 years old, recently had hip surgery. She has no  other income than her Social Security and asked that we do everything  we can to make sure that her Medicaid isn't cut.

As someone who is not just a father of two young kids but as a  caretaker of an older parent, it weighs on me, and I understand the  challenges that are there, knowing that you have to do everything you  can to make sure the people you love have the care they need.

Life is hard enough. Care is hard enough. The point of Medicaid, the  point of government, is to make it a little easier, a little more  bearable.

So when Republicans come to the floor with a budget that threatens to  cut Medicaid so they can give tax cuts and tax breaks to the ultrarich,  the choice they are putting before us is making your lives worse and  make their lives better. It is making your healthcare worse to make  their bank accounts bigger. It is making your future more uncertain to  make their futures brighter.

That can't be an acceptable choice, and it is not one we have to  make. We can reject this budget resolution and save Medicaid and save  healthcare. We can reject this budget resolution and choose to support  that expecting mother who just wants to give birth to a healthy child.  We can reject this budget resolution and choose to support that child  as they grow. We can reject this budget resolution and choose to  support our neighbors who work hard but just need that little bit of  help to stay healthy and achieve the American dream. Finally, we can  reject this budget resolution and choose to support our seniors. We owe  the best care to them in their golden years.

This is the moment to show the 2 million New Jerseyans on Medicaid,  the nearly 80 million Americans on Medicaid, and every other American  across this country that we choose their well-being over the wealth and  power of those who already have plenty. Let's reject this budget  resolution and do the right thing for them.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689514/establishing-the-congressional-budget-for-the-united-states-government-for-fiscal-year-2025-and-setting-forth-the-appropriate-budgetary-levels-for-fiscal-years-2026-through-2034,2025-04-03,2025-W14
Republican,Marlin Stutzman,Six Months of America First Leadership,"Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, this week marks 6 months of the America  First leadership under President Trump Donald Trump.

He has had innumerable accomplishments over the first half of this  year and has kicked off a new golden age for our country. His strong  leadership has single-handedly added over half a million jobs to the  U.S. economy. Many of these jobs came back to my home State of Indiana,  like the announcement from General Motors about increasing its  production in the Fort Wayne truck plant.

He has brought gas prices to their lowest point since 2021 by  unleashing American energy independence.

Outside of the economic impacts that have saved money for everyday  Americans, President Trump has kept his commitment to protect American  children and families by halting so-called gender-affirming care for  children in this country.

As another testament to his impressive pace, President Trump has also  signed 27 bills into law, the greatest of which, the One Big Beautiful  Bill Act, delivers tax cuts to American families, solidifies funding  for America's Golden Dome, and defunded Planned Parenthood.

Over the past 6 months, President Trump has delivered on his promise  to restore America's strength and dominance, and I look forward to  continuing the fight with President Trump leading the way to ensure  America's golden age lasts for decades to come.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694059/six-months-of-america-first-leadership,2025-07-23,2025-W30
Democrat,Danny Davis,Commemoration of Juneteenth Amid the Erosion of Black History,"Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, after just four short years since  I proudly cast my vote to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday  through the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, the very history  that this day honors is now under attack by the current administration.  While we mark Juneteenth with prayers and proclamations, we must also  confront a harsh and unsettling truth: the significance of this day and  African American history is being erased. Across our Nation, we are  witnessing the systemic losses of our hard-fought gains--the stripping  of diversity, equity, and inclusion from federal institutions,  censoring school curriculums, and silencing conversations about the  true history of America.

Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, the day Union troops arrived  in Galveston, Texas, and informed over 250,000 enslaved Black people  that they were free--more than two years after the Emancipation  Proclamation. Juneteenth is a reminder that freedom and equality remain  delayed for Black Americans. For generations, this history of  intentional continuation of slavery was ignored, and, now that it is  finally acknowledged as part of our Nation's past, we see the Trump  Administration trying to strip away Black history. Banning books,  censoring lessons, and eliminating honest conversations about race is  not about education, it is about control. We must ensure that  Juneteenth is not just a day off but a day of truth.

In 2005, I partnered with then-Senator Barack Obama to introduce  legislation recognizing Juneteenth. And now that it has become law, we  must defend it and the history it represents from being erased. The  history of our people is not optional. Let me be clear: Black history  is American history. As a Black man who was raised in the rural South  during segregation, I know all too well what it feels like to be told  that your history does not matter. As the Representative of the 7th  Congressional District of Illinois, a district with a rich history of  Black culture and resilience, I fight in Congress for equity,  inclusion, and the honest American history.

Today, the Trump Administration threatens Chicago Public Schools with  the loss of over one billion dollars in federal funding for its efforts  to improve the success and reduce suspensions of Black students, teach  Black history, and recruit teachers who reflect the students they  teach. African Americans have faced enormous challenges in every corner  of life--education, economic security, health care, employment, housing  and the criminal justice system. We are routinely denied opportunity  solely because of the color of our skin. And still, we continue to  fight for justice and equity in the face of deep-rooted, systemic  racism.

This Juneteenth, Chicago will celebrate Juneteenth as a testament to  community, remembrance, and pride. There is the Pullman Porter Museum's  Juneteenth parade, games, and concert. Or the Cook County celebration  at Malcolm X College, the Juneteenth Annual barbeque at the DuSable  Black History Museum, or 1865 Fest in West Garfield Park, to name just  a few. Events like these are not just festivals: they are declarations  that we will not be silent. We will celebrate. We will educate. We will  resist.

I will continue to fight for equality and opportunity at every turn,  while honoring the history my forefathers and foremothers endured.  Let's not forget, the White House and this country were built by  enslaved labor. As we commemorate Juneteenth this year, let it be a  call to action. The struggle for freedom will not end here. I am  committed to protecting the truth of our past, fighting for justice in  our present, and building a future where every African American can  learn their history, see their worth, and know they belong.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692688/commemoration-of-juneteenth-amid-the-erosion-of-black-history,2025-06-20,2025-W25

Democrat,Eleanor Norton,Introduction of the District of Columbia Flood Prevention Act of 2025,"Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia  Flood Prevention Act of 2025. This bill would amend the Coastal Zone  Management Act of 1972 (CZMA) to make the District of Columbia an  eligible entity. The House passed this bill as part of the Coastal and  Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act in the 116th Congress.

This bill would make D.C. eligible for federal funding for coastal  zone management and give D.C. oversight of federal agency actions that  affect its coastal waters. D.C. urgently needs the protection of the  CZMA because of serious flood risks that affect federal assets,  residents and businesses in D.C., including the National Mall and  federal buildings in the Federal Triangle area.

The CZMA provides planning and technical services to assist states in  protecting, restoring and developing coastal communities and resources.  Once the federal government approves a state's coastal management plan,  the state becomes eligible for federal funding and federal agency  actions must be consistent with the state plan.

Even though D.C. is located on two rivers and has suffered  substantial coastal floods, it was omitted from the list of eligible  entities in the CZMA. It is notable that under the CZMA, the term  ``coastal state'' includes the states and territories. D.C. residents  pay full federal taxes and therefore D.C. is usually treated as a state  for federal programs. It appears D.C.'s omission was a mistake. This  oversight likely occurred because the CZMA was passed in 1972, which  was before D.C. achieved home rule.

Scientists have predicted that the tides on the Atlantic Coast could  rise two to four feet by 2100, causing property worth as much as $7  billion in D.C. to be routinely under threat by floodwaters. This  includes private homes and businesses, the National Mall, federal  buildings and three military bases. The Anacostia and Potomac rivers,  which surround D.C., are tidally influenced. In addition, the Maryland  and Virginia coastal zones each include the tidal Potomac River, with  Maryland's zone ending at the D.C. line.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696521/introduction-of-the-district-of-columbia-flood-prevention-act-of-2025,2025-11-04,2025-W45
Democrat,Dina Titus,Sloan Canyon Conservation and Lateral Pipeline Act,"Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their kind words of  support. I, too, am rising today in support of this bill, H.R. 972,  that I brought before you. It is the Sloan Canyon Conservation and  Lateral Pipeline Act.

As we barrel toward record low water projections at Lake Mead and the  increasing risk of prolonged drought due to climate change, there is no  time to waste in securing water reliability for southern Nevadans.

My bill would allow a portion of the Southern Nevada Water  Authority's Horizon Lateral water pipeline project to tunnel beneath  Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area. This pipeline will increase  water reliability for over a million southern Nevadans. It will fortify  the region's water infrastructure against potential outages, and it  will minimize disruptions and impacts to the surrounding communities.

The proposed underground route beneath the Sloan Canyon National  Conservation Area is estimated to save southern Nevadans at least $200  million, while minimizing disturbances to both residents and the local  environment.

This route for the Horizon Lateral water pipeline also ensures the  water delivery system's redundancy in emergency situations, and it  offers flexibility to accommodate the needs of a growing community.

Finally, this legislation expands the Sloan Canyon National  Conservation Area by 9,290 acres to enhance the preservation of the  desert landscapes and habitat unique to southern Nevada.

I call that a win-win-win. It is no wonder that my legislation  received bipartisan support in the House Natural Resources Committee,  and I thank my colleagues for that. It is also supported by businesses,  conservationists, and the Southern Nevada Water Authority.

Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your attention to this, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' today on this critical legislation for  southern Nevada's water future.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698163/sloan-canyon-conservation-and-lateral-pipeline-act,2025-12-15,2025-W51
Democrat,Jennifer McClellan,Health Disparities in Minority Communities,"Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Clyburn for yielding. I am  honored to be here tonight on behalf of  the Congressional Black Caucus to commemorate National Minority Health  Awareness Month, but I am also here for personal reasons.

Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago today, I was 31 weeks pregnant. I was  excited. I was expecting a girl. I had placenta previa, so I knew we  were going to have to schedule a C-section. We had just scheduled it.  She was due June 30, but we had scheduled a date in early June because  my doctor did not think it likely that we would make it to June 30.

I went to bed still planning out are we going to get to go on a  babymoon before she arrives. I woke up the next morning, and my  placenta ruptured. I started bleeding. I was panicked. My husband  called the ambulance. He said I was as white as this piece of paper.

We rushed to the hospital, and I remember hearing the doctor in the  emergency room saying that everything looked fine. Then less than three  seconds later he said that we have got to go right now because both of  our heart rates dropped. I remember thinking as the oxygen mask came on  my face, please let me be asleep before my doctor starts cutting, and I  was.

I woke up a few hours later, and I had a baby girl, but I didn't get  to see her until the next day. As I waited those 24 hours to see if she  would make it, I realized that I almost became one of the Black women  who are three times more likely to die due to pregnancy-related  complications than White women.

I was a State legislator at the time. This was my second child. I was  on the Joint Commission on Health Care, and I began to really look into  the maternal mortality crisis that we have in this country. We have  higher death rates for women than many other Third World countries.

I started looking at the data of why women were dying. Many of these  deaths were preventable. There were differences. There were differences  in the rate at which Black women died compared to White women, and  there were differences in the reasons.

In Virginia, the data showed us that for White women they were more  likely to die due to postpartum depression leading to suicide or other  mental health-related issues leading them to take their own life or to  self-medicate and die of drug overdoses.

For Black women in Virginia, their deaths were more likely caused by  co-morbidities, mostly cardiovascular issues. Many pregnant women, as I  began talking to them, many Black, pregnant women had their first heart  attack either while they were pregnant or shortly thereafter. Oh, by  the way, the disparities in cardiovascular care for Black women and  men: The death rate is higher than for White men and women.

I began to look at how do we put policies in place that address the  maternal mortality crisis as a whole, but the disparities in  particular. I also noticed that many Black women died within the first  year of childbirth, yet Medicaid for many of these women didn't cover  the first year, so they didn't have health insurance when their first  cardiac event or pregnancy-related event that led to their death  occurred.

We looked at expanding Medicaid to cover the first 12 months after  birth, which we did here at the Federal level, as well. We looked at  expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and how would that  address the maternal health crisis. We did expand Medicaid in Virginia,  and we began to see that for many Medicaid expansion patients they  ended up healthier because they were connected to medical help, getting  regular checkups to catch things before they became deadly. All of that  now is under attack.

As we approach April every year, I like to commemorate National  Minority Health Awareness Month through some sort of roundtable, but I  especially like to commemorate Black Maternal Health Week because as I  said when I started, that one is personal.

As I got ready for Black Maternal Health Week, I wanted to first  figure out is there a theme this year on which we should focus our  efforts. As I got ready to prepare my social media posts, as I got  ready to prepare the topics that I would have if I had a roundtable, I  thought, well, the Office of Maternal Health, the Office of Minority  Health, they usually announce a theme every year.

I went to the Office of Minority Health website, and sure enough, in  January they did announce a theme for 2025: Advancing Commitments to  Eliminate Health Disparities.

Then in the January post on their Facebook page they invited the  public to join them all year as they shared resources to help address  health disparities impacting racial and ethnic minority groups. I  thought, great, that is exactly what I want to do during National  Minority Health Awareness Month and Black Maternal Health Week. I went  to the web page expecting to pull down those resources that I could  share with the communities that I represent. ``File not found.''

Then I thought, well, maybe the Office of Minority Health at CMS has  something. ``File not found.'' Well, maybe the National Institutes on  Minority Health and Health Disparities has something. ``Page not  found.'' That is what the website said in the very month that we are  supposed to renew our commitment to addressing healthcare disparities  that cause Black women to be three times more likely to die in  childbirth than White women, that cause Black men to be more likely to  die of prostate cancer than White men. I could go down the entire list  of the statistics. You heard some of them earlier today.

In the very month we are supposed to reaffirm our commitment: ``File  not found.''

Well, I shouldn't be surprised because with the President's war on  diversity, equity, and inclusion and DOGE going through and finding  every web page that had certain words without actually looking at what  are those web pages doing, that they would take these pages down.  Imagine my dismay when I discovered that the Office of Minority Health  at both HHS and CMS are now gone.

The very employees who collect the data, who look at the underlying  causes of why these women are dying anyway, let alone at three times  higher rates than White women, they are gone. Well, at least we can  continue to fight for the policies.

I am on the Energy and Commerce Committee that was told in a markup  on March 7 to find $880 billion worth of cuts. The Congressional Budget  Office it says can't do that unless there are cuts to Medicaid. I have  heard some of my colleagues say, well, we are not going to address  vulnerable populations, and they include pregnant women in that. The  healthcare disparity doesn't start the day you get the positive  pregnancy test. It starts when you aren't getting access to the care  that you need to address diabetes or hypertension or the cardiovascular  issue that is bubbling.

As we see Medicaid expansion at risk, all of the progress we began to  make to address these disparities is at risk.

Mr. Speaker, this is not politics. This is not theoretical debates  over the role of the Federal Government. This is people are dying, and  our Declaration of Independence that we will celebrate the 250th  anniversary of next year says that: All men--and I would add women--are  endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights: life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Life is number one.

When the Federal, State, and local governments work together with the  private sector, our research hospitals, the nonprofit community, when  we work together to identify the reasons for the disparities and put  policies in place that address them, people's lives are saved. When we  strip those policies away, when we strip away the very workforce  implementing them, people will die.

That is why I am proud to stand here as a member of the Congressional  Black Caucus and say we will fight to protect those policies that save  our people's lives.

Tomorrow, when my daughter turns 10 and I think back at how I almost  became that statistic but how we are also coming up on the 1-year  anniversary of when her uncle became the statistic of a Black man more  likely to die because of a heart attack, I am going to follow the theme  of the 2025 National Minority Health Awareness Month: Advancing  Commitments to Eliminate Health Disparities. I am going to fight any  effort by our President or my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  to put barriers in our way and to remove the very policies that help  save lives to begin with.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690243/health-disparities-in-minority-communities,2025-04-28,2025-W18

Democrat,George Latimer,Northeast Corridor Amtrak Cuts,"Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, before I hopped on the Northeast Regional  train to D.C. this morning, I joined Westchester County Executive Ken  Jenkins to bring attention to the Trump administration's proposed 25  percent cut in funding the Amtrak Northeast Corridor service. This is a  bad business decision that speaks more to politics than any objective  analysis of what will grow the economy and jobs.

In the congested corridor between Boston and D.C., where major  businesses are headquartered and where we generate major revenue for  this Nation, we don't need more cars on the road and more planes  circling our airports.

We can attract more Amtrak riders with modernization and upgrades,  but this administration shows every day that if you don't support them  and their policies, you don't count. They will remove Federal services  from key cities, take away longtime tax deductions, impose their values  and policies, and now curtail transportation options.

Those of us who represent northeast and mid-Atlantic States get the  message loud and clear: We don't count.

Amtrak represents growth and expansion for America. When we treat it  as such, we will see more of these benefits in other corridors.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692196/northeast-corridor-amtrak-cuts,2025-06-09,2025-W24
Republican,Randy Fine,"Supporting A Free, Democratic, and Secular Iran","Mr. FINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock) for asking me here to talk about this important subject.

Mr. Speaker, I came to speak because the cause of Iran is not just a  cause that we should care about for the Iranian people, though we  should. As Americans, we are a people whose country was founded because  a group of people were unhappy by the tyranny we faced. There is no  question they face it over there, as well.

The cause of Iran is one that we should care about because it is in  the best interest of the United States to care about it. We live in a  world that, unfortunately, is on fire, whether it is in China, whether  we see it in Russia, or certainly in Iran.

Iran has chosen to not only take their horrific, genocidal, lunatic  policies to kill their own people, to hurt women, and to hurt people  who won't abide by their radical Islamic faiths, but they have done it  to other people around the world. They are the leading sponsor of  terrorism around the world.

We saw this most dramatically just a little over 18 months ago when,  on October 7, 2023, 1,200 people, most of which were Jews, but not all,  people from dozens of countries, including Americans, were attacked and  killed.

We focus on Hamas, but Hamas only exists because Iran funds and  supports it. Just as we saw President Trump free the last American  citizen who was being held hostage because of Iran, those problems and  challenges continue to happen today.

I did a little research. Obviously, I have an affinity for Jewish  problems around the world because I am Jewish. I have always been part  of a small minority throughout my life. I am one here in Congress, as  well, and it is a great honor to be here.

In 1979, 100,000 Jews lived in Iran. The same people who Iran likes  to fund to talk about genocide, suffering, and rooting out people and  all these problems around the world, Mr. Speaker, you can say: How many  of those folks still live in Iran today?

Today, estimates are that 10,000 Jews live in Iran. I am not saying  that 90,000 of them have been killed. Certainly, some of them have. Mr.  Speaker, 90,000 have left. That is 90 percent of this population, of  just one population. There are many populations of people who would be  at risk in a place like Iran, but 90 percent have left and fled. Many,  by the way, have come to the United States.

They do that because they are not free to live their lives the way  they want to live them. Today, when we talk about this, we stand with  Iran not only because we believe in freedom for all people around the  world but freedom of self-determination and to decide what kind of  government we want.

Frankly, we want to allow women to vote, to have equal rights with  men, to live in a society where religion is important but is not a tool  for oppression.

We care about these issues because they create peace and security in  the Middle East. Ultimately, that leads to peace and security here in  the United States.

It is my honor to speak here today to support the gentleman and his  resolution. We must do everything we can to get these lunatics out of  power and allow the great Persian people, where many say civilization  began thousands and thousands of years ago, to reseize that initiative  that they had at the founding of civilization and to rebuild the kind  of society they once had and certainly could have again.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691211/supporting-a-free-democratic-and-secular-iran,2025-05-14,2025-W20
Republican,Greg Steube,"Recognizing Krysta Fowler, Gold Award","Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me  in congratulating Krysta Fowler. Krysta is an individually registered  member of Girl Scouts of Gulf Coast Florida and has exemplified  extraordinary leadership, innovative problem-solving, and a  demonstrated commitment to making a lasting, positive impact, by  earning the most prestigious award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award.

Gold Award Girl Scouts are recognized as trailblazers who are willing  to tackle the most pressing challenges facing their communities and the  world with measurable, sustainable, and far-reaching results. To earn  the Girl Scout Gold Award, high school-age Girl Scouts must identify  and investigate an issue they care about, devise a plan, and then lead  a team of experts and community members to implement a project that  produces lasting change. Over the course of 1-2 years, Gold Award Girl  Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and leadership,  distinguishing them from their peers. Through their resourcefulness and  perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to truly make the world a  better place.

Krysta's project, ``BAT-vocate: Appreciation and Awareness for  Bats,'' in partnership with The City of North Port, North Port School  District, The Environmental Conservancy of North Port, Peace River  Wildlife Center, Girl Scouts of Gulf Coast Florida, was an excellent  endeavor to address the issue of bat endangerment, conservancy, and  awareness in our community. Krysta took action by constructing 26  sustainable bat habitats across Bradenton, North Port, and Ft. Myers to  support endangered bat populations. She led educational workshops for  Girl Scouts and community members on bat conservation and successfully  petitioned the City of North Port to establish a Bat Awareness Day.  Additionally, she collaborated with the council to develop a Girl Scout  badge curriculum, ensuring ongoing education on bat conservation. Her  efforts will have a lasting positive impact on the community. It is an  honor to represent brave individuals like Tigran Gambaryan in Congress,  and I celebrate his return home to his wife Yuki and their two young  children. God bless their family.

On behalf of the 17th Congressional District of Florida,  congratulations to Krysta Fowler for achieving the highest distinction  in Girl Scouts, the Gold Award. We thank Krysta for her leadership and  making such a positive, lasting change in our community.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690422/recognizing-krysta-fowler-gold-award,2025-04-30,2025-W18
Republican,Lloyd Smucker,"Congratulating Sophia Rivera, Girls' Shot Put and Discus State Champion","Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate Sophia Rivera  of Ephrata High School on winning gold medals in both girls' shot put  and girls' discus at the 2025 PIAA Class 3A Track and Field  Championship, held on May 23 and 24.

The 2025 PIAA Class 3A track and field championship took place on May  23 and 24,  during which Ephrata junior Sophia Rivera excelled in shot put and  discus. On the first day, Rivera captured the state title in girls'  shot put with a distance of 43 feet, 3 inches. Her domination continued  into girls' discus the following day, where a throw of 143 feet, 3  inches nabbed the gold medal.

Sophia Rivera's two state titles crown a spectacular season and a  complete sweep in the postseason, as Rivera won gold medals in both  events during the Lancaster-Lebanon League championship and the  District Three championship weeks prior.

With two state titles and a total of 6 gold medals during the track  and field postseason, Sophia Rivera has firmly established herself as  one of Pennsylvania's best in shot put and discus. I offer my sincere  congratulations to Sophia on her success this year and look forward to  seeing what she accomplishes next.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691701/congratulating-sophia-rivera-girls-shot-put-and-discus-state-champion,2025-06-02,2025-W23
Democrat,Suhas Subramanyam,Recognizing Food Pantries,"Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to give a huge thank-you to all  of the food pantries, food banks, and nonprofits that helped so many  families during this past shutdown, and really all year, with food  insecurity. They have been giving out hundreds of thousands of meals,  very rarely ever turning away anyone.

The ones in my community include ones like Dulles South Food Pantry,  Haymarket Regional Food Pantry, Mobile Hope, Northern Virginia Food  Rescue, Creating Foundations for Hope, House of Mercy Food Pantry, and,  of course, Loudoun Hunger Relief. They did so much: fresh produce,  sweet treats, pantry essentials, and even Thanksgiving meals coming up  next week.

Some saw up to a 500 percent increase in new families asking for  food, and this is still going to be a big issue. We saw the SNAP cuts  over the summer. All of them told me that that is going to be a big  issue.

We need to continue to address food insecurity in America, and I  thank those organizations for stepping up when we needed them most.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696984/recognizing-food-pantries,2025-11-19,2025-W47
Democrat,Angela Alsobrooks,Department of Health and Human Services,"Ms. ALSOBROOKS. Mr. President, I would like to use my time to  highlight the attacks currently being thrown at our Federal workers and  the unconscionable firings that are taking place.

We have heard baseless and callous criticisms of our Federal workers  from this administration for weeks now. They are wrong, and much of  what they are built on is a lie. And they are dehumanizing.

This is, in fact, a witch hunt. Our civil servants are among the best  of what our Nation has to offer. They serve with no political  motivation. Many have served for years under Democratic administrations  and Republican administrations. They have one dedication: to their  fellow Americans. It is a patriotic calling that they have all  answered. They are not faceless villains. They are real people with  real stories.

People like a woman I spoke with who has served at the Department of  Health and Human Services for over 35 years, she has been put on leave  as a part of the President's Executive orders. For her and people like  her, to be caught up in these partisan attacks is infuriating.

The administration claims to be doing this in the name of efficiency.  There is nothing efficient about gaining unauthorized access to private  data and then blindly firing 5,200 employees across multiple Agencies.  There is nothing competent about cutting the workforce without any  thought about how it would impact operations.

This is not efficient. This is senseless, and this is heartless.

NIH is based in my State of Maryland, and many of the workers there  are among the 150,000 civil servants who call Maryland home. Each one  of them has made a commitment to public service. Each one of them is a  civil servant that I am proud to represent. These abrupt and improper  firings have shaken up the lives of thousands of dedicated workers who  do not deserve this treatment. And what makes this even worse is that  attacking our Federal workers doesn't just hurt them; it hurts all  Americans, the people who rely on government programs to keep them  healthy and safe.

These aren't hypothetical concerns. These firings will have real- world consequences. Eliminating staff at NIH will delay the development  and approval of lifesaving treatments. Cancer patients will have to  wait longer for promising new treatments as clinical trials still stall  due to staffing shortages. This will slowly eliminate research and  medical intervention and weaken our standing in global biomedical  science.

Cuts to an already understaffed CMS workforce will hurt patient care.  We will see disruptions in medically necessary care and delays in  payments to hospitals and other healthcare providers. Firing staff at  HHS will cripple our ability to quickly identify and respond to public  health threats. And right now, we are experiencing the worst flu season  in over 15 years, resulting in school closures in at least 10 States.  We are monitoring an outbreak of Ebola in Uganda. We are keeping track  of the growing threat of avian influenza.

Without a strong workforce, we will not be able to react effectively.  It is impossible to forget the significant role that NIH plays in  developing and deploying vaccines and treatments. We are just beyond  the clutches of the last major public health crisis. And without a  strong workforce, we will not be prepared to face the next pandemic.

In the clearest terms possible, these cuts aren't about efficiency.  To the American people, it quite literally could be the difference  between life and death. They are as direct a contradiction as you can  have of the priorities this administration claimed to set when they  took control--to ease burdens on families. Instead, these firings could  add enormous strain to a nation that is already in need of relief. They  are irresponsible, they are inefficient, and they are undeserved.

What our civil servants deserve is a recognition of the work they do  every day to make us stronger. What the American people deserve is for  us to keep our obligation to ensure their health and their safety. I  will continue to defend them and apply pressure to this administration  until it happens.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688252/department-of-health-and-human-services,2025-02-27,2025-W09

Republican,Kevin Kiley,Universal School Choice,"Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, The Nation's Report Card  recently showed that our education system is in a state of crisis.  There has been a steady and alarming decline. However, right now, we  have an opportunity to turn the tide by catalyzing a revolution in  school choice across the country.

One-half of the equation is the Educational Choice for Children Act  which will expand private school choice to 2 million kids and has been  included in the text of the reconciliation bill.

However, the other one-half, the High-Quality Charter School Act, and  a tax provision contained therein, would triple the number of kids in  charter schools across the country remains missing still.

I am encouraging my colleagues to ensure that we provide support for  charter school families in equal measure in a way that will expand  opportunity across the country. Together with universal school choice,  we will be able to begin a new era of educational excellence in this  country.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691230/universal-school-choice,2025-05-14,2025-W20
Republican,Gus Bilirakis,Recognizing Ellen Tantillo,"Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Ellen Tantillo has made through her work with  Metropolitan Ministries. Ellen has been a dedicated volunteer at  Metropolitan Ministries since 2016. Monday and Friday mornings at the  Metro Welcome Center are lively and welcoming, thanks to this  remarkable woman. She greets both new and returning volunteers with  enthusiasm, ensuring newcomers feel comfortable and understand the  importance of their roles. Her humor, empathy, and dedication ensure  smooth operations across all areas, from kitchen prep to client  shopping in the metro market. She welcomes everyone--volunteers,  clients, residents, and community members--with warmth, compassion, and  genuine joy in service. Ellen is always ready to tackle any task that  needs attention. Metropolitan Ministries relies heavily on her to keep  Volunteer Services running smoothly, not just during the holidays but  all year round. She embodies the four key values of Metro's culture,  including: Character, Chemistry, Competency, and Calling.

It is clear Ellen Tantillo has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for her service.

Democrat,Steven Horsford,Black History Month,"Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues in the  Congressional Black Caucus to honor my history--our history--American  history . . .

I'm here to honor Black history during Black History Month.

This is a time to honor our elders, and the struggles they endured  bringing us to this moment.

My home of Las Vegas is rich with contributions, milestones and  heroes that advanced equity in our society.

People like Hattie Canty--who led the Culinary Workers Union Local  226 to fight for better wages and job security, including the longest  strike in American history against unfair labor conditions--six and a  half years.

Places like West Las Vegas, which became the heart of the city's  Black community during segregation.

Black-owned businesses and venues along the Black Strip on Jackson  Avenue allowed culture to thrive . . .

. . . while entrepreneurship and homeownership helped local community  members begin to accumulate wealth.

And breakthroughs, like the Sands Hotel allowing Nat King Cole to  stay and perform there in 1955, challenging racial segregation to its  core at the time.

Las Vegas is one of so many, pillars of progress--progress made over  generations--and progress that is under threat right now by forces who  want to take our country backwards.

. . . Denigrating civil rights . . .

. . . Undermining racial diversity . . .

. . . Eroding opportunities to grow wealth and better oneself with an  education.

What the forces against progress don't seem to realize, is the spirit  of progress is alive and well today--every bit as much as it was for my  parents' generation, and the generations before them.

I mentioned Hattie Canty--I stand on her shoulders to this day.

I spent a decade leading the Culinary Training Academy of Las Vegas  that she helped found in 1993.

It trains thousands of people every year with vocational skills that  help local youths, adults, and displaced workers find work in the  hospitality industry.

The spirit of Black History Month is the spirit of progress--it's a  flame that cannot be blown out.

I am grateful for all of the leaders who came before me.

And my commitment is to stand steadfast for future generations in  this time of need, just as past generations did for me.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688004/black-history-month,2025-02-25,2025-W09
Republican,Troy Downing,Safeguarding Property,"Mr. DOWNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of my bill, the  Safeguarding American Property Act.

In the 119th Congress, House Republicans have sent a clear message to  criminal illegal aliens: If you break our laws, you go home.

Earlier this year, we passed the Laken Riley Act. My Safeguarding  American Property Act builds on the good work of the Laken Riley Act by  expanding the bill to include property crimes like trespassing and  arson as deportable offenses.

Mitigating these types of property crimes is a particularly important  challenge for border States and rural districts like mine which often  have vast distances between homes and businesses and in which law  enforcement resources are often spread thin.

This bill sticks up for those communities and upholds the fundamental  American value of respecting property rights by providing additional  legal requirements that ensure Federal immigration law is properly  enforced.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Safeguarding  American Property Act to further strengthen the good policies codified  in the Laken Riley Act.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689825/safeguarding-property,2025-04-09,2025-W15

Republican,Buddy Carter,Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025,"Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong and  unapologetic support of the SAVE America Act, legislation that defends  the integrity of our elections and makes one principle perfectly clear:  U.S. elections are for U.S. citizens only.

This is not extreme. It is common sense. Citizenship matters.  Sovereignty matters. Americans alone must decide America's future.

Yet radical Democrats have abandoned the standard. New York City has  allowed noncitizens to vote in local elections. Washington, D.C., has  done the same, granting political power to foreign nationals in the  Capital of our Nation.

Georgia's own Senator John Ossoff, who once said that voter ID was  right and appropriate, now supports his party reframing it as voter  suppression.

The law didn't change. Public opinion didn't change. What changed was  he and other Democrat politicians like him realized that illegal  immigrants could no longer vote to keep Democrats in office.

They oppose this bill because it chips away at their voting base,  plain and simple. For years, conservatives warned that this was the  radical left's goal, and we were mocked for it.

That is exactly what Democrats are doing right now, fighting to allow  illegal aliens to vote. This is not only grotesquely unjust, but it  waters down the meaning of American citizenship.

Mr. Speaker, by passing this bill, we reaffirm a simple but sacred  truth. American elections belong to Americans, no loopholes, no  exceptions, no apologies.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1700004/veterans-accessibility-advisory-committee-act-of-2025,2026-02-11,2026-W07

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 9) authorizing the use of the  Capitol Grounds for the National Peace Officers Memorial Service and  the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition.

The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.

The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                               H. Con. Res. 9

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That       SECTION 1. USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL PEACE                     OFFICERS MEMORIAL SERVICE.

(b) Date of Memorial Service.--The Memorial Service shall       be held on May 15, 2025, or on such other date as the Speaker       of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules       and Administration of the Senate jointly designate, with       preparation for the event to begin on May 9, 2025, and       takedown completed on May 16, 2025.       SEC. 2. USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL HONOR GUARD                     AND PIPE BAND EXHIBITION.

(a) In General.--The National Fraternal Order of Police and       its auxiliary shall be permitted to sponsor a public event,       the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition (in this       resolution referred to as the ``Exhibition''), on the Capitol       Grounds, in order to allow law enforcement representatives to       exhibit their ability to demonstrate Honor Guard programs and       provide for a bagpipe exhibition.

(b) Date of Exhibition.--The Exhibition shall be held on       May 14, 2025, or on such other date as the Speaker of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and       Administration of the Senate jointly designate.       SEC. 3. TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

(a) In General.--Under conditions to be prescribed by the       Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board, the       event shall be--

(1) free of admission charge and open to the public; and

SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT OF RESTRICTIONS.

Mr. PERRY.  Con. Res. 9.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have introduced this bipartisan resolution  along with the Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency  Management Subcommittee Ranking Member   Greg Stanton of Arizona.

This resolution authorizes the use of these Capitol Grounds for the  44th Annual Peace Officers' Memorial event to honor the law enforcement  officers who died in the line of duty in 2024.

According to the Fraternal Order of Police, last year, there were 342  on-duty officers who were shot, 50 of whom were killed.

In February of this year, tragedy occurred in the district I am  honored to represent when multiple police officers were shot while in  the line of duty. One, Officer Andrew Duarte of the West York Borough  Police Department, made the ultimate sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, he was  only 30 years old.

Police officers across the country put their lives on the line every  single day to keep us safe. Every day that they go out, they put their  uniforms on and leave their families, and they don't know what they are  going to run into. Every day can be a boring day where nothing happens.  They can go through a whole career that way, but they never know and  their families never know. Every single day, they are prepared. They  are ready to give everything as a sacrifice to their communities to  make sure that safety is preserved.

That is why I and my friend, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Stanton), are extremely honored to once again be able to sponsor this  resolution.

Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, like my friend, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Stanton), implied, these are heartbreaking, heart-wrenching stories  about real people. Oftentimes, in our country, people look for heroes.  They look to sporting fields. They look to pop culture for their  heroes, but their heroes walk right among them, right in their own  communities every single day, again, being willing when they put on  that uniform, when they sign up, to say, ``I will give all for my  community,'' running to the sound of the gun, running to the danger,  unlike most other people whose senses, whose sensibilities, tell  them to go the other way.

This is the smallest thing we can do to acknowledge the enormous  sacrifice that law enforcement makes every single day in our community,  to acknowledge that sacrifice and to honor those heroes who are near  and far.

In closing, I reiterate my support for H. Con. Res. 9, which will  honor the fallen men and women serving our Nation as law enforcement  officers.

Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution, and I yield back the  balance of my time.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689661/authorizing-the-use-of-the-capitol-grounds-for-the-national-peace-officers-memorial-service-and-the-national-honor-guard-and-pipe-band-exhibition,2025-04-07,2025-W15
Republican,John Cornyn,Department of Government Efficiency,"Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, it looks like my timing is exquisite  because I came down here to talk about something that I think has sort  of fallen off the radar screen here in recent weeks, and that is the  work of the Department of Government Efficiency,  one of the most important developments that I think we have seen with  the advent of President Trump's ascension to the Office of President.

It is amazing to me to listen to my Democratic colleagues talking  like Chicken Little: ``The sky is falling.'' I heard the Senator from  Rhode Island suggest that we are trying to privatize Social Security.  There is no one--absolutely no one--suggesting that. This is what is  called a straw man. You erect a phony argument, and you knock it down,  and you claim victory.

The truth is, Mr. Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency  should be applauded for their efforts to root out waste, fraud, and  abuse. You would think taxpayers--the same taxpayers our colleagues  represent in their States--would applaud this effort.

I can't think of a more difficult but important goal than helping the  government find efficiencies and reduce spending, because if we reduce  spending, two things happen: Either we reduce the taxes that are taken  from the hard-working families and produce the revenue by which  government operates or we eliminate or reduce the amount of debt that  the Federal Government accrues, which right now is at an unsustainable  level. To me, both of those things are positive: limiting the amount of  money that comes from the taxpayer or--and maybe it is ``and''-- reducing the government debt.

The problem with runaway spending by the government, of course, is  not a new one, but it has been getting increasingly worse, particularly  during the last 4 years of the Biden administration. The truth is, it  has taken us a long time to get to $37 trillion in debt, but it has now  reached the point of unsustainability. We are spending more money on  interest on the national debt than we are on defense in an increasingly  dangerous world. That alone is unsustainable.

Ronald Reagan described our spending problem back in 1984, when he  said these famous words, ``We could say they spend money like drunken  sailors, but that would be unfair to drunken sailors,'' which just  about sums it up.

For somebody like Elon Musk, who is reportedly one of the most  wealthy--maybe, the most wealthy person--on the planet to spend his  time and effort and to assemble a team like he has to work with the  government and to start the Department of Government Efficiency is a  huge public service. I am grateful to Elon Musk, who has volunteered  his time, as well as recruiting others to help the U.S. Government deal  with its spending addiction and to try to help it get clean--certainly,  much worse than a drunken sailor.

This morning, I had a chance to meet with a gentleman, Joe Gebbia,  who is the former CEO of Airbnb and who is volunteering his time  because he sees this as an unprecedented opportunity to get at problems  that the government historically has been unable to deal with, and that  is the incredible rise and increase in government spending, the  inefficiency, the waste of taxpayer funds, and the national debt.

So getting a team like this, with very accomplished entrepreneurs and  people who have been very successful in the private sector, to come in  and try to help us figure out how to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse  strikes me as an act of patriotism and public service.

I know we have heard the saying that imitation is the highest form of  flattery. Back home in Texas, Governor Abbott and the Texas Legislature  have also followed dozens of other States in paying a high compliment  to the Department of Government Efficiency and Elon Musk by proposing a  DOGE-like task force at the State level. I am sure that, even in a  State as efficiently run and with as low taxes as Texas, you can find  inefficiency that can be and should be rooted out.

Govenor Abbott recently signed the first bill of this year's  legislative session into law to establish the Texas Regulatory  Efficiency Office, modeled after DOGE.

While some States are more fiscally responsible than others, State  governments, as I said, are not immune from spending taxpayer money on  outdated or inefficient programs. Texas is one of the most efficient.  That shouldn't surprise anyone. We have the fourth lowest State taxes  in the country, and we have been ranked one of the lowest spending  States in terms of State-spending per capita.

I look forward to seeing the great work being done down in Austin by  the Texas DOGE and what they can do to try to help make State  government more efficient. I know I join many of them in thanking Elon  and his team at DOGE for the inspiration and what he has brought down  to our State.

Of course, Elon's status within the Federal Government is that of  what is called a special government employee. That means it is for a  period of time--130 days, in this case. And with that date approaching  soon, Mr. Musk indicates he plans to wrap up his work. But I must  emphasize that the work of DOGE must go on. The task of improving  government efficiency is one that will never be finished.

I believe that Elon Musk and his team at DOGE have made monumental  progress in just a few short months. Let me give you a few examples.

The Department of the Treasury started its first automated payment  verification system at the recommendation of DOGE. So far, more than  $300 million has been identified in improper payment requests.

Over at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the  government has launched a Fraud Detection Operations Center, and 1 week  ago today, CMS announced they suspended suspected fraudulent payments  to 33 different providers. One such fraudulent payment was for a  patient that died two decades ago. It reminds me of some of the people  on the Social Security rolls that DOGE has also found--some well in  excess of 100 years old, if they exist at all.

Well, another example included billing more than $2 million in  genetic testing for patients that never actually received the test.  These are just a few examples of the gross fraud and inefficiencies  that happened throughout the Federal Government.

I am sure it is just the tip of the iceberg, but these technical  payment glitches are just scratching the surface. DOGE's findings and  recommendations have also eliminated some of the most egregious  examples of fraud.

The Department of Justice, in partnership with DOGE, discovered and  charged an Iraqi man for illegally voting in a U.S. election. Now, we  should know--I think everybody does know--that foreign nationals,  noncitizens, are not eligible to vote in U.S. elections. That is a  privilege reserved for citizens of the United States. Instances of  foreign nationals voting in our elections threaten the bedrock of our  democratic Republic. All of us should be thankful to the Department of  Justice, Attorney General Bondi, FBI Director Patel, and DOGE that they  identified and eliminated this violation of the sanctity of our  elections process.

The Department of Labor and the Department of Agriculture are working  to make sure that illegal immigrants are not receiving Federal benefits  that they are not authorized to receive, such as unemployment insurance  or SNAP benefits, otherwise known as food stamps. These programs were  meant to protect vulnerable Americans, not to reward illegal immigrants  for breaking our laws.

From eliminating improper payments to safeguarding our elections, I  believe we owe Mr. Musk a debt of gratitude for helping to identify  these problems--again, just the tip of the iceberg--and/or eliminating  these wasteful uses of hard-earned tax dollars.

In order to consolidate the gains that DOGE has made, I support  Congress and the administration working together to codify these cost- cutting measures through rescissions. That is the official process by  which we actually save the money.

This will be important for a few different reasons. No. 1, it will  allow us to use the savings that DOGE is identifying in order to offset  the costs of the tax bill that we are currently considering, allowing  us to send even more money back to the American people. Any money we  can save from wasteful spending, obviously, can be sent back or kept by  the people who earn it in the first place, which are hard-working  American families.

So I am very happy to hear that the White House indicated that they  plan on sending us a rescissions package very soon. I would recommend,  personally, that they send a rescissions package on a monthly basis.

I am going to be very interested to see how our Democratic colleagues  react to some of these sensible spending cuts or rescissions. So far,  what they have done is they have been in complete opposition to  anything and everything that the Trump administration has proposed,  including the Department of Government Efficiency.

I don't think it helps their credibility when some of the most  egregious expenditures and waste of taxpayer money are pointed out, and  they complain about the person who is identifying it and made it  possible maybe to save that money or to return it to the taxpayers from  whom it came in the first place.

As officials at the Office of Management and Budget consider their  options moving forward, I hope they know that I will be a willing and  eager partner in their efforts.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690662/department-of-government-efficiency,2025-05-05,2025-W19
Democrat,Suhas Subramanyam,Markets Sent Into A Tailspin,"Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the President posted on  social media: ``This is a great time to buy.'' Then, shortly after  that, he paused his tariff plan, the very one that sent markets into a  tailspin.

The market bounced back, although it is down again, and the President  celebrated in the Oval Office with top financial executives. They  celebrated at whose expense? The parents who watched their kids'  college savings accounts get depleted, the retirees who rely on their  investments to carry them through their remaining years, and the small  business owners, including many in my district, who don't know how to  plan and don't know how to keep the lights on at this point.

This wreaked havoc on millions of Americans, and those Americans also  deserve to know about what happened and who profited off of it.

Did the financial executives know about what was going to happen? Did  the President's donors know? Who knew and who profited from this  ``great time to buy'' tweet and everything that was leading up to it?

We need a full investigation into what happened and who profited from  it. The American people deserve better.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689992/markets-sent-into-a-tailspin,2025-04-10,2025-W15
Republican,David Taylor,Recognizing Hillsboro High School Lady Indians,"Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Hillsboro High  School Lady Indians softball team.

The Lady Indians had a historic season this year that saw them  achieve over 20 wins and secure the Division 4 regional championship  for the first time in 23 years, finishing the year as State runner-up.

Teamwork propelled them to great achievements as the Lady Indians  consistently had great performances on the mound and in the batter's  box.

Along the way, the Lady Indians were supported by a dedicated fan  base of parents and alumni that fueled their desire for victory.  Without the fan support and the support of their coaches, none of this  would have been possible.

I will always be grateful for the parents and coaches that pour so  much of themselves into our student athletes. The great achievements of  the Lady Indians belong to them as much as they belong to the players.

Mr. Speaker, all of southern Ohio is proud of our Lady Indians'  accomplishments, and I look forward to another great season next year.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693117/recognizing-hillsboro-high-school-lady-indians,2025-06-27,2025-W26
Democrat,Suzanne Bonamici,Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act,"Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise  today in strong opposition to the SAVE Act.

This bill will make it more difficult to register to vote, and it  will prevent millions of American citizens, including married women who  change their name and rural Americans, from exercising their right to  vote. It creates an enormous and expensive unfunded mandate on election  offices, and for what?

Federal law already requires people to attest under penalty of  perjury that they are U.S. citizens when they register to vote.  Noncitizens attempting to register to vote is exceedingly rare, and if  they do, they face severe consequences, including fines, up to 5 years  in prison, and deportation.

Mr. Speaker, more than 140 million Americans do not have a passport.  Approximately 70 million women do not have a birth certificate that  matches their current legal name. Millions and millions of rural voters  would have to travel long distances to try to register to vote.

We don't have to guess what would happen if this bill were to pass.  In 2011, Kansas had a proof-of-citizenship requirement.

Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, in Kansas, more than 30,000 U.S. citizens,  12 percent of everyone seeking to register to vote, were barred from  voting.

Other States have tried. In all of them, a significant number of  citizens have been wrongly barred from voting. It is unacceptable. It  is voter suppression. It is wrong.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the SAVE  Act.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690002/safeguard-american-voter-eligibility-act,2025-04-10,2025-W15

Republican,Chip Roy,Highlighting Flawed Policies,"Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I would note just an observation: One of our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle who is a cancer survivor--and  God bless him for it--was raising issues about government funding and  about what funding should or shouldn't exist and what this  administration may or may not be doing to make sure our bureaucracies  are running efficiently and effectively and not wasting money.

I say this as a cancer survivor, stage III, Hodgkin's lymphoma, 13  years ago: I think research is important. I think we need to make sure  there is solid research. I think it can be driven heavily by the  private-sector businesses who are incentivized to make money for  developing lifesaving drugs, but it could be done in concert with  governments and universities. What we don't need is continued  profligate Federal funding in order to achieve greatness.

The Wright brothers, Henry Ford, the great inventors, the great  industrialists, the great innovators in technology, the entrepreneurs  out there, for the most part, are not doing that based on government  funding and action. They are doing it based on innovation and hard  work. That should be our model and approach.

While I appreciate those who have gone through a terrible disease  like cancer, as I did, as a number of people in this Chamber, and as  millions of Americans across this country have done, it is not always a  rationale for more government spending, more government action, and  more government bureaucracy.

I would note that the other colleague who came down and talked about  high and rising energy prices, I too share some frustration about  foreign-owned energy companies and utility companies.

I would remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that our  energy prices wouldn't be skyrocketing and off the charts had we not  gone down the foolish road of massive subsidies for the so-called Green  New Deal, which is more rightly called the green new scam, in which  foreign companies, Chinese companies, have been enriched because my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle wanted to pursue their  radical agenda.

Do you want to know why the price of energy is going up? It is  because of Democratic policies and mandates, EV mandates, and mandates  about solar panels and wind farms that are far less efficient than  nuclear and clean-burning natural gas. Those things are driving up the  price of energy for the average American and putting that money into  the pockets of a handful of wealthy people and the Chinese. I  congratulate them, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  shouldn't come whining to Congress about what they need in order to  deal with high energy prices that my Democratic colleagues caused.

That is the truth.

The fact of the matter is that we need to do a lot better job of  speaking truth here in this Chamber. As a number of my colleagues were  debating a resolution honoring a friend to many of us, Charlie Kirk,  who, as is well known now, lost his life last week, I am reminded of  the importance of truth. Truth matters.

Charlie stood for the proposition that you should go into the public  square and put forward your ideas and put forward what you believe is  truth and then hash it out. He did so eloquently, thoughtfully, and  engagingly with people of all stripes: Black, White, straight, gay,  male, female, whatever it was. He would engage with people on campuses  and around this country to pursue truth.

Mr. Speaker, one of my favorite quotes is from Thomas Jefferson where  he said that for here, we are willing to pursue truth wherever it may  lead. We need to follow truth wherever it may lead, but you also have  to have the courage to speak truth.

Charlie Kirk, when he was engaging with Bill Maher, a skeptic, just  earlier this year, said: ``In China and, of course, in the Soviet  Union, there was an anti-Christian movement. Very hardcore. What book  do you think is best for humanity to live by? I say the Bible. The  entire arc of the Bible is a story of love and a need for humanity's  redemption. The Bible has wisdom in ways you might not ever imagine.  Humanity will seek to find a book. They will seek to find a code to  live by, and I think it is incumbent upon atheists to tell us what that  should be.''

Charlie Kirk earlier this year in April: ``The mechanisms of a  religious society are good for everybody. When somebody walks around  and thinks that you were created and that you are not God, you tend to  have better citizens.'' Charlie was not wrong.

Earlier this year, Charlie Kirk, in a debate with an atheist: ``I  would argue you have a lot more faith than I do. You have a lot more  blind faith to believe that everything around you, love, joy, peace,  sadness, is all just a construct of neurons firing in your brain. We,  as Christians, have hope that we are going to see our loved ones again  and that we will be in Heaven and that we will be in perfect peace and  that this is not it. In fact, there is something even better awaiting  us.''

Also earlier this year with Bill Maher: ``The greatest minds of  history have been mesmerized by the Scriptures: Isaac Newton, Thomas  Aquinas. Isaac Newton wrote more about biblical prophecy than even  physics. And so there is something about the Scriptures that are  intellectual, that does push your limits. And that is what I think is  so beautiful about our faith is it can be accessible to everyone, but  infinitely nourishing in exploration.''

Earlier this year, Charlie said about his goal of conservatism. He  said: ``You have to try to point them toward ultimate purposes and  toward getting back to the church, getting back to faith, getting  married, having children. That is the type of conservatism that I  represent, and I am trying to paint a picture of virtue, of lifting  people up. . . .''

In another exchange with Bill Maher: ``It defies reason to think that  this is just a roll of the dice. When you see a baby come into the  world, when you see how we naturally heal, when you see even  consciousness itself, I think it is a pretty miraculous thing. To think  that it is all just a bunch of happy accidents, I think it is more  rational to think that it is a byproduct of design.''

Four days before Charlie was shot, I think he tweeted out: ``Jesus  defeated death so you can live.''

Earlier this year, Charlie said: ``I want to be remembered for  courage for my faith. That would be the most important thing. The most  important thing is my faith.''

I can go further.

My point of sharing these things is the importance of us standing up  and speaking truth. People say, Well, Chip, how can you say it is  truth? It is just what you believe when you talk about your faith.

Well, I, of course, believe it to be true. It is truth. Jesus did die  so that we may live and Jesus lives.

It is important that we remember our Nation's founding and our  Nation's convictions and the spirit that binds us together as a Nation,  actual spirit, in God we trust. We cannot be bound together as a Nation  if we do not adhere to a commonsense set of principles and values,  rooted in a collective faith, a collective faith in God Almighty.

It does not mean that every individual has to believe anything  specific. It doesn't mean that anybody has to go to church. It doesn't  mean that we have to go around doing something in violation of the  First Amendment, which says you can believe what you want to believe,  but the First Amendment also does not stand for the proposition that we  should walk away from our collective faith. It does not do that.  Nowhere in the First Amendment does it say that.

How does a Nation conquer evil? How does a nation conquer Nazi  Germany, Imperial Japan, the Soviet Union? Was it all because we just  got together and decided to put together a military, or was there  something bigger? Was there something more important? Was there a  collective faith in the Almighty that bound us together and gave us the  courage for those young men to walk into a wall of bullets at Normandy?

People always ask me what is wrong with our country. Why is there so  much division? When the Nation turns its back on God, when the Nation  walks away from that collective faith, then do we really even have a  Nation?

A lot of people keep branding Charlie as a conservative activist.  Sure. He unapologetically advanced his definition of conservatism, but  remember, as I said, when he tried to define that conservatism, he  talked about it in the context of faith. He said, as I said a minute  ago: ``You have to try to point them toward ultimate purposes and  toward getting back to the church, getting back to faith, getting  married, having children. That is the type of conservatism that I  represent.''

I got to be honest, that should be the essence of conservatism and  the essence of who we are. What point is there to living free if you  are not advancing toward the kingdom of God?

Charlie had courage to speak to this, to raise these issues to a lost  generation, consumed into devices that are destroying the minds of our  youth, devices that I would wipe away from the face of the planet  tomorrow if I could. I would, God's honest truth. The Amish are on to  something, but since I can't do that, can we not at least recognize  that these are poisoning our children?

The first thought I had after I had received word that Charlie was  shot was to call my wife and to figure out how to get word to my son,  also named Charlie, who I knew was an enormous fan of Charlie Kirk and  who does not have social media or access to it on his telephone but is  around a lot of friends who do. I wanted to get word to him not to look  at anything because I knew immediately that the horrific images would  be spread around instantly, and no children should be watching that.

That is just one example of millions every day polluting the minds of  our children, coarsening our culture, breaking us down, addicting our  children to devices instead of engagement, conversation, life, family,  and being outside.

We are at each other's throats because we have turned our backs on  God. We are at each other's throats because nonstop there is a deluge  of imagery and horrific thoughts that are flooding into the in-boxes  and into the visibility of our children and, frankly, ourselves.

Charlie Kirk was correct, that we have to focus on getting back to  church, getting our Nation, our families, and our communities back to  church. Would that this Sunday everybody that is going to be at a  National Football League game or parked in front of a TV watching an  NFL game, would that every single American doing that would be in  church with devices off, TVs off, having supper with their families,  which society would be stronger?

The fact of the matter is, when I had to tell my son that,  unfortunately, Charlie had passed, and he asked if that was formally  known in public, and I said: Yes, he is gone. I am sorry, buddy.

He said: I would have loved to have met him one day. Then he sent me  a Bible verse that said: Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand  firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of  the Lord because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.  First Corinthians 15:58.

Well, thank goodness his mom is doing something right.

A lot of people have asked me why one of my first reactions in light  of all this was to raise the prospect of an organized, radical left  that has been fomenting the targeting of people that I care about,  people like Charlie Kirk, groups like the Family Research Council,  targeting families and communities and our way of life, Chip, why would  you do that? Aren't you just sowing more division in calling for a  select committee to investigate the organized efforts of the radical  left?

Actually, I think it is the opposite of that. I started this talking  about the  need to pursue truth. Our job in Congress, in part, is oversight and  investigation, and pursuing truth and exposing it to the American  people.

It is a problem that organizations like the Southern Poverty Law  Center creates hate maps in which they targeted the Family Research  Council a decade ago resulting in an individual shooting it up and a  security guard getting shot right here in D.C. or Charlie Kirk's  organization, TPUSA, being put on that same map with a target being put  on their backs. Antifa is known to be radicalized and engaging in  terrorist activities, which the President recognized just yesterday, I  believe rightfully.

The extent to which there is an extraordinary network funded not just  by George Soros but a large number of radical billionaires that are  funding organizations dedicated to putting into office DAs and judges  who put criminals on the street, who allow dangerous criminals to walk  among us in our communities, on trains in Charlotte, North Carolina,  where a young woman from Ukraine was butchered by someone who had been  in and out of jail, arrested 14 times.

It is not just an accident. It is not just one random DA or judge or,  oh, George Soros funded one election. It is a coordinated effort to put  DAs and judges and other law enforcement officials into places in  communities--including in the communities I represent in Austin and San  Antonio and throughout Texas--purposely to then have organizations like  the Wren Collective, which is now known through reporting just this  week from the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, putting out the known  networks where they are going in and telling these DAs and prosecutors  precisely what to do, precisely how to get people back on the streets  sooner or not prosecute them at all. The result of this is that  dangerous individuals are walking among us and hurting us and our loved  ones, which is a direct threat to the security of our Nation.

Yes, I think we should investigate that. Yes, I think we should get  to the bottom of that. Yes, I want to know how those dollars are  flowing. Yes, I want to know why the people of San Antonio have to be  turned upside down or the people of Charlotte, North Carolina, have to  be turned upside down because a radical group of billionaires are  funding organizations that are funding these people to be put on our  streets.

How about our borders? Should we not know the flow of the dollars, of  the coordinated network through the United Nations and through  international organizations and through supposedly religious  organizations, or the 250 organizations that our friends at the Center  for Immigration Studies put out, demonstrating the network that was  responsible for dumping millions of people into our communities,  including violent gang members from around the world that resulted in  the death of Americans, Americans like Jocelyn Nungaray, Americans like  Laken Riley, Americans like Rachel Morin? I could go down the list of  people who were killed, abused, assaulted, or harmed because a radical  group of leftists decided that open borders for their political  purposes was more important than your safety and security as Americans.

Yes, I think we should have a select committee or an organized effort  among the Judiciary Committee and the Oversight Committee to expose  this network, to expose the funders, to expose the people who are doing  this purposely to undermine your security as a nation. Yes, we should  know that. The only question is why isn't every single Representative  in this body standing up and saying: Yes, I agree?

I agree with Vice President JD Vance and Deputy Chief of Staff  Stephen Miller. They put forward plans to go after leftist  nongovernmental organizations in the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder. The  Vice President said: We are going to go after the NGO networks that  foment, facilitate, and engage in violence. We are going to channel all  the anger that we have over the organized campaign that led to this  assassination to uproot and dismantle these terrorist networks.

The Vice President is correct. My friend, Stephen Miller, is correct.  The President is correct to be declaring antifa a terrorist  organization. Enough is enough. Enough with the disruption of our  Nation. For those who say this is somehow clamping down on speech:  Wrong. You can say virtually anything you want to say in this country,  but number one, there is consequences to that, including getting fired  and having television shows canceled because there is a limit to what a  society should have to take.

If you are going to say crazy things, then there can be a consequence  to saying those crazy things. That is okay.

No, it is not interfering with your First Amendment rights to say  that you cannot engage in effecting a conspiracy to foment violence-- including, by the way, the riots in 2020--in the false name of  supposedly healing racial division or in the name of certain lives  mattering because we want to divide our country further.

Organizations funded for a specific purpose, to create instability  and to undermine our way of life and our freedoms, should be  investigated. Leftwing groups that are providing material support to  that kind of violence should be investigated.

They say, ``Chip, why just leftwing groups? Why not rightwing  groups?'' Fine. Go look at any groups fomenting said violence.

All I know is, in the wake of Charlie Kirk getting shot, I didn't see  the streets around this country burning. I didn't see people's  businesses and livelihoods getting looted, destroyed, and burned, from  Minneapolis to California to our Nation's Capital. I didn't see statues  getting toppled and tossed into water. I didn't see spray-painting and  destruction of public monuments and statues.

What I saw was prayer. What I saw was people coming together in  defense of their collective belief in God and their belief in this  country, but willing to not just say we need unity for the sake of it.

I am tired of that. I am tired of this nonsense where they say,  ``Come together. We must unite. We need unity.'' Unity for what? Unity  under what? Unity under a Constitution, under a flag, and under God,  yes. In defense of a country with shared values, yes. Not unity for the  sake of it, not turning the other cheek to a lawless bunch of  organizations designed to take down and destroy our way of life and our  country, to undermine our faith, undermine our country, undermine our  freedoms, because that is what we see.

You have to be blind to ignore it, and you have to be willful in that  blindness to ignore the conspiracy and coordination to dismantle so  much of what made this country great, to target institutions of faith;  to target people for their conservative views and beliefs; to  destabilize our society; to put criminals on the streets; to import  people from around the world with criminal backgrounds and gang members  for your own crass political purposes, to try to pack your districts  and try to expand your voter base.

It is not working because this administration and those of us who  have stood up to fight and expose this are seeing to it that we are  removing people from this country who should be removed, securing the  border so that people aren't flowing across it, standing with law  enforcement, securing our communities, backing the blue, restoring  safety and security, not just in our Nation's Capital but around the  country, making this country a place where you can achieve the American  Dream again, but only if we are willing to take on these organizations  that are still causing the lawless to be walking among us.

That resulted directly in the death of a Ukrainian refugee who  thought she could live the American Dream. It was taken away from her  because people were purposely put on the street who are dangerous.  There is no other way to look at that. That is literally what happened.

I know that there is going to be a lot more conversation and speeches  about Charlie coming up, but I will close with this. In a 1981 speech,  which is hard to believe was almost 45 years ago, President Reagan  declared liberal pro-criminal policies rooted in ``utopian presumptions  about human nature.'' ``For all our science and sophistication, for all  our justified pride in intellectual accomplishment, we must never  forget the jungle is always there waiting to take us over.''

He observed that the liberal belief that criminal justice is solely  for rehabilitation instead of incapacitation and deterrence is rooted  in ``a belief that there was nothing permanent or absolute about any  man's nature . . . and that by changing his environment, we could  permanently change man and usher in a great new era.''

President Reagan was right. There is a place appropriately for  forgiveness and rehabilitation, but there is not a place for allowing  the rampant, lawless, and dangerous to be walking among our families  and our communities, and our borders to be wide open to endanger our  societies for this crazy notion of some utopian nonsense or, worse yet,  a purposeful use of this tool for political purposes.

I applaud the President for what he is doing for trying to secure our  country.

I call on my colleagues to band together to expose to the American  people these organized efforts that are undermining our security and  our way of life--targeted specifically at us. It is high time that we  expose it. It is high time that we do something about it.

If we learned anything from what we saw unfold that resulted in the  murder of Charlie, it is that we go find the people that are just as  guilty as the young man that pulled that trigger, the people who are  just as guilty because they created that environment. They fomented the  radicalization and the creation of an environment where that occurred  knowingly, knowingly destabilizing our society in the process.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695719/highlighting-flawed-policies,,
Republican,Pat Fallon,Recognizing the Service of Lieutenant Colonel Kyle Frazer,"Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Kyle  Frazer's exemplary and distinguished record of service to our Nation. A  native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, Kyle was commissioned as an Infantry  Officer in 2008 through the University of Utah. He earned his master's  degree in Legislative Affairs from George Washington University in  2023.

Kyle was an honor graduate from the Army's Ranger School, Basic  Officer Leader's Course, and Air Assault schools. After completing  Airborne school and Master Jumpmaster school with distinction, Kyle  spent most of his 17-year career at the tactical level specializing in  combined arms maneuvers and large-scale combat operations. He deployed  three times in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom,  and Inherent Resolve. Kyle has served as a platoon leader and company  commander, senior observer controller, Deputy Chief of Operations of  Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, battalion and  brigade operations officer, and as a congressional staffer, where he  was my National Security and Defense Fellow.

Kyle currently serves as a Legislative Liaison for the Army in the  House of Representatives. Kyle has been the face of the Army for 435  members of the House of Representatives, with direct influence over 13  states covering 88 Members of Congress. Kyle built, promoted, and  facilitated lines of communication between Congress and the Army that  were instrumental in maintaining relationships between the executive  and legislative branches. Through his ability to clearly define the  Army's message and help navigate the needs of Congress to provide  essential oversight requirements, Kyle has made a lasting impact on our  Nation's ability to respond to global threats, modernize the Army, and  maintain the Army's readiness at the highest level.

I want to thank Kyle for his dedication and steadfast commitment to  our country. In August, he will be taking over the ROTC program at his  alma mater, the University of Utah, where I know he will continue to  lead with excellence and honor. I want to extend my deepest gratitude  to Kyle, his wife, Annie, and their two children, Eleanor and Theodore,  for their sacrifices and contributions to the strength and security of  our great Nation. I congratulate Kyle, and I wish him the very best.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694098/recognizing-the-service-of-lieutenant-colonel-kyle-frazer,2025-07-23,2025-W30
Democrat,Melanie Stansbury,Holding This Administration to Account,"Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump says that he isn't sure if  he needs to uphold the Constitution. It is clear to all of us from his  attacks on the courts, the rule of law, our democratic institutions,  our civil and legal rights, an open and free press, the dismantling of  Federal agencies, and attacks on our communities that, indeed, he does  not know what his constitutional duties are.

I have to say, Mr. Speaker, we are a nation of laws, a nation  governed by a Constitution of the people and by the people. Donald  Trump and his administration are not above the law. We will hold them  to account, and that is why we are here every day fighting back,  pushing back, and defending our democracy and the rights of the  American people.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690721/holding-this-administration-to-account,2025-05-06,2025-W19
Democrat,Sheldon Whitehouse,Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,"Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Environment  and Public Works Committee, I wish to correct the record on one small  piece of the big, terrible bill that the Senate barely passed last week  and which the President signed into law on July 4. There are many  things to say about that legislation, and I will continue to daylight  concerning provisions buried in it over the coming weeks.

But today, I want to focus on section 60002 of the so-called ``One  Big Beautiful Bill Act,'' which repealed and rescinded all unobligated  funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. There has been some spin  put on this section, including in court filings. And so I aim to fix  some misconceptions, with the help of the Congressional Budget Office  and the relevant Republican House subcommittee chair.

I have spoken a lot about the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund over the  past several months, on the floor and in the Judiciary and Environment  and Public Works Committees. Most of the time, I have focused on the  many red flags raised by outrageous behavior of top DOJ and EPA  officials in their attempts to claw back nearly $20 billion in grant  funds that were awarded in April 2024 and fully dispersed into private  bank accounts by August. After terrorizing grantees with false  allegations of fraud and trying to open bogus criminal cases that went  nowhere, EPA froze and then announced the termination of these fully  obligated and dispersed grants. The grantees, rightfully, sued EPA for  these arbitrary and capricious actions. The dispute is being actively  litigated in the D.C. circuit.

The Justice Department continues its mischief. On July 3, 2025, DOJ  ran to the court with news of the repeal and rescission of unobligated  funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, claiming that this was  Congress rescinding a full $17 billion, including all of what EPA  claimed to terminate on March 11, 2025. That simply is not so. The DOJ  reads too much into the repeal of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund  language. Two pieces of evidence support my contention here.

First, when this provision came up through the Environment and Public  Works Committee, it was ``scored'' by the Congressional Budget Office.  That means the Congressional Budget Office provided an estimate of the  funds saved by rescinding unobligated funds. The CBO score for  rescinding all unobligated funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction  Fund, as provided to us by the majority on June 24, 2025, was $19  million. That is 19 with an m, not a b. CBO confirmed, further, that  the repeal of the program language did not create any additional  savings. The repeal and rescission together only saved the $19 million  EPA had remaining to oversee the program. All of the grant funding was  out the door, in private bank accounts, and in some cases, tied up in  firm legal commitments with third parties. At no point in our  discussions with the majority, directly or in our several conversations  with the Parliamentarian, was this score disputed.  The majority did express concern about EPA prevailing in litigation and  suddenly having nearly $20 billion back and, for this reason, pushed to  repeal the language. But the fact of the matter is, section 60002 only  rescinded EPA's administrative dollars and not a cent of the grant  funding.

Second, Republicans made clear that rescissions from environmental  grant programs only touched funding that had not yet gone out the door.  During the markup of the Energy and Commerce Committee title for the  House version of this bill, the chair of the Environment Subcommittee  Mr. Griffith of Virginia made the following statements:

On page 244, lines 5959-64:

I just want to point out that these provisions that we are       talking about only apply as far, as this bill is concerned,       to the unobligated balances. So if a grant was already given,       as far as this bill is concerned, then that would still be       going forward.

On page 244, lines 5968-70:

If the grant has already been granted and the money is       obligated, then this--then our language does not affect that.

On pages 247-48, lines 6055-57:

. . . [W]e can't rescind expenditures that have already       been obligated.

Neither CBO nor Republican Members understood the repeal and  rescission of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to save anything more  than EPA's unspent oversight dollars. Not a cent of the grant funding  was touched by section 60002. Wishful thinking on the part of DOJ does  not moot the ongoing litigation.

The committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:37 a.m. in Room       2123, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Brett Guthrie       [chair of the committee] presiding.

Present: Representatives Guthrie, Latta, Griffith,       Bilirakis, Hudson, Carter of Georgia, Palmer, Dunn, Joyce,       Weber, Allen, Balderson, Fulcher, Pfluger, Harshbarger,       Miller-Meeks, Cammack, Obernolte, James, Bentz, Houchin, Fry,       Lee, Langworthy, Kean, Rulli, Evans, Goldman, Fedorchak;       Pallone, DeGette, Schakowsky, Matsui, Castor, Tonko, Clarke,       Ruiz, Peters, Dingell, Veasey, Kelly, Barragan, Soto,       Schrier, Trahan, Fletcher, Ocasio-Cortez, Auchincloss, Carter       of Louisiana, Menendez, Mullin, Landsman, and McClellan.

The Chair. The committee will come to order.

The Chair. The gentleman yields back. Is there anyone       seeking recognition to speak on the amendment?

The gentleman from New Jersey seeks recognition. He is       recognized for five minutes to speak on the amendment.

Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Chairman, and I want to thank my       colleague Mr. Carter, for offering this amendment. You know,       often when we talk about environmental justice our friends       across the aisle roll their eyes. They scoff at the idea of       what is environmental injustice. It is not a thing. We don't       need to talk about it. So I want to just add a little context       to it.

Environmental justice initiatives are lifelines for       communities that are at a higher risk of adverse health       impacts from exposure to pollution and other environmental       challenges. So in my district the Ironbound section of       Newark, 25 percent of children living there suffer from       asthma. That is three times the state average.

And it isn't just their health that suffers. When we talk       about environmental justice, we are talking about children's       education. Asthma is the leading cause of absenteeism in       school-age children, which is why it is so obscene that today       Republicans want to cut funding that would address air       pollution at schools. I would just ask the American people,       like, what part of addressing air pollution at schools is       controversial? I don't think there is anything controversial       about.

And this is not just Democratic states or blue states. When       we talk about environmental justice, we are talking about       mining-related pollution in Appalachia. We are talking about       water crises in Alabama and Michigan. We are talking about       over-burdened communities that exist across the country and       across party lines.

So speaking about across party lines, another one of our       Republican colleagues from Oregon has a district that has       been awarded multiple grants at risk from this reconciliation       bill that would be saved by my amendment.

You are welcome.

First is the Columbia Gorge Early Learning and Resilience       Center, located right outside of Portland in a rural, low-      income community of The Dalles, Oregon. This grant-funded       project would renovate a 70-year-old school building into a       community center that protects public health and provides       valuable resources for local residents. That sounds like a       home run project to me. The center would provide childcare       for up to 200 children, create an on-site learning       laboratory, and provide vocational scholarships for students       to pursue careers in fields such as engineering or       agriculture. That is fantastic.

But the same party that claims to be the party of families       wants to shut down a grant that would help some of those       families with       child care. The irony is staggering. This is all while       also creating a renewable, energy-powered refuge that will       protect our most vulnerable residents during extreme       weather events like wildfires and winter storms. When the       lights go out and the community needs critical heat and       services, Republicans turn the other way, even at the risk       of their own constituents' lives. Unfortunately, the $20       million EPA grant to carry out this valuable mission was       unjustly and illegally terminated last month.

Similarly, another grant in Oregon, the Chiloquin Community       Resilience Hub and Municipal Center, would have remediated a       brownfield site into an emergency shelter, municipal space,       and community education center. We all sat here weeks ago and       touted the brownfields program as a bipartisan program, and       yet here we are trying to cut the funding for a brownfield       site that would serve as a critical community hub in a       Republican district. The center would also provide training       and education opportunities for a population that lives in a       rural and historically underserved area. The project was       awarded a $16.3 million EPA environmental justice grant--      great job getting that for your community--but it was also       illegally and arbitrarily canceled last month.

Now Republicans like that congressman from Oregon want to       get rid of the program entirely. To me, the conclusion is       clear. Republicans are willing to withhold nearly $40 million       from one congressional district alone, from his own       constituents, to give tax breaks to those who need them the       least.

So in addition to health care, we are not just talking       about Democratic environmental priorities. We are talking       about cutting funding for programs that will impact districts       across the country, and that is why everyone should support       this amendment to ensure that you bring those dollars home to       your district.

Thank you, and I yield back.

The Chair. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and I will       recognize myself to speak on the amendment, and yield to my       good friend from Virginia.

Mr. Griffith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to point       out that these provisions that we are talking about only       apply as far, as this bill is concerned, to the unobligated       balances. So if a grant was already given, as far as this       bill is concerned, then that would still be going forward.

The Chair. So would you yield back to me? So everyone that       was listed, if the grants had been awarded as projects or       not----

Mr. Griffith. If the grant has already been granted and the       money is obligated, then this--then our language does not       affect that.

Mrs. Fletcher. Will the gentleman yield?

The Chair. The--yes, it is my time. Yes, I will yield.

Mrs. Fletcher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

The Chair. Yes.

Mrs. Fletcher. I just want to clarify. I understand the       statement to be that this particular legislation doesn't deal       with the already-obligated funds. But isn't it true that the       administration is rescinding the grants and pulling back the       money from the projects like my colleague from New Jersey was       just explaining?

I know that there have been grants under various programs       in my community. One, for example, to help build sidewalks       and tree canopy. It is amazing to think about. In my district       there is a 17-degree difference in the temperature during the       summer between the poorest neighborhoods and the wealthiest.       And they have no trees, they have no tree canopy. There is       this great program to try to build sidewalks, put in trees,       and address some of these challenges that--it gets real hot       in Houston, and this is a really important program. But I       know the funds for that have been revoked.

And so is the statement that this won't do anything to       those, but there are still these grants being revoked? Or are       we trying to preserve those grants in this legislation and       just--the already-obligated funds, are we protecting those in       this?

The Chair. Well, this legislation does not take--does not       close the grants on any obligated funds, and that--the       executive actions----

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Will the gentleman yield? The       Chair. My understanding--and I will yield to my friend from       Virginia, if you would like to answer that.

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Will the gentleman yield?

Mr. Griffith. I am happy to say that I don't--The Chair.       Louisiana, my friend from Virginia, and then I will yield to       you.

Mr. Griffith. I don't know what the administration is       doing, per se, to the specific----

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. I can help----

Mr. Griffith. --grants that were mentioned, but I would say       that this amendment specifically talks about the unobligated       amounts, as well, so that whether it be the bill or the       amendment, this action that we take does not impact that       action that may or may not be going on in the administration.

I know it is confusing for folks back home, as well, to       understand that not--the administration does not always tell       us everything they are doing because they are doing so many       things.

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Will the gentleman yield briefly?

Mr. Griffith. And while I----

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. I will address that.

The Chair. I will yield to you in a second. Let him finish,       yes.

Mr. Griffith. I don't have the floor. I have been yielded       time, so I have to finish and then I yield back----

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Fair enough, sir.

Mr. Griffith. ----to the chair.

And so I can't speak for the administration on this. That       is a whole different ball game.

But what we are debating tonight is the bill in front of       us. And what we are debating right now is the amendment.       Neither the bill in front of us nor the amendment deal with       the issues that the gentleman previously raised. And so that       is why I ask folks to vote no on the amendment and yes on the       bill.

The Chair. Thank you.

The gentleman from Louisiana, I yield to you.

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. And I am happy to have an       opportunity to address that, because those comments are not       exactly correct.

If the Administrator Zeldin is successful in terminating       these critical grant programs in his misguided attempt to gut       the agency, these grants will be subject to rescission. It is       very clear. So the notion that it has been awarded, it is not       going to be impacted, that is a little disingenuous. So I       want to clear that up for the record.

I yield.

The Chair. Thank you. I yield, but--to the--back to the       gentleman from Virginia.

You want to--okay I will--do you want to speak, the       gentleman from Virginia? Go ahead.

Mr. Griffith. And what I would say, Mr. Chairman, is that       that may be true for a future rescission, but we can't       rescind expenditures that have already been obligated.

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Oh----

Mr. Griffith. And for purposes of this reconciliation, we       can't look at the crystal ball and decide what might happen       in the future.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693322/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund,2025-07-09,2025-W28
Democrat,Andrea Salinas,Protect Children's Innocence Act,"Ms. SALINAS. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this disgusting  bill that does nothing to protect children's innocence.

It endangers parents, healthcare providers, and children. It allows  healthcare providers and parents to be fined and possibly jailed if  they help a minor access lifesaving care. It permits Federal law  enforcement to act as the national gender police, allowing them to  invade children's private medical records.

This bill puts even more children in harm's way and exacerbates the  mental health crises that our young people are facing because it stops  them from actually receiving the care that they need right now.

Madam Speaker, why is our focus on this when what I am hearing from  constituents is that Republicans are falling short in addressing the  cost of groceries, healthcare, and housing?

To my Republican colleagues, why not focus on the issues that will  impact millions of families who are just one paycheck away from  homelessness or losing their healthcare instead of waging a war on  children's genitals? What is this unhealthy obsession? Let's end it  today by voting ``no'' on H.R. 3492.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698353/protect-childrens-innocence-act,2025-12-17,2025-W51
Republican,David Taylor,Congratulating Ironton Fighting Tigers,"Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Ironton  Fighting Tigers for winning their first football State championship in  35 years.

With an incredibly strong work ethic and a commitment to excellence,  the Ironton High School football team spent all season training and  working together with one goal in mind: the State title.

In the championship game, senior Shaun Terry led his team to victory  with 300 all-purpose yards, including 148 receiving yards and three  touchdowns. This championship win is evidence of a season full of hard  work, dedication, and commitment to excellence.

Since the school's last title in 1989, the Ironton Fighting Tigers  have appeared in six State title games in pursuit of a win, which made  bringing home this year's trophy even sweeter.

Head Coach Trevon Pendleton and his staff poured their knowledge and  experience into eager players all season long, guiding them and pushing  them toward excellence on and off the field.

I also recognize each parent who supported their players and  encouraged them to work hard. I congratulate each player for their  hard-earned victory and new State title.

Congratulations. Go Fighting Tigers.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689087/congratulating-ironton-fighting-tigers,2025-03-25,2025-W13

Republican,Blake Moore,Historic Tax Relief for Families,"Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I am so glad to be joined by my  colleagues this evening to talk about the historic tax relief we are  providing for working families this tax season. I think it should be on  the mind of every single American, and we are thrilled to be able to  highlight some of the many things that we have accomplished in the  preceding calendar year.

Honoring Mark Roman

Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I will briefly add that I had the  opportunity to serve on Chairman Smith's Ways and Means Committee, and  I have seen the work that Mark Roman did, mostly behind the scenes, the  stress that he is put under, and the outcomes that we have delivered.

Oftentimes, we don't talk about this being a functional place.  Sometimes when you go to Congress, Mr. Speaker, all you hear about is  the gridlock, the nonsense, and all the rhetoric. Mark Roman  accomplished some things for the American people that he will never get  credit for.

I am going to speak a little bit about it today, but I also wanted to  add how much I appreciated getting a chance to work under Mark. I wish  his amazing kids and family all the best. We hope that he really, truly  won't go far.                       Historic Tax Relief for Families

Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, I want to share a  brief message about what we have accomplished this last year.

Mr. Speaker, House Republicans have turned a season of dread as tax  season approaches into a season of historic relief. Tax season is  officially underway, and this year, 91 percent of all taxpayers will  experience an easier and more simplified filing process.

We locked in the doubled standard deduction, and not only at the rate  that Republicans established in 2017. We actually boosted it for this  new approach. It is now considered permanent policy, meaning that  families will pay no taxes on the first $31,500 of what they make.

It will also save Americans an estimated 210 million hours per year  in paperwork and $13 billion in compliance costs annually.

We talk all the time about simplifying the tax code. Everybody talks  about it, and we have done it. Since 2017, we decided to double the  standard deduction.

That immediately targets middle- and lower-income Americans who  choose not to itemize. Itemizing is still an option you can do, Mr.  Speaker, if you have multiple different types of elements that you can  deduct from your taxes. You can still choose to do that, but the vast  majority of Americans, working Americans and everyday Americans, use  the doubled standard deduction.

That is real tax relief. It goes unsaid a lot. It is such a standard  piece. Nobody truly disagrees with it--``nobody'' meaning both parties.  It is something that we have now established as the norm, and it will  give immediate relief to the vast majority of American families.

Because the historic tax cuts are retroactive to 2025, the average  refund is projected to increase by $1,000, with a total of $91 billion  in additional refunds being returned to the American people this  spring. We also repealed the Democrats' $600 reporting requirements for  payments through PayPal or Venmo  and requirements for paperwork reporting of small payments to casual  sellers and service providers.

This, again, is an effort to simplify the tax code and make it work  for American families so they will be able to have more of what they  earned. I will get to more of that.

Filing taxes is a pain point--we all know that--for most people  because of both the amount and the process. We have simplified it to  improve the experience for filers and increase accountability for  lawmakers deciding where those funds are allocated.

Working families were our top priority in these tax cuts. We wanted  to help them achieve the American Dream, make life more affordable, and  make filing taxes less of a burden. This year, Utah families will be  able to keep more of their hard-earned money through the increased  standard deduction and face less burdensome paperwork.

It is very simple. Republicans have created a tax code that simply  works for American families. This is something that doesn't work  against them, as so oftentimes things from Washington, D.C., do.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a part of delivering this win for  Utahns, and I yield back the balance of my time.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699706/historic-tax-relief-for-families,2026-02-04,2026-W06
Democrat,Terri Sewell,We Will Beat Cancer,"Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 842, the Nancy  Gardner Sewell Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage  Act,  which was included in the funding package being considered by the House  today.

Named in honor of my mother who lost her battle to pancreatic cancer  in 2021, this legislation would expand access to cutting-edge cancer  screenings for America's seniors, ensuring Medicare coverage for these  emerging tools once they become FDA approved.

I am immensely grateful that this bill was led by Republican sponsor,  Congressman Jodey Arrington, and the many organizations and patient  advocacy groups who helped us push this bill across the finish line. I  am giving a big shout-out to the American Cancer Society Cancer Action  Network, PanCAN, the Prevent Cancer Foundation, the National Minority  Quality Forum, and so many others.

Thanks to their tireless advocacy, H.R. 842 is the most cosponsored  bill in the 119th Congress with 339 cosponsors in the House and 68  cosponsors in the Senate.

Democrat,Joaquin Castro,Uyghur Policy Act of 2025,"Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2635 to  support the human rights of Uyghurs, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.

I am a proud supporter of Representative Kim's Uyghur Policy Act of  2025. The House Foreign Affairs Committee has played an important  leadership role in pushing for the protection of Uyghurs and other  minorities in Xinjiang in the face of genocide and forced labor, as my  colleague mentioned.

In the last few years, the Congress and the House Foreign Affairs  Committee have prioritized this issue, including marking up and  enacting the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, thanks in large part  to Representative  Jim McGovern and Speaker Emerita Pelosi's  leadership, but our work is far from done because Beijing's oppression  continues.

The legislation before us today is a strong, bipartisan bill. I hope  it sends a clear signal to the Trump administration about Congress'  intent. So far, the administration has cut congressionally authorized  programs that support human rights in China, including initiatives  empowering Chinese and Uyghur-related diaspora groups to combat  transnational repression and defend religious freedom.

Despite the fact that Radio Free Asia helped break the story about  China's program of detention, reeducation, and forced labor, this  administration is trying to close Radio Free Asia as we speak. It has  shut down the only independent Uyghur language service in the entire  world.

I thank Representative Kim and Representative Bera for their  leadership on this bill and hope this administration reverses course.  These cuts aid the CCP, not the victims of their abuse or the American  people.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to champion the protection of Uyghurs as a  Member of Congress. Yet, let me point out someone who is also a fierce  champion of the Uyghurs, perhaps their strongest supporter across the  Capitol, and that is our current Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Then-Senator Rubio gave an important speech in the Senate to get the  Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act over the finish line just a few  years ago in 2021. Yet, now, as Secretary, he has overseen drastic cuts  to religious freedom and human rights programming that helps the  Uyghurs.

I hope that this bill augurs a return to Senator Rubio, rather than  what is a disheartening and nonstrategic policy that we have seen from  the State Department today.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and encourage my  colleagues to do so, as well, and I yield back the balance of my time.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694800/uyghur-policy-act-of-2025,,

Republican,Brian Mast,"Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026","Mr. MAST. Mr. Chair, I am here to speak on my amendment No. 21. This  is something that we have dealt with here in Congress before.  Specifically it relates to veterans' access to cannabis.

The story that I will tell in advance of this is simply this: I woke  up in Walter Reed Army Medical Center not too far from here a number of  years ago, and when I woke up, I was missing two legs and a finger. I  had been out of consciousness for a week plus.

What I woke up to was being on a laundry list of medications. I had  an epidural. I had oral morphines and oxies. I had antidepressants,  anti-inflammatories, and heavy sleep sedatives. I had a Dilaudid drip  and a number of other things that I can't even remember at this point  all at once. I had never been on any of these things before in my life.

Immediately, as soon as I woke up, I started to wean myself off of  these drugs because I was saying to myself: I might be very  uncomfortable, but I don't want to be dependent on sleep sedatives. I  might be in a lot of pain, but let's start by getting off of this  painkiller and this painkiller and this painkiller. I am not depressed,  so take this antidepressant away.

These narcotics were beyond painful to come off of. I was down to the  lowest amount after about 6 months of the last narcotic, which was an  oral morphine. Going from the lowest amount twice a day 6 a.m. and 6  p.m. to nothing, I spent the next several months  miserable, suffering the gamut of withdraw symptoms: irritability to  say the least, food going through me, up all night. You name it. That  was just after 6 months.

The state that these narcotics, in many cases, leave our veterans in  are, at the most extreme end of it, states of suicide and, at the other  end of it, just extreme states of dissatisfaction and lacking purpose  in life. In some cases it does leave them in a better condition.

The point I am making with this true story is that veterans need to  have options outside of these narcotics.

In many States, there are legal cannabis medical programs. They need  to have the ability when they are being seen by their primary care  physician inside of the VA to have discussions about whether cannabis  is or is not right for them. They have access to it in their State.  They need to be able to talk to their medical provider about what they  fill out on the paperwork, what the right dosage amount is, how that is  going to interact with any other medications that they might be on, and  how it might affect their blood pressure or other things going on with  them personally.

If we are not giving that option to have that conversation at the  most serious level without worrying about some kind of reprisal for the  doctor or otherwise, then we are doing our veterans a disservice in,  certainly, at minimum, all of these States where there are legal  cannabis programs.

I am not a doctor. I would not purport to know when this is a good  treatment for somebody, when it is not, or the amounts that they should  take. Yet, I know that as long as it is available in these various  States, their doctors need to have the opportunity to discuss that  treatment with them. The fact of the matter is, while I have heard of  many of my brothers- and sisters-in-arms being in a state of suicide  because of the narcotics they have been on, I have yet to hear about  any of them attributing a state of suicide to the cannabis that they  have had as a part of their life.

Mr. Chairman, I ask for support on amendment No. 21.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692956/military-construction-veterans-affairs-and-related-agencies-appropriations-act-2026,2025-06-25,2025-W26
Democrat,Rosa DeLauro,Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025,"Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, as ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee, I am responsible for funding programs and services that the  American people rely on.

I also see the importance of programs like Medicaid, which help tens  of millions of people afford health insurance. After all of their talk  of lowering the cost of living, Republicans wasted no time in making  their real priorities clear. For this majority, billionaires and the  biggest corporations always come first.

Elon Musk and President Trump are hard at work trying to gut Medicaid  and the Affordable Care Act, which helps nearly 100 million Americans  afford health insurance, medications, and lifesaving care.

Nationwide, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program  provide medical coverage to nearly 4 in 10 children. Almost 40 percent  of the children in the United States get their healthcare through  Medicaid.

These programs were designed, improved, and expanded over decades by  both parties to help people deal with the high costs of healthcare, and  they have delivered for so many families. In my district alone, there  are 229,000 people on Medicaid, including 79,000 children and 33,000  seniors. Medicaid paid for 3,000 births last year, providing  comprehensive prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care to newborns and  mothers. These are programs that help families and children. Medicaid  works.

Elon Musk is only interested in helping the richest among us. His  dream is to fully extend more than $4.5 trillion worth of tax breaks to  his billionaire friends and the wealthiest corporations in the world.

How will they pay for these tax cuts and pay for this massive  giveaway? Republicans want to pay for this with cuts to Medicaid, $880  billion from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, putting coverage at  risk for millions of Americans and raising their premiums.

Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, who bears the brunt of these cuts:  seniors, children, low-income families, people with disabilities, those  struggling. The most high healthcare costs impact the first ones left  behind.

Republicans are coming for SNAP next, threatening 40 million  Americans who are just trying to put food on the table. Democrats will  stand where we always do, on the side of the middle class, against yet  another reckless Republican budget that steals even more wealth for the  billionaire class.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688072/concurrent-resolution-on-the-budget-for-fiscal-year-2025,2025-02-25,2025-W09
Republican,Andy Barr,Stop Chinese Fentanyl Act of 2025,"Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Washington State and  Chairman Mast for supporting the legislation. I thank my friend, the  ranking member, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks), for his  bipartisan support, as well.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, H.R. 747, the  Stop Chinese Fentanyl Act.

The fentanyl crisis is one of the most significant threats to our  country and continues to plague families and neighbors across the  United States.

My home State of Kentucky, sadly, has been ravaged by the fentanyl  crisis.

Drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18  to 45, and fentanyl is responsible for nearly 70 percent of these  deaths.

Last year, the DEA seized more than 60 million fentanyl-laced fake  pills in the United States and almost 8,000 pounds of fentanyl power  equal to more than 380 million lethal doses of fentanyl.

As of last month, the 2025 seizures of fentanyl equate to over 232  million deadly doses and 70,000 of our fellow Americans succumbed to  this poison. In 2024, over 1,400 Kentuckians lost their lives to a drug  overdose, including fentanyl.

Unfortunately, this scourge has spread with the help of our greatest  strategic adversary, the People's Republic of China and the Chinese  Communist Party.

As a member of the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition  Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, we conducted  an investigation, and that investigation in the last Congress  established that the PRC Government, under the control of the Chinese  Communist Party, directly subsidizes the manufacturing and export of  illicit fentanyl materials and other synthetic narcotics through tax  rebates.

Many of these substances are illegal under the PRC's own laws and  have no known legal use worldwide. Like its export tax rebates for  legitimate goods, the CCP's subsidies of illegal drugs incentivize  international synthetic drug sales from the People's Republic of China,  and the CCP never disclosed this program.

In addition, the select committee found that the CCP gave monetary  grants and awards to companies openly trafficking illicit fentanyl  materials and other synthetic narcotics. There are even examples of  some of these companies enjoying site visits from provincial PRC  Government officials, who complimented them for their impact on the  provincial economy.

The CCP holds an ownership interest in several PRC companies tied to  drug trafficking, including a PRC Government prison connected to human  rights abuses, owning a drug trafficking chemical company, and a  publicly traded PRC company hosting thousands of instances of open drug  trafficking on its sites.

The PRC failed to prosecute fentanyl and precursor manufacturers.  Rather than investigating drug traffickers, the Government of the PRC  security services have not cooperated with U.S. law enforcement and  have even notified targets of U.S. investigations when they receive  requests for assistance.

The PRC allows for the open sale of fentanyl precursors and other  illicit materials on the extensively monitored and controlled PRC  internet. A review of just seven e-commerce sites found over 31,000  instances of PRC companies selling illicit chemicals with obvious ties  to drug trafficking. Undercover communications with PRC drug  trafficking companies revealed an eagerness to engage in clearly  illicit drug  sales with no fear of reprisal. The government in China censors content  about domestic drug sales, but leaves export-focused narcotic content  untouched.

We know that China has historically been and remains the primary  source of fentanyl in global circulation through the production of  these precursor chemicals and outsourcing the final production to  cartel labs in Mexico. That is why it is paramount that Congress pass  my legislation that is being considered here today, the Stop Chinese  Fentanyl Act.

My bill amends the Fentanyl Sanctions Act to expand the definition of  ``foreign opioid trafficker'' to include certain Chinese entities and  government officials that fail to take steps to prevent opioid  trafficking, subjecting them to sanctions. The bill also requires the  President to determine whether the heads of the National Narcotics  Control Commission, the Ministry of Public Security, the General  Administration of Customs, and the National Medical Products  Administration of the Government of the PRC are foreign opioid  traffickers.

We must attack the production of fentanyl by targeting the source of  precursors in China.

Chinese producers of synthetic opioids and opioid precursors and  senior government and Chinese political officials' culpability does not  end when their precursor products land in Mexico or illegally cross our  southern border. We must look at every step of fentanyl's deadly supply  chain and hold our adversaries accountable.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694828/stop-chinese-fentanyl-act-of-2025,,
Republican,Brian Mast,Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026,"Mr. MAST. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.

Mr. MAST. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment I am  going to say for procedural reasons, but there are procedures that are  important here. The ranking member should know this.

As members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, we have sole  jurisdiction over powers of war. What goes on abroad with war is not  flippant activity. It affects the lives of soldiers, sailors, marines,  and airmen that are stationed abroad in Europe, Asia, Latin America,  and the Middle East. While I agree with a lot of the comments that the  ranking member just made about reasons to say there should be sunsets  on AUMF--and I didn't hear everything that my colleague Mr. Meeks said,  but I am sure undoubtedly we have agreement on why there should be  sunsets on these things--it cannot be done without bringing in the  CENTCOM commander and this commander and this commander and this  commander and saying: What are your thoughts on this? What effects does  this have on our ability to react or deploy? What effects does this  have on those downrange in counterterrorism operations as we speak?  What needs to be put back in place in order for us to not be afoul of  something that we are doing right now?

These are questions that were not asked, and the answers were not  given. This goes beyond just our generals in the Pentagon. It goes to  our Secretaries. It goes to others. They are absolutely questions that  I am committed to asking and questions that I am committed to finding  the answers to and in a timely way. I consider it to be vitally  important.

Again, we have, I think, probably large agreement on reasons to  sunset things, but it should not be done in the absence of doing  something of this gravity in the proper way.

Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. MAST. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695244/streamlining-procurement-for-effective-execution-and-delivery-and-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2026,,
Republican,Buddy Carter,Jeremy and Angel Seay and Sergeant Brandon Mendoza Protect Our Communities From Duis Act of 2025,"Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 875, the Jeremy and  Angel Seay and Sergeant Brandon Mendoza Protect Our Communities from  DUIs Act of 2025. This piece of legislation is crucial to restoring  common sense to our Nation's judicial system.

Over the past 4 years, the Biden administration has allowed millions  of undocumented immigrants to pour into our country. Along with zero  oversight and accountability for the crisis, the Biden administration  allowed illegal immigrants to stay in the country even after committing  horrible crimes.

This piece of legislation would give the courts the ability to deport  illegal aliens from America and bar them from reentry if they are  convicted of a DUI or a DUI-related charge.

This issue hits home for me. In my district, a 15-year-old girl and  her grandmother were killed by an illegal alien who was driving drunk.  This was a terrible, avoidable tragedy. Sadly, true justice was not  served. The assailant received only 15 years per death and will be out  to roam free in America by the time he is 67 years old.

Madam Speaker, this was in Nahunta, Georgia, in Brantley County, in  my district. I met with the other grandmother of this child, who shared  with me the grief that this family has gone through since that time.

There is no reason at all that this should have happened. There is no  reason for the American taxpayer to have to fund the incarceration of  this person or any other programs to help him get back on the streets  of Georgia.

Though my example is the worst outcome possible, illegal aliens  should not be able to stay in America with a minor penalty for driving  under the influence in the first place. This legislation would close  this loophole.

I thank the gentleman from Alabama for bringing this forward. It  would close that loophole that allows illegal aliens to get off lightly  when committing fatal acts, such as vehicular manslaughter under the  influence.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this  legislation to help bring back common sense to our immigration and  legal systems after these 4 years of pure chaos.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693081/jeremy-and-angel-seay-and-sergeant-brandon-mendoza-protect-our-communities-from-duis-act-of-2025,2025-06-26,2025-W26

Democrat,Suzanne Bonamici,Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026,"Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chair, I thank Representative Stansbury for  yielding.

Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to this amendment, which would  ban transgender women from participating in women's sports but also  lead to challenges on all women's bodies, making the military and  academies less safe for any women to enlist, no matter who they are.

Military personnel already undergo in-depth medical exams, and this  amendment would allow for women and trans people to be subjected to  increased and invasive targeting and harassment.

Athletic associations and the service academies are better prepared  to understand the sports that they regulate and how to provide both  respect for transgender people and fairness in sports. These  associations and academies should be addressing this issue, not  politicians, especially politicians who do not understand that trans  people are not men who put on skirts.

Republicans have already banned trans people from the military and  the service academies via executive action. This amendment is just  another backdoor attempt to discourage transgender people from  enlisting in the future while making the military less safe for all  women and embedding discrimination into law. This amendment is a  classic example of politicians trying to insert themselves where they  don't belong. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695232/streamlining-procurement-for-effective-execution-and-delivery-and-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2026,,
Democrat,Luz Rivas,Fighting Dhs Immigration Raids,"Ms. RIVAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressional Hispanic Caucus,  the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and Congresswoman Ramirez for  organizing today's important conversation on the Trump administration's  cruel and inhumane treatment of immigrant communities.

This is an important discussion to have in front of the American  people because, as they have seen, ICE is out of control. All summer,  ICE has been terrorizing communities across Los Angeles, sowing fear in  our families, and rounding up our most vulnerable.

I have been sharing the story of Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, a senior at  Reseda High School who was detained by ICE while walking his dog. He is  an older brother, a loving son, and a valued member of the community.

He is a high school student, just a kid. Benjamin should be in a  classroom, not a courtroom.

Benjamin was detained by ICE, separated from his family and friends.  He was originally transferred from the Adelanto Detention Facility in  California to a detention center in Arizona. Less than 24 hours later,  he was on a plane ready to be sent to Louisiana, but instead, he was  sent back to California. This all occurred without his family even  knowing.

I keep sharing this story because the American people deserve to see  how cruelly ICE is treating children, elderly women, and others, even a  U.S. Senator.

ICE is incapable of treating our most vulnerable with the respect  that they deserve. If this was happening to Benjamin, imagine who else  it is happening to.

I have been urging ICE leadership to answer for their chaotic,  inconsistent, and cruel decisionmaking processes that have torn apart  families across the country.

This is why I introduced the INFORM Act. My bill holds ICE  accountable for the nightmare they are forcing families like Benjamin's  to live through. Many immigrant families in my district do not know the  whereabouts of their loved ones after they are detained  by ICE. My bill respects the dignity of immigrant families and promotes  government transparency.

With my Hispanic Caucus and Progressive Caucus colleagues, I will  continue showing up to detention facilities and working with my  colleagues to hold ICE accountable, promote government transparency,  and respect the dignity of immigrant families.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697460/fighting-dhs-immigration-raids,2025-12-03,2025-W49
Republican,Andy Biggs,Providing for Consideration of S. Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of Providing for Consideration of H.R. Law- Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act; Providing for Consideration of H.R. Undersea Cable Protection Act of and Providing for Consideration of H.R. Securing America's Critical Minerals Supply Act,"Mr. BIGGS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas, Mr.  Roy, for yielding 2 minutes to me.

Mr. Speaker, I will say this. This is really humorous to hear the  machinations and the twisting and goings-on from our friends across the  aisle. As they say, this is too much.

Mr. Schumer denigrated Black people and basically said they can't get  the IDs. Kamala Harris said rural folks can't get IDs. It is just too  hard. That is BS. They know it is BS. The American people know it is  BS. It is exactly why 85 percent of Americans say we need to do this.

Let me just say that I come from a State that is the most unique  State in the country because we have been, for years, requiring proof  of citizenship when a person registers for a State ballot. We have to  do that in Arizona, and we have had no suppression. We are the only  State that does it because the Supreme Court ruled that way. Somehow,  we can't do it for Federal ballots?

Mr. Speaker, think about that. For an alderman or legislator in  Arizona, we have to show proof of citizenship to register to vote. We  can't do it for the President, though. How absurd is that?

We have had no problems. There has been no voter suppression. They  want to make it an issue because they don't want that proof, and we  need to have that proof. Every rational American knows it is not  suppression. It is common sense. That is why we need to show ID when we  vote. It is popular in Arizona. It is popular across the country.

We need to show our citizenship when we register to vote. That is  what has to happen in Arizona. It will work across the country. There  is not a doubt in my mind, and I urge passage of this bill.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699942/providing-for-consideration-of-s-veterans-accessibility-advisory-committee-act-of-providing-for-consideration-of-hr-law-enforcement-innovate-to-de-escalate-act-providing-for-consideration-of-hr-undersea-cable-protection-act-of-and-providing-for-consideration-of-hr-securing-americas-critical-minerals-supply-act,2026-02-11,2026-W07
Republican,Marlin Stutzman,Lowering Housing Costs and Advancing Main Street Community Banks,"Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman  Haridopolos, for organizing this evening's event.

I am proud to say that this body just passed the Housing for the 21st  Century Act in a strong bipartisan manner. Owning a home is the  American Dream. It is one of the best investments any person can  possibly make here in America.

At a time when too many American families are struggling to afford a  home, House Republicans are taking meaningful action to address one of  the most pressing challenges facing our country.

Indiana remains one of the most affordable States for homeownership  in the country, but I know the dream of owning a home is still out of  reach for many Hoosiers. Every day, I hear from families that work  hard, save their money, and still cannot find a place to call their  own. Unfortunately, this is true not just for families in my district,  but for the families across the country, as well.

House Republicans have heard these concerns and responded with  legislation that will directly help more Americans achieve the dream of  homeownership.

Instead of throwing more taxpayer dollars at ineffective government  programs, we are restoring housing affordability by getting government  out of the way.

Included in this package are many commonsense, bipartisan reforms.  Among them is my Streamlining Rural Housing Act. I thank Chairman Hill  for including it in this package.

Today, rural housing projects in Indiana and across the country that  rely on both HUD and USDA programs must undergo two separate  environmental reviews. This duplicative process drives up costs for  developers, delays construction, and discourages the very investment we  need to expand affordable rural housing.

My bill requires HUD and USDA to establish a joint environmental  review process so that these projects no longer face redundant  oversight. The result is simple: fewer delays, lower costs, and more  homes built for working families across the country.

This package also delivers several other important housing reforms.  One such reform led by my colleague on the Committee on Financial  Services from Tennessee, Mr. Rose, removes the permanent chassis  requirement for manufactured homes. This simple fix will reduce  unnecessary costs and help families move into new homes more quickly on  day one.

The package further modernizes longstanding programs so that Federal  housing tools better match our current market realities. It provides  local communities with greater flexibility to invest in housing  solutions tailored to meet their needs and encourages private  investments to expand supply where it is needed the most.

Mr. Speaker, this is what a Republican Congress and President Trump  were elected to do, and we are delivering results for the American  people. We are cutting red tape, and we are restoring the American  Dream of homeownership.

I am proud to have supported the Housing for the 21st Century Act,  and I look forward to its swift consideration in the Senate.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699812/lowering-housing-costs-and-advancing-main-street-community-banks,2026-02-09,2026-W07
Democrat,Greg Stanton,Relating to A National Emergency By the President on February 2025,"Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 72.

I thank Ranking Member Meeks for his great leadership on this  critical issue.

It is time to end Trump's illegal tariffs on Canada, his tariffs on  United States' biggest trading partner, Mexico, and the so-called  liberation day tariffs. Congress has the power of the purse, not the  President. It is time that we take our power back from an executive who  is out of control.

Trump's tariffs have been a massive tax on the American people,  costing an average household $1,000 per household just in the last  year. These tariffs have led to slower job growth, a declining  manufacturing industry, and less investment. They have hurt our farmers  and increased food costs.

These tariffs have inflicted real damage on our relationship with  Canada. Canada isn't just our neighbor. It has historically been one of  our strongest military allies and biggest trading partners. Trump's  constant insults, threats, and these punishing tariffs have turned one  of our best friends away from us and toward the People's Republic of  China.

Enough is enough. It is time that we end this. I urge my colleagues,  Republicans and Democrats alike, send Trump a clear message that he  can't unilaterally wage a trade war against one of our strongest allies  and biggest trading partners.",https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699973/relating-to-a-national-emergency-by-the-president-on-february-2025,2026-02-11,2026-W07
