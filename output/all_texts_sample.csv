Democrat,Richard J. Durbin,Durbin: Why Did President Trump Continue Holding Ukraine Military Aid Amid Warnings About Legality?,"During the question and answer portion of the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Vice Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, today asked both the House managers and the President's counsel why the President continued withholding $250 million in military aid to Ukraine when Department of Defense (DoD) officials were sounding the alarm that the hold would violate the law and short-change our ally of much-needed defense aid as early as August 19, 2019.

Un-redacted emails between DoD and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which were obtained by the media and released in early January,  revealed that by August 12, 2019, the Pentagon could no longer guarantee that all of the $250 million in military aid to Ukraine could be spent before it expired on September 30, 2019.  On August 27, Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist drafted a letter that stated that the Pentagon had ""repeatedly advised OMB officials that pauses beyond August 19, 2019 jeopardize the Department's ability to obligate USAI funding prudently and fully, consistent with the Impoundment Control Act.""

Durbin's question asked the following: ""Emails between DoD and OMB officials reveal that by August 12 the Pentagon could no longer guarantee that all of the $250 million in DoD aid to Ukraine could be spent before it expired.  Deputy Secretary of Defense Norquist drafted a letter that stated that the Pentagon had ""repeatedly advised OMB officials that pauses beyond August 19 jeopardize the Department's ability to obligate USAI funding prudently and fully.'  Why did the President persist in withholding the funds when DoD officials were sounding the alarm that the hold would violate the law and short-change our ally of needed military aid?""

Mr. Patrick Philbin responded to Durbin's question on behalf of the President's counsel.  He admitted that because of the President's hold on the funds, $35 million of the military aid was not spent before the end of the fiscal year.  Those funds would have expired had Congress not intervened to extend the availability of the fiscal year 2019 funds.  Nearly half of the unspent funds were intended for lethal material to assist Ukrainian security forces battling Russian-back separatists.

U.S. Representative Jason Crow (D-CO-06) followed Mr. Philbin on behalf of the House managers stating, ""This idea that the delay doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter if it was a four-day delay, a 40-day delay, or a 400-day delay.  Every delay in combat matters.  Every delay in combat matters.""

Earlier this month, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a legal opinion, which found that the Trump Administration's order to hold $250 million in military aid to Ukraine violated the Impoundment Control Act, a law passed by Congress to rein in Nixon-era abuses.  The GAO ruling found that a president can only put a hold on congressionally-approved spending for very limited and temporary purposes, which was not the case with the White House's orders in the summer of 2019.  

The unlawful, months-long hold on $250 million in defense aid to Ukraine resulted in $35 million of the funds not being spent before the end of the fiscal year -- leading GAO to conclude that the hold was not permissible.   Durbin and other Senators wrote to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on November 18, 2019, urging the Pentagon to spend the remaining funds as quickly as possible.  As of late December, about $18 million of those carryover funds remain unspent.",2020-01-30,2020-W05
Republican,Thom Tillis,"Tillis Announces Additional $391 Million Dollars for North Carolina Hospitals, Community Health Centers, and Rural Health Clinics","Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will award more than $391 million to North Carolina health care providers who provided care for COVID-19 patients, including high-impact hospitals, rural providers, and those treating low-income and uninsured patients. The allocation for rural providers includes rural acute care general hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs), Rural Health Clinics (RHCs), and Community Health Centers located in rural areas. 

Senator Tillis previously announced more than $919 million in grants to health care providers and health systems in North Carolina and $34 million in grants to North Carolina health care centers to assist efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The funding comes from the CARES Act, legislation supported by Senator Tillis.

""As our hospitals and frontline workers continue their heroic care for COVID-19 patients, we must ensure they have the proper resources to provide for every North Carolinian,"" said Senator Tillis. ""Hospitals have struggled financially with the delay of elective surgeries and increased costs due to COVID response, and this crucial funding will help provide our hospitals with more resources to ensure the safety of all patients.""

Breakdown of additional funding in North Carolina:

-High-impact hospitals: $79,025,656-Hospitals treating low-income and uninsured patients: $29,992,087-Rural providers: $282,581,596",2020-05-05,2020-W19
Democrat,Amy Klobuchar,"Price, Matsui, Houlahan, Bera, and Schrier Lead Effort to Bolster Public Health with National Service","Today, Representatives David Price (D-NC) and Doris Matsui (D-CA), Co-Chairs of the National Service Caucus, along with Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), Ami Bera, M.D. (D-CA), and Kim Schrier, M.D. (D-WA) introduced The Pandemic Response and Opportunity Through National Service Act.

Supported by over one hundred national service organizations, the legislation would provide a comprehensive, locally focused, national service strategy to address, move forward and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill creates 750,000 AmeriCorps positions and establishes a partnership with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to manage a quick, federal deployment to crisis regions. These new roles would prepare Americans with meaningful opportunities to improve public health while supporting the needs of local communities and economies. To encourage participation from Americans of all backgrounds, this legislation would also increase AmeriCorps living stipends and grant educational awards equivalent to two years of public college tuition. Empowering AmeriCorps will enhance communities' ability to address, respond, and recover from the far-reaching impacts of COVID-19.

Original Cosponsors: Reps. Nanette Barragan (D-CA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), David Cicilline (D-RI), Diana DeGette (D-CO), Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Joe Kennedy (D-MA), Peter King (R-NY), Annie Kuster (D-NH), John Larson (D-CT), Jimmy Panetta (D-CA), John Sarbanes (D-MD), Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA), Brad Schneider (D-IL), Paul Tonko (D-NY), and Lori Trahan (D-MA).

The U.S. Senate companion legislation has been introduced by Chris Coons (D-DE), who is joined by Jack Reed (D-RI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Ed Markey (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Dick Durbin (D-IL). Members of both the U.S House of Representatives and Senate are working to include this legislation in the upcoming COVID-19 relief package.

""National service organizations possess the unique skills to rise to the challenge during this COVID-19 public health crisis,"" said Representative David Price, Co-Chair of the National Service Caucus. ""As we respond and recover, America needs dedicated individuals, like AmeriCorps and Peace Corps members, that stand ready to tackle a wide range of challenges like bolstering public health initiatives, ramping up contact tracing, and supporting parents and teachers as they transition to e-learning. As Co-Chair of the National Service Caucus, I am proud to introduce the Pandemic Response and Opportunity Through National Service Act to strengthen the response in our communities and our country.""

""The COVID-19 pandemic has opened up fractures, but also new emergency and public health opportunities in our workforce that will live well into the future,"" said Congresswoman Doris Matsui, Co-Chair of the National Service Caucus.  ""As we move forward from this crisis as a country, we must not only strengthen our country's health infrastructure, but we must also prepare a workforce with skills and leadership that extend beyond this pandemic. In times good and bad, the great AmeriCorps workforce has proven its capability to bridge divides in our local communities and help implement a national plan for a better tomorrow.""

""As our country works to reopen and rebuild, we need dedicated public servants who will help strengthen our communities, rebuild our economies and protect our most vulnerable,"" said Congresswoman Houlahan. ""As a veteran and former AmeriCorps Member, I know firsthand that national service is critical to our individual and collective successes. I am proud to be introducing the Pandemic Response and Opportunity Through National Service Act. This legislation will help build a robust response to this pandemic utilizing and augmenting our National Service programs, including AmeriCorps and Peace Corps. Throughout our history, National Service programs and their Corps members have consistently bolstered communities across the country and globe. We will need them now more than ever in order to successfully emerge a stronger, more unified nation.""

""Throughout our history, Americans have always answered the call to national service during times of crisis,"" said Congressman Ami Bera, M.D. ""As our country continues to recover from the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, our national service programs will once again play an integral role in our nation's recovery effort. I'm proud to join my colleagues in support of this bill which will empower a new generation of Americans to serve their country. I encourage Americans to explore their national and local service programs to learn how they can help in the nation's recovery efforts.""

""Right now, the most important thing we can do to start moving towards ""normal life"" is to competently address this public health crisis,"" said Congresswoman Kim Schrier, M.D. ""For the last few months, I have been advocating for an extensive, national contact tracing program that will allow us to identify cases, isolate those patients, then find the people they've been in contact with, and test and quarantine them. Without a vaccine or an effective treatment, this is how we will combat this pandemic and allow people to feel more comfortable leaving their homes. Training and educating AmeriCorps and other National Service members in public health will broaden their skill base, expand the health care workforce, and stop this virus. By tapping into service-minded young people from all over our country, and then recruiting others, we may also spark a passion for public health and create the next generation of public servants to address some of our other pressing healthcare needs.""

""As they have so many times before in times of great need, AmeriCorps and Senior Corps members are stepping forward to serve, meeting critical needs in our communities during this pandemic,"" said AnnMaura Connolly, President of Voices for National Service. ""AmeriCorps members are integral to the COVID-19 response, supporting testing by serving at drive-thru testing sites, providing childcare for health care workers, delivering food and medicine to our most vulnerable, supporting students struggling with distance learning and increasingly supporting emerging contact tracing efforts across the country. As we face the triple threat of a health, economic, and educational crisis, we should lean into the robust and flexible national service infrastructure offered by AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to meet the acute needs mounting in our communities. Voices for National Service is grateful to Representatives Price, Matsui, Houlahan, Bera, Schrier, Cole, DeLauro, Cicilline and the other original cosponsors for their bold vision for expanding AmeriCorps as a transformational force for our country at this critical time.""

This legislation has gained support of over one hundred organizations including: American Conservation Experience, AmeriCorps Mentors for Success, America Forward, America Learns, American YouthWorks, Appalachian Trail Conservancy, America's Service Commissions, Association for Utah Community Health, Bay Area Community Resources, Boston Cares, Boys & Girls Club of Utah  County, Breakthrough Central Texas, California Family Resource Action, Catholic Volunteer Network, Changeist, Child Abuse Prevention Center, Child Abuse Prevention Council of Sacramento, Cities of Service, Citizen Schools, City Year, Civic Assets, CivicWorks, Inc., CLIMB Community Development Coalition, Colorado Youth Corps Association, College Forward, College Possible, Communities in Schools, Conservation Corps of the Forgotten and Emerald Coasts, Conservation Corps Minnesota & Iowa, Conservation Legacy, The Corps Network, East End Neighborhood House, Education Northwest, Encore.Org, FoodCorps, Great Basin Institute, Great Oaks Charter Schools, Habitat for Humanity International, HandsOn Atlanta, Hunger Free America, Indianapolis Neighborhood Resource Center, Iowa & Minnesota Campus Compact, Jumpstart, Kansas Volunteer Commission, Homestead Affordable Housing, Larimer County Conservation Corps, Local Government Commission, Literacy Coalition of Central Texas, Literacy Minnesota, Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), Louisiana Conservation Corps, Maryland Governor's Office on Service and Volunteerism, Massachusetts Service Alliance, Metropolitan Family Service, Mile High Youth Corps, Minnesota Alliance With Youth, Montana Education Partnership, National Association of Foster Grandparent Program Directors, National Center for Appropriate Technology, National Health Corps, National Senior Corps Association, National Youth Leadership Council, New Leaders, New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity, New York Cares, Northwest Youth Corps, Notre Dame Mission Volunteers, Oklahoma AmeriCorps, Ohio Reading Corps, OneStar Foundation, Oregon Volunteer Commission, Playworks, Points of Light, Public Allies, Prevent Child Abuse California, Reading Assist, Reading & Math, Inc., Reading Partners, Rebuilding Together, Regional Youth Adult Social Action Partnership, Relay Graduate School of Education, Rocky Mountain Youth Corps, SBP, Serve Austin, Serve Colorado, Serve Connecticut, Serve Indiana, Serve Minnesota, Serve New Mexico Commission, Serve Ohio, Serve Washington, ShreveCorps, Sierra Nevada Alliance, Student Conservation Association, Service Year Alliance, Teach for America, TerraCorps, United Way of Dane County, United Way of King County, United Way of South Carolina, Up2Us Sports, UServeUtah, Volunteer Mississippi, Volunteer Tennessee, Volunteer West Virginia, Washington Campus Compact, Youth Action Programs and Homes, Inc., YouthBuild USA, Inc., YWCA Central Alabama.

Specifically, the Pandemic Response and Opportunity Through National Service Act would:

Fund 750,000 national service positions over a three-year response and recovery period, in part to meet the projected need for as many as 300,000 public health workers.

Create a partnership between AmeriCorps and CDC inspired by FEMA Corps to provide for additional response surge capacity that could be deployed to specific areas as needed.

Provide flexibilities for programs quickly to grow and respond to dynamic local recovery needs.Prioritize funding for activities directly related to our response and recovery, such as: public health services, emergency logistics, workforce and reemployment services, education support (including for adult learners), and services that combat nutrition insecurity.

Ensure that individuals' financial resources do not limit participation by increasing the AmeriCorps living allowance to 175 percent of the federal poverty line and tying the value of the Segal Education Award to the cost of two years of public university tuition, harmonizing the treatment of both with other programs by making them nontaxable.

Fund new online tools for Senior Corps to safely move to a teleservice model.

Extend priority enrollment to Peace Corps, U.S. Fulbright, and AmeriCorps participants whose service or grants was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and encourage participation by members of low-income and minority communities, those who have had contact with the juvenile justice system, and those of diverse abilities.

Invite participation by a diverse range of Americans by launching an awareness and outreach campaign on response service opportunities and supporting the Volunteer Generation Fund.",2020-05-05,2020-W19
Republican,Jerry Moran,Congressional Leaders Introduce Veterans Economic Recovery Act,"Today, Rep. Phil Roe, M.D. (R-Tenn.), the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.), the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, along with Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kans.), the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and Senator Jon Tester (D-Mont.), the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, introduced the Veterans Economic Recovery Act of 2020. The Members released the following statements about the bipartisan, bicameral bill:

""America's veterans are dedicated, talented, and hard-working leaders in their fields, as employers around the world can attest,"" said Ranking Member Roe. ""That is why the veteran unemployment rate reached its lowest level in modern history earlier this year. Unfortunately, veterans - particularly young veteran women - have not been spared from the economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 virus and by our national response to it. I am introducing the Veterans Economic Recovery Act today to rapidly retrain those veterans so that they have the knowledge and skillset they need to successfully transition from military to civilian life, quickly reenter the workforce, and thrive in the post-pandemic economy. We have perhaps no greater calling than the calling to help those who have served live their version of the American dream once they hang up their uniforms. This bill will help us do just that.""

""The men and women who have served our country are entrepreneurs, engineers, teachers, and so much more, but like most Americans, the coronavirus pandemic has been devastating for them and their families,"" said Rep. Levin. ""It's unacceptable that we now have over a million veterans unemployed, and we need to step up to help get them back to work. With more support for retraining, education, and transition assistance, America's veterans can lead the way as we work to recover from this pandemic. Under Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Roe, our Committee is determined to help every veteran thrive in their post-service careers, and our Veterans Economic Recovery Act sets out to achieve that goal.""

""We have made great strides to lower the veteran unemployment rate, and last year we saw the lowest rate in nearly 20 years,"" said Chairman Moran. ""Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a setback in veterans' employment. The Veterans Economic Recovery Act of 2020 will provide retraining opportunities to help our veterans and their spouses find meaningful jobs so they can provide for themselves and their families. These men and women, who have raised their right hand to serve, deserve no less during this crisis that we are facing.""

""With veteran unemployment on the rise, it's critical that we expand resources to swiftly get these folks trained and back to work,"" said Ranking Member Tester. ""The reality is that the coronavirus hasn't spared our nation's servicemembers--and we've got to work twice as hard to make certain these men and women get the support they earned during their service. That's why I'm introducing the bipartisan Veterans Economic Recovery Act, to strengthen existing retraining job opportunities and establish new resources to get veterans employed and back on their feet. Veterans dealing with the devastating, economic consequences of the pandemic need to know that the government is in their corner--and I'll continue working hard to ensure they aren't left behind during this crisis.""

This legislation is also supported by the following Veteran Service Organizations: Veterans of the Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW), The American Legion, Disabled American Veterans (DAV), Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), American Veterans (AMVETS), Student Veterans of America (SVA), Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), Wounded Warrior Project (WWP), Blinded Veterans Association (BVA), National Association of Veteran Program Administrators (NAVPA), National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), National Association of State Approving Agencies (NASSA), Reserve Officers Association (ROA), Veterans Education Success (VES), and Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States (EANGUS).

Background:

In 2019, the veteran unemployment rate was 3.1%, the lowest in 19 years. However, following the COVID-19 pandemic, the veteran unemployment rose to 11% in April 2020. The unemployment rate for post 9/11 veteran women reached 20% in April 2020, compared to 15.5% for non-veteran women. The centerpiece of the Veterans Economic Recovery Act of 2020 would be the creation of a rapid retraining program to provide unemployed veterans and reservists with 12 months of educational benefits, to pursue training in high-demand occupations. The education benefits available under the rapid retraining program would be equivalent to the benefits provided under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. To be eligible to participate in the rapid retraining program, veterans must:

- Be between the ages of 25-60;- Be unemployed on the day of application;- Have an honorable or other than dishonorable discharge;- Not be eligible for any other VA education benefit;- Not be enrolled in another Federal of State job training program;- Not be receiving disability compensation for reasons that have led to un-employability; and- Not be in receipt of any unemployment benefit when they begin training under this program.

Members of the National Guard or Reserve who were called up on Federal orders to assist states with the COVID-19 response would also be eligible for the rapid retraining program as long as they meet other age, unemployment, discharge requirements. The bill would also incorporate provisions of H.R. 5766, which was introduced by House Republican Leader McCarthy, to make needed improvements to the VET Tec pilot program and of H.R. 2326, to help veterans and servicemembers transition to civilian life.",2020-06-04,2020-W23
Democrat,Edward J. Markey,"Senators Markey, Blumenthal, Warren Lead Colleagues in Demanding Airlines Provide Full Cash Refunds for Coronavirus Cancellations","Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) today led a group of their colleagues in a letter sent to each of the major domestic airlines, urging every company to issue full cash refunds to all customers who cancel their flights during the COVID-19 crisis, and to American citizens who encounter flight cancellations while stranded in countries that implemented travel restrictions. This request comes in the wake of Congress passing an unprecedented bailout for the airline industry, including $25 billion in loans for passenger air carriers.

 

Although most domestic airlines have taken some steps to temporarily waive coronavirus-related change and cancellation fees, travelers who cancel their flights are finding that they will receive only airline credits, not cash refunds. Unfortunately, these travel vouchers do the public little good in this time of emergency, when Americans need money now to pay for basic necessities. Many Americans have also experienced expensive flight cancellations by commercial airlines -- without reimbursement -- as they sought to return to the United States from countries that implemented travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 crisis.

 

Letters were sent to the following companies: Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, and United Airlines.

 

""The ongoing pandemic is placing enormous financial strain on millions of Americans, and families need cash to pay for essentials such as food, housing, and medical care,"" write the Senators. ""In light of this pressing need and the unprecedented bailout -- to the tune of $25 billion -- that the airline industry just received from Congress, we believe your company has a moral responsibility to provide real refunds, not travel vouchers, to consumers, and to support State Department efforts to repatriate any American citizens trying to come home.",2020-03-31,2020-W14
Democrat,Tammy Duckworth,Duckworth Statement on President Trump's Covid-19 National Emergency Declaration,"Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today released the following statement after President Trump issued an emergency disaster declaration under the Stafford Act to strengthen federal support to state, local and tribal efforts to protect public health during the COVID-19 pandemic:

""The Trump Administration botched its response to the COVID-19 outbreak from the beginning by eliminating the office that could have helped our country prepare for this pandemic, rejecting the World Health Organization's proven COVID-19 test and then failing to efficiently develop its own complicated test kit on the first try. The Trump Administration's failure to widely distribute a functional test kit to public health officials across the country has set our response back--while Donald Trump's spewing of misinformation has only sown chaos and confusion at every turn. While today's action should have been taken much sooner, I'm glad President Trump has finally heeded my call for him to declare a national emergency under the Stafford Act to combat the spread of COVID-19.

""This declaration will enable the Federal Government to provide FEMA grants and bridge loans to small businesses affected by COVID-19 and take on a greater role coordinating with state and local governments as they work to contain this outbreak. I hope today marks a turning point for Donald Trump and urge him to do more to take this pandemic seriously and work with Congress to make sure we can support all Americans and mitigate the spread of this virus. Because while this emergency declaration is an important step, we also need to ensure hourly workers can apply for expedited unemployment insurance and provide guaranteed paid leave so everyone can take time off if they feel sick.""

The overdue issuance of a Stafford Act Emergency Declaration unlocks two forms of federal assistance: public assistance for emergency protective measures and individual assistance for individuals and households. This will supplement existing efforts already ongoing under the Public Health Emergency declaration and the U.S. Small Business Administration's economic injury disaster loan program.

Earlier this week, Duckworth introduced the COVID-19 Health Care Worker Protection Act that would require the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to promulgate an emergency temporary standard to protect frontline health care workers who are at increased risk of exposure to the coronavirus. She also pressed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield for information on the potential shortage of enzymes needed for CDC coronavirus test kits. Duckworth also wrote to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to highlight her concerns that the Department of Defense has not yet taken proactive steps to ensure the readiness of National Guard and Reserve units to support local civilian authorities should the COVID-19 pandemic continue to spread.

Last week, Duckworth sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) urging the agency take immediate action to dramatically improve establish clear diagnostic testing procedures, capabilities and production capacity to better mitigate against the impact of the highly contagious coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) that is spreading throughout communities in the United States. She also wrote to the U.S. Small Business Administration to request the agency establishes a task force focused on effectively and efficiently providing assistance to small businesses harmed by the outbreak of COVID-19.",2020-03-13,2020-W11
Republican,Chuck Grassley,"Letter to Bill Bar, Attorney General of the Dept. of Justice, and Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture - Grassley Seeks Federal Investigations into Potential Market Manipulation and Other Illegal Activity by Meat Packers","Dear Attorney General Barr and Secretary Perdue: I write to call on your departments to investigate concerns raised by America's farmers and ranchers about possible illegal practices in the cattle industry. Since February 4, 2020, live cattle prices are down 16 percent. This is happening while American consumers bought 77 percent more meat during the week of March 15 compared to 2019. The spike in the purchase of beef products at the grocery store has resulted in higher beef values for meat packers, yet farmers and ranchers have seen a net decrease in the value of cattle. Further, the four largest meat packing companies control approximately 80 percent of beef processing in the United States. With the shelf price of meat at record highs and with the high rate of concentration in the meat packing industry, there are concerns that the difference in these margins is the result of illegal practices. The Department of Justice and the Department of Agriculture should initiate investigations into potential market manipulation and unfair practices within the cattle market. I have received a large volume of calls and emails from Iowans and member organizations expressing concerns that the current discrepancy between high shelf price and decreased cattle price does not make sense. I share the concerns of these farmers and ranchers and I take their claims seriously. As such, I request that you examine the current structure of the beef meat packing industry and investigate potential market and price manipulation, collusion, restrictions on competition and/or other unfair and deceptive practices under the United States antitrust laws and the Packers and Stockyards Act. Thank you for your prompt consideration of this important matter. I look forward to hearing the results of your investigations. Sincerely,",2020-03-31,2020-W14
Republican,Mike Crapo,-9999,"Mr. CRAPO.  Res. 95,  the resolution seeks to overturn a Trump administration IRS notice  providing simplified guidance on applying the corporate alternative  minimum tax to partnerships. The corporate alternative minimum tax is a  fundamentally flawed, Democrat-enacted book minimum tax. Not one single  Republican voted for it.

As Republicans predicted, the book minimum tax has proven to be  highly complex and burdensome. Even President Biden's own Treasury  Department acknowledged its dizzying complexity. They waived penalties  related to it for 2 full years due to the ``continued challenges'' of  compliance.

The Trump IRS notice at issue today reduces compliance burdens,  making it easier for businesses to calculate their liability. Democrats  gave Treasury extremely broad discretion to implement the tax,  including on complex issues like how it should apply to partnerships.  The notice is within the Treasury's authority, but the Democrats  dislike the outcome.

Approving this resolution would revive ambiguity, inviting audits,  litigation, and significant compliance costs. Therefore, I register my  objection when the unanimous consent request is made.",2026-02-10,2026-W07
Democrat,Christopher A. Coons,"Sens. Coons, Braun announce founding members of bipartisan Senate ALS Caucus","U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) announced the founding members of the bipartisan Senate ALS Caucus: U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Doug Jones (D-Ala.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Martha McSally (R-Ariz.).

""During my time in Congress, I have been inspired by ALS patients and their families,"" said Senator Blackburn. ""Their courage and determination to face this disease and fight for therapies and a cure motivates me to work to find a way to improve their quality of life.""

""Arizonans with ALS and their families deserve to know we're fully supporting research to find a cure for this debilitating disease,"" said Senator Sinema. ""I'm proud to join the ALS Caucus and will continue my efforts advocating for all affected by this disease.""

""The ALS Caucus will focus efforts in the Senate to pass legislation like the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, my bill to waive the standard five-month waiting period for those benefits for patients battling this fatal disease,"" said Senator Cotton. ""It's urgent that we do all we can to support people living with ALS in Arkansas and around the country.""

""ALS is a heartbreaking diagnosis,"" said Senator Whitehouse.

The New Business Preservation Act would create a new program at the Treasury Department that will partner with states to invest in promising new businesses alongside private investors in areas of the country that do not currently attract significant equity investment in new businesses. Special consideration will be given to businesses founded by women and persons of color, who face additional barriers in accessing investment capital.

""New businesses are critically important -- they create jobs and drive innovation in this country. They also need help weathering the economic turmoil caused by the coronavirus pandemic,"" Klobuchar said. ""This legislation will allow the Treasury Department to partner with states to ensure that the most promising new businesses across the country are given a lifeline in the form of an equity investment that will allow them to maintain operations and continue innovating. Congress must continue to work with small business owners, especially women and those who face barriers, to stimulate innovation and create jobs to move our country forward.""

""Critical to American job creation is the ability of Americans to translate an idea into a business. As our economy continues to suffer due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we should be doing everything we can in Congress to support both existing and new businesses, so our economy can recover,"" Coons said. ""I'm proud to work with Senator Klobuchar to introduce legislation that would create a program at the Treasury Department to pair innovative new business ideas with venture capital companies so we can turn those ideas into realities."" 

""As we work to support businesses hurt by the coronavirus, we want to make sure that startups are not left behind,"" Kaine said. ""These businesses have an important role to play to bolster our economy, but they are particularly at risk during the pandemic, especially if they are in cities and towns outside of startup hotspots. Our bill would provide critical support for them and help promote future job development."" 

""The coronavirus pandemic that is harming our economy could set back our innovative small businesses for years,"" King said. ""Our legislation would help create opportunities for dynamic-forward thinking enterprises in parts of the country that are too often left behind. It's a win-win that supports our economy and our communities.""

""Senator Klobuchar's bill is a positive step at a critical time.  As we look at how to cope with the challenges presented by the coronavirus, we should not lose sight of the critical role new businesses play in creating jobs.  The New Business Preservation Act will help level the playing field, by backing entrepreneurs in every state and every zip code, and lead to a more inclusive economy,"" said Steve Case, Chairman and CEO of Revolution.

The economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic are expected to disproportionately harm new businesses, which tend to have less cash on hand and are often poorly positioned to weather a drop-off in customer demand and lender financing. Equity financing -- which this program provides - is critical because it does not require repayment but instead represents a long-term investment in the business. A significant reduction in the number of new businesses in our economy would have a devastating impact on job openings since research has shown that these new businesses are the source of most new job creation.

The New Business Preservation Act is supported by the Progressive Policy Institute, Third Way, Small Business Majority, Center for American Entrepreneurship, Economic Innovation Group, Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, and the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.

The New Business Preservation Act would:

Create a new program at the Treasury Department that will partner with states to invest alongside private venture capital companies in new businesses in areas of the country that do not currently attract significant equity investment in new businesses.Special consideration is given to businesses created by women and persons of color, who face additional barriers in accessing investment capital.The program will be self-sustaining, with any returns on investment being reinvested in new businesses in future years.",2020-03-19,2020-W12
Republican,Ted Cruz,"Sen. Cruz Calls Violent Antifa Riots a ""Terrorist Assault' on Our Country That Must Be Stopped","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today appeared on Fox News' ""Outnumbered Overtime w/ Harris Faulkner,' to condemn the violent riots that have broken out amid peaceful protests following the horrific death of George Floyd. Sen. Cruz also spoke with reporters, calling for strong leadership to protect all Americans and fairly and equally enforce the law for everyone.

ON POLICE BRUTALITY

""Everyone agrees what happened to George Floyd was horrific. It was police brutality. And we are united in rightly believing that the officers involved should face criminal prosecution. They are facing criminal prosecution for breaking the law.""

ON ANTIFA'S VIOLENT RIOTS

""I think there are a lot of people who are second guessing the President, and second guessing our leadership. Now is a time for strong leadership. Rioting should not be tolerated. It cannot be allowed. And we need strong leadership from the President, from the Attorney General, from governors, from mayors, [and] from police chiefs.

""Every American has a right to speak and to peaceably express your freedom of speech. What you don't have a right to do is engage in violent rioting. What you don't have a right to do is loot. What you don't have a right to do is light police cars on fire and attack your fellow citizens. We need law enforcement to be unequivocal that if you do that, you will be arrested, you will be prosecuted and you will spend a very long time in jail. We also need systematic law enforcement targeting Antifa and other terrorist groups that are organizing, [and] that are providing assistance. This is a terrorist assault on our country and rioting cannot be tolerated. It needs to end and it needs to end now.""

ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RESPONSE & VISIT TO ST. JOHN'S CHURCH

""The military has been called up a number of times to defend the nation. The natural route is to use the National Guard. That is appropriate. If necessary, the military should be used and there is a long tradition of that.""

""I'm glad the President went to St. John's church. That's a historic church in our nation's capital city that arsonists and vandals have firebombed. It was strong and powerful for the President to go there and say we will not be cowed.""

ON DEMOCRATS' AUTHORITARIAN DOUBLE STANDARD

""Isn't it interesting, Harris, that all of these authoritarian Democratic local leaders who were eager to send in law enforcement to arrest people at churches or to try to target a dad playing softball with his six-year-old daughter [...] when it comes to violent protesters, looting, robbing, breaking windows, stealing, burning police cars, suddenly these Democratic elected office holders, too many of them are deciding it's bad politics to enforce the law. Every one of them needs to protect our American cities, our American people.""",2020-06-02,2020-W23
Democrat,Mark R. Warner,"Letter to the Hon. Donald Trump, President of the United States - Manchin Leads Colleagues in Calling for MSHA to Implement Emergency Standards to Protect Miners During Coronavirus Pandemic","Dear President Trump:

We write to echo the request of America's coal miners by urging the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), the federal government's principal agency directed to prevent mine illness, injury, and death, to exercise its authority to issue emergency standards to safeguard miners as the nation continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic.

As you are well aware, coal miners are especially prone to the dangers of COVID-19 because of the nature of their work. Unlike other professions where social distancing recommendations are practicable, coal mining requires the continuous clustering of people working in close proximity of one another. Clustering usually begins in the locker rooms where miners prepare for the day's shift by putting on their protective gear. It continues when the miners climb into their mantrips, mine cars, and elevators where they are carried to the extraction sites. While there, the miners will breathe the same air, utilize the same machinery, tools, and instrumentalities to move the coal out of the mine and into the stream of commerce. Once their shifts conclude, the miners will return to the locker rooms, utilize showering facilities, and exchange orders with the next shift before heading home to their families. This process repeats itself between every shift, and at every mine, exponentially increasing the probability of exposure to the COVID-19 virus.

We understand that individual mine operators and local unions have implemented their own measures in an attempt to mitigate the risks of exposure to this highly contagious virus. However, we believe that a uniform implementation of practices detailed within an MSHA emergency standard would ensure that the highest level of precautionary measures were in place at every mine.

Coal miners are the backbone of this country; they have always risked their lives to provide the power that keeps our lights on and the energy flowing to our homes and businesses. When it comes to the coal industry, the health and safety of our miners must continue to be our top priority.

Again, we strongly urge MSHA to immediately issue the emergency standards necessary to protect our nation's miners as we work toward finding solutions to the current public health crisis. Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.",2020-04-17,2020-W16
Republican,Chuck Grassley,"Letter to Vice President Mike Pence - Grassley Pushes for Crackdown on Scam Artists Defrauding Hospitals, Selling Fake or Faulty PPE","Dear Vice President Pence: I write to you today deeply concerned that scam artists are taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic by engaging in fraud or selling counterfeit and faulty personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals and other healthcare providers. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, I have read reports of hospitals in Missouri, Georgia, New Jersey, California, and New York who have been defrauded or have received counterfeit or faulty PPE from third-party vendors.[1] It is very likely that several dozen more hospitals have also been defrauded, but have not reported this information to the authorities because of the current demand and scarcity of PPE. We must continue to encourage our hospitals and healthcare providers to report this information to the Federal government so that we can ensure the safety and security of our supply-chain and root out bad-actors during this crisis. As of April 14, 2020, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations has opened over 130 investigations, seized $3 million in illicit proceeds, and worked with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to stop over 225 shipments of mislabeled, fraudulent, or counterfeit PPE and COVID-19 testing kits.[2] Both Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and CBP have issued alerts to the medical community urging them to exercise due diligence and caution when dealing with unverified vendors or third-party brokers.[3] Even 3M and Prestige Ameritech--the two leading manufacturers of masks--have issued fraud warnings to hospitals and consumers warning them that fraudsters are selling non-existent product. Scammers are using a variety of methods to take advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Often, scammers promise supplies they do not have and demand up-front payments before agreeing to ship PPE. In these types of schemes, the victim pays a purported seller or broker for PPE or medical supplies and receives nothing in return. Alternatively, scammers ship PPE and medical supplies that do not meet Federal health and safety standards putting the safety of our healthcare workers at direct and significant risk.[4] Indeed, most PPE are manufactured in China--the world's largest supplier of medical PPE--which make it increasingly difficult for hospitals to verify the legitimacy of the goods they are purchasing until they arrive at their facility. Earlier this month, China seemed to acknowledge the problem by requiring additional quality and safety checks on PPE and other medical equipment exports.[5] However, these additional measures have become an impediment to the receipt of timely supplies, including from U.S. companies with manufacturing facilities overseas. The last thing our hospitals and healthcare professionals need to worry about during this crisis is whether their PPE are safe, reliable, and legitimate. I understand the difficulty we face in procuring legitimate PPE and other medical supplies right now and I'm sure we will have serious discussions about how the U.S. can identify and mitigate supply-chain vulnerabilities in advance of natural disasters soon. However, right now I ask that your Administration take every reasonable effort to ensure the safety and security of our supply-chain so hospitals are not being defrauded or sold fake or faulty PPE. I am also asking the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, HHS, and CBP to brief the Senate Finance Committee on their work to prevent and detect COVID-19-related fraud and the sale of counterfeit or faulty PPE and medical supplies at their earliest convenience.

Democrat,Christopher Murphy,Letter to Donald Trump - Congressional Delegation Calls on Trump Administration to Fully Reimburse Connecticut for Emergency Services Granted Under Disaster Declarations,"Dear Mr. President:

We write strongly urging you to grant Governor Ned Lamont's request for a 100 percent cost-share adjustment for both the major disaster declaration and emergency declaration issued to the State of Connecticut.  While we appreciate your approval of Public Assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for our home state, we fear that 25 percent cost-share requirement puts unnecessary financial burden on the State, its tribal nations, municipalities, and eligible private non-profit entities.  Additionally, we request that you continue working closely with Governor Lamont to ensure approval of Connecticut's request for certain FEMA Individual Assistance programs and our state's eligibility for any forthcoming disaster assistance.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across our state, our local, state, and tribal governments and their eligible private non-profit providers continue to provide essential services.  As of this morning, more than 13,380 residents have tested positive, 1,700 are hospitalized, and 600 have died.  Almost 10 percent of our state's total population has filed for unemployment since March 13, 2020, local businesses remain shuttered, and the everyday lives of the people of Connecticut remain upended. 

Frontline agencies and providers need to utilize limited financial resources to continue battling the devastating health and fiscal effects of COVID-19 and ensure a full recovery.  It is imperative that you adjust the current cost-share agreement to cover 100 percent federal reimbursement for disaster assistance.  Our frontline agencies and organizations need funds to save lives and help people through these unprecedented times -- not a requirement to pay for a portion of federal services.  This request is not unprecedented as such cost-share requirements were waived during past natural disasters, and it is certainly warranted given the magnitude of the impact of this global pandemic.

As Governor Lamont's request makes clear, our state is taking unprecedented steps to address the needs of our businesses, residents, first responders, healthcare providers, and others.  It is absolutely necessary for the federal government to abandon burdensome cost-share requirements so that the State, its tribal nations, municipalities, and eligible private non-profit entities can focus resources exclusively on this critical work. 

Finally, we reiterate our plea for immediate approval of the Governor's request for four supplemental assistance programs under the Individual Assistance Program: Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Crisis Counseling Program, Disaster Case Management, and Disaster Legal Services.  Additionally, the Governor requested Other Needs Assistance for Child Care Assistance and Funeral Assistance under the Individuals and Households Program.  It is critical that you make these federal resources and any additional disaster assistance available for the State of Connecticut and the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribal lands.

We appreciate your immediate consideration of this request.",2020-04-14,2020-W16
Democrat,Chris Van Hollen,"Letter to the Hon. Andrew Wheeler, Admin. of the Environmental Protection Agency - Senators to EPA: Describe Your COVID-19 Plans","Dear Administrator Wheeler:

 

We write to request information about how EPA is adjusting its operations in light of the novel coronavirus, including as required by the Acting OMB Director's memorandum issued on March 17, 2020.[1] That memorandum requires federal agencies to ""take appropriate steps to prioritize all resources to slow the transmission of COVID-19, while ensuring our mission-critical activities continue,"" including taking steps to ""immediately adjust operations and services to minimize face-to-face interactions.""

EPA is taking several steps in response to COVID-19, such as publishing its list of approved disinfectants[2] and expediting claims for EPA-registered surface disinfectants that have been demonstrated to work on other similar viruses. However, EPA's Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) is not publicly available. EPA also seems to have archived its 2016 pandemic influenza website.[3] Lack of access to this information raises questions as to whether EPA's essential functions and response role remain intact in the current COVID-19 pandemic and whether the COOP plan is sufficient to address the current situation.  Additionally, early reports about EPA's activities during and in response to the pandemic also raise several concerns:

 

-Enforcement Discretion. A March 24th article in the Wall Street Journal reported on EPA plans ""to waive compliance requirements and deadlines for a range of industries, including oil refiners, water utilities and sewage plants, as it seeks to help businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic.""[4] Other sources have also told Senator Carper's office that EPA appears ready to issue sweeping waivers of enforcement known as ""no action assurances."" Sources have also indicated that EPA issued interim inspection guidelines on March 18th that appropriately instruct staff to postpone any routine or non-time-critical inspections in order to prevent further spread of COVID-19. EPA's March 26th publication of a COVID-19 temporary enforcement discretion policy[5] does provide a transparent description of EPA's enforcement efforts, and we appreciate the policy's express commitments that EPA will update the policy if it determines that modifications are necessary and post any such modifications on its website at least seven days prior to terminating the temporary policy. However, EPA must balance any relaxation in enforcement efforts taken to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 with its important mission to assure compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and must not allow enforcement discretion to be used as a license to pollute freely. EPA must also ensure that these measures are taken only as necessary, and with full transparency. 

-Public Comment. EPA also appears to be moving forward with controversial rulemakings and other activities, often in a manner that does not allow for meaningful public input to be provided. For example, despite calls for delay, EPA insisted[6] on completing the peer review process for the controversial[7] Toxic Substances Control Act risk evaluation of the toxic chemical trichloroethylene (TCE) with a short written comment period and an online ""public meeting'[8] at a time when reviewers and other stakeholders may be either quarantined or, in some cases, responding to the COVID-19 crisis as members of the public health community. At the same time, EPA is rushing to finalize many of its more controversial rules to weaken pollution standards for automobiles and power plants. According to a March 25th article in The New York Times,[9] federal workers describe the deregulatory atmosphere at EPA as relentless, with several workers being been told to expect no ""slippage"" or relaxation of rulemaking deadlines even though thousands of federal employees are teleworking and juggling child care responsibilities.   

-Telework and Employee Protection. EPA does not appear to have long-term plans to adequately protect its employees. Senator Carper's office has learned that on March 15, 2020, you ""authorized voluntary unscheduled leave and telework for all EPA employees across the nation"" through April 3, 2020. However, press reports[10] have also stated that on February 27, 2020, EPA issued an order (effective March 15, 2020) that eliminates the option of full-time regular telework for all non-bargaining unit employees (i.e., supervisors and other senior-level employees).[11] Sources also indicate that at least as of March 24th, EPA had not implemented its Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) for DC-area employees because the governments of Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia had not yet issued formal shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders. As a result, sources have said that they were told during a March 24th conference call that EPA employees (at least in the DC area) would be required to return to work after April 3rd unless you extended your March 15th telework and unscheduled leave flexibility or unless required to do so by local area governments. On March 30, 2020, the governments of Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia issued stay-at-home orders. My office has obtained a copy of a March 30th email from you to EPA staff informing them that ""In response to the President's announcement yesterday to continue social distancing through April 30th, we will extend unscheduled leave and unscheduled telework in the Agency to the end of April. We are also evaluating options to provide as much flexibility to you as possible so that you can balance work and family responsibilities."" We urge you to promptly develop a plan to adequately protect EPA staff beyond April 30th.

EPA's mission to protect human health and the environment requires a wide range of tasks, including monitoring air and water quality, cleaning up Superfund sites, ensuring that drinking water is safe, keeping harmful chemical products out of commerce, making sure that pesticides are used safely, and conducting research. The regulated community also relies upon EPA to approve, certify, permit, or otherwise authorize many important commercial activities, such as approving disinfectants, evaluating the safety of new and existing chemicals, issuing air, water, and hazardous waste permits, certifying vehicles and engines for entry into commerce, and approving Energy Star products. It accomplishes its regulatory tasks in part via on-site visits, sampling, laboratory testing, inspections, public meetings, negotiations, and other activities that necessarily and appropriately will be severely limited for weeks or months while many EPA employees are teleworking or limiting contact with others. Even though some of these in-person activities can be converted to telephonic or online meetings, EPA's efforts may be hampered given that nongovernmental organizations, the regulated community, and EPA's state partners could be short-staffed and similarly focused on other tasks for many weeks or longer. So that we can better understand how EPA plans to perform its important mission while protecting its employees against the spread of COVID-19, we ask that you provide the following:

 

1. A copy of EPA's current Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP), pandemic plan, and other plans or documents that are guiding the Agency's operations in light of COVID-19, including a description of how such documents are being utilized or modified to address this unique situation.

Democrat,Richard J. Durbin,"Letter to the Hon. Chad Wolf, Acting Secretary of the Dept. of Homeland Security - Durbin Presses DHS On Reported Sharing Of Confidential DACA Recipient Information","Dear Acting Secretary Wolf:                                                                                    

In light of serious concerns that the Trump Administration is preparing mass deportations of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, I write to urgently seek more information about the confidentiality of information that DACA recipients have provided to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).  These concerns are particularly pressing at a time when more than 200,000 DACA recipients are ""essential critical workers,"" as defined by your agency, on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, including 41,700 DACA recipients in the health care industry. 

Long-standing USCIS policy is that information provided by DACA recipients will not be used in removal proceedings.  According to ""Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals: Response to January 2018 Preliminary Injunction,"" which appears on the USCIS website, ""Unless otherwise provided in this guidance, the DACA policy will be operated on the terms in place before it was rescinded on Sept. 5, 2017, until further notice.""  That page links to ""DHS DACA FAQs,"" which state:

Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure to ICE and CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings unless the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS' Notice to Appear guidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA). Individuals whose cases are deferred pursuant to DACA will not be referred to ICE.

DHS and USCIS nominees and officials have testified under oath, both before and after the Administration announced its intent to rescind DACA, that existing DACA guidelines would remain in place.  For example, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on May 24, 2017, Senator Durbin asked then-USCIS Director nominee Francis Cissna, ""For the record, do you commit to maintaining the existing DACA guidelines?""  Mr. Cissna replied, ""If confirmed I would see my role to be to administer that program well as it stands with its current parameters.""  At a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on November 8, 2017, Senator Harris asked then-DHS Secretary nominee Kirstjen Nielsen, ""If confirmed, do you commit that this information [provided by DACA requestors] will not be shared for enforcement purposes?""  Ms. Nielsen replied, ""Yes, as I understand it, there are extraordinarily limited circumstances that involve very specifically national or public safety. To my knowledge, there are no other reasons or exceptions to enable that information to be shared for any enforcement purpose. If there are any, I will commit to you to immediately come and talk to you about it and work out a solution together.""

In light of grave concerns about the confidentiality of information that DACA requestors have provided to USCIS, I request that you respond to the following questions as soon as possible, and no later than May 1, 2020:

1. Is it still DHS policy that USCIS may not refer DACA recipients to ICE? 1.a. Has USCIS referred any current or former DACA recipients to ICE since January 20, 2017?  

a. If yes, how many current or former DACA recipients has USCIS referred to ICE since January 20, 2017? 

1. In what circumstances, if any, can ICE access information submitted by a DACA requestor?  

 1.a. Does ICE have access to any databases in which information submitted by a DACA requestor is stored?  

a. If yes, which databases and under what circumstances can ICE access this information? 

a. For each such database, how long has ICE had such access and how many DACA requestors' information has ICE accessed? 

a. For each such database, does ICE require permission from USCIS to access DACA requestors' information?  If yes, which USCIS officials are authorized to grant such permission? 

a. For each such database, which ICE officials are authorized to access DACA requestors' information? 

 1.a. Can ICE access information submitted by DACA requestors through the National Records Center?  

a. If yes, since when has ICE had this access? 

 1.a. What policies or procedures govern ICE's access to DACA requestors' information?  Please provide copies of any such policies or procedures. 

a. How long have such policies or procedures been in place?  

a. If such policies or procedures have changed since January 20, 2017, was Congress notified of any such changes? 

a. In how many instances have the policies or procedures governing ICE's access to DACA requestors' information been violated? 

 1.a. Has ICE used DACA requestors' information in any enforcement actions? 

a. If yes, in how many instances has this taken place and what was the nature of such enforcement actions? 

Thank you for your time and consideration.  I look forward to your prompt response.",2020-04-17,2020-W16
Democrat,Edward J. Markey,Gardner and Markey Introduce Cambodia Democracy Act,"U.S. Senators Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Ed Markey (D-MA), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, introduced S. 3081, the Cambodia Democracy Act, in response to the deteriorating human rights and democracy situation in Cambodia.  

Human Rights Watch found ""The ruling Cambodian People's Party maintains power through violence, politically motivated prosecutions, repressive laws, and corruption. Prime Minister Hun Sen, in power since 1985, oversees one-party rule in the National Assembly since government-controlled courts dissolved the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, detained opposition leader Kem Sokha, and banned more than 100 opposition members from politics in the lead up to sham elections in July 2018. The government has also intensified its crackdown on independent media, local human rights defenders, and land rights activists. Rights to free expression and peaceful assembly are sharply curtailed, and there is no accountability for serious abuses."" 

""The United States cannot stand idly by as a dictatorship entrenches in Cambodia and corrosive Chinese influence takes hold,"" said Senator Gardner. ""The Cambodia Democracy Act will hold those intent on destroying Cambodia's democratic progress accountable and send a clear message that the United States will always stand in defense of those seeking freedom and justice around the world.""  

""Those who have perpetrated grave human rights abuses or undermined democracy in Cambodia should lose access to the U.S. financial system. The Hun Sen government must know that the world is watching as it cracks down on civil society, opposition leaders, and journalists, including former employees of Radio Free Asia. The Cambodian people have a right to democracy, rule of law, and the opportunity to deliver on the promise of the Paris Peace Agreements of a generation ago,"" said Senator Markey.

The Gardner-Markey Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018, enacted into law in December 2018, imposed conditions upon U.S. assistance to the Government of Cambodia related to democracy and regional security.

S. 3081, The Cambodia Democracy Act, is companion legislation to H.R. 526, which passed in the House of Representatives by voice vote on July 15, 2019.

The Cambodia Democracy Act:

Applies asset blocking sanctions to senior officials of the Government, military, or security forces of Cambodia that the President determines have undermined democracy in Cambodia or committed related human rights violations.Codifies the State Department's existing visa restrictions for these individuals.Requires the President to transmit to Congress a list of the sanctioned individuals, and the President may waive sanctions upon a certification that such waiver is in the national interest of the United States.Sanctions may be suspended for up to one year, and renewed for one-year periods, upon the President's certification to Congress that Cambodia is making meaningful progress towards ending government efforts to undermine democracy, ending related human rights violations, and conducting free and fair elections.",2020-01-03,2020-W01

Democrat,Christopher A. Coons,"CNN ""Erin Burnett Outfront"" - Transcript:  Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) Discuss About What Will Happen After The Motion For Witnesses And Documents Has Been Defeated","BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT 

ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett and the breaking news, history is unfolding as we speak. Right now the impeachment trial of President Trump is about to resume any second. They've been in recess for nearly 80 minutes, trying to do some sort of a backroom deal to figure out how to move forward.

A motion to allow witnesses was defeated and now the senators are going to be taking on amendments. They have been debating what comes next. That final vote we now believe will be Wednesday and I want to go straight to Democratic Senator Chris Coons who's about to head back into that room.

And Senator, what can you tell us? Let's start with right now you're going back into that room, what happens the rest of tonight?

SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Well, Erin, that's really in the hands of the Republican majority right now. I'm expecting that we're going to be called back in for a vote any moment. The majority leader will lay out whatever he's been able to work out with his caucus, which is the majority of the Senate.

And then I expect a series of amendment votes to be offered by the Democrats. Frankly, trying through a number of votes to force reconsideration of this central vital question, will there be any witnesses, will there be any documents.

I'll remind you, Erin, this will be the very first impeachment trial in the entire history of the Senate to have no witnesses. The last impeachment trial when it happened right as I got here 10 years ago of a judge from Louisiana, had 26 witnesses, 17 of whom had not appeared before their appearance in front of the Senate trial committee.

I think the House managers made an excellent case today about why we should be hearing from John Bolton and other witnesses and it was frankly very painful that this didn't happen.

BURNETT: But that all got voted down. I mean, it seems at this point though, of course, I mean, look, I understand you got to make your point on these amendments, but you're talking about taking a last stand, the next step --

COONS: That's right.

BURNETT: -- which would be closing arguments on Monday and a vote on Wednesday is what we understand. Is there any more you can tell us about the deal from here to make it clear that would mean that the vote comes after the State of the Union and after the Iowa caucuses?

COONS: Well that, as I said, Erin, that's what I have heard through press reports is what the majority leader is trying to persuade his caucus to support. I don't think that will get much support in our caucus. There's a lot of folks who would like to see us keep fighting and keep pushing for more votes tonight and tomorrow, and to be here for our arguments on the floor.

But given that he was able to secure 51 votes against any more witnesses or any more documents, it seems likely that the majority leader has the votes to drive through the process that he's fighting for.

BURNETT: So there are some Republicans who wanted an acquittal tonight. They wanted it very quickly, right?

COONS: Yes.

BURNETT: There were some though who did want a chance to talk, to stand up and say something and that's in part why the majority leader is going to allow these closing statements and senators to speak Monday, Tuesday and then that vote on Wednesday.

Have you talked to any of those Republicans who actually wanted a chance to stand up and speak? And if so, why? What do they want to say? Why is this important to them?

COONS: I've talked to a couple of my colleagues. Frankly, it's hard. I'm normally someone who works across the aisle fairly well but this has been a really hard two weeks and I am very disappointed in some of my colleagues, very frustrated at this process.

As we saw just today, The New York Times reported more breaking news from the upcoming book by the former National Security Advisor John Bolton suggesting that President Trump was in the room with John Bolton, with Rudy Giuliani, with the White House Counsel.

BURNETT: Yes.

COONS: Months earlier, weeks earlier, excuse me, than we previously knew. Why they don't want more evidence? I don't understand. But a number of them are making the argument that this is not an impeachable offense and I think, frankly, the consequences of their deciding that this is not an impeachable offense will be long lasting and great for our country.

BURNETT: Senator, I appreciate your time very much. Of course, he's referring to senators Lamar Alexander, Marco Rubio and others who said assume everything that happened is true, they don't believe it's impeachable.

Democrat,Ron Wyden,"Wyden Statement on Trump Budget Slashing Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security and Proposal to Privatize BPA","U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement on the Trump budget:

""For a president who makes himself out to be a champion of typical working Americans, Donald Trump has run the same old Republican playbook of giving tax handouts to the wealthy and slashing the safety net that supports everybody else. He started this con with his 2016 campaign promises not to touch Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, and now he wants to cut them by more than $1.5 trillion. Bottom line, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are on the chopping block as long as Donald Trump is president.""

Wyden also condemned the Trump proposal to privatize Bonneville Power for the third consecutive year. Wyden said:

""Too many families in Oregon are already balancing the food bill against the utility bill and do not need the administration to come in like a wrecking ball and make things worse. Yet, Trump is once again threatening to sell off Bonneville Power and raise the monthly utility bills for Oregon families and businesses. This misguided scheme would be felt by everybody in the Northwest.""",2020-02-10,2020-W07

Port intends to build and install more storage area for cargo to be held before it is loaded onto ships. This will increase the use of barges and traffic at the port.

""Now is the time to invest in infrastructure. Louisiana ports are the gateways to the world. This grant allows the Port of New Orleans to increase its storage ability so that more goods will flow through the port and onto the global marketplace,"" said Dr. Cassidy.",2020-06-08,2020-W24
Democrat,Jeff Merkley,"Merkley, Van Hollen Introduce Legislation Requiring Witnesses and Documents for Future Impeachment Trials","Oregon's U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley and U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) today introduced new legislation that would require the Senate to consider evidence and hear from witnesses in future impeachment trials.

The Senators' resolution follows the conclusion last week of the first-ever Senate impeachment trial that did not include any witness testimony. The Merkley-Van Hollen resolution would ensure the rights of both sides to call relevant witnesses and introduce relevant evidence in any future impeachment trial.

""Whether to hear out the truth should never be a partisan question,"" said Merkley. ""Impeachment is a key tool that goes to the heart of our constitutional system of checks and balances. The Senate must never fail its constitutional responsibility in this way again. That's exactly why we should fix our rules now, while there is a window for Democrats and Republicans to agree on fair rules for both sides outside the pressure of an imminent trial.""

""The Senate's sham impeachment trial was a disgrace to the Congress and to the country. It was the first impeachment trial in American history where the Senate did not hear from any witnesses or receive relevant documents. To prevent this type of farce from occurring again, the Senate must change its rules to require witnesses and documents. I'm proud to join Senator Merkley in introducing this legislation to change the Senate rules to ensure fair impeachment trials. Partisanship should not come before the truth,"" said Van Hollen.

Merkley announced his intention to introduce the legislation last week, after the Senate voted down motions to subpoena witnesses on multiple near-party line votes.

Republican,John Barrasso,Barrasso: Time Is Of The Essence,"Today, Senator John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, released the following statement after Paycheck Protection Program funding was finally replenished after being blocked by Senate Democrats. The deal included funding for rural hospitals affected by coronavirus, a priority for Senator Barrasso as co-chair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus.

""Two weeks ago, Senate Republicans put forward a bill to prevent the Paycheck Protection Program from running out of money. Last week, the program officially ran out of money. Democrats claim on-camera to be fighting for the same people they're holding hostage off-camera. Pelosi and Schumer blocked funding and burned weeks of precious time for America's small businesses.

""I'm ready to move forward with the deal reached today. The House must immediately pass this bill. No more delays. In addition to supporting small businesses, the legislation includes important funding for rural hospitals in Wyoming.

Republican,Marsha Blackburn,"Bill Renames Chinese Embassy Street ""Li Wenliang Plaza""","Senators Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska), Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), and Representative Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming) introduced companion bills to rename the street outside the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. ""Li Wenliang Plaza."" The bill honors the late Dr. Li Wenliang, the Wuhan-based doctor who warned the world about the coronavirus before the Chinese Communist Party silenced him. 

""Dr. Li's professional ethics made him an enemy of the Chinese Communist Party and a hero to the Chinese people. Chairman Xi can try to claim Dr. Li as the Party's own martyr, but the Chinese people know that it was Dr. Li's selfless work and voice that the Party sought to silence. We can honor that work by renaming the street outside the Chinese Embassy after him. The street outside the embassy will draw a glaring contrast between the cruelty and lies of the Chinese Communist Party and the decency and compassion of the Chinese people,"" said Sasse.

""The Chinese Communist Party wants the world to forget the name Li Wenliang. CCP officials forced the Wuhan-based doctor to retract his early warnings about coronavirus, and government censors scrubbed Chinese social media of his name after his death. We'll ensure the name Li Wenliang is never forgotten--by placing it permanently outside the embassy of the nation responsible for the deaths Dr. Li tried to prevent,"" said Cotton. 

""The Chinese Communist Party may have forcefully silenced Dr. Li for informing the public about COVID-19, but Beijing's totalitarian censorship cannot erase what the global community now knows. Renaming the street outside of the Chinese embassy ensures that Dr. Li will never be forgotten, will serve as a stark reminder to the Chinese government and Communist Party that the U.S. will stand with the oppressed and not with their oppressors,"" said Rubio. 

""Dr. Li took a great personal risk to tell the world about COVID-19 despite the looming threats of, and subsequent forced censorship by, the Chinese Communist Party. Even when he contracted the virus, Dr. Li continued his efforts to communicate his experience and what he knew about it. Dr. Li is a hero. In naming this street in his honor, we will show the Chinese government and the world that truth prevails and free speech is paramount to who we are as a nation. The American people are grateful for his sacrifice,"" said Blackburn.

The Chinese Government attempted to silence Dr. Li Wenliang who, at great personal risk, warned about the danger of Coronavirus. While the Chinese Communist Party caused the virus to be spread around the globe, resulting in death and economic devastation, brave medical professionals like Dr. Li spoke truth to the regime. I am honored to introduce this legislation to rename the street in front of the Chinese Embassy after Dr. Li. May this serve as a constant reminder to the world and to the Chinese Government that truth and freedom will prevail, that we will not forget the bravery of Dr. Li, and that the Chinese Communist Party will be held accountable for the devastating impact of their lies,"" said Cheney.",2020-05-07,2020-W19
Republican,John Thune,"Thune, Wyden Introduce Bill to Improve Child Support Enforcement for Native American Tribes","U.S. Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight, and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, today introduced legislation to improve child support enforcement for Native American tribes by allowing the 61 tribes that currently operate their own child support agencies to access the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program to collect past-due child support from non-custodial parents. It would also create parity between tribes and states by allowing tribal child support agencies to obtain other identifiable information of non-custodial parents that can be used to enforce child support.

 

""State child support agencies have access to federal programs that assist them in collecting past-due child support from non-custodial parents,"" said Thune. ""By ensuring tribes operating their own child support agencies have access to these same programs and information provided to states, we can help families in Indian Country receive child support payments that are past due and help put tribal and state programs on equal footing.""

 

""Tribal governments in Oregon and across America should have access to the same child support enforcement programs as state agencies,"" said Wyden. ""Equal access to these important resources and tools means more families and children will get the support they need.""

 

""By giving tribal governments the same child support collection tools and safeguards available to their state partners, the bill is a great collaborative effort to further enhance state and tribal programs and the children they serve,"" said Tanguler Gray, president of the National Child Support Enforcement Association. ""The National Child Support Enforcement Association has long-sought the improvements contained in the bill and supports them whole-heartedly.""

 

""The NATCSD is extremely pleased by the introduction of the Tribal Child Support Enforcement Act,"" said Susan Smith, president of the National Association of Tribal Child Support Directors. ""Our sincere thanks to those who have persistently and tirelessly worked for the introduction of this Bill. We look forward to ‎the passage of this Bill as it will assist Tribal IV-D agencies in collecting child support arrears due to tribal families."" 

 

""On Behalf of the National Tribal Child Support Association and our 400 colleagues, we are extraordinarily pleased that federal lawmakers are addressing the current disparity in our efforts to collect child support arrearages on behalf of tribal children,"" said Marsha Harlan, president of the National Tribal Child Support Association. ""Passage of this Act will allow Tribal IV-D programs to have equal access to the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program that states have had for many years. Tribal access to these funds ensure our programs can capture refunds of non-custodial parents and apply those dollars directly to collections for children who are desperately in need of support.""

 

States have several enforcement methods at their disposal to enforce child support, one being the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program. With this program, when a non-custodial parent is due a refund but owes past-due child support, Treasury can withhold the tax refund and send it to the state child support agency to get it to the family.",2020-01-08,2020-W02
Republican,Thom Tillis,Tillis Supports Bipartisan Agreement To Help More Small Businesses,"Today, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued the following statement on the bipartisan agreement on additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program:

""I'm glad we were able to pass additional funding to help North Carolina's small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. It should have never taken this long. Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer halted this program for a week in order to play partisan political games resulting in extra unnecessary hardship and uncertainty for small business owners across the state and country. This cannot happen again. Congress will likely need to allocate additional funds to this program and make improvements based on feedback we have heard from small businesses and non-profits. I'm committed to putting the health and jobs of North Carolinians first, and we cannot allow partisan politics to get in the way of assisting the American people during this global crisis.""

According to the SBA, there have been 39,520 approved loans in North Carolina totaling $8.05 billion as of April 13, before funding for the program ran out.",2020-04-21,2020-W17
Republican,Deb Fischer,Fighting COVID-19 with Technology,"During this COVID-19 emergency, the way in which Americans have responded has been remarkable. I have seen so many stories of individuals, communities, and businesses reacting to this pandemic in new and creative ways, both in Nebraska and around the country. 

As we have had to distance ourselves physically to flatten the curve, digital technologies have been the lifelines that keep us connected. Much of this connectivity has been enabled by Internet of Things technology, which connects everyday devices and sensors to the internet.

These internet-connected devices can collect and communicate data to allow for real-time data analytics that boost productivity and quality of life across many different daily activities. Just a few examples of IoT are smart thermostats that help us manage home energy consumption, the tablets students use for their classwork, radar-enabled crash avoidance notifications in your car, and soil sensors that manage crop irrigation.

IoT technology has already seen widespread adoption, but it has the potential to connect our world even further in the future, with some reports estimating that 125 billion devices will be connected to the internet by 2030. IoT also has the potential to generate trillions of dollars in new economic activity around the world.

As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I have led a bipartisan effort to pass the Developing Innovation and Growing the Internet of Things (DIGIT) Act, along with Senators Cory Gardner, Brian Schatz, and Cory Booker. Our bill would bring private sector experts together with federal agencies to create a collaborative and enduring IoT policy.

Sound technology policies are essential to ensuring that all Americans can benefit from these innovations. By combining the expertise of governmental, academic, and industry stakeholders, the DIGIT Act will support a future in which we can all stay connected. 

IoT was already improving our lives in countless ways before this pandemic began, but it has played an even larger role in the past few months. For example, IoT technology has enabled health care providers to offer telehealth services, allowed educators to teach their students remotely, and helped business owners stay connected with their employees.

We have also seen businesses use IoT technology to fight this virus more directly. Many tech companies are partnering with health care officials to use IoT data to track the spread of COVID-19 and identify new hotspots. This has great potential to help us win the fight against COVID, but we need to ensure that our personal data is safe from misuse.

This concern about data privacy is why I joined several of my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee in introducing the COVID-19 Consumer Data Protection Act, a bill that would provide Nebraskans and all Americans with more information about how their private information is used. This bill would require companies to obtain consent from users before collecting data and to disclose how your data, like your current location, will be used. It also allows individuals to opt out of this collection process.

I am advocating for these policies because real-time access to the latest information and technologies is valuable, especially during a time of uncertainty like we are facing right now. COVID-19 won't last forever, but these forward-looking policies will help us get through it and prepare us for the future.

Thank you for participating in the democratic process. I look forward to visiting with you again next week.",2020-05-11,2020-W20
Republican,Susan M. Collins,Statement on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, trade with Canada and Mexico is vitally  important to Maine's economy, supporting numerous small businesses and  more than 53,000 jobs in our State. 

  In reviewing the text of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the  replacement for the deeply flawed NAFTA, my paramount concern was  ensuring that Maine workers will be protected. After careful assessment  of the benefits USMCA will have for those employed in Maine's  manufacturing industry, agriculture sector, and small businesses, I  will vote in support of the USMCA. 

  According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, USMCA is  projected to have a positive impact on all broad industry sectors,  increasing employment by 176,000 jobs and increasing real GDP by $68.2  billion. This agreement also makes important improvements to labor and  environmental standards and brings these issues into the core of the  agreement. This is a step in the right direction for modernizing trade  agreements. 

  Dana Connors, president & CEO of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce,  said:  

       Our border countries are important trade partners for Maine       businesses, in fact, trade with our friends to the north is       vital to many Maine businesses on a daily basis. The Maine       State Chamber of Commerce thanks Senator Collins for her       support of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).       The USMCA's passage is vital for Maine businesses, will       restore trade uncertainty and help our economy to continue to       thrive.  

  One out of five Maine manufacturing firms exports to Canada and  Mexico, and the majority of these are small- and medium-sized  companies. Without tariff-free trade, Maine's manufactured goods  exported to Canada and Mexico could face $6.3 million to $26 million in  additional tariffs, jeopardizing Maine jobs. Companies like New  Balance, which employs hundreds of Mainers at its facilities in  Norridgewock, Norway, and Skowhegan, and Texas Instruments in South  Portland, depend on a stable North American supply chain. 

  Amy Dow, director of public relations and government relations for  New Balance, said:  

       On behalf of our company's Maine associates, New Balance       supports the passage of the USMCA that will enable the       continued success and future growth of our three       manufacturing facilities in Maine. Senator Collins' support       and leadership on this trade agreement has been vital to       ensure that our factories can continue to produce thousands       of pairs of shoes annually for export to the Canadian market.  

  Stephen Bonner, Texas Instruments vice president for worldwide  government relations, said:  

       Texas Instruments is a long-time supporter of predictable,       open-market based trade policies. We're pleased that the new       USMCA includes strong digital trade and intellectual property       provisions to adapt the agreement to the 21st century       economy, and support its passage.  

  Our agricultural producers also rely on a stable and predictable  trading environment. U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico  more than quadrupled between 1993 and 2017. In Maine, I have heard from  producers in the dairy, potato, and wild blueberry industries who have  shared their support for free and fair trade agreements. 

  Maine has a special relationship with Canada in particular, given our  shared border. While there remain frictions with Canada, including  fishing rights, right whale regulations, and softwood lumber issues,  Canada is our largest trading partner and has consistently been our top  U.S. export market. As a native of Aroostook County, I know how many of  our border communities are truly intertwined, with people and goods  traveling back and forth daily. In 2019, Maine and Canada traded an  average of $350 million in goods per month. 

  Ambassador Robert Lighthizer deserves recognition for his tremendous  work on this agreement. It is impressive to see a trade agreement  receive such strong bipartisan support.                           Vote on Motion to Waive

Democrat,Christopher Murphy,"CNN ""State of the Union"" - Transcript:  Interview With Sen. Chris Murphy","BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT 

Senator Chris Murphy joins me next on President Trump's intelligence community crackdown and new claims about Russian interference in the 2020 election.

Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[09:17:18]

TAPPER: Welcome back to the STATE OF THE UNION. I'm Jake Tapper.

We learned this week that the U.S. intelligence community has warned lawmakers that Russia is already trying to interfere in the 2020 presidential race.

Senator Bernie Sanders confirmed a ""Washington Post"" report that he was briefed by officials that Russia is trying to aid his campaign in the primaries as part of Russia's overall disruption campaign, while President Trump and a top aide are now denying what an intelligence official told lawmakers in a briefing, that the Russians have a preference for President Trump.

A national security official tells me that the briefer may have overstated and mischaracterized the intelligence regarding Trump, which, as of now, does not suggest the Russians have a preference, though they do believe they can work with President Trump.

Joining me now, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut. He's a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Senator, thanks so much for being here.

I want to ask about something that National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien was asked about on a different show about Russia interfering in the 2020 election, specifically the Bernie Sanders elements of it. He said -- quote -- ""There are these reports that they want Bernie

Sanders to get elected president. That's no surprise. He honeymooned in Moscow"" -- unquote.

What's your response to that?

SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Well, our national security adviser should stay out of politics. And that is a political statement.

What we know is that the Russians never stopped interfering in American politics. They don't just get involved in elections. They are involved every single day.

And analysis of what they have been doing on Twitter since 2016 has been pretty clear. They are weighing in over and over again in support of right-wing causes, in support of Donald Trump's political agenda.

And, of course, it stands to reason that they want Donald Trump reelected, because he has been a gift to Russia. He has essentially ceded the Middle East to Russian interests. He has accomplished more in the undermining of NATO than Russia has in the last 20 years.

And he continues to effectively deny that they have an ongoing political operation here in the United States that, by and large, is intended to support Donald Trump and his allies.

TAPPER: So, the Trump people would push back. They would say that he has actually gotten NATO members to spend more on defense than previous presidents have been able to do, which is factually correct, that he is spending more on the U.S. military than previous presidents, which -- which is also correct, and, in fact, that all of this is hostile to what Russia would want.

MURPHY: So, what we know is that NATO is weaker today than ever before.

The fact that Donald Trump has questioned whether or not the United States would even come to the defense of a NATO ally in the future is an invitation to Russia to continue to probe at our borders.

And, of course, the entire impeachment scandal was over the Trump administration's weakening of Ukraine, taking that country and turning it into just another political actor in the United States, which is going to once again send a message to Russia that they can try to move on countries on their periphery without any real consequences from the United States.

[09:20:14]

TAPPER: Which they have not done, we should -- we should note.

I want to ask you, Sanders' campaign manager cited this quote from O'Brien that I read to you in a tweet. And he suggests in his tweet, the Sanders campaign manager, that the Trump administration leaked classified intelligence without context to weaponize against Bernie.

That's a very strong charge. Do you agree?

MURPHY: Well, I don't know how that information ultimately came out.

What I am worried about is the politicization of intelligence by this administration. The new acting head of intelligence has no background in intel. He is a Trump loyalist.

And I think we all worry about this administration controlling massive amounts of intelligence, massive amounts of classified information, and leaking it out to the press when it advantages them.

I have been very worried about the kind of information the Trump administration keeps classified. There have been multiple instances of the Trump administration keeping classified information that might be politically embarrassing to the president, but actually doesn't hold any true national security classified information.

So, the weaponization of classified information, I think, is something that we are more worried about, especially with this new acting director of intelligence.

TAPPER: What are you talking about when they say they're keeping information secret because it might be damaging? You talking about the John Bolton book? What do you -- what do you mean?

MURPHY: The John Bolton book certainly is an example of information that may not actually need to be classified, but it's simply embarrassing to the president.

The information regarding Mike Pence's meeting in -- regarding Ukraine that was kept classified during the impeachment proceedings involved no classified information. The only reason that that was classified was because it would have hurt the president's case during the impeachment trial.

TAPPER: I want to ask you about your recent meeting last weekend, I guess, with Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif in Munich.

President Trump said this week that he thought your meeting was illegal. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I saw that there's a -- Senator Murphy met with the Iranians. Is that a fact? I just saw that on the way over. Is there anything that I should know?

Because that sounds like, to me, a violation of the Logan Act.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: The Logan Act, as you know, but our viewers might not, is a law that bars unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.

Did you tell the president or the State Department you were going to meet with Zarif? And, if not, why not?

MURPHY: I did.

TAPPER: You did? OK.

MURPHY: I alerted the State Department ahead of time.

It is, of course, my job, as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and as the top Democrat on the Middle East Subcommittee, to meet with regional leaders, even our adversaries.

And the fact of the matter is, it's dangerous that this administration is not talking to the Iranians. The Trump policy on Iran has been a total disaster. Iran is more powerful today than they were at the beginning of the Trump presidency. They have restarted their nuclear program. They're shooting at U.S. troops. They're offering up more support for proxies.

I'm not negotiating with Iran, but it does make sense for somebody to be listening to them and to be engaged in some level of outreach, as perhaps a means of trying to avert crisis and disaster down the road.

TAPPER: We only have a couple minutes left, but I do want to ask you about the 2020 campaign.

One of the issues that you're known for the most is pushing for further regulation of firearms, guns. During the 2016 campaign, Senator Sanders was asked about whether the victims' families in the Sandy Hook Connecticut shooting should be able to sue gun manufacturers.

This is what he said:

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

SANDERS: Do I think the victims...

QUESTION: The right -- the right -- yes.

SANDERS: ... of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer? Is that your question?

QUESTION: Correct.

SANDERS: No, I don't.

I think there are grounds for those suits, but not if you sold me a legal product.

(END AUDIO CLIP)

TAPPER: You responded on Twitter, saying -- quote -- ""Bernie's a friend, but this is really bad. Democrats can't nominate a candidate who supports gun manufacturer immunity.""

Now, since then, he has changed his position. But do you still have concerns about Senator Sanders' position on guns?

MURPHY: None. None.

Senator Sanders has stood with us over and over again on expanding background checks, on taking these dangerous assault weapons off the streets.

To the extent that he had made statements in the past questioning whether or not victims' family should be able to sue manufacturers...

TAPPER: Not just statements. He voted against it.

MURPHY: ... he has changed that position.

He has been an ally. Every single candidate in this Democratic primary has taken a very strong position, has made it clear that they are going to make it a priority to solve this epidemic of gun violence if they get the nomination and if they're elected president.

TAPPER: Do you have any concerns about Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee in terms of his ability to beat President Trump in November or how much he might hurt down-ballot Democrats who are in more moderate districts?

MURPHY: I do not.

I think Bernie Sanders will beat Donald Trump. I think Joe Biden would beat Donald Trump. I think Elizabeth Warren would beat Donald Trump.

What we need is a candidate who has a base of enthusiastic supporters, who's authentic, who speaks truth to power, who can throw a punch and who can take a punch.

[09:25:02]

I think anybody that's polling in the top four or five fits that bill. But Bernie's base of support, the enthusiasm behind him I think speaks to the strength of his candidacy both in the primary, but as a general election candidate as well.

TAPPER: Are you -- that was very strong. I mean, are you endorsing him? Are you supporting him?

MURPHY: No, I'm not endorsing anyone.

I think that this primary is going to be a test of who is ready, who's tough enough to take on President Trump. Remember, only 5 percent of the country has voted yet.

I mean, I -- Bernie's done very well in the opening primaries, but this thing is not a done deal. Any of the candidates who are polling well in these early primaries, and Mayor Bloomberg, still has, I think, a very good shot at the nomination.

TAPPER: All right, Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, we appreciate your time. MURPHY: Thank you.

TAPPER: Thank you, sir.

Democrat,Maria Cantwell,"Letter to Eugene Scalia, Department of Labor Secretary - Cantwell Leads Washington State Lawmakers in Letter Calling for Support for Boeing Workers","Dear Secretary Scalia:

We are writing in support of the recently filed Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) petition to assist the 9,843 workers, including on-site contractors, at Boeing's commercial aircraft facilities throughout the Puget Sound and Moses Lake regions of Washington who have already been laid off or who will be by the end of July. These workers are being displaced, in part, due to trade pressures and international economic conditions.

Boeing is the largest private employer in Washington state, employing approximately 72,000 total employees who work at facilities across Washington. These workers contribute to their local economies and support approximately 64,000 additional direct and indirect jobs in the aerospace supply chain throughout the state. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that these workers receive the retraining and reemployment resources available through TAA certification. Such a certification will allow them to get back on their feet more quickly, support their families, and continue making critical contributions to their communities and our economy.

We urge you to review this TAA application in a timely manner, consistent with all applicable rules and regulations, to ensure that these trade-affected workers receive the assistance they need to obtain employment services and maintain their financial stability.

Thank you for your consideration on behalf of the workers at Boeing's facilities throughout the state of Washington.",2020-06-09,2020-W24

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:

1. The GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb-Increment I (SDB-I) all-      up-round (AUR) is a 250 lb bomb with a GPS-aided inertial       navigation system. It is a small, autonomous, day or night       and adverse weather, conventional, air-to-ground precision       glide weapon able to strike fixed and stationary re-locatable       non-hardened targets from standoff ranges. It is intended to       provide aircraft with an ability to carry a high number of       bombs because aircraft are able to carry four SDBs in place       of one 2,000-lb bomb.

2. The GBU-53 Small Diameter Bomb-Increment II (SDB-II) AUR       is a 250 lb air-to-ground munition with precision-guided and       semiautonomous capabilities used to defeat targets in adverse       weather. The SDB-II has deployable wings and fins and uses       Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System (GPS/      INS) guidance, network-enabled datalink (Link-16 and ultra       high frequency datalink), and a multi-mode seeker to       autonomously search, acquire, track, and defeat a variety of       moving or stationary targets at standoff range in a variety       of attack modes. The SDB-II employs a multi-effects warhead       (blast, fragmentation, and shaped-charge) for maximum       lethality against armored and soft targets. The SDB-II weapon       system consists of the tactical AUR weapon, a 4-place common       carriage system, and a mission planning system munitions       application program.

3. Joint Direct-Attack Munitions (JDAMs) consist of a bomb       body paired with a warhead-specific tail kit containing a       GPS/INS       guidance capability that converts unguided free-fall bombs       into accurate, adverse weather smart munitions. The JDAM       weapon can be delivered from modest standoff ranges at high       or low altitudes against a variety of land and surface       targets during the day or night. JDAMs can receive target       coordinates via preplanned mission data from the delivery       aircraft, by onboard aircraft sensors during captive carry,       or from a third-party source via manual or automated aircrew       cockpit entry.

a. The GBU-31 is a 2,000 lb JDAM, consisting of a KMU-556       tail kit and BLU-117 or MK-84 bomb body;

b. The GBU-32 is a 1,000 lb JDAM consisting of a KMU-559       tail kit and BLU-110 or MK-83 bomb body;

c. The GBU-38 is a 500 lb JDAM, consisting of a KMU-572       tail kit and BLU-111 or MK-82 bomb body.

4. The MK-82 general purpose (GP) bomb is a 500 lb, free-      fall, unguided, low-drag weapon. The MK-82 is designed for       soft, fragment-sensitive targets and is not intended for hard       targets or penetrations. The explosive filling is usually       tritonal, though other compositions have sometimes been used.

5. The MK-84 general purpose (GP) bomb is a 2,000 lb, free-      fall, unguided, low-drag weapon. The MK-84 is designed for       soft, fragment-sensitive targets and is not intended for hard       targets or penetrations. The explosive filling is usually       tritonal, though other compositions have sometimes been used.

6. The FMU-139 joint programmable fuze (JPF) is a multi-      delay, multi-arm, and proximity sensor compatible with       general purpose blast, frag, and hardened-target penetrator       weapons. The JPF settings are cockpit-selectable in flight.

7. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.

8. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.

9. A determination has been made that Japan can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.

10. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Japan.",2025-11-19,2025-W47
Republican,Joni Ernst,"Ernst: ""All Hands on Deck' to Address COVID-19","U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today continued to urge her fellow Americans to work together to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and to find ways to support folks in Iowa and across the country who have been adversely impacted.

Democrat,Richard J. Durbin,Duckworth Helps Announce Bill to Expand Health Care Workforce to Meet Nationwide Challenges,"Amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) helped U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL-09), a Senior Chief Deputy Whip, announce bicameral legislation to provide a historic investment in the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) and Nurse Corps programs to cover the graduate education costs of approximately 300,000 clinicians in order to help address existing health workforce shortages throughout our health care system.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed existing health workforce shortages, while simultaneously imposing unprecedented strains on America's heroic frontline health professionals.  A substantial barrier in meeting our nation's health workforce needs is the student debt associated with graduate health education--which can average more than $200,000.  COVID-19 has also magnified alarming racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes, which can be partially addressed by expanding the representation of minority populations working in health careers.

The legislation, Health Heroes 2020 Act, would address these challenges and entice promising students from diverse backgrounds--physicians, dentists, mental health professionals, nurses, and physician assistants--into primary health careers in underserved communities by providing historic new funding levels for scholarship and loan forgiveness options in exchange for a service commitment in an urban or rural area with a shortage of providers.  The legislation would also immediately surge $30 billion into the NHSC and Nurse Corps, further increase the annual funding level for NHSC by 300 percent, and create a new Reserve Corps to boost our health care surge capacity in response to public health emergencies. 

""Our health care professionals are doing heroic work on the front lines of our pandemic response.  But the current public health crisis has highlighted our need for a national policy that increases the number of health workers to address shortages, medical disparities, and respond to emergencies.  The Health Heroes 2020 Act is a tribute to the inspiring work of our health workforce and a commitment to our future by expanding the NHSC and Nurse Corps programs to provide a boost of more than 300,000 clinicians in underserved communities,"" Durbin said.  

""The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the need for more health care providers throughout many parts of our country.  We need to immediately reinforce those heroes who are working day and night to save lives.  Additionally, as we look beyond this crisis, we also have an opportunity to build the kind of world-class health infrastructure that meets the needs of all Americans in every community,"" said Schakowsky.  ""I am proud to introduce the Health Heroes 2020 Act with my friend and Senator, Dick Durbin.  Our plan will build a nationwide pipeline that will make it possible for students of every background to become the doctors and nurses we need without incurring huge debt.""

The United States is projected to face a shortage of up to 120,000 doctors over the next decade, and the need for an estimated 200,000 new nurses for each of the next several years.  Within these fields, there are significant shortages in both urban and rural communities as well as among specialties, including in primary care and behavioral health.  COVID-19 has upended this equation, with providers being called back into service from retirement and health professionals traveling across state lines to deliver care.  Coronavirus has also magnified alarming racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes, which can be partially addressed by expanding the representation of minority populations working in health careers.

Along with Durbin and Schakowsky, the bill is also cosponsored by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).

Specifically, the Health Heroes 2020 Act would expand the NHSC and Nurse Corps programs by:

Emergency Surge Funding to Restore Workforce Pipeline

Providing a one-time, supplemental appropriation of $25 billion for scholarship and loan forgiveness awards through the NHSC, and $5 billion through the Nurse Corps program;Includes a 40 percent set-aside for populations historically underrepresented in health care (racial/ethnic minorities and students from low-income urban/rural areas);Sustainable Growth to Meet Nation's Health Care Needs

Increasing the annual mandatory NHSC funding level from $310 million to $1 billion to increase scholarship and loan forgiveness awards to meet the nation's health needs;Creation of Reserve Corps for Surge Capacity

Establishing a NHSC Reserve Corps demonstration option to allow health professionals to serve for two years in ""reserve status"" for each qualifying year of scholarship.  Would permit such health professionals to work in the private practice setting of their choice, but:In the event of a health emergency/disaster would be called up to serve at the direction of HHS Secretary (alongside the Public Health Commissioned Corps or health departments);Require a monthly commitment, similar to the National Guard, to conduct preparedness training or deliver care to an underserved community; Allows currently practicing health care professionals--who did not participate in the NHSC program--to opt into this reserve status and obtain loan forgiveness;Expands emergency surge capacity by allowing NHSC members to serve in high-need areas during a public health emergency.This is the third proposal developed by a working group of Senate Democrats to address the urgent need to expand the public health and response workforce during and in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, which include Senator Chris Coons' (D-DE) Pandemic Response and Opportunity Through National Service Act and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand's (D-NY) and Michael Bennet's (D-CO) Health Force and Resiliency Force Act.",2020-04-24,2020-W17
Republican,Bill Cassidy,"Letter to the Hon. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States - Cheney Letter To Administration: Don't Let Banks Discriminate Against Energy Sector","Thank you for your fervent support of the United States energy sector. Since your election, you have pursued a policy of energy dominance. Whether coal, natural gas or oil, your aggressive action has supported tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, provided critical revenue to states and bolstered our national security and diplomatic strength. Unlike foreign producers who operate with little to no regulation, American energy is responsibly developed with the highest environmental standards in the world. According to the International Energy Agency, the United States achieved the largest reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of any country in 2019. Over the last three years, we have made substantial progress, which our constituents and the world have noticed. But it must not be taken for granted.

We write with critical concern as major American financial institutions continue unfairly to pick energy winners and losers in order to placate the environmental fringe. Admittedly, these banks and investors play a vital role to the entire U.S. economy. From Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance to much-needed stabilization during financial crises, Congress has consistently recognized the critical role they play and has provided support and benefits to America's large financial institutions. Even now, many of America's biggest financial institutions will likely benefit significantly from their participation in the federally backed Treasury, Small Business Administration, and Federal Reserve facilities programs in the CARES Act. Given these long-term, ongoing federal benefits that these financial institution reap from the federal government, we find it illogical and unacceptable that they openly discriminate against the American energy sector, which supports millions of good paying jobs throughout our country and was the critical sector of the U.S. economy that enabled our country to recover from its deep recession in 2009.

In an April 7th letter to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Powell regarding the implementation of the financial tools in the CARES Act, a group of Senators highlighted BlackRock's decision to forego investing in U.S. coal and screen other energy investments. This is despite the development of innovative carbon capture technology and the continued decline in emissions. Our coal fleet provides some of the most resilient fuel sources on the electric grid -- capable of onsite fuel storage, dispatchability, and operation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. Considering BlackRock's central role as a Federal Reserve fiduciary for the distribution of CARES Act credit facilities, its hostility towards the American energy sector is unacceptable and should be closely scrutinized. Similarly, multiple U.S. banks have pledged to withhold financial support for oil and gas development throughout the country from Alaska, Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, to Pennsylvania. Americans overwhelmingly support and rely on this legal enterprise to provide economic resources and an improved living standard for themselves. Considering the federal backing banks receive, their decision to discriminate against another critical sector of the economy smacks of hypocrisy and inadvertently promotes oil, gas, and coal development in countries abroad, like Russia, with lax and little environmental standards.

Modern American energy development goes to great lengths to minimize the environmental footprint by operating under the most stringent regulatory standards and substantial mitigation investments. Financial institutions usurping the responsibility of environmental regulators by making these unilateral determinations is not only alarming for Americans in our states, but for every American job supported by our energy sector. Unfortunately, many leaders in the Democratic party have gone a step further and actually advocated for a complete ban on fracking and responsible energy development on Federal lands. In fact, a recent tweet from a high- profile member of Congress actually celebrated the precipitous decline in American energy when thousands of workers are losing their jobs and livelihoods. Statements and proposals like these provide cover for the discriminatory tactics financial institutions are deploying against America's energy sector and the hard working families that support it. Scoring cheap political points at the expense of American energy workers is an affront to our economic success and must be confronted.

As every sector of our economy struggles to survive the COVID-19 pandemic and seeks financial stability from the federal government, environmental extremists are using the pandemic to accelerate their goal of putting America's energy jobs in the grave. We urge you and your Administration to use every administrative and regulatory tool at your disposal to prevent America's financial institutions from discriminating against America's energy sector while they simultaneously enjoy the benefits of federal government programs. Wall Street's big banks, for example, should not be able to reap the benefits of participating in federally guaranteed loan programs laid out in the CARES Act, such as the Paycheck Protection Program or the trillion dollar 13(3) Federal Reserve facility lending programs, while simultaneously targeting American energy companies and workers, which again will be critical to our nation's economic recovery and play such an important role in advancing our nation's economic and national security.

We again want to thank you and your Administration for your steadfast support for this critical industry and its workers and families.",2020-05-07,2020-W19
Democrat,Kirsten E. Gillibrand,"Letter to the Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Hon. Kevin McCarthy, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, the Hon. Mitch McConnell, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and Charles Schumer, Minority Leader of the Senate - Delgado, Gillibrand Urge Congress To Provide Direct Relief To New York's Rural Communities Struggling To Respond To COVID-19 Pandemic","We write to request help for rural communities that are suffering economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and are struggling to provide services for their citizens. In the best of times, our rural communities often operate on very thin margins, and in this time of unprecedented economic uncertainty they require direct assistance.

We were very pleased to see an additional investment in fiscal relief to states, tribes and localities included in the Interim Emergency COVID-19 Act proposed by Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer. As negotiations move forward on this proposal, we urge inclusion of robust rural funding and the consideration of direct payments to small towns and counties to provide  support and relief to communities of all sizes across the country. Too often, funding for small towns and counties is funneled through the State bureaucracy before ever reaching the municipal governments that need it.  Traditionally, rural communities must rely on competitive grant programs to receive funding, which puts a burden on small communities to apply for funding with no assurances of success when larger communities are guaranteed assistance through funding entitlements. In communities where duties at the county and local level are often shared, it is problematic to have our rural leaders competing against one another for pieces of an already small pie. As our localities work to provide direct response to the COVID-19 crisis, they need direct funding to meet the needs of their communities.

Communities are hemorrhaging funds as they continue to operate with diminished sales tax returns, an abandonment of the tourism industry and closures across nearly all retail sectors.  Without assistance, our rural communities will face a serious downturn unless we provide them with the tools to address the complex challenges they face. In October of 2019, we introduced the Rebuild Rural America Act which directly addresses the needs of our rural communities by providing a dedicated, noncompetitive block grant  to smaller cities and rural communities. The bill sets up a framework that we encourage you to adopt into your next COVID-related bill. This framework would give our rural communities the support and flexibility needed to ensure that rural residents have access to vital public safety, emergency management and temporary assistance.

As you grapple with the needs of the American people in this time of global crisis, we ask that the Administration and Congressional Leadership come together to pass the proposed increase in funding for states, tribes, and localities, and include funding mechanisms that provides direct federal dollars squarely into rural communities and counties. These local municipalities are often best equipped to provide the services necessary to ensure rural residents can rebuild and come out stronger and more resilient than ever before.",2020-04-16,2020-W16

Democrat,Edward J. Markey,Massachusetts Awarded $500K in Initial Federal Funding to Combat Coronavirus Outbreak,"United States Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) today announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has awarded $500,000 in initial funding to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to support efforts to address a potential outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This initial funding comes in advance of a Senate vote on a $7.8 billion appropriations package that would provide additional emergency funding to Massachusetts and other jurisdictions.

 ""The coronavirus outbreak is a public health emergency and requires an all-hands-on-deck response,"" said Senator Warren. ""While I am pleased that the federal government has awarded this much-needed funding to the Commonwealth, we must act quickly to provide communities with the resources they need to confront this potential pandemic and minimize the economic impact this crisis could have on our families. I'll keep fighting to make sure our federal government has an effective response to this crisis.""  

""Responding to the coronavirus emergency will take leadership and resources at the federal, state, and local level,"" said Senator Markey. ""This federal funding for Massachusetts communities will help them confront this growing threat and help address the harm it could have on their economies, and public health and safety. There is much more to be done to support our response to the coronavirus crisis, and I will continue to fight to protect our families and our communities.""

The funding awarded to Massachusetts is part of an initial $25 million cooperative agreement to the states and local jurisdictions who have borne the largest burden of response and preparedness activities to date. This initial award will provide assistance for activities such as monitoring of travelers, data management, lab equipment, supplies, staffing, shipping, infection control, and surge staffing.",2020-03-05,2020-W10

Democrat,Martin Heinrich,"Letter to Mark Esper, Secretary of Defense - NM Delegation Requests Department of Defense Use New Authority to Reimburse NM Communities Affected by PFAS, Purchase Land, and Provide Clean-Up Solutions, Water Filtration","Dear Mr. Secretary:

S.1710, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2019, as passed by Congress and signed by the President, includes strong new authorities for the Department of Defense and Air Force to finally address the dire situation in Eastern New Mexico near Cannon Air Force Base. Our constituents there have struggled with elevated levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) chemicals in water from military activities. The concentrations of PFAS detected in the groundwater below Cannon Air Force Base exceeded 26,000 parts per trillion (ppt) which is 371 times greater than the U.S. EPA drinking water health advisory level of 70 ppt.  Agricultural activities and dairy operations have been directly and negatively impacted.

For well over a year, the New Mexico delegation has pressed the leadership at the Department of Defense and the Air Force to provide clean water and filtration to our constituents who have seen elevated levels of PFAS in the water that supplies their local dairies. We have also encouraged the Department and Air Force to purchase land in proximity to the Air Force base that has been contaminated as a logical way to improve base security and streamline clean-up efforts.

PFAS chemicals were detected in milk produced by one of the dairies near Cannon Air Force Base, resulting in severe economic impacts there as its owner dumped thousands of gallons of milk in order to prevent human exposure. That dairy is on the verge of bankruptcy. The contaminant plume has affected the water supply for other dairies that have had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars out of their own pocket to install water filtration and provide monitoring for their livestock.  The Air Force is aware that the plume is on the move and without fast decisive action, there will be even worse impacts for the local dairies and residents.

The Air Force is responsible for PFAS contamination in the water at several bases across the country and have been supplying drinking water and filtration to many affected communities. But leadership at the Department of Defense and the Air Force have not pursued similar actions in New Mexico, arguing that the authorities to do so did not exist. With the passage of S.1710 and the complete language of our legislation providing these authorities, we can move past these concerns and bring needed attention to this situation.

These dairies have been very good neighbors to the Air Force. They have previously sold their air rights to the base and have lived in harmony with the base for many years. But this past year, the contamination has been devastating and left them with no options to move forward. Due to the PFAS contamination, the commercial land value for all the neighboring dairies is next to nothing and the owners are struggling to make ends meet.

There is now an opportunity for leadership at the Department of Defense and the Air Force to not only do the right thing to address the negative impact it has had, but also increase the force protection standoff near critical infrastructure and runways that would directly benefit Cannon Air Force base.

We would like to know how you plan to use the new authorities that have been enacted to address this situation as soon as possible.  Please let us know by January 23rd what next steps you will take to supply clean water, reimburse filtration expenses that were incurred, and purchase contaminated lands within proximity of the base for the purpose of implementing remediation.

Republican,Roger Marshall,Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025,"Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, before I start talking today, I just  want to pause for a moment to take a quick drink of the most  nutritious, delicious drink known to humankind. So here is to healthy  bones and here is to all the hard-working dairy farmers across Kansas  and across America.

This summer, the Senate Agriculture Committee worked together to pass  this legislation through the committee on a bipartisan basis. Special  thanks to our chairman and to our ranking member for working on this  with us.

This bill will allow for whole and reduced milk, as well as  nutritionally equivalent nondairy options, to be served in schools.  This corrects a decades-old policy made here in Congress that  consequently created over 10 years of kids without having access to  whole milk in schools and, indeed, created a whole generation of young  Americans with weak bones.

Passing the Whole Milk for Health Kids Act through the Senate is a  huge win for schools, for students, for parents, and for American dairy  farmers. We are giving students more choices, schools more flexibility,  and ensuring a brighter future for our farmers.

Whole milk delivers 13 essential nutrients and has enough fat content  to help students absorb vitamins like A, D, E, and K. It is also packed  with protein that helps keep the student full all the way through those  long afternoon math classes and then on through gym and on through  their sports activities, until they get home at night for dinner.  Simply put, it is one of the healthiest--it is the healthiest--option  in the cafeteria.

Bringing whole milk and nutritionally equivalent beverages to schools  would help fight early onset osteoporosis, osteopenia, and other diet- related diseases by providing students with critical nutrients-- nutrients like calcium, potassium, and vitamin D--that we are all  lacking today.

It strengthens bones. It helps your immune system. It builds healthy  habits, and it tastes great.

As the grandson of a dairy farmer, as an OB-GYN for over 30 years, it  may seem like I am a bit biased, but I assure you this legislation is a  slam-dunk solution for our Nation.

Of course, there is always room to improve our public health, and I  look forward to working with our colleagues who, I understand, also  have a few thoughts on this legislation.

Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, before we wrap up this Whole Milk for  Healthy Kids Act, I just want to go back over a couple things as well.  Senator Welch, it is always a pleasure to work with you. Whether we are  trying to connect high-speed internet or give milk to schools, it is  always a joy. I appreciate your hard work and greatly appreciate your  staff and my staff as well. I think our staff never gets enough credit.  They did all the heavy lifting--the chairman and ranking member, of  course, and their staff, and the Ag Committee's staff as well.

Senator Alsobrooks, thank you so much for coming down this morning  and educating me on this disability issue as well. And I see the  Senator from New Mexico Mr. Lujan is here as well and is also engaged  in this effort, and we appreciate his support and many, many, many  others.

So a big thanks. This has been a multiyear process for my staff, a  personal goal. I was raised on whole milk. I didn't know there was  anything except whole milk, and I always wondered why all of a sudden  our youth weren't drinking any milk.

And just many of us prefer the taste of it, and guess what,  nutritionally, I think it has some really great qualities as well.

Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 111, S. 222.",2025-11-20,2025-W47
Democrat,Brian Schatz,Impeachment,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, the American experiment was a radical one.  It imagined equal justice under the law. It imagined equal protection  under the law. It imagined a cumbersome system in which tyranny could  be avoided by the constant struggle between elected and appointed  leaders, and it intentionally sacrificed speed, efficiency, and  convenience to avoid the abuse of power. And so it is with unending  regret that I see what is happening. 

  I grieve for the Senate, an institution both hallowed and flawed, an  elite place in the worst sense of the word, and yet still the main  place where American problems are to be solved. To paraphrase Winston  Churchill, the Senate is the worst legislative body, except for all of  the others. 

  There are millions of Americans who have formed a basic expectation  about how a trial is to function based on hundreds of years of law and  based on their common sense. Make no mistake--what the Senate did was  an affront to the basic idea of a trial. And for all of the crocodile  tears of my colleagues, all of the fake outrage at the accusation, we  must call this what it was--it is a coverup. 

  I don't know what Mulvaney or Bolton or Pompeo would say. I don't  know what the documents would illuminate. And I believe it is normally  very dangerous to ascribe motives to fellow Senators when criticizing  their vote. But it is impossible for me to escape the conclusion that  they don't want to know; that they wanted to get this over with before  the Super Bowl, of all things. They are afraid of this house of cards  falling all the way down. 

  As I look at the Republican side of the Chamber, I know this moment  in history has made their particular jobs extraordinarily difficult,  requiring uncommon courage. They have to risk the scorn of their  voters, their social circle, their colleagues, and their President in  order to do the right thing. 

  On one level, I knew the likely outcome, but the bitter taste of  injustice lingers in my mouth. 

  On behalf of everyone who couldn't get away with an unpaid traffic  fine, is in jail for stealing groceries so they could eat that night,  who can't get a job because of medical debt, I say shame on anyone who  places this President or any President above the law. The President is  not above the law. No one is above the law. The President is guilty on  both counts. 

  The Constitution gives extraordinary powers to the President under  article II, and that makes sense because without a powerful magistrate,  the government can't function. But in granting these powers, the  Framers thought carefully about how to constrain them, and they decided  that a President could be controlled to greater or lesser degrees by  the legislature, by the judiciary, and by the voters. But the Framers  couldn't contemplate this level of polarization where, even in the face  of the overwhelming evidence of high crimes, one party would not just  exonerate him for it but, in fact, ratify these crimes. They didn't  imagine that one party would be so uniformly loyal to its President  that it could maintain a hammerlock on the Senate, preventing the  prospect of 67 votes from ever being available for removal. 

  I don't think we are in danger of the impeachment process becoming  routine; I think we are in much greater danger of making the  impeachment process moot. And if so, God help us all. 

  But all is not lost. We remain a government of, by, and for the  people. If people across the country find this as odious to our basic  values as we do, in 8 months the American public can render their own  verdict on the Senate.

Democrat,Chris Van Hollen,"Cardin, Van Hollen, Democratic Senators Lead Effort to Ensure Maximum Financial Assistance for Those Enrolled in ACA Exchange Plans","U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen (Both D-Md.), Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.), have introduced legislation that would enable individuals collecting enhanced federal unemployment compensation to receive maximum financial assistance when enrolled in Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plans. The bill also temporarily eliminates the repayment burden of excess advance premium tax credits. For those eligible for advance premium tax credits or cost-sharing reductions for ACA marketplace plans, the $600 weekly bump in federal unemployment benefits could result in reduced financial assistance for their health insurance during the current COVID-19 pandemic when affordable, quality health insurance is essential. In addition, due to the uncertainty of employment during this public health emergency, eliminating the repayment burden of excess advance premium tax credits will help unemployed consumers manage what they may owe in the 2021 and 2022 tax seasons if they end up with a higher annual income than they had expected.

The CARES Act included a $600 weekly add-on in federal unemployment compensation. This $600/week in unemployment compensation is not included in monthly income when determining an individual's Medicaid and CHIP eligibility. However, it currently counts towards a consumer's annual income when determining financial assistance (premium tax credit or cost-sharing reductions) for ACA marketplace plans. Exempting the $600/week federal UI payment from annual income will increase the amount of financial assistance unemployed consumers will qualify for, thereby lowering a consumer's monthly health insurance premium or out-of-pocket costs. The legislation also protects those who may, for the first time, qualify for financial assistance for ACA marketplace plans due to the $600 weekly add-on.

""Congress is providing unemployed Americans an extra boost during this pandemic to help them get by during a public health emergency. It should not be an impediment to getting the quality health coverage they need in the midst of a pandemic,"" said Senator Cardin. ""To be fair, the $600 unemployment supplement should be exempt from income determinations in all categories of federal or state assistance.""

""As families struggle to put food on the table and pay their bills, no American should have to worry about their temporary unemployment benefits driving up the costs of their health care. This bill will help ensure Americans get the assistance they need, without unintended consequences,"" said Senator Van Hollen. 

""This legislation is a commonsense solution to ensure that Granite Staters and Americans across the country can access expanded unemployment benefits without having to lose financial assistance for the cost of health insurance premiums,"" said Senator Shaheen. ""As we navigate this crisis, we need to make changes to the law wherever possible to help families weather this storm in the weeks and months ahead.""

""Access to affordable and comprehensive health insurance is absolutely essential during this public health crisis. The last thing families should be worried about when collecting unemployment insurance is the possibility of losing their health coverage or not having access to it during a pandemic,"" said Senator Bennet. ""This legislation will provide certainty to families and Colorado's state marketplace so that every American can see their doctor or health provider when they need it.""

""People who are already worried about making ends meet without a job during this pandemic should not have to worry about affording health insurance,"" Senator Brown said. ""Now more than ever we need to remove barriers to quality and affordable healthcare and ensure that families enrolled in exchange plans have the financial assistance they need.""

""We've expanded unemployment insurance to help our workers during  this crisis, but we cannot have that additional assistance hurt the people we're trying to help, or deprive Americans of needed health care coverage,"" said Senator Markey. ""This legislation will ensure that struggling, unemployed workers don't have to worry about coverage for their physical health as they work to improve their financial wellbeing.""

In Maryland, those individuals earning $39,000-$40,000 before unemployment will be the most impacted. They miss qualifying for Maryland Medicaid because the state monthly unemployment income for these individuals will be $1,500- $1,538. The monthly income limit for Maryland Medicaid eligibility is $1,470.",2020-05-12,2020-W20
Democrat,Richard J. Durbin,Durbin Statement On Senate Passage Of Iran War Powers Resolution,"U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Vice Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, today released the following statement after the Senate voted to pass a war powers resolution, introduced by Durbin and Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) last month, to prevent a war with Iran without congressional approval.  In January, the House passed a similar war powers resolution 224 to 194.  It will now go to the President's desk for his signature or veto.

""Today, the Senate finally found its bipartisan voice and asserted its Constitutional authority to decide whether to declare war.  I was proud to join Senator Kaine in introducing this measure and urge the President to sign this resolution without delay."" 

The resolution underscores that Congress has the sole power to declare war, as laid out in the Constitution.  The resolution requires that any hostilities with Iran must be explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force, but does not prevent the United States from defending itself from imminent attack.  The resolution will force a public debate and vote in Congress as intended by the framers of the Constitution to determine whether United States forces should be engaged in these hostilities.

In June, Durbin voted for a bipartisan measure to prohibit funds from being used for military operations against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress.  He was also a cosponsor of this measure.

In 2015, Durbin led the effort in the Senate that ultimately allowed the Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), to proceed, securing enough votes to block an effort to derail it.",2020-02-13,2020-W07
Republican,John Kennedy,"Sen. Kennedy Praises Secretary Perdue, USDA for Helping Food Get to New Orleans Food Banks","Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) praised the United States Department of Agriculture and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue for cutting through bureaucratic tape in order to make 4 million pounds of food available to food banks in New Orleans.

""Louisiana residents have Secretary Perdue and his team to thank for filling up our food banks, especially in areas hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic. As we tackle the economic challenges that come with the coronavirus, we have to work on multiple fronts to make sure Louisiana families have food on their tables. I'm grateful to have Sonny Perdue as an ally in this battle,"" said Kennedy.

Kennedy spoke with Perdue by phone on Friday to request the food banks be granted flexibility to deliver food to people whose health or livelihoods have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The food for these programs comes with certain restrictions concerning who is eligible to access it. Perdue granted Kennedy's request to allow food banks to better meet the local demand, which continues to increase in Louisiana.",2020-03-30,2020-W14
Democrat,Patty Murray,PAID Leave Act: Senator Murray to Introduce Updated Emergency Paid Leave; Small Business Support Bill In Response to Worsening Coronavirus Crisis,"Today U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), the top Democrat on the Senate health and labor committee, Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) Chairwoman of the House Labor Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Senate lead on the FAMILY Act, announced plans to introduce the PAID Leave Act (Providing Americans Insured Days of Leave Act). The PAID Leave Act is a comprehensive emergency paid sick days and paid family and medical leave bill--fully funded by the federal government during this emergency--to provide additional support to workers and businesses during the coronavirus outbreak and future public health emergencies.

""I'm hearing from workers who urgently need to have the ability to stay home without losing a pay check or their job, and I'm hearing from businesses in Washington state and nationwide who care deeply about seeing their employees through these hard times but just don't have the cash flow,"" said Senator Murray. ""Our legislation will ensure all workers have paid sick leave while protecting small businesses that are suddenly finding themselves struggling. This is good for workers, businesses, and critically, it will help slow the spread of the coronavirus. We should get it to the President's desk as quickly as possible.""

Because small businesses across the country continue to feel the effects of the public health crisis, the bill will fully and quickly reimburse employers for all paid sick days and paid leave in 2020 and 2021. In order to ensure that business do no need to wait for tax credits, the bill will only require employers to provide documentation to the Department of Labor (DOL) to demonstrate they paid out sick days or leave in order to receive reimbursement. After 2021, the bill would allow workers to accrue seven paid sick days and establish a self-sustaining family and medical leave insurance program for all workers.

For all employees and independent contractors, this bill would:

Provide 14 emergency paid sick days in the event of a public health emergency, including the current coronavirus crisis, reimbursed in full by the federal government.Provide workers with 12 weeks emergency paid family and medical leave, fully reimbursed by the federal government.Permanently ensure workers can accrue 7 paid sick days.Permanently enact a paid family and medical leave program (Senator Gillibrand's and Representative DeLauro's FAMILY Act).The bill is being endorsed by: National Partnership for Women and Families, CLASP, Family Values at Work, Paid Leave for All, Center for American Progress, American Federation of Teachers.",2020-03-17,2020-W12
Republican,John Barrasso,Johnson Continues Push for Delist Gray Wolf Amendment,"U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) introduced a bipartisan amendment Wednesday that would delist the gray wolf in the Western Great Lakes region, including Wisconsin, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The amendment would restore the gray wolf to the status determined to be appropriate by Department of Interior wildlife experts in 2011, and allow the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to develop a wolf population management program. 

""Gray wolf listing decisions should come from wildlife experts. While Congress has failed to act, many northern Wisconsinites' problems with wolves have only gotten worse. This critical amendment would allow wolf management plans that are based on federal and state wildlife expertise to move forward without legal ambiguity,"" Senator Johnson said. ""This is the proper time and place for Congress to discuss this issue, so I hope there will be full consideration of my amendment. I will continue to support northern Wisconsin farmers, ranchers, hunters, and land owners who suffer the consequences of the growing wolf population.""

Sen. Johnson's amendment is cosponsored by Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.). Sen. Johnson has worked to remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list in the western Great Lakes region since 2015 when he introduced legislation with former Rep. Reid Ribble (WI-8) to address the issue.

The gray wolf maintains a stable and growing population with an expanding territory in Wisconsin.",2020-06-10,2020-W24
Republican,Todd Young,Young and Warner Resolution to Honor 75th Anniversary of Iwo Jima,"U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) today introduced a Joint Resolution to honor the 75th Anniversary of the Battle for Iwo Jima during World War II. The resolution recognizes the gallantry and heroism demonstrated 75 years ago during the victory that was led by the United States Marine Corps over Imperial Japan on the island of Iwo Jima. A companion resolution was introduced in House by U.S. Representatives Greg Pence (R-IN-06), Pete Visclosky (D-IN-01), and Ken Calvert (R-CA-42).

 

""Iwo Jima is hallowed ground for me, my fellow Marines, and all those who lost loved ones in the battle. This resolution helps to recognize those who gave their lives in Iwo Jima seventy-five years ago,"" said Senator Young. ""The resolution also calls upon Americans to honor these veterans and reaffirm the deep bonds of friendship between the United States and Japan that have developed over the seventy-five years since we were at war.""

 

""As we mark 75 years since the battle of Iwo Jima, I'm reminded of the many servicemen who sacrificed so much for our nation. Many of these individuals, including my father -- a Marine Corporal at Iwo Jima -- witnessed their fellow servicemen lose their lives in defense of our freedoms. This resolution is a tribute to the resilience of the Greatest Generation and the courage of those who fought in the 36-day battle,"" said Senator Warner.

 

""As a Beirut Veteran, I understand that our first duty is to remember. The 75th anniversary of the Battle for Iwo Jima is a time to remember and honor the relentless courage of our men and women in uniform. Our Marines took Iwo Jima at a heavy cost, but their bravery made possible the Allied Victory in World War II. It is one of the deadliest days in Marine Corps history, and those heroes will never be forgotten,"" said Congressman Pence. ""I had the solemn experience of going to Iwo Jima when I was deployed as a Marine. I am honored to return this year with the Commandant of the Marine Corps to remember the nearly 7,000 Marines who made the ultimate sacrifice at the Battle for Iwo Jima.""

Lest they let the country forget about their disgraceful acts just weeks ago, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats are once again holding help hostage and exploiting the COVID--19 pandemic to advance House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's extreme, left-wing ""vision.'

It's time for Senate Democrats to stop pandering to the far left and step up to the plate to get the job done.""

The Paycheck Protection Program was created as part of the Phase Three COVID--19 relief package known as the CARES Act. It offers small businesses forgivable loans to continue paying employee-related expenses in order to retain those workers during the pandemic.

Republican,John Thune,"Shelby, Thune, Wicker unveil liquidity assistance for distressed American industries within comprehensive coronavirus package","Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), and Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) today released ""The Coronavirus Economic Stabilization Act of 2020"" as part of the broader Senate economic response package.  The legislation allows the Treasury Secretary to provide up to $208 billion in collateralized loans and loan guarantees to American industries whose operations are jeopardized as a direct result of the coronavirus outbreak.  Of the $208 billion, $58 billion is allocated to facilitate liquidity in the airline sector, and an additional $150 billion is provided for the same purposes in other distressed sectors of the American economy.  The legislation does not provide grants to or bailouts for the airlines or other industries.

""American businesses didn't cause this crisis, and aggressive action is warranted to ensure they have the liquidity necessary to weather its direct impacts.  But let's be crystal clear about what we are and are not doing here.  We are not bailing out the airlines or other industries -- period.  Instead, we are allowing the Treasury Secretary to make or guarantee collateralized loans to industries whose operations the coronavirus outbreak has jeopardized.  In my judgment, this approach strikes an appropriate balance between providing assistance and protecting taxpayers,"" stated Chairman Shelby.

""These are extraordinary times that require swift and bold action from the federal government,"" said Majority Whip Thune. ""The legislative proposals we're announcing today, while not a silver bullet, rise to the occasion. They provide critical tools to industries throughout the country that help support the entire U.S. economy and have been pummeled by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, at no fault of their own. I look forward to supporting these and other measures that will continue to support American families and small businesses, strengthen our economy, and give our nation's health care community the tools it needs in this fight.""

""The global coronavirus pandemic requires strong and decisive action from the federal government,"" Chairman Wicker said.  ""During this time of unprecedented economic uncertainty, it is critical that air carriers and other impacted industries have the resources they need to continue operations.  This recovery package would support the hard-hit workers and businesses who bear no responsibility for this crisis.""

Summary of The Coronavirus Economic Stabilization Act of 2020 

-The legislation provides a total of $208 billion to the Secretary of the Treasury, through the Exchange Stabilization Fund, to provide sufficiently collateralized loans and loan guarantees to eligible entities, broken out in the following amounts:   -Up to $50 billion for passenger air carriers;   -Up to $8 billion for cargo air carriers; and   -Up to $150 billion for other eligible entities.-The Treasury Secretary is afforded flexibility to provide collateralized loans and loan guarantees to domestic entities ""that have incurred losses as a direct result of the coronavirus global pandemic"" so they can maintain operations. -Entities eligible for loans or loan guarantees are those for whom credit is not otherwise reasonably available at the time of the transaction. -An entity is only eligible for relief if the Treasury Secretary determines its continued operations are jeopardized as a result of losses stemming directly from the coronavirus outbreak.  -Interest rates on any loans extended by the Treasury Secretary may be no less than the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturity.-The legislation explicitly bars the Treasury Secretary from using the funds provided to make grants or direct cash payments to entities: ""Nothing in this Act shall be construed to allow the President or [Treasury] Secretary to provide relief to eligible entities except in the form of sufficiently collateralized loans and loan guarantees.""-The legislation also mandates that entities receiving assistance under the Act do not increase compensation for, or provide golden parachutes to, executives over a two-year period from the date of enactment.-The legislation directs the Secretary of the Treasury, to the extent feasible and practicable, to ensure that the Government is compensated for the risk assumed in making loans and loan guarantees.  To that end, ""the [Treasury] Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts under which the Government, contingent on the financial success of the eligible entity, would participate in the gains of the eligible entity or its security holders through the use of such instruments as warrants, stock options, common or preferred stock, or other appropriate equity instruments.""",2020-03-19,2020-W12

Democrat,Amy Klobuchar,"Letter to the Hon. Mike Pompeo, Secretary of the U.S. Dept. of State - As Impeachment Focuses on Yovanovitch's Ouster, 22 Democrats Demand Pompeo Explain Steps to Protect U.S. Diplomats","Secretary Pompeo:

We write with grave concern regarding recent allegations that the security of a sitting U.S. Ambassador may have been at risk. Text messages provided to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence reveal that Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch may have been under surveillance by hostile agents, possibly by the direction of U.S. persons while she served at her post in Kyiv. If true, this raises serious questions for the Embassy's overall security posture and the Department's efforts to monitor and respond to threats against U.S. diplomats and other personnel. These allegations also follow a disturbing and cavalier lack of seriousness regarding the protection of our diplomats at the Department under your leadership. 

According to these text messages, a U.S. person, Robert Hyde, was allegedly tracking or being kept apprised of Ambassador Yovanovitch's movements, and apparently had knowledge about her security detail and use of electronic communications. Mr. Hyde kept Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani, informed of these alleged efforts. Around the same time, Mr. Giuliani was in direct communication with you, and provided the Department with a file that included false and misleading information about Ambassador Yovanovitch.

Notably, this is not the first time concerns about Ambassador Yovanovitch's safety have been raised. As Ambassador Yovanovitch herself testified before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, on April 24, 2019, she received a call from Carol Perez, the Director General of the Foreign Service telling her to return promptly to Washington. During the call Director Perez told the Ambassador that she was being recalled because ""we're worried about your security.""[1]

Moreover, these revelations come on the heels of your steadfast refusal, over several months, to issue any statement of support for Ambassador Yovanovitch, or any of the career professionals working for the Department, even as they face attacks. Ambassador Yovanovitch has dedicated more than three decades of her life in service to our nation. A three-time Ambassador, she has demonstrated stellar leadership throughout her entire career advancing U.S. policy goals, and the American people have benefited from her many years of selfless service. Your repeated silence in the face of threats and disinformation aimed at Ambassador Yovanovitch, and other career officials, is inexplicable.

As the nation's chief diplomat, you are charged with ensuring the protection of American citizens, property, and interests in foreign countries--and in particular, the safety and security of those you lead: our nation's diplomats and officials overseas. The revelation that Ambassador Yovanovitch may have been under close surveillance, including potentially by a U.S. individual, demands immediate action. We therefore request details about what steps the Department is taking to investigate and determine the veracity of these allegations, particularly as Ukrainian officials have opened up their own investigation into these allegations. To that end, we request an immediate and complete accounting of these troubling allegations, including:

1. Whether the Department has verified the veracity of the texts indicating that Ambassador Yovanovitch's movements and electronic communications were being monitored; 

2. Whether at any point, the Ambassador's security was compromised, and what steps the U.S. Government took in response;

3. A full assessment of any vulnerabilities at Embassy Kyiv;

4. A full accounting by you and all relevant officials about what you, Diplomatic Security, the Department, and the U.S. Government knew about the security concerns and surveillance of Ambassador Yovanovitch, including when you first learned of these concerns;

5. Whether security concerns played any role in the Ambassador's premature departure from post, and if so, the nature of those concerns;

6. Whether the Embassy's Regional Security Office or other responsible offices received reports from Ukrainian security or intelligence services about threats to Ambassador Yovanovitch's security, and what steps were taken in response;

7. The intelligence behind and basis for Director Perez's statement to Ambassador Yovanovitch that there were concerns about her ""security"";

8. Whether you are cooperating with Ukrainian authorities in their investigation; and

9. Separate and distinct from the Hyde allegations, whether you are aware of any other threats to the security of Ambassador Yovanovitch during her time in Kyiv or since.",2020-01-29,2020-W05

       *As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             policy justification      Egypt--AH-64E Refurbished Apache Attack Helicopters and Related                           Eguipment and Support  

       The Government of Egypt has requested to buy equipment to       refurbish forty-three (43) AH-64E Apache attack helicopters.       This includes: eighty-eight (88) T700-GE-701D engines (86       remanufactured, 2 spares); forty-seven (47) AN/ASQ-170       Modernized Target Acquisition and Designation Sight/AN/AAR-11       Modernized Pilot Night Vision Sensors (MTADS/PNVS) (43       remanufactured, 2 new, 2 spares); forty-five (45) AAR-57       Common Missile Warning Systems (CMWS) (43 new, 2 spares); and       ninety-two (92) Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial       Navigation Systems (EGI) (86 new, 6 spares). Also included       are AN/AVR-2B Laser Detecting Sets, AN/APX-119 transponders,       Identify Friend or Foe (IFF), AN/APN-209 radar altimeters,       AN/ARN-149 Automatic Direction Finders, UHF/VHF radio,       tactical AN/ARC-201E radio, APR-39 Radar Warning Sets,       Improved Data Modems IDM-401, Enhanced Image Intensifiers       EI2, Hellfire launchers M299, 2.75 inch 19 tube rocket       launchers, M230 automatic guns, M230 spare gun barrels, MT06       initiators, cartridge actuated JAU-59, training devices,       helmets, simulators, generators, transportation, wheeled       vehicles and organization equipment, spare and repair parts,       support equipment, tools and test equipment, technical data       and publications, personnel training and training equipment,       U.S. government and contractor engineering, technical, and       logistics support services, and other related elements of       logistics support. The estimated total cost is $2.3 billion. 

       This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a friendly country that continues to be an       important strategic partner in the Middle East. 

       Egypt intends to use these refurbished AH-64 helicopters to       modernize its armed forces to address the shared U.S.-      Egyptian interest in countering terrorist activities       emanating from the Sinai Peninsula, which threaten Egyptian       and Israeli security and undermine regional stability. This       sale will contribute to Egypt's military goal to update its       capability while further enhancing greater interoperability       between Egypt, the U.S., and other allies. Egypt will have no       difficulty sustaining these refurbished aircraft. 

       The proposed sale will not alter the basic military balance       in the region. 

       The principal contractors involved in this program are the       Boeing Company, Meza, AZ, and Lockheed Martin Corporation,       Orlando, FL. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale. 

       Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Egypt. 

       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-74       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii  

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 

       1. The highest classification of the AH-64 Apache Attack       Helicopter AH-64 Apache helicopter is CONFIDENTIAL and the       highest classification of data and information is SECRET. The       AH-64 Apache helicopter weapon system contains communications       and target identification equipment, navigation equipment,       aircraft survivability equipment, displays, and sensors. The       airframe itself does not contain sensitive technology;       however, the pertinent equipment listed below will be either       installed on the aircraft or included in the sale: 

       a. The AN/ASQ-170 Modernized Target Acquisition and       Designation Sight/AN/AAQ-11 Pilot Night Vision Sensor (MT       ADS/PNVS) provides day, night, and limited adverse weather       target information, as well as night navigation capabilities.       The PNVS provides thermal imaging that permits nap-of-the-      earth flight to, from, and within the battle area, while TADS       provides the co-pilot gunner with search, detection,       recognition, and designation by means of Direct View Optics       (DVO), EI(2) television, and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR)       sighting systems that may be used singularly or in       combinations. 

       b. The AAR-57 Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) detects       energy emitted by threat missiles in-flight, evaluates       potential false alarm emitters in the environment, declares       validity of threat and selects appropriate countermeasures.       The CMWS consists of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU),       Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMSs), and Sequencer and       Improved Countermeasures Dispenser (ICMD). 

       c. The AN/APR-39 Radar Signal Detecting Set is a system       that provides warnings of radar-directed air defense threats       and allows appropriate countermeasures. This is the 1553       databus-compatible configuration. 

       d. The AN/AVR-2B Laser Warning Set is a passive laser       warning system that receives,       processes, and displays threat information resulting from       aircraft illumination by lasers on the multi-functional       display. 

       e. The Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial       Navigation System plus Multi-Mode Receiver (EGI+MMR). The       aircraft has two EGIs which use internal accelerometers, rate       gyro measurements, and external sensor measurements to       estimate the aircraft state, provides aircraft flight and       position data to aircraft systems. The EGI is a velocity-      aided, strap down, ring laser gyro based inertial unit. The       EGI unit also houses a GPS receiver. 

       2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities. 

       3. A determination has been made that Egypt can provide       substantially the same degree of protection of this       technology as the U.S. Government. This proposed sale is       necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification. Moreover, the benefits to be derived from this       sale, as outlined in the Policy Justification, outweigh the       potential damage that could result if the sensitive       technology were revealed to unauthorized persons. 

       4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal has been authorized for release and export to       Egypt.

Democrat,Charles E. Schumer,"USA Today - Schumer, Young, Khanna, Gallagher - US needs bipartisan push for scientific research after coronavirus: Congressional leaders","By Sen. Chuck Schumer, Sen. Todd Young, Rep. Ro Khanna, and Rep. Mike Gallagher 

We must reposition the United States to lead the 21st Century with the greatest scientific and technological breakthroughs.

 

Today, researchers across the world are using all the scientific tools available in a global race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. But America is no longer the preeminent leader in scientific research as we were for the second half of the 20th Century. We must address this vulnerability.

 

Though we sit on opposite sides of the political aisle, recently we all came together to respond to this sudden, unprecedented health and economic crisis, approving the largest economic recovery package in American history.

 

This unifying moment brings clarity to a longstanding national vulnerability: our decades-long underinvestment in the infrastructure that would help prevent, respond to and recover from an emergency of this scale -- namely, scientific and technological discovery, and the ability to turn fundamental research into innovations we produce here at home.

 

In coming months, as we address this public health emergency, stabilize our economy and formulate a recovery plan, we must also reposition the United States to lead the 21st Century with the greatest scientific and technological breakthroughs. When America discovers a vaccine or develops a cost-effective ventilator, then we can manufacture and deploy such life-saving innovations here at home.

 

Conversely, America's dwindling investments in the tools and talent essential to modern research and development threatens our long-term health, economic and national security. We cannot allow our research capabilities to atrophy without undermining our global competitiveness and leaving our people vulnerable during a time of crisis.

 

So what are we proposing?

 

The Endless Frontiers Act proposes a renewed national investment in public research and development to strengthen our nation's innovation ecosystem now and into the future.

 

In the near-term, this means specific investments in the urgent research and production needed to confront COVID-19. This should involve dedicated investment for federal and university labs and technical facilities, paired with infrastructure investments like the broadband build out needed to tap the innovation potential of communities across America. This should also include investment in technical education. We must fund undergraduate scholarships, graduate fellowships, trainees and post-doctoral support in the targeted research areas.

 

Longer term, we should sustain our global leadership through investment on the frontiers of modern science and technology -- the types of investments that will soon help us overcome COVID-19. We also must continually improve our ability to rapidly move groundbreaking ideas from government laboratories to job-creating companies and, in turn, to the world's consumers. 

 

Finally, at a time of historically low interest rates, we should work to pair federal investments in research and development with public- and private-partner investments in scientific and technical moonshots.

 

Even as we continue to fight the coronavirus, our country must prepare to confront the next generation of global threats and seize opportunities that lie over the horizon. We must also remain mindful that, as our nation recovers, China gains ground. Beijing""s authoritarian leaders aim to capitalize on this moment with an eye toward outpacing the United States by investing in technological innovations essential to Americans' future safety and prosperity.

 

The private sector efficiently funds research and development of goods and services that meet the demands of individual consumers. But many of the technologies that will collectively benefit our citizens over the long term require bold public investments in fundamental research.

 

In the decades after World War II, America's leaders wisely anticipated the benefits of such investments. By 1965, we invested 1.8% of GDP to rapidly advance the frontiers of knowledge. The returns were spectacular. In fact, the engines fueling our modern economy trace their roots to such investments, from aerospace to modern computing, from the internet to life-saving pharmaceuticals. Even our now-ubiquitous smartphones were spawned by public investment before the private sector brought them to consumers.

 

In the weeks ahead, America will need to support those impacted by this pandemic and the private businesses that sustain our way of life. But, as we prepare for the post-COVID-19 future, we should draw inspiration from the past. Our own history proves that smart, targeted and substantial public investments in the infrastructure and talent necessary to produce cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs will result in higher rates of economic growth, sustained job creation and greater wealth creation.

 

Today we know that every dollar invested in the National Institutes of Health leads to $3 in increased stock market valuation for private companies. And studies show that raising public research and development spending by $100 billion per year on a permanent basis could help generate as much as 4 million new American jobs.

 

Unfortunately, our appreciation for the benefits of such investments has waned. Federal R&D spending has fallen to a mere 0.6% of GDP. Whereas America once led the world in the share of our economy invested in R&D, we now rank 12th globally. If we fail to change course, China will invest more than the United States in just 10 years.

 

America is enduring a national stress test. Our people are up to the challenge, but our gradual retreat from global scientific leadership has been laid bare. America's pharmaceutical scientists are working tirelessly to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, but smarter, bolder investments in recent decades might have better prepared us for this moment.

 

Similarly, many of our teachers and other workers have resiliently adapted to shelter in place orders. But strains on America's broadband network to support the surge in online demand for remote work and distance learning have surpassed the capacity of private carriers. Now is the time to change course.

 

In the face of adversity, Americans are resilient. We adapt, improvise, overcome. We are a nation of problem solvers, freelancers and innovators. In 2020, as we face one of the most powerful enemies humankind has ever faced -- and we steel ourselves against the next threat to our way of life -- we should harness this creative power. We should make a down payment on science and technology today by passing The Endless Frontiers Act.",2020-05-14,2020-W20
Republican,Mike Lee,Sen. Lee Outlines Corona Response Priorities,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Thursday as he continued to work with Senate colleagues on an economic response to the Coronavirus.

""If there is any state that is best prepared for the one-two punch of a global pandemic and a generational earthquake, it is Utah. We will rise to this occasion. We will beat this virus. And we will rebuild from the damage from the earthquake that hit us Wednesday.""

""All of us can do our own part to help our community through these times. For some, that means staying at home, practicing responsible social distancing. For others it means being on the front lines providing medical care and tests to those affected by the virus. And for some it means cleaning up, assessing, and rebuilding our infrastructure as we recover from the earthquake.""

""Here in Washington I am working with my colleagues to make sure the federal government's response helps all Utahns who need it. That means fighting for broad-based action to help all Americans through the social and economic disruptions this emergency is creating.

""Americans are all in this epidemic together. So the federal response -- from loan guarantees to tax reforms to regulatory relief to direct aid to families -- should be as inclusive as possible, rather than carved out only for select special interests.""",2020-03-19,2020-W12
Democrat,Chris Van Hollen,"Letter to Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State - Young, Van Hollen, Leahy Urge Pompeo to Immediately Sanction Turkey Over the Wrongful Detention of Locally Employed Staff of U.S. Diplomatic Missions","Dear Secretary Pompeo:

 

We urge you to impose sanctions immediately on the Turkish government officials responsible for the wrongful detention of locally employed staff at U.S. diplomatic missions in Turkey, as required by law.

 

The State Department recently provided a report to Congress on the status of Metin Topuz, Mete Canturk, and Hamza Ulucay -- three Turkish citizens who have served at U.S. missions in Turkey since the 1980's. The Department stated that the Turkish government has detained all of these individuals on ""unsubstantiated charges related to work they carried out in the course of their official duties on behalf of the U.S. government.""

 

Metin Topuz, detained in 2017, could face life in prison for dubious charges of ""attempting to overthrow the government."" Mete Canturk, arrested in 2018 and subject to a travel ban, faces spurious criminal charges of membership in the ""Fetullah Terrorist Organization."" Hamza Ulucay -- who spent two years in prison and is banned from leaving the country -- could face additional imprisonment under false allegations of terrorism. The Department reported that, in each of these cases, the charges against the individuals were ""specious and politically motivated.""

 

The Congress has mandated visa bans on foreign officials credibly involved, directly or indirectly, in the wrongful detention of locally employed staff of a U.S. diplomatic mission, specifically in Turkey. Section 7031(c) of division G of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, which applies to all foreign countries, states that ""[o]fficials of foreign governments and their immediate family members about whom the Secretary of State has credible information have been involved, directly or indirectly, ina gross violation of human rights shall be ineligible for entry into the United States."" The accompanying report, Senate Report 116-126, notes that the term ""gross violation of human rights"" shall include unjust or wrongful detention, and such report includes the following requirement:

 

""Prohibition on Entry.-- In addition, the Secretary shall apply [Section 7031(c)] to officials of the Governments of Turkey, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia about whom the Secretary has credible information have been involved in the wrongful detention of locally employed staff of a U.S. diplomatic mission or a U.S. citizen or national.""

 

The United States relies on the support of locally employed staff of U.S. diplomatic missions abroad. They form the backbone of our conduct of foreign affairs and are vital in ensuring the safety and security of our diplomats. The United States must send a strong, public signal to Turkey, and other countries, that it will not tolerate the abuse of foreign nationals serving the U.S. government. A failure to do so could severely hamper the recruitment and retention of locally employed staff. We therefore call on you to apply section 7031(c) immediately.

Democrat,Richard J. Durbin,Durbin Calls On Trump Administration To Prioritize Health & Safety Working Families In Coronavirus Response,"Amid the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), during a speech on the Senate floor, called on the Trump Administration to prioritize the health and safety of working families during the coronavirus outbreak, including paid sick leave, enhanced unemployment insurance, transportation, food security, educational plans, affordable treatment, and widespread and free coronavirus testing. 

Last week, Durbin, along with Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), helped introduce new, emergency paid sick leave legislation to provide paid sick days immediately to workers in light of the coronavirus crisis, and in preparation for future public health emergencies.  This emergency paid sick days legislation requires all employers to allow workers to accrue seven days of paid sick leave and to provide an additional 14 days available immediately in the event of any public health emergency, including the current coronavirus outbreak.

""As we look forward to the next steps to respond to this public health emergency, it is critical that Congress prioritize the health and safety of workers and their families.  Our public health experts are rightfully telling people to stay home if they are sick.  But, for many Americans, staying home means losing a paycheck that helps them afford rent, pay for food, medication, and child care,"" Durbin said.  ""I'm proud to have helped introduce legislation last week that would immediately provide 14 days of paid sick leave to workers in light of coronavirus.  It also is important that we ensure workers have access to unemployment insurance benefits during this uncertain time.""

Durbin continued, ""We passed a robust funding bill last week, but our work is not done -- there will be far-reaching impacts of this outbreak.  It is imperative that we look toward developing a comprehensive response that benefits everyone-- including America's working families and small businesses--not just large corporations.""

In his speech on the Senate floor, Durbin also highlighted the good work being done at Argonne National Laboratory to combat the coronavirus.  Argonne is helping to address the threat of coronavirus with its Advanced Photon Source.  Researchers are using this high-power X-ray to study the virus.  It was announced last week that a potential drug target has been identified for this coronavirus by a team including the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of California, Riverside.",2020-03-10,2020-W11
Independent,Bernard Sanders,"Chair Grijalva Joins Sanders, Velázquez, Colleagues in Unveiling Legislation to Provide Nutrition Assistance to Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa","Today, Natural Resources Committee Chair Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) joined Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) and Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez (D-N.Y.) introduced the Equitable Nutrition Assistance for the Territories Act of 2020 today to ensure that in the face of the economic, public-health, and food-security crises posed by the coronavirus pandemic, the people of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa receive equal access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 

The federal SNAP program is designed to respond to meet the needs of food-insecure Americans during times of high poverty, unemployment, and economic downturns, automatically expanding coverage. Under SNAP, everyone who is eligible receives benefits. The block grant that exists for these three territories' nutrition assistance means that no matter how many people face food insecurity, the amount of funding remains flat.

Puerto Rico is in especially dire need of increased food assistance funding due to a decades-long economic crisis, hundreds of recent earthquakes, and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has devastated certain parts of the island. Prior to the outbreak, one-third of adults experienced food insecurity. Since then, the island has seen an increase of over 10,000 new families applying for nutrition support. 

In the early 1980s, Congress removed Puerto Rico from what was then the Food Stamp Program and replaced it with a block grant. A family of four in Puerto Rico receives a maximum basic benefit of $410 per month compared to $649 for a family of four living in the continental United States. The Equitable Nutrition Assistance for the Territories Act of 2020 transitions Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa to SNAP benefits.

""The people of Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are American citizens and nationals with urgent needs and a legitimate claim to government aid,"" said Chair Grijalva. ""Congress needs to fix this inequity as quickly and comprehensively as possible, and I'm proud to join my colleagues in offering badly needed food assistance before more children go hungry.""

""Millions of families are struggling to put food on the table during this devastating pandemic. The people of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa deserve the same help from the federal government as any state--period,"" said Sen. Sanders. ""This bill would end unequal treatment of the territories, help Puerto Rico recover from the earthquakes, and aid some of the most vulnerable in our society during this time of global crisis. Right now, we are all in this together and we cannot tolerate American citizens going hungry, living on U.S. soil, being denied the support they are entitled to.""

""Puerto Ricans are American citizens who fight and die in our wars,"" said Rep. Velázquez. ""It is shameful and unconscionable that, when it comes to food security, they receive disparate treatment through a program that fails to help them when they need it most. No child in our nation should ever go hungry, but especially not after natural disasters or during a historic pandemic. Unfortunately, the current nutrition assistance program fails Puerto Rico when food demand is highest. This legislation would fix this longstanding injustice and I'm proud to join Bernie Sanders in introducing it,"" Velázquez added.

The bill is cosponsored by Senators Booker (D-N.J.), Markey (D-Mass.), Harris (D-Calif.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Menendez (D-N.J.), Warren (D-Mass.) and Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Representatives Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Moore (D-Wis.), Gonzalez-Colón (D-P.R.), Espaillat (D-N.Y.), Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Serrano (D-N.Y.), Meng (D-N.Y.), and Lee (D-Calif.) are House cosponsors.

""We are in the midst of a historic public health and economic crisis and the people of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa are, like other Americans, struggling to put food on the table,"" said Sen. Harris. ""It is time for Congress to take immediate action to end the discriminatory treatment of Americans living in U.S. territories and help give people the resources they need to afford food during tough times.""

Menendez: ""The COVID-19 pandemic doesn't discriminate based on the geographical location. All American citizens, no matter where they live, need and deserve support from the federal government,"" said Sen. Menendez.""Providing equal access to the supplemental nutrition assistance program across states and territories is critical in helping families who are struggling during this crisis to put food on the table. I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join us and pass this bill. These American families have no time to wait.""

""The COVID-19 pandemic has made even more apparent the unacceptable disparity in federal nutrition assistance provided to Americans in Puerto Rico and other territories,"" said Sen. Blumenthal. ""As families across the United States struggle to make ends meet and put food on the table, our fellow citizens living in territories deserve the same help the federal government provides residents of any state. I am proud to support this legislation to ensure that federal funds are distributed justly and to help all Americans tackle food insecurity during these unprecedented times.""

""Long before this pandemic, families in Puerto Rico have suffered from natural disasters, economic crises, and unacceptable responses from the Trump administration. But enough is enough,"" said Sen. Warren. ""I'm glad to support this bill to ensure communities in Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa have equal access to food assistance programs, like SNAP, that they need and deserve."" 

""This bill should not be controversial or partisan. The richest country in the world should feed its people. These are Americans -- and we must stop treating them as second-class citizens,"" said Rep. Ocasio-Cortez. 

""Puerto Ricans need and deserve reliable access to nutrition assistance,"" said Rep. González-Colón. ""The natural disasters that have recently taken place, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate how the block grant formula established for Puerto Rico is inadequate and incommensurate with need. Participation in SNAP will provide truly lasting relief to residents who currently do not have access to nutrition benefits due to limited funding, and will allow equitable distribution of benefits, similar our counterparts in the 50 states, USVI and Guam."" 

""Millions of American citizens in Puerto Rico and the territories depend on nutritional assistance,"" said Rep. José E. Serrano. ""Puerto Ricans, in particular, has suffered due to the coronavirus pandemic, the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria and numerous earthquakes in 2020 in addition to the ongoing economic crisis. Every American citizen residing in any of the territories deserves equal treatment and this bill does just that. The Equitable Nutrition Assistance for the Territories Act of 2020 grants equal treatment under SNAP to Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. As a longtime champion in Congress of equal treatment for Puerto Rico and the territories, I am proud to support this bill."" 

""As communities around the global face ongoing challenges due to the coronavirus, our efforts to provide relief and recovery must first address the needs of the most vulnerable among us,"" said Rep. Adriano Espaillat. ""It is long past time that Puerto Rico receives equal federal treatment to support individuals and families in need, and the global COVID-19 pandemic only further exacerbates the many hardships families face. We must extend SNAP benefits to ensure these families do not face further barriers when providing food for their families during these challenging times.""

Republican,Steve Daines,Daines Celebrates Phase One U.S.-China Trade Agreement Signing at the White House,"U.S. Senator Steve Daines today joined President Trump at the White House for the official signing ceremony of the Phase One U.S. -- China Trade Agreement. Daines was joined by Cascade County Commissioner Joe Briggs for the White House event.

""What an honor to be here with Commissioner Joe Briggs of Cascade County, Great Falls Montana, for this historic U.S.-China trade signing ceremony,"" Daines said. ""I'll tell you what, it means billions of dollars for our ag industry which is a big deal for Montanans, so big shout out to President Trump and his team here.""

""I sure appreciate the opportunity to be here Steve and spend some time with you this morning,"" Briggs said. ""It's incredible to have been at a ceremony like this. This is such an historic trade agreement. It has far reaching ramifications economically, militarily and overall for the security of the world.""

In September 2019, Daines traveled to Beijing, China to conduct a series of high-level meetings with senior Chinese government officials to reinforce President Trump's efforts to come to a trade deal.

As Montana's lone voice on the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over international trade, and as a member of the U.S. Senate China Working Group, Daines is a strong voice for Montana's ag priorities in international trade. Moving forward, Daines will work with the Administration and the Finance Committee to ensure that China is held accountable and fulfills its commitments in this agreement.

Background: 

The Phase One U.S.-China Trade Agreement includes:

-Commitments by China to increase purchases of U.S. agriculture, manufactured goods, energy, and services by $200 billion over two years, including $40 billion in agriculture commodities-Includes important structural reforms related to intellectual property, technology transfer, financial services, and others to help level the playing field for the U.S. in China's market

Daines has been an active voice for Montana's ag priorities with China and Asia. 

In early October, Daines celebrated the official signing of a trade agreement between Japan and the United States by President Trump and Prime Minster Abe that would level the playing field for Montana's farmers and ranchers in that critical market. This agreement went into effect on January 1st.

In mid-June, Daines questioned U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer during a U.S. Senate Finance Committee hearing on U.S. agriculture exports to Japan.

In early March, Daines urged United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in a U.S. Senate Finance Committee hearing to advance and finalize trade agreements with Japan and China to put Montana farmers and ranchers on a level playing field in the global stage.

On April 24, 2018, U.S. Senator Steve Daines pressed USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue to support reconsidering the Trans-Pacific Partnership and that the TPP would benefit U.S. and Montana agriculture. Secretary Perdue agreed and has urged the President to reconsider TPP.

On April 12, 2018, at a White House meeting with President Donald Trump, U.S. Senator Steve Daines voiced the concerns of Montana farmers and ranchers to the President by urging the President to expand access to markets critical to the agriculture community.

On February 16, 2018, Daines led 25 senators in sending a letter to President Trump urging the President to act on his recent statements expressing interest in considering an improved TPP.",2020-01-15,2020-W03
Democrat,Jack Reed,RI Delegation Announces Distribution of $5.4 Million in CARES Act Funds to Expand Coronavirus Testing and Tracing,"U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, along with Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline today announced that $5.4 million in funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act has been distributed to the Rhode Island Department of Health to boost the state's COVID-19 testing and contract tracing infrastructure. 

""This latest installment of federal funds will increase the state's testing capacity and build on other public health efforts.  This is another down payment toward getting COVID-19 testing to where it needs to be for public health,"" said Senator Reed.

""Rhode Island is a national leader in coronavirus testing, thanks to the hard work of Governor Raimondo and a partnership with CVS,"" said Senator Whitehouse, a member of the White House's congressional task force for reopening the economy.  ""We need to continue to build on that progress.  A robust testing and contact tracing infrastructure will help contain the spread of the virus and ultimately lead to reopening more of the economy.""

""I'm pleased that this additional funding from the CDC will help bolster treatment and testing efforts in Rhode Island to contain coronavirus and protect and preserve public health,"" said Congressman Langevin.  ""As we make plans to begin reopening the nation, we must acknowledge that lives are still at risk.  We must expand the capacity of our health institutions and better support physicians and health workers to get through this pandemic.""

""This new federal funding will amplify the work that Governor Raimondo and the Department of Health are already doing,"" said David Cicilline.  ""In order to control the spread of this disease and begin to re-open the economy, we need to first have a strong testing policy in place for all 50 states.  I will continue working with my colleagues in the delegation to deliver the resources Rhode Island needs right now.""

The funding was distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The grant may be used for a range of activities, including:

-Enhancing the ability to aggressively identify cases, conduct contact tracing and follow up, and implement appropriate containment measures;-Improving surveillance of patients;-Expanding testing capacity;-Controlling COVID-19 in high-risk settings and protecting vulnerable or high-risk populations; and

Working with healthcare systems to manage and monitor system capacity.To date, Rhode Island has received $11.5 million in CDC funding to help combat coronavirus.  Additionally, the COVID 3.5 bill passed by Congress this evening includes another $17.5 million to quickly expand the state's testing and contact tracing capacity.

Rhode Island currently ranks first in the nation for coronavirus testing on a per capita basis, with almost 4 percent of the state's population tested.",2020-04-23,2020-W17

Democrat,Christopher Murphy,"Letter to Dr. Robert Redfield, Dir. of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Connecticut Congressional Delegation Urges CDC to Provide More COVID-19 Testing Kits for Connecticut","Dear Dr. Redfield,

We write today to express concern with the very limited supply of COVID-19 diagnostic testing kits that have been sent to the state of Connecticut. Although Connecticut does not have a confirmed case of COVID-19, cases in neighboring states continue to be reported and Connecticut public health officials are alarmed that the broader testing guidelines announced by the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC) could lead to a shortage of testing kits in the state. We request that CDC respond to Connecticut's request for access to additional testing kits as quickly as possible.

On March 4, CDC issued new guidance allowing clinicians to use their judgement to determine whether or not a symptomatic patient should be tested, inevitably expanding the number of individuals who will be evaluated for COVID-19. While this is a promising step that would seemingly allow for greater testing, diagnosis, and surveillance of individuals with COVID-19, Connecticut officials warn that greater testing is simply not possible without greater access to testing kits. At this time, our state -- home to 3.5 million people -- only has sufficient diagnostic kits to test just over 500 individuals, and as the state moves to expand its capacity to test specimens beyond the state laboratory in Rocky Hill, Connecticut to private sector laboratories and the state's hospitals, it is critical that access to diagnostic testing kits becomes a reality.

            This week, Congress approved and President Trump signed a bipartisan $8.3 billion emergency supplemental, providing billions in funds that can be used to improve testing capabilities at the state level and support diagnostic test development.  These funds are absolutely necessary to bolstering federal, state, and local government efforts to respond to this unprecedented challenge, and we look forward to CDC working with Connecticut officials to guarantee that the state has access to the necessary number of diagnostics testing kits as we confront this crisis together.",2020-03-08,2020-W10
Democrat,Maria Cantwell,"Letter to Peter Gaynor, Administrator of FEMA - Washington Delegation Sends Letter to FEMA Administrator Gaynor For Field Hospitals Amid Coronavirus Outbreak","Dear Administrator Gaynor:

We urge you to provide sufficient and appropriate medical personnel and equipment as part of the Mission Assignment for any field hospitals and clinics being deployed to Washington to ensure they will be fully staffed and equipped. We appreciate the additional bed capacity that we understand is set to be deployed to Washington, however, it will fail to meet the State's needs and the federal government's goals in deploying such assets if it does not include additional medical personnel and equipment.

In particular, we strongly urge you to work closely with Secretary Esper in determining how military medical personnel may be used as part of this effort. The Military Health System has a mission to maintain a ready medical force that is prepared to respond to the full spectrum of military operations. This includes humanitarian missions.

Many other states and cities are projected to face shortcomings in their health care system; Washington is facing a crisis now. Hospitals in our State are already overwhelmed by the exponential growth in hospitalizations related to COVID-19. Washington has just 1.7 hospital beds per 1,000 residents, significantly below the national average of 2.4 beds per 1,000 residents.

Part of the reason we believed it was critical to send the U.S.N.S. Mercy to the Puget Sound region is that it would come already staffed. Washington already faces an insufficient number of health care providers to handle the COVID-19 outbreak. Washington's Registered Nurse (RN) to population ratio of 781 to 100,000 is well below the national average of 825 RNs to 100,000 population. Over 2,200,000 people in Washington live in a designated Primary Care Professional Shortage Area. Twenty-two percent of licensed physicians currently practice in other states, and twenty-five percent of RNs have a Washington license but do not practice in Washington.

As the first and hardest hit region in the country by COVID-19 to date, the health care workforce in Washington has only been further strained. The number of available nurses and physicians has decreased due to fatigue and illness caused by the outbreak. It is estimated that 35 percent of physicians are married to other physicians and have childcare responsibilities. Furthermore, an estimated 75 percent of nurses must either care for a child and/or an elderly relative at home. The necessary closure of schools and impact of the outbreak has led many of these health care workers to have to stay home to care for themselves and their families. The shortage of health care personnel in Washington resulting from the severity of the State's COVID-19 outbreak is one that we desperately need the federal government to supplement.

As we wrote to President Trump on March 18, hospitals in the Puget Sound region will soon have to implement crisis care standards and make excruciating decisions about care rationing. Our State and local health agencies have taken extreme actions and exhausted every avenue to support our hospitals. But without urgent federal action, our state will see a near total collapse of hospitals in Washington like we have seen in other places such as Italy.

We understand that a 148-bed field hospital with medical staff is being prepared to deploy to Washington from Fort Carson. As you know, this initial deployment is still far short of the 1,000 beds and staff that would have come with the U.S.N.S. Mercy. We request a timeline for exactly when the deployment from Fort Carson will be operational in Washington and when a decision about additional deployments of beds and medical personnel from federal agencies to Washington will be made.

Washington desperately needs additional bed capacity, but just as vital is that this additional capacity be accompanied by federal medical personnel and equipment. Anything short of this greatly jeopardizes the ability for Washington's health care system to meet the urgent and growing needs of our communities.

Democrat,Charles E. Schumer,"Udall, Senate Democrats Unveil COVID-19 ""Heroes Fund,"" $25,000 Proposed Pay Increase to Essential Workers and Tribal Workers on Frontlines of Pandemic Response","Today, U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-N.M.) joined Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senators Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) to unveil the COVID-19 ""Heroes Fund,"" Senate Democrats' proposal to establish a pandemic premium pay to reward, retain, and recruit essential workers. Senate Democrats' proposed ""Heroes Fund"" consists of two major components: a $25,000 premium pay increase for essential workers--including Tribal workers--equivalent to a raise of $13 per hour from the start of the public health emergency until December 31, 2020, and a $15,000 essential worker recruitment incentive to attract and secure the workforce needed to fight the public health crisis.

""Essential frontline workers in New Mexico, Indian Country, and across America are risking their own health to protect ours, to care for our loved ones, and to keep our communities safe and running. We owe these heroes -- the health care workers, first responders, law enforcement, grocery clerks, delivery workers, and many others -- more than just words of gratitude: we must make sure they are paid what they deserve,"" Udall said.

 

""Importantly, this proposal will give Tribal frontline workers equal access to these benefits, and includes the necessary flexibility to meet the unique needs of Native communities,"" Udall continued. ""Because this crisis is hitting Indian Country especially hard: frontline workers in Native communities are stretched thin, and, due to severe federal underfunding, Indian Country has long struggled to recruit and retain workers in fields like health care and law enforcement. So this proposal is absolutely necessary for Indian Country and for all communities -- to support the frontline workers who are doing incredible, life-saving work, and to secure the workforce that we need to keep our nation healthy and strong.""

 

Across New Mexico, Indian Country, and America, essential frontline workers--doctors, nurses, grocery store workers, transit workers, public safety personnel, and many more--continue to put themselves at risk on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. Udall and Senate Democrats' proposal would compensate these workers for their great personal sacrifices and tireless dedication while increasing the recruitment of additional workers for the front lines that will be needed in the months ahead.

 

Udall and Senate Democrats fought for workers-first provisions in the recently-passed CARES Act, the $2 trillion package includes key provisions to support New Mexico, including: direct payments to individual New Mexicans and a major expansion of unemployment benefits, badly-needed direct relief for small businesses, an emergency infusion of resources into hospitals and to support health care workers, and reimbursement for state and Tribal governments that have stepped up to address the crisis.

 

Udall and Senate Democrats also fought to ensure Tribes had equitable access to federal resources in the recently-passed CARES Act. They secured over $10 billion in resources for Tribes and Native communities to address their unique needs, including providing over $1 billion to the Indian Health Service and establishing an $8 billion Tribal Government Relief Fund.

 

Portions of the first wave of grants from the package have recently been released to New Mexico, while the Indian Health Service announced disbursement of $600 million of the over $1 billion in funds Udall helped secure from the CARES Act.

 

""Thousands of workers report to the frontlines of our nation's pandemic response each and every day, placing themselves squarely in harm's way to serve the needs of others,"" said Leader Schumer. ""Senate Democrats' proposed ""Heroes Fund' would provide premium pay to these essential workers--the doctors and nurses, grocery store workers, transit workers, and more who are central to fighting this crisis--and would establish an incentive system to retain and recruit the workforce needed for the long months to come. Essential frontline workers sacrifice daily for our collective health and well-being, and Senate Democrats are fully committed to supplying these heroes the financial support they deserve.""

 

A summary of Senate Democrats' COVID-19 ""Heroes Fund"" proposal can be found here and below:

 

The COVID-19 ""Heroes Fund"" Summary

 

Senate Democrats' Proposal for Pandemic Premium Pay to Reward, Retain, & Recruit Essential Workers

 

Essential frontline workers are the true heroes of America's COVID-19 pandemic response.  Senate Democrats believe in providing premium pay to frontline workers during this pandemic to reward essential frontline workers, ensure the retention of essential workers who are working grueling hours on the frontlines of this crisis, and promote the recruitment of additional workers who will be needed in the months ahead.

 

As the Congress looks at a potential fourth COVID-19 bill, the following proposal is meant for consideration by Members of Congress, key stakeholders, and the American people. Senate Democrats' proposal consists of two major components:

1. A $25,000 pandemic premium pay increase for essential frontline workers, equivalent to a raise of an additional $13 per hour from the start of the public health emergency until December 31, 2020.

2. A $15,000 recruitment incentive for health and home care workers and first responders to attract and secure the workforce needed to fight the public health crisis.

 

Structure of the Pandemic Premium Pay

To meet the goals of reward, retention, and recruitment, Senate Democrats propose a set dollar amount per hour with a maximum amount for the year, for a definite duration, and with an additional bonus for workers who sign up to do such essential work during this crisis.

 

Amount of Pay Premium. The proposal--

-Uses a flat-dollar amount per hour premium model in order to ensure it is clear, simple, and lifts up particularly those workers making lower wages.-Would give each essential frontline worker $13/hour premium pay on top of regular wages for all hours worked in essential industries through the end of 2020.-Would cap the total maximum premium pay at $25,000 for each essential frontline worker earning less than $200,000 per year and $5,000 for each essential worker earning $200,000 or more per year.  

Duration of Premium. The premium pay period--

-Must be for a specified and clear duration of time to ensure workers can rely on it for their economic security and plan for needs like additional child care.-Should cover all hours worked by each essential frontline worker through December 31, 2020, or until the worker's salary-based maximum premium pay is reached. 

Premium Pay as a Recruitment and Retention Incentive.  In order to recruit the additional health care workers, home care workers, and first responders needed over the coming months, thef proposal--

-Would provide a one-time $15,000 premium for signing on to do essential work.-Would limit eligibility for this incentive premium to essential health and home care workers and first responders that are experiencing severe staffing shortages impeding the ability to provide care during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1]  

Premium Pay and Worker Incentives Delivery Mechanism

 

The proposal would fully federally-fund the premium pay and recruitment and retention incentive. We will continue to seek input on the specific mechanism for delivering the pay to workers, as well as the universe of ""essential workers"" to be covered. The new federal fund would partner with entities designated as an ""eligible employer"" -- states, localities, tribes, and certain private sector employers -- to issue the funds premium payments to eligible workers. Frontline federal employees would also be granted the new benefit of up to $25,000.

 

COVID-19 Heroes Fund. The new COVID-19 Heroes Fund would provide funds directly to eligible employer-partners so that they could distribute the premium payments.

-Employers in industries engaged in ""essential work"" would apply to the Heroes Fund for funds to be used to add line-item premium pay to employees' or independent contractors' paychecks. The eligible employer would track these payments, provide payroll records demonstrating premium payments, and return any unspent funds to the agency.-No employer would be required to participate, but all would be strongly encouraged to and the program would be widely advertised.-An entity that contracts directly with the state, locality, Tribe, or the federal government (e.g., to provide care to people with Medicare and Medicaid coverage) would be considered a private sector employer, and employees of this entity who are designated as ""essential"" would be eligible for premium pay. Similarly, an eligible employer is also an individual who hires someone designated as ""essential"" through programs established through the State (e.g., self-directed care arrangements). This would help ensure coverage of the 2.2 million home health aides, direct service providers, and personal care workers who provide services to more than 12 million Americans.-Eligible employers would submit applications for the recruitment and retention incentive premium on a rolling basis.   

Federal Workforce. The proposal would ensure all federal government essential frontline employees receive the same $25,000 premium pay benefit provided to other essential workers.[2]

-Coverage should be expansive to capture all federal employees with public-facing positions.  This includes Title 5 employees and employees of all other federal personnel systems (e.g., employees of the Postal Service, TSA, VA, FAA, District of Columbia, and federally-funded Indian programs[3]).-The benefit would be limited to frontline and public-facing positions -- employees who are not teleworking from their homes. 

Additional Background and Commentary

 

Precedents. Disasters require exceptional flexibility in standard work schedules and assignments and often put first responders and other essential workers in dangerous situations. To ensure this critical workforce is compensated appropriately, there are precedents for funding hazard premium pay and worker incentives through a federal program.  

 

FEMA, through the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Response and Emergency Assistance Act and the Disaster Relief Fund, is currently authorized to reimburse state, local, and tribal governments for straight-time and premium pay associated with disaster response. Extraordinary costs (such as call-back pay, night-time or weekend differential pay, and hazardous duty pay) for essential employees who are called back to duty during administrative leave to perform eligible Emergency Work are eligible for reimbursement in certain circumstances.

 

This authority has been used many times over the last few years to pay for personnel costs associated with enforcing curfews, facilitating evacuation routes, and restoring critical infrastructure. Past usage illustrates precedent for federal funding of critical state, local, and tribal employees performing essential response functions that keep our communities safe in times of disaster.

 

Essential Frontline Worker definitions. As mentioned above, the definition of essential frontline workers for purposes of both the premium pay increase and the recruitment-retention incentive will be the subject of debate. This proposal is not meant to exclude any worker from this conversation. Rather, we hope this proposal will encourage a discussion about how large and diverse this universe of workers truly is. Our goal is to make federal, state, tribal, local and private sector essential workers that are at risk eligible for this benefit.

 

Retroactive Pay. Workers who have been on the frontlines since the initial declaration of the Public Health Emergency on January 27, 2020, could receive a lump sum of backpay of $13 per hour for work before enactment. These workers would continue to receive the $13 per hour premium pay on top of regular wages moving forward, but these workers would still be subject to the maximum premium pay cap outlined above. 

 

Additional Benefits for Essential Health and Home Care Workers and First Responders. The employers of frontline health and home care workers and first responders should be eligible to apply for a second round of premium pay funds of up to $10,000 as those workers continue to combat the virus.

 

Death Benefits. It is a deeply disturbing but unfortunate reality that some of our frontline workers are making the ultimate sacrifice to the nation through their work fighting COVID-19. Their families rightfully deserve to receive the full amount of the premium pay as a lump sum in addition to all other forms of death benefits.

 

Protections from Corporate Expense Shifting. Certain large corporations engaged in the provision of essential services and goods employ essential frontline workers who are deserving of premium pay. However, massive corporations should make investments in providing premium pay of their own accord before trying to participate in this program.

 

Protecting Workers and PPE. Senate Democrats have been fighting to give essential workers the protections and equipment they need to stay safe. The CARES Act provided billions of dollars for PPE, and Democrats have pushed the Administration to appoint a czar to handle all manufacturing and distribution of critical PPE. We must do more to ensure all frontline workers have the protective gear they need to perform their jobs safely, and we need a strong emergency temporary standard to protect all workers.

[1] The recruitment and retention incentive might need to cover a broader swathe of workers in Indian Country and other underserved areas that experienced high levels of essential frontline worker vacancies prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

[2] Certain federal workers are entitled under current law to a maximum 25 percent hazard premium pay for exposure to hazardous substances, including virulent biologicals.  However, President Trump has failed to activate this policy for the federal workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT",2020-01-06,2020-W02
Republican,Ted Cruz,Women's Healthcare,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today for every child who has been  denied the chance to live; the little boys and the little girls who  never got the chance to breathe a breath of air, to live life; never  got the chance to grow up to be athletes, doctors, poets, or inventors;  never got the chance to live their own unique lives. 

  This year marks the 47th tragic anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the  Supreme Court decision that forced on all 50 States abortion on demand  and has tragically led to the loss of life of over 60 million unborn  children. Since that decision, so much life has been lost. So many  unborn and even newborn babies have suffered. 

  In recent years, we have seen the Democratic Party not listening to  the concerns of a great many people of good will on both sides of the  party but, rather, radicalize. We have seen leading contenders for the  Presidential nomination in the Democratic field declare that pro-life  Democrats are no longer welcome in the party. We have seen far too many  Democrats embrace extreme positions on abortion--abortion up until the  moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that. 

  I think the radicalization of today's Democratic Party was made  crystal clear for a great many Americans with the radio interview that  Virginia Governor Ralph Northam did on January 30 of last year. In that  interview, Governor Northam was speaking in favor of a bill that would  allow abortion when a mother was already in labor. 

  Stop and think about this for a moment. There have been debates about  abortion for a long, long time. A mother in labor, in the process of  delivering a child, this bill would allow a doctor to kill that child  instead of delivering the child in the midst of labor. For a great many  people, even Americans who identify as pro-choice, the idea of killing  a child while the mother is in labor delivering the infant is  horrifying beyond words. But Governor Northam didn't end there. He  wasn't content simply with saying that abortion should be allowed even  in the midst of birth. He went further. He said on that radio  interview:  

       The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept       comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what       the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion       would ensue between the physicians and the mother.  

  Now, so nobody is lost on what Governor Northam was saying, he was  describing something that has euphemistically been called post-birth  abortion. He was describing his view of the right way to approach  delivering a child, which is a child who is delivered, who is outside  the womb, who is breathing and crying and living. That is an infant.  And Governor Northam calmly, with virtually no emotion whatsoever,  described comforting that infant and then having a conversation about  whether to deny that child the necessary care to live or simply to  callously let a newborn infant die. 

  For virtually every American, that is a concept that is so extreme,  that is so radical, that--other than elected Democrats who have decided  to embrace a radical view of abortion in all circumstances--almost  every other American would be, rightly, horrified by the notion of a  doctor allowing a newborn infant outside the womb to die. That was  Governor Northam's position. 

  Well, tomorrow the Senate has an opportunity to speak out against  those extreme, radical positions, to say this isn't OK, to draw a line,  to find what should be some degree of common ground. We are going to be  voting on two bills in the Senate tomorrow: the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act and the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  Act. 

  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of both pieces of legislation.  Those are both commonsense pieces of legislation that would work to  restore fundamental rights for the unborn and for newborn babies. They  are simple pieces of legislation. 

  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act requires doctors to  provide medical care to infants who survive attempted abortion  procedures. It  would help make sure that, when an infant has already been born, when  the infant is alive, is breathing, is crying, is outside the womb, that  that child receives the medical attention he or she needs. 

  The second bill is the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act that  would ban late-term abortions that result in pain and suffering and  agony for an unborn child. 

  What you will not hear from congressional Democrats is that after 5  months, an unborn child's toes and eyelids and fingers and eyelashes  have already formed. He or she has a heartbeat and can feel pain, and  science confirms this. We know that these late-term abortions, embraced  by more and more radical partisans, produce pain and suffering and  agony. We should not be a part of allowing the deliberate infliction of  pain on a little girl or a little boy. 

  These two proposals, in any sane and rational world, would be agreed  to unanimously. If you look at the last 3 years, we have seen enormous  victories when it has come to defending life, when it has come to  confirming 192 new Federal judges committed to following the law in the  Constitution; when it has come to restricting taxpayer funding of  Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of abortions in this country;  when it has come to defending the religious liberties of Americans all  across this country, including the Little Sisters of the Poor. We are  making major steps in the right direction, but we can go further. We  can agree on these commonsense provisions. We can also test whether  Senate Democrats agree with their colleagues running for President,  whether Senate Democrats agree with the chairman of the Democratic  National Committee, who has said: If you are a pro-life Democrat, get  out of the party; you are not welcome. 

  I can tell you in Texas, I certainly welcome pro-life Democrats to  speak up for their values and defend their values, and we should come  together behind commonsense propositions that say we should not be  committing procedures that result in pain and agony and suffering, that  science demonstrates causes that suffering, and we should not be  allowing newborn infants to die because medical care is denied to those  children. 

  This should bring us together. I urge our colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to stand together for life--every life, as a precious, unique  gift from God. Every life, whether the child has a disability, whether  the child is valued or not, that child should be valued, should be  protected because that child is precious.

We are writing in support of Governor JB Pritzker's request for an extension from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the State conducting a Preliminary Damage Assessment of the flooding event that occurred from January 10-11, 2020.

As you may know, severe storms brought rain, snow, ice, and high winds in excess of 50 miles per hour to Cook and Lake Counties.  This caused Lake Michigan water levels to reach an all-time January high--four inches above the previous January high set in 1987.

Given damage the flood has inflicted upon the lakefront and its communities, it is of the utmost importance that the State of Illinois submits an accurate Preliminary Damage Assessment from county-compiled information.  However, the conditions in the aftermath of the severe storms and flooding will require additional time for local governments to conduct their initial damage assessments.

We respectfully request that FEMA grant the extension request for this purpose, to ensure these counties have the opportunity to report all damages endured to their communities.

Thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this important request.",2020-02-07,2020-W06
Republican,Chuck Grassley,Iowa,"Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are in the middle of what is known as  March Madness. I am not talking about budget reconciliation or tax  season; I am here to congratulate and say thank you to our outstanding  student athletes who have competed their hearts out on the court and on  the mat these last few weeks.

First, I want to pay tribute to our Iowa teams who made it into the  NCAA Division I basketball tournament. That includes Iowa State  University women's and men's teams, the University of Iowa women's  team, and the men's team at Drake University in Des Moines.

Division I wrestlers from the Iowa Hawkeyes, Iowa State Cyclones, and  my alma mater, the University of Northern Iowa, competed earlier this  month in Philadelphia.

I want to congratulate two teams from my home State who won their  respective collegiate championships this month. In the NCAA Division  III wrestling national championship, the Knights from Wartburg College  returned from Rhode Island as cochampions and with their 16th national  title--the most in Division III history. The women's basketball team at  Dordt University in Sioux Center returned to the NAIA national  championship held last week in Sioux City, IA. The Dordt Defenders  defended their title and are back-to-back champions.

Sports brings communities together from one generation to the next.  As loyal UNI Panther fans and proud boosters for Dike-New Hartford  athletics, Barbara and I would say that sports are like glue that  sticks, a refreshing antidote in these polarizing times.",2025-04-08,2025-W15
Republican,Lindsey Graham,Graham on Trump Statement About Georgia Business Re-openings,"U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement on President Trump expressing concerns about business re-openings in the State of Georgia.

""I agree with President Trump's concern about Georgia going ""too far too fast' with business re-openings. 

""I have great respect for Governor Kemp and believe that future re-openings can occur rather quickly but we must get Phase I right.  I totally understand Governor Kemp's desire to allow businesses to reopen as small business owners are under great stress. 

""President Trump and his team have given us a sound roadmap on how to safely reopen the economy.  I strongly suggest, as a nation, we follow it.  The best path forward is to follow the guidelines set by President Trump and his team. Barber shops, hair salons, tattoo parlors, and other close quarter business activity will come after a successful Phase I.

""I am confident that in the coming weeks -- if we follow the guidelines -- more and more businesses will be safely reopened.  Our goal is to achieve a bump in the economy without creating a spike in the virus. 

""We are fifty individual states but when it comes to the virus we are all in this fight together.  Because of the sacrifices we have made as a nation there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Better days are ahead.""",2020-04-23,2020-W17
Republican,John Boozman,Legislation to Protect GI Bill Benefits During Coronavirus Crisis Heads to President for Signature,"Legislation that would allow veterans to continue receiving full GI Bill benefits as universities move classes online to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has cleared Congress and is expected to be signed into law by President Trump. 

U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR), an original cosponsor of the Emergency GI Fix for Coronavirus School Closures bill, applauded Congress's swift action to ensure that veterans do not see a disruption in education benefits as a result of steps taken to protect public health. 

""We are all adjusting to changes in our daily routines as a result of the coronavirus. Concerns about the loss of GI Bill benefits is the last thing a student veteran should have to worry about amidst all this disruption. These are earned benefits that should not be put at risk due to the fact that a public health emergency has forced classes to move online during a temporary closure of campuses. I am pleased that Congress moved quickly to address this and look forward to President Trump signing this bill into law,"" Boozman said. 

The GI Bill determines student veterans' benefits based on whether or not they attend a physical university in person versus an online program. As colleges and universities close campuses to prevent the spread of COVID-19, veterans using the GI Bill could lose or have their benefits cut. The Emergency GI Fix for Coronavirus School Closures bill would allow these student veterans to continue to receive full benefits even if the universities they are attending decide to temporarily move classes online due to COVID-19. 

The legislation now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law.",2020-03-19,2020-W12
Republican,James Lankford,"Letter to the Hon. Ajit Pai, Commissioner of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission - Senators Lankford, Manchin, Blackburn, Tester, Kennedy Urge FCC to Provide Broadband for Rural Communities","Dear Chairman Pai:

Last month's Mobility Fund Phase II (MF-II) Coverage Map Investigation Staff Report confirmed what we already knew to be true -- the maps were wrong. While we commend the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) for acknowledging that critical fact, we have some serious reservations about the recently announced 5G Fund and the decision to focus these limited mobile broadband deployment dollars on the promise of a 5G future when many places in our states still lack 4G service or do not have any service at all. To stand any chance of connecting rural Americans, the FCC needs a more accurate method of data collection, a strong challenge process, and a funding process that includes terrain factors to ensure that the hardest to serve places can compete for limited funding.

While carriers are beginning to roll out 5G service in select major metropolitan areas, 5G availability remains the exception rather than the rule for most Americans, even those living in big cities. The divide is even greater for the rural Americans we represent, some of whom still lack the 4G LTE service promised by MF-II. By refocusing funding toward 5G, not only will our states have to compete with our more urban, more profitable neighbors, we are also at a major systemic disadvantage because of the additional hurdles 5G presents for rural deployment. Specifically, high frequency signals being utilized for several announced 5G deployments enable faster data rates but cannot travel as far or pass through geographic impediments like buildings or mountains as easily. In order to overcome these technological constraints, 5G deployment will rely on the deployment of small, densely-concentrated cells to transmit effectively. While this may be possible in urban areas with large customer bases, these constraints will make it extremely difficult to deploy in rural areas like our home states. 5G deployment is an admirable long-term goal, but the performance criteria for the 5G Fund should account for the realities of closing the digital divide today.

Additionally, as you consider the structure of this new 5G Fund, we urge you to learn from the MF-II process. The Commission only recognized the fundamental flaws in the coverage maps after states, local governments, tribal governments, mobile broadband providers, and other stakeholders were allowed to review and formally challenge the incumbent providers' reported coverage data. One of the principal lessons learned from MF-II was that the old way of mapping does not work. We can no longer have a system where maps are drawn based on unreliable data. As your agency's Staff Report recommended, data must be collected based on more specific parameters that better reflect minimum on-the-ground network performance. And we must allow people to be a part of the verification process before the money goes out the door.

We also urge you to retain the terrain factor that you committed to include in the MF-II process. As Senators representing states where challenging topographical features make broadband deployment extremely expensive, we know all too well the competitive disadvantage we face when applying for funding that is awarded through reverse auctions. The states we represent have distinctive landscapes that are integral to their identity and their beauty which is what draws people from around the world to visit each year. Unfortunately, these same natural features make the construction of critical broadband infrastructure far more expensive than other parts of the country. It costs more to serve fewer people, plain and simple. Without a terrain factor or a high cost set aside, we cannot compete.

All Americans, no matter their area code, deserve to have access to high speed, reliable mobile service, and we need your help to make this a reality. We thank you for your careful consideration of this request and look forward to working with the Commission to ensure that this funding will go to the places that need it the most.",2020-01-09,2020-W02
Republican,Mitch McConnell,Kentuckians Honor McConnell for Bipartisan Bill to Protect Coal Miner Pension Benefits Becoming Law,"U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) welcomed Kentuckians with the United Mine Workers of America to his office in the U.S. Capitol this week. The Kentucky coal miner retirees presented Senator McConnell with a coal plaque honoring him for his work to protect pension benefits for coal miners and their families.

Utilizing his role as Majority Leader, Senator McConnell ensured his bill, the Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019, which he introduced with Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Joe Manchin (D-WV), was included in the Fiscal Year 2020 government-funding agreement, which President Donald Trump signed into law last year.

""It was great to celebrate President Trump's signing of my Bipartisan American Miners Act with these Kentucky coal miner retirees. This law secured the retirement benefits for more than 90,000 retired coal miners and their dependents nationwide, including many in Kentucky,"" said Senator McConnell. ""The uncertainty and pain from President Obama's War on Coal left many of these families watching their retirement security slipping away. Our coal communities needed help, and I was determined to provide it. I made our case directly to President Trump and used my position as Senate Majority Leader to make sure our bipartisan bill got to his desk. I'm proud to keep standing with Kentucky's coal families and will continue championing their priorities in the Senate."" Eddie Embry of Hartford, Kentucky, UMWA retiree said, ""We are so very appreciative of Leader McConnell's support for the Bipartisan American Miners Act. This has been a long struggle but worth it, in the end. Leader McConnell's support was essential to our victory, and we were happy to recognize his contribution on behalf of the membership of the UMWA.""

The coal plaque (below) reads: ""At our most desperate hour, you rose to the aid of America's retired miners and widows, On behalf of a grateful union, we present this to Senator Mitch McConnell. We will never forget your dedication to our cause as we mark the passage of The Bipartisan American Miners Act"" --Cecil E. Roberts, International President and Levi Allen, International Secretary-Treasurer of the United Mine Workers of America.

The Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019 secured funding for the 1974 miner Pension Plan to prevent its insolvency. The law also expands the existing health care benefits provided under Senator McConnell's HELP for Coal Miners Health Care Act of 2017 to the orphaned coal miners whose medical benefits have been put in jeopardy due to recent coal company bankruptcies. 

-In 2017, Senator McConnell mobilized Congress to permanently secure health care benefits for thousands of retired miners. Had Congress not acted, approximately 3,000 Kentucky coal miner retirees -- and tens of thousands more around the country -- would have lost their health care benefits. The bill also included additional assistance for troubled coal-mining communities and dislocated coal workers.-As senior appropriators, Senator McConnell and Congressman Hal Rogers (KY-05) have secured hundreds of millions of dollars for the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Economic Development Pilot Program (AML Pilot). ARC funding supports economic growth in Eastern Kentucky by helping create jobs, combat the spiking substance abuse epidemic, and provide employment training for former coal miners, among a number of other worthy initiatives. In 2015, Senator McConnell and Congressman Rogers established the AML Pilot, which promotes economic and community development on abandoned mine lands. Since then, they have helped secure more than $100 million for Kentucky through this program-Senator McConnell also helped secure nearly $130 million through the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to provide career and training services to dislocated workers in rural areas, including dislocated coal workers in Kentucky who lost their jobs. This includes $3.7 million to help support the recently impacted Harlan County, Kentucky coal miners and their families with employment and training services.",2020-02-27,2020-W09
Democrat,Jeff Merkley,"Merkley, Wyden Announce Over 350,000 Children in Oregon Will Receive Critical Food Assistance","Oregon's U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced that over 350,000 children in Oregon will receive critical food assistance through the Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) program in order to help fill the meal gap created by school closures.

Even before the coronavirus crisis hit, over half a million people, including one in five children, in Oregon struggled with food insecurity.

""Every child in Oregon--regardless of the color of their skin, the town they live in, or where their parents work--deserves to go to bed with a full belly,"" said Merkley. ""Unfortunately, we have more work ahead of us to live up to that principle. I'm grateful that this funding will help bring us a step closer, and will keep fighting for the funding and resources we need to end hunger in Oregon once and for all.""

""The year-round fight against hunger for young Oregonians got even tougher with COVID-19 requiring schools to close to protect public health,"" Wyden said. ""I am gratified these federal funds will help feed students across our state during this crisis, and I will keep battling to provide food security for Oregonians of all ages.""

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act created the P-EBT program to provide nutrition assistance to families whose schools closed in response to COVID-19. P-EBT provides households and EBT card with the value of the free school breakfast and lunch reimbursement rates for the days the schools are closed. Schools must close for at least five consecutive days in order for families to receive a P-EBT Card. Oregon submitted a state plan for operating P-EBT which was approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The disbursal announcement follows Senator Merkley's work as the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the USDA to require the agency to reinstate the Summer EBT program in Oregon for the next three years. In addition, Senator Merkley led a group of 22 lawmakers--including Senator Wyden--in urging Senate Leadership to strengthen the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps, in upcoming coronavirus relief legislation.",2020-05-05,2020-W19
Democrat,Charles E. Schumer,"Letter to the Hon. Ben Carson, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development - Baldwin Leads Bipartisan Group of Senators Calling on HUD Secretary Carson to Take Action on CDBG Funding and Guidance","We write regarding funding for critical health facilities, child care centers, senior services, food banks, affordable housing and services for individuals experiencing homelessness included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. As states and local governments respond to the COVID-19 public health and the economic crisis, it is essential that they receive the $9 billion in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funding Congress provided in the CARES Act without delay, as well as guidance from HUD to make rapid use of it. We are concerned that $5 billion remains to be awarded from both the CDBG and ESG programs, and that HUD has yet to make comprehensive guidance available for awards already announced--holding states and local governments back from spending the federal funds we worked to ensure they receive.

The CARES Act included $5 billion for CDBG to enable nearly 1,240 states, counties, and cities to respond to the public health, economic, and housing challenges we now face. As required by the bill, HUD made an initial $2 billion available to states and entitlement communities through the existing CDBG formula on April 2. The second round of funding, this time directly to states to support a coordinated response across entitlement and nonentitlement communities, was allocated on May 11. While we appreciate HUD's work to announce this funding, states and local communities are still waiting for comprehensive guidance from HUD about how CARES Act and prior year funds can be used to address COVID-related needs, as well as administrative requirements they'll need to follow.

Further, HUD has not yet developed a formula or established a date for allocating the $2 billion in remaining funds that are to be distributed to states and units of local government. Under the requirements of the CARES Act, we expect that formula will target hardest-hit areas, based on factors reflecting the direct effect COVID-19 has had on states and localities, prioritizing risk of transmission of coronavirus, number of coronavirus cases, and economic and housing disruptions as a result of the coronavirus. Using these data sets simply as a back-end adjustment factor could seriously underestimate the impact of regional epicenters and would contradict the intent of the CARES Act.

The CARES Act also included $4 billion in Emergency Solutions Grant funding to address the impact of COVID-19 among families and individuals who are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of homelessness. This funding is to be used to support additional homeless assistance and prevention, as well as eviction prevention assistance, including rapid rehousing, housing counseling and rental deposit assistance. With the initial allocation of CDBG funding in early April, HUD also allocated $1 billion to local governments under the existing ESG formula. However, like CDBG, HUD has yet to publish guidance on the use of these funds and grantees are still waiting on the remaining $3 billion for ESG funds targeting hardest-hit areas. The CARES Act requires HUD to prioritize areas with the greatest risk of transmission of coronavirus, high rates of sheltered and unsheltered homeless, and economic and housing market conditions for the second round of ESG grants.

While HUD has made announcements informing grantees about the amount of a portion of CDBG and ESG funds available from the CARES Act, without the associated programmatic guidance published in the Federal Register, grantees do not have the program requirements, additional waiver authorities, or management recommendations from HUD to ensure funds are used effectively. This creates a disincentive for communities to execute grant agreements and additional administrative burdens, should a grantee need to ultimately amend its grant based on alternative requirements and waivers made available in an impending notice. We ask that HUD work quickly to allocate all remaining CDBG and ESG funds from the CARES Act and publish comprehensive guidance for use of those funds, including for previously announced funding.

We appreciate your attention to this important matter.",2020-05-27,2020-W22
Independent,Bernard Sanders,"Letter to Joseph V. Cuffari, Inspector of Department of Homeland Security - California Congressional Members Lead Request for Investigation of Death at Detention Facility and ICE Measures During COVID Crisis","Dear Inspector General Cuffari:

We write to ask for a thorough investigation into the recent death of a detained person at OtayMesa Detention Center (Otay Mesa) due to COVID-19. We request that your investigationinclude an assessment of the sufficiency of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's(ICE's) preparedness for a COVID-19 outbreak, including any measures to prevent its spreadamong the detained population and ensure the testing, treatment, and care of persons detained at Otay Mesa during this pandemic. Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak in the UnitedStates, Members of Congress have requested information from the Department of HomelandSecurity (DHS) and ICE to understand how the Department manages the risk of COVID-19outbreaks in detention centers, and we have yet to receive sufficient answers. Based on the scantinformation that DHS and ICE have made available and public reports, ICE has takeninsufficient measures to protect individuals in its custody and staff working in detentionfacilities.

As of today, 1,327 detained persons have tested positive for COVID-19 out of 2,620 individualswho have been tested,although this may be an undercount of the number of infections sinceICE has not implemented widespread testing of all detained persons. According to ICE, it hasreleased at least 900 medically vulnerable individuals since March. The Otay Mesa DetentionCenter has suffered the most significant coronavirus outbreak among ICE detention facilities; atleast 217 total detained persons have tested positive, including 158 in ICE custody. ICE hasstated that the agency will consider releasing more detained persons based on medical conditionsand public safety considerations.

On May 6, Carlos Escobar-Mejia died at Paradise Valley Hospital in National City, CA aftercontracting COVID-19 in the Otay Mesa Detention Center. He was held in ICE custody fornearly four months and was identified as medically vulnerable after he was hospitalized.Advocacy organizations have described the following dangerous conditions at Otay Mesa:

* cells are populated by up to eight people at once with bunk beds fewer than six feetapart;* when a detained person has tested positive, ICE has ""cohorted"" dozens of people whowere in the same housing unit as that person, which means they were locked uptogether for two weeks in close proximity despite public health guidancerecommending physical distancing to prevent the spread of infection;* detained persons share sinks, toilets, telephones, and showers, with no disinfectantcleaner available for after use;* soap runs out frequently and refills are inconsistent, forcing detained persons whocannot afford to buy soap to go without it;* mealtime is communal, with detained persons lined up in close proximity to receivetheir meals, compelling them to choose between eating at overcrowded tables or intheir cells, close to other detained persons and toilets; and* detained persons have reported insufficient medical services and potential retaliationagainst individuals who report concerns regarding the same.

Additionally, a group of 43 individuals currently detained at Otay Mesa describe serious medicalneglect by staff at Otay Mesa.5 We urge you to investigate and assess conditions at Otay Mesa,including the sufficiency of policies, protocols, and practices governing decision-making aboutsocial distancing, hygiene, and personal protective equipment by both ICE and third-partycontractors operating at the facility. We also urge you to identify the actual availability oftesting, care, and treatment for detained persons; and the availability of testing for all staff atOtay Mesa, including individuals employed by third-party contractors.

Your robust and thorough investigation is imperative to preventing COVID-19-related illnessand death in ICE custody. In addition to seeking records from ICE and interviewing staff at OtayMesa, this investigation should include interviews with legal service providers and detainedpersons (with adequate precautions to prevent retaliation and ensure anonymity).

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. We respectfully request a response as soonas possible.",2020-05-28,2020-W22
Independent,Bernard Sanders,"Letter to John Mackey, CEO Of Whole Foods - Schatz, Senators Urge Whole Foods To Stop Suppressing Unions And Intimidating Workers, Respect Right To Organize","Dear Mr. Mackey:

We write to express our serious concerns regarding recent reports that Whole Foods is trying to interfere with workers' rights by tracking and monitoring employees that you think might exercise their right to collective action and union organizing.

Based on these reports, your company rates each of your 510 stores on a scale of how likely their employees are to organize to join a union, designates union organizing as ""problematic"", and plans to funnel resources to stop union organizing.  The rating includes components such as employee loyalty, racial diversity, tip line calls to human resources, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations.

The fact that Whole Foods has decided to heavily invest in systems to avoid unionization rather than improve the wages, hours, and working conditions of their employees demonstrates a reckless disregard for the welfare of your workforce.  Instead of monitoring employees, your company should be taking active steps to improve workplace safety and health, especially during the current COVID-19 crisis.  In addition, incorporating data from ""anonymous"" tip lines violates the intent of such a resource, which is to provide a safe space for whistleblowers to register concerns.

Due to the proliferation of unethical and anti-worker actions occurring at your company, we request the following information:

What steps does Whole Foods currently take to reduce the chance of workers organizing?Does Whole Foods do any type of internal tracking to identify or monitor workers that may be organizing, planning strikes, or talking to the media?  If so, describe in detail.Does Whole Foods track workers that participate in walk-outs, strikes, or other organizing activities?  If so, who is responsible for this, and how is this information recorded?What type of resources does your company make available to stores at the highest risk of organizing?What steps does Whole Foods take specifically when it becomes aware of an active organizing campaign at a store and thereafter?What steps is your company currently taking to reduce the number of OSHA violations issued at stores, and would your company be willing to accept third-party audits of workplace safety and health conditions and publish the results of such audits publicly?Will you commit to ensuring that those employees who call your tip line are given total anonymity, including the location of their store, and that any tips will not be used in any way for anti-organizing or anti-union efforts?Among the purposes of our country's labor laws is to encourage collective bargaining and to curtail private sector management practices that may harm the general welfare of workers.  We take those purposes very seriously.  In these difficult times, it is paramount that we empower workers to use their voices, both individually and collectively.  As such, we encourage you to end your company's union suppression and avoidance tactics, and respectfully request a response to these questions by June 1, 2020.

Republican,Thom Tillis,Senate Democrats Call Out Speaker Pelosi's Refusal To Send Articles of Impeachment to the Senate,"Today, Speaker Nancy Pelosi once again refused to commit to when she will send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, an indefinite delay now at 22 days and counting following the House's partisan impeachment vote.

Senator Thom Tillis penned an op-ed this week highlighting how House Democrats have lost the ""urgency"" that they claimed was their justification for rushing through the impeachment process. Now, many Senate Democrats are echoing the call for Speaker Pelosi to send over the articles of impeachment so the Senate can begin the trial. 

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear that the Senate will operate using similar bipartisan rules established for the Clinton impeachment trial, rules that unanimously passed the Senate 100-0 at the time. 

""Speaker Pelosi knows that House Democrats deliberately rushed through their impeachment process and produced a weak case against President Trump, which is why she is embarrassed to present their evidence to the Senate,"" said Senator Tillis. ""There is clear bipartisan consensus in the Senate that it's time for House Democrats to end the delay and their political posturing and allow the Senate to begin the impeachment trial. If and when House Democrats stop wasting the nation's time and forge the courage to send over the articles of impeachment, the Senate will fulfill its constitutional obligation by examining the evidence collected by the House, hearing from both sides, and then rendering a verdict.""

What Senate Democrats Are Saying About Speaker Pelosi's Impeachment Delay

Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA): ""The longer it goes on the less urgent it becomes. So, if it's serious and urgent, send them over. If it isn't, don't send it over.""

Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT): ""I think the time has passed. She should send the articles over.""

Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT): ""We are reaching a point where the articles of impeachment should be sent.""

Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV): ""I think it needs to start, I really do.""

Senator Doug Jones (D-AL): ""I'm hoping they will come over here soon. I think most people are ready to get moving on this.""

Senator Jon Tester (D-MT): ""I don't know what leverage we have. It looks like the cake is already baked.""

 The deal provides $320 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program co-authored by Senator Collins, which includes $60 billion for smaller lenders.  This brings total funding for the PPP to $670 billion so far.

Cramer, Colleagues Introduce Legislation to Prohibit Teleabortions","U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) this week introduced legislation to protect the sanctity of human life by prohibiting chemical abortions from being performed without the supervision of a healthcare provider. U.S. Senators John Kennedy (R-LA), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), James Lankford (R-OK), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Tim Scott (R-SC), and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) joined Cassidy as original cosponsors of the bill.

The Teleabortion Prevention Act would make it a federal offense for healthcare providers to perform a chemical abortion without first physically examining the patient, being present during the procedure, and scheduling a follow-up visit for the patient. This legislation builds on the efforts of several states to curtail teleabortion and care for mothers throughout their pregnancy.

The bill would also stop attempts by pro-abortion groups who use teleabortion to work around state law.

""Proponents of abortion say it should be a safe, rare decision made between a mother and a qualified doctor, but now there is a movement to provide abortions with little-to-no consultation with a physician.

Democrat,Ron Wyden,"Wyden, Oregon Labor, Ag and Business Leaders Hail Bipartisan Passage of New NAFTA","Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., hailed the passage of the new NAFTA trade agreement today, by a bipartisan 89-10 vote.

The updated agreement with Mexico and Canada includes strong new enforcement provisions by Wyden and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, along with modern digital trade rules to advance innovation and free speech, and new environmental protections.

""The version of NAFTA the Trump administration released in 2018 was fundamentally flawed, particularly because it was weak on enforcement. After a lot of work by members here in the Senate and in the House, the proposition of protecting American workers from trade cheats is now at the heart of this agreement. No more corporate race to the bottom coming at the expense of America's middle class. Today's broad, bipartisan vote in favor of the new NAFTA reflects the fact that putting workers first is absolutely essential to trade that Oregonians and the rest of America can support,"" Wyden said.

Wyden and Brown highlighted how the new labor enforcement rules require faster action with stronger penalties for foreign factories that violate labor laws in a Senate floor speech on Wednesday, and Wyden also spoke Wednesday on how the new deal address flaws in the original NAFTA.

Oregon labor, agriculture and business leaders also praised the updated agreement and Wyden's work to secure it.

""After decades of disastrous consequences for working families and nearly two years of renegotiation, NAFTA has finally been rewritten in a way that makes trade rules in the U.S. fairer,"" said Oregon AFL-CIO President Graham Trainor. ""Thanks to the perseverance of working people across the country and our allies in Congress, the new USMCA contains the first truly enforceable labor standards, raising the bar for future trade negotiations. While it's far from perfect, working people relentlessly demanded a deal that benefits workers over corporate profits and have now secured an agreement we can support. Thanks to Senators Wyden and Brown for standing strong with workers to demand a truly enforceable agreement.""

""The USMCA is far better than NAFTA and we owe Senators Brown and Wyden a debt of gratitude for their efforts,"" said Joe Ybarguen, President of United Steelworkers' Oregon Legislation and Education Committee and Business Manager for Local 8378. ""It is up to the U.S., Canada and Mexico to be vigilant with implementation and enforcement of the provisions set to protect workers rights and the environment.""

""The new NAFTA provides some much needed certainty to many of our members who view Canada & Mexico as important markets, said Skip Newberry, President of the Technology Association of Oregon. ""In particular some of the new provisions around strengthening intellectual property protections as well as providing certainty for internet-based companies as it relates to liability for content posted by users are all welcome improvements to the old NAFTA.""

""We appreciate Senator Wyden's leadership in ensuring these important export markets remain open,"" said Jana McKinney, Executive Director of the Oregon Winegrowers Association. ""Canada is the #1 export market for Oregon and U.S. wines. Senator Wyden's support for export promotion funding is allowing Oregon winemakers to expand activities in Canada and Mexico to help Oregon wineries fully realize the benefits of the USMCA.""

""The nursery and greenhouse industry, Oregon's largest sector of agriculture, supports passage of trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico,'' said Jeff Stone, Executive Director of the Oregon Association of Nurseries.  ""These two countries are important partners to the industry.  Canada in particular is the top trading partner for the industry.  Senator Wyden has been a critical leader in advocating for open trade and the export of environmentally beneficial green goods and works diligently to ensure that Oregon goods are not held up by petty artificial trade barriers around the globe.""

""I am very happy to see the Senate pass this updated trade agreement and appreciate Senator Wyden's leadership in negotiating a better deal for our state and for Oregon agriculture,"" said Walter Powell, Chair of the Oregon Wheat Commission. ""Mexico is US wheat's biggest customer, and this is a good agreement for US wheat and a good agreement for our milling customers in Mexico."" 

""USMCA is a win for U.S. dairy and all of American agriculture,"" said Patrick Criteser, president and CEO of the Tillamook County Creamery Association, the 110-year-old Oregon-based, farmer-owned dairy cooperative. ""Our industry's success depends on our critical North American partnerships and, by leveling the playing field with our trading partners, USMCA opens doors to a bright future and continued growth for U.S. dairy through exports to Canada and Mexico. We join with our peers across dairy and other industries in applauding this successful bipartisan effort, and we congratulate and thank Senator Wyden for his leadership on behalf of American agriculture and Oregon.""

""Our business is happy that Congress worked to get this trade agreement accomplished.  Senator Wyden has been a champion for Oregon trade, and we greatly appreciate his work,"" said Marty Myers, General Manager of Threemile Canyon Farms. ""This agreement is significant for our business and the Columbia Basin overall because both our major agricultural products -- dairy and potatoes -- benefit.  Mexico buys a lot of dairy and they love Oregon and U.S. potato products.""",2020-01-16,2020-W03
Democrat,Amy Klobuchar,Klobuchar-Backed Legislation to Improve the National Suicide Hotline and Veterans Suicide Crisis Line Passes Senate,"This week, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) announced that legislation she cosponsored to improve the National Suicide Hotline and Veteran Suicide Crisis Line (VCL) has passed the Senate. The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act would designate 9-8-8 as the three-digit number for a national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline.

""As we confront the coronavirus pandemic, we must ensure that people suffering from mental health crises can easily access life-saving support,"" Klobuchar said. ""This three-digit number will enable those in need to get help during their darkest hours. While there is more work to do to improve access to mental health services for all Americans, this action by the Senate is an important step in connecting people with the support they deserve.""

Klobuchar has been a leader in the fight to improve mental health care for veterans.

In March 2020, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith (D-MN) sent a letter calling on the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) to increase access to Readjustment Counseling Services to help Minnesota veterans, servicemembers, and their families transition to both military and civilian life. In the letter, Klobuchar and Smith also highlighted the importance of mental health services - particularly in rural Minnesota - to combat Minnesota's rising veteran suicide rate.

In 2016, Klobuchar's bipartisan legislation with Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) to establish a patient self-scheduling appointment system at VA Medical Facilities was signed into law. The Faster Care for Veterans Act directs the Secretary of the VA to commence a pilot program under which veterans could use the internet to schedule and confirm appointments for health care at VA medical facilities.

In 2016, legislation that she and Senator John Thune (R-SD) led to improve the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) was signed into law. The No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act would require that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop a quality assurance plan to identify performance metrics and objectives to improve the effectiveness of the VCL.

In 2015, legislation she cosponsored to help prevent veteran suicides was signed into law by the President. The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act helps expand access to mental health services for veterans by establishing a loan repayment program to help the VA recruit more psychiatric specialists, enhances resources for veterans transitioning into civilian life, and improves the VA's ability to address traumatic brain injuries. She also introduced the Service Member Mental Health Review Act in 2013 to help veterans who may have been discharged with improper mental health diagnoses get their records corrected and their benefits restored.",2020-05-15,2020-W20

Republican,Chuck Grassley,"Providing Emergency Assistance and Health Care Response for Individuals, Families, and Businesses Affected By the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic","BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, all 100 Senators are hearing from our  constituents about the urgency of our acting. If we aren't hearing  about the urgency of our acting, we are hearing about the questions  they have about the future economy, as they read about businesses being  in trouble, restaurants shutting down, and schools closing. All of  these decisions that have brought doubt to the minds of our  constituents have been caused by governmental action as a result of the  virus pandemic, the world health pandemic, that has been expressed. 

  We have to respond to that, and I think the leader has said how  urgently he takes the response that our constituents expect from us and  that we have a responsibility for taking action. This is an urgent time  for us. 

  As Americans continue to do their part to curb the spread of  coronavirus and the pandemic that it has been called, we are doing our  part here in the Senate to support Americans, and that includes their  families and their jobs. 

  Congress passed two bills quickly to step up the government's ability  to combat the virus and to provide greater security for families whose  incomes have been disrupted by containment efforts. Those two bills-- one signed just last night by the President--were very bipartisan in  these efforts. We need to continue that bipartisanship. 

  We are now working, as the leader just introduced, on a bold and  comprehensive effort to provide additional relief to Americans and our  economy in this challenging time, to respond to the anxiety that the  American people have that I previously said was caused by government-- and not just the Federal Government but State governments maybe in 50  different ways because of 50 different States and by many local  governments in different ways, as they felt they needed to take action.  I have already referred to shutting down restaurants, schools closing,  et cetera. That speaks to how it affects the individuals we are trying  to help. 

  I am chairman of the Finance Committee, as my colleagues know. I have  been working with my colleagues around the clock to find opportunities  in the Tax Code to reduce stress on American taxpayers and the  businesses that create the jobs and the businesses that are probably  closed now and their workers laid off. 

  Our small group of colleagues is working to help the American  taxpayers and the businesses so that jobs continue. We first adopted a  do-no-harm approach. We want to ensure that routine government  processes don't add to the strain that everybody has out there. We do  this by issuing recovery assistance to American families in the form of  checks that can go out the door in short order. These direct payments  could be as much as $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for couples, with  additional assistance to families. Obviously, the purpose of this is to  provide immediate relief to folks who are facing cash flow problems in  their families as they stay home to stop the spread of this virus. 

  To avoid in-person meetings with tax preparers in the midst of the  pandemic, we are extending the tax filing deadline from April 15 to  July 15, and of course we all know that the administration has already  deferred collection of taxes until July or later. So this will help  families defer filing costs and avoid meetings that could put folks at  risk at this time of--who knows how far the effect of this virus is  going to be. The deadline for quarterly estimated tax payments will  also be postponed for 180 days. 

  We encourage those able to lend a financial hand by providing  additional deductions for charitable giving. This includes suspending  the deduction limitation for cash donations by individuals and easing  the limitation on donations of cash and food inventories by businesses.  Additionally, for those who do not itemize, a new deduction will be  available for everyone who gives, regardless of how you file your  taxes. 

  American businesses, as we know, are the engine of our economy, and  we stand ready to help them as well. American business men and women  are our job providers, and we need to make sure that they can keep  their doors open--or if those doors are closed today, to reopen them-- and that the payrolls they have going out to those individual workers  and families across the Nation can be maintained. 

  Our proposal includes items to improve cash flow and liquidity for  businesses of all sizes. Businesses, including the self-employed, will  be able to defer their quarterly tax estimates 180 days and their  employer Social Security tax payments through 2020. 

  We are going to increase the limit on interest deductibility. We will  speed up the recovery of the alternative minimum tax credits. We will  relax limitations on how companies use losses from previous years to  reduce their tax burdens. 

  These are just some of the many provisions in our proposal to  unburden businesses, particularly those that have liquidity problems,  so that they can keep employing those who are home with their families  and helping to prevent the spread of the virus. 

  I hope nobody tries to tell me or the rest of us that we are bailing  out business. We are in the job of preserving jobs. If those jobs have  been lost in the last 10 days because of this slowdown of the economy-- almost a shutdown of the economy--then we want those jobs to be brought  back. Workers are unemployed because of government's decisions--not the  employer's decision, not the employee's lack of hard work, but because  Federal, State, and local governments have stopped interaction among  people so that we don't spread this virus, and it is because of what  the World Health Organization has labeled a world health pandemic.  

  We don't see it as bad now as we do in Italy and other countries in  Europe. We hope we don't see it as bad as they have, but we just don't  know, and because we don't know, people have this anxiety. They don't  know about the future, and we ought to give some help to the future. 

  I described to you some of the things the Finance Committee is  working on. 

  I have also joined Senator Alexander and others to assist healthcare  workers and patients. This portion of the package includes several  Finance Committee provisions to help everyone fight the pandemic. For  example, we are adding additional flexibility to the health savings  accounts, bolstering telehealth services, and boosting Medicare  payments to healthcare providers. 

  We can contain this deadly virus without destroying livelihoods or  the Nation's economy, but right now, our constituents have doubt about  that, and this proposal the leader has put forth is to try to quiet  some of that anxiety. 

  These recommendations take bold steps to curb the economic fallout as  we work as a country to contain this pandemic. These proposals won't be  the end of the congressional response to the coronavirus. I think we  made clear that this is the third effort--two already signed by the  President of the United States--and there will probably be more. When  people want more than what is maybe here, there are going to be plenty  of opportunities for more. 

  I wish I could say we know by a certain date that this anxiety is  going to go away and we know this pandemic has slowed down enough that  we can go back to work and start interacting with our friends and  family to the same extent we always have and open up the restaurants. 

  I stand ready to continue identifying targeted relief as necessary to  help bridge the gap beyond this bill, but we need to take this next  step and do it quickly. 

  I want to thank Leader McConnell for convening our task forces to  quickly provide meaningful relief to families, individuals, and all  sectors of the economy. 

  The people I have been working with that I thank are Senators John  Thune, Rob Portman, Pat Toomey, Tim Scott, Tom Cotton, and Mitt Romney  for working with me on this package. Some of those Members are hard- working Members of the Finance Committee, and some aren't on the  committee because we wanted as broad an opinion as we could get. I know  our staffs work literally around the clock, so I want to recognize  their efforts as well.  

  So many Americans are working day and night to provide essential  services and efforts to combat this outbreak. We in Congress must be  prepared to do the same, and that is why you heard the leader a little  while ago saying that we are going to stay in until we get this job  done. We ought to applaud that type of leadership. 

  It is a commitment to keep the Senate open until we have done our  part, and I look forward to working with Democrats and the  administration to get this job done without delay. So maybe, if we work  hard Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, we can get a bill to the President  next week. Nobody should be going home until we have delivered this  needed relief. 

  We often spoke in World War II about the United States being the  arsenal of democracy. I still remember--I was only 9 years old-- December 7, 1941. And then I remember studying history and how we  ramped up production for the war effort. Can we ramp up production of  the respirators, protective gear, and testing kits we need? Can we do  it on the same scale we did in World War II--a scale that can help us  overcome this crisis? 

  I suppose you all remember the cry of ``Remember Pearl Harbor'' to  help us pull the country together to win that war. Can we think of  ``Remember coronavirus'' as an effort to pull this country together?  Because in those times, I remember we all pulled together to--let's  say, just one example--we all prided ourselves in planning what we  called victory gardens. We did it in unison, as we sought to defeat the  Axis powers. Can we pull together in the same way to slow the spread of  COVID-19 until our healthcare system catches up with something we never  anticipated, never could plan for? 

  I think this is a test of America's character, just like it was a  test of our character in World War II to pull together.

Democrat,Jeanne Shaheen,Shaheen Leads Bipartisan Legislation to Hold E-Cigarette Companies Accountable for the Youth Vaping Crisis,"This week, Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced bipartisan legislation to protect children from the dangers of e-cigarettes. The Resources to Prevent Youth Vaping Act would require that e-cigarette manufacturers pay user fees to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help to fund more activity at FDA to conduct stronger oversight of the e-cigarette industry and increase awareness for the danger of e-cigarettes. Companion legislation will be introduced in the House by Representative Cheri Bustos (D-IL17). 

""Teachers and parents are overwhelmed by the youth vaping crisis--a crisis that's the result of e-cigarette manufacturers marketing their products directly to young people. These companies should be on the hook for the funding to respond to this crisis,"" said Senator Shaheen. ""Teachers and parents shouldn't have to fight this fight alone. In New Hampshire, our high school students are using e-cigarettes more than their peers in every other state in the nation. This legislation gives FDA the authority and resources the agency needs to hold e-cigarette companies accountable, crack down on e-cigarette sales to minors and raise awareness among youth about the dangers of vaping. Congress and the Trump administration need to act to address this crisis and passing this legislation would be a major step forward."" 

""Data from 2019 indicates that more than 1 in 4 high school students have used e-cigarettes. I continue to work with my colleagues to take flavored products that are designed for no other purpose than to attract kids, off the market, but our efforts cannot stop there. As we face a growing epidemic of youth vaping, it is crucial to ensure that our agencies have the necessary resources to ensure that another generation of Americans do not become addicted to nicotine,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""This bill will create a more even regulatory playing field by expanding the existing FDA authority to collect user fees on traditional tobacco producers to include e-cigarette producers-- a significant and increasing share of the tobacco marketplace."" 

""The youth vaping epidemic has now hooked five million kids--an increase of 135 percent over the past two years of the Trump Administration,"" Senator Durbin said. ""This bill would impose a new user fee on e-cigarette companies, so that the FDA would have the resources it needs to better review and regulate these addictive products.  In order to protect an entire generation of children from nicotine addition, we must act now."" 

""The FDA currently assesses and collects user fees from manufacturers and importers of cigarettes and other forms of tobacco, but electronic nicotine devices are not subject to the same fees,"" Senator Romney said. ""By granting the FDA the authorization to collect user fees on e-cigarettes, our legislation builds on the positive work done so far to tackle the vaping crisis and protect our kids' health in Utah and across the country."" 

""The rise of teen vaping is an epidemic and we must take action to protect children from the dangers of e-cigarettes and prevent them from using harmful tobacco products,"" said Senator Baldwin. ""This legislation is an important step forward to fund stronger oversight of the e-cigarette industry and increase our prevention and youth awareness efforts."" 

""The dramatic increase in the use of e-cigarettes by our young people is threatening the progress we have made to reduce overall tobacco use. Teachers have talked with me about the growing epidemic of vaping in high schools and middle schools in Maine,"" said Senator Collins. ""This legislation would impose fees on e-cigarette manufacturers similar to fees for other tobacco products, which could be used to support youth education and prevention initiatives as well as greater enforcement activities such as age restrictions, marketing to children, and illegal products."" 

""Last year, we saw nearly 50 vaping deaths across the country, thousands of lung injuries and vaping rates among high school and middle school students skyrocket. Enough is enough,"" Congresswoman Bustos said. ""We must increase public awareness of the dangers of vaping and prevent any further harm. That's exactly what this bill will do. With this legislation, the FDA will be able to collect funding to implement awareness and prevention programs, all without costing taxpayers a dime. I want to thank Senator Sheehan for leading in the Senate and for all of our bipartisan sponsors. This bill will take us one step further in helping us prevent the negative health outcomes caused by vaping."" 

""The American Lung Association applauds Senators Shaheen and Murkowski for their leadership in ensuring the Food and Drug Administration has sufficient resources moving forward to complete its vital work in protecting our nation from all tobacco products,"" said Deborah P. Brown, Chief Mission Officer of the American Lung Association. ""The youth e-cigarette epidemic is commanding a significant portion of FDA's energies and the e-cigarette industry should pay its fair share of user fees."" 

""E-cigarette use among teens is skyrocketing, with more than 5 million youth using e-cigarettes, which is why we need strong legislation like this to protect youth from dangerous and addictive products. We are grateful to Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) for introducing the Resources to Prevent Youth Vaping Act and for her continued work to help address the e-cigarette crisis in our nation."" -- The American Heart Association 

Background

In recent years, the use of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) products, such as JUUL, has skyrocketed, particularly among teens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that:

-E-cigarette use among high school students rose from 1.5 percent of students in 2011 to 27.5 percent of students in 2019.-E-cigarette use among middle school students also grew, from 0.6 percent of students in 2011 to 10.5 percent of students in 2019.-The availability of flavored e-cigarettes, and easily-concealable vaping products, like JUUL, have made e-cigarettes more popular among youth.

The Resources to Prevent Youth Vaping Act increases the total amount that will be collected in tobacco user fees by $100 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and indexes that amount to inflation for future years. Critically, the bill also authorizes FDA to collect user fees from all manufacturers of products that have been deemed as tobacco products by FDA, including e-cigarettes. Currently, manufacturers of traditional combustible tobacco products pay into FDA user fees, but e-cigarette companies are exempt due to a loophole in the law. The amount collected from individual e-cigarette manufacturers will be proportional to their share of the overall tobacco market, as determined by FDA. This approach is consistent with the Trump administration's e-cigarette user fee proposal included in the FY 2020 Budget. FDA would be able to use this additional revenue from e-cigarette user fees to conduct safety review of vaping products, prevent sales of e-cigarettes to minors, help support efforts to educate youth on the dangers of e-cigarettes and increase the agency's oversight capabilities. 

Senator Shaheen has prioritized efforts in the Senate to tackle the youth vaping crisis. Over the past year, she has repeatedly pressed the Trump administration to remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market and stop delaying action in implementing the planned restrictions on flavored products. Shaheen has led legislation -- the E-Cigarette Youth Protection Act -- which would require e-cigarette companies to pay fees to the FDA to help fund federal prevention efforts and ensure that the agency has the resources needed to conduct enforcement actions against e-cigarette manufacturers. She's also held multiple meetings with students, educators, law enforcement and health officials across the state about the ongoing public health concern. In September, Shaheen introduced the No Tax Subsidies for E-Cigarette and Tobacco Ads Act, which would close a tax loophole that allows manufacturers to claim federal tax deductions for the cost of advertising e-cigarettes and tobacco products. Shaheen and Murkowski also helped introduce the E-Cigarette Device Standards Act, which would set safety standards in the design of e-cigarette and vaping devices to prevent the use of e-cigarettes to vape Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)--a combination that has been linked to the vast majority of vaping illnesses.",2020-01-22,2020-W04
Democrat,Amy Klobuchar,"Letter to the Hon. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States - Members of Minnesota Congressional Delegation Urge Administration to Approve Minnesota Request for Major Disaster Declaration","Dear President Trump:

We write to urge you to approve Minnesota's request for a major declaration due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As the State continues to confront this crisis, additional assistance from the federal government is essential.

All of Minnesota's 87 counties and 11 tribes have been affected by the spread of the pandemic. As of April 5, the State had 935 positive cases and 29 deaths, with those affected ranging in age from 4 months to 104 years old. Minnesota's health care facilities are confronting a lack of needed supplies and limited capacity, which will be exacerbated by a limited number of qualified medical staff that is expected to decrease further as the pandemic continues to spread. At the same time, the State's economy has been dramatically impacted by this crisis, with approximately 300,000 applications for unemployment having been filed since the pandemic's onset and businesses small and large facing sharp declines in revenues.

It is for these reasons that we ask for your timely approval of this request. As specified in the Governor's letter, we ask that you issue an expedited major disaster declaration for Public Assistance (PA) Category B (emergency protective measures), and authorize the provision of aid through the following individual assistance programs: Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Program, Individuals and Households Program, Other Needs Assistance to include Medical Assistance, Crisis Counseling, Funeral Services, Disaster Legal Services, and Small Business Administration Disaster Assistance, as well as statewide Hazard Mitigation.

Republican,Ted Cruz,Sen. Cruz: I Applaud the Trump Administration for Protecting Religious Freedom for Students and Religious Organizations,"U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, today issued the following statement applauding President Trump for proposing new rules to protect religious freedom for students and organizations:

""By protecting the right to express one's faith at school or through a religious organization, the Trump administration is taking a stand for one of our most fundamental freedoms. Increasingly, we see religious freedom and conscience rights vilified by an intolerant segment of liberal elites, the media, academia, and the entertainment industry. The space in which it is deemed acceptable to practice one's faith shrinks each and every day. The threats to religious freedom are never ceasing, and we need candor and resolve if we are going to identify these threats and stop them.

""The United States has inherited a rich tradition of religious freedom, and I'm thankful the Trump administration is taking concrete steps to stand up for Americans of faith.""

Background: The Trump administration's proposed rules would reverse Obama-era regulations that single out religious organizations and would enable religious organizations to compete for funding on a level playing field without being discriminated against. The administration is also taking action to protect the right of students to pray and express their religious beliefs at school.",2020-01-17,2020-W03
Republican,James Risch,-9999,"Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Ricketts for those very  clear remarks that demonstrate exactly why this needs to be done.

I myself for a long time have hoped to see our European partners wake  up to the extreme threat that we all face from a nuclear Iran. Today,  we are 10 years on from President Obama's failed nuclear deal with  Iran. Over the last 10 years, Iran has enjoyed unwarranted sanctions  relief, and time is short before the opportunity expires to snap back  sanctions, as has been described by my colleague from Nebraska.

This resolution would make it clear that the U.S. Senate understands  the threats we face from a nuclear Iran and urges our UK, French, and  German partners to immediately trigger snapback sanctions pursuant to  U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231. We cannot afford to wait until  the end of August. Initiating the snapback process would be right and a  long-overdue move and would deny Iran the resources it uses for its  terror agenda.

The 2015 deal flooded Iran with cash while allowing it low-level  enrichment, a clock to simply wait out, no limitations on ballistic  missiles, and nothing to rein in terror proxies. Years down the line,  the sanctions relief Iran received from this deal directly funded  Iran's terror proxies and led to Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.

Iran's ejection of the International Atomic Energy Agency from its  facilities marked the latest in a long chain of violations of Iran's  nuclear commitments. These actions confirmed what we have known all  along: The Iran nuclear program is not civilian, as they claim; it is  the pursuit of a bomb to destroy Israel and threaten U.S. national  security interests in the region.

The international community must not tolerate this activity any  longer. The decision to initiate the snapback process is only the  beginning. The U.N. Security Council must fully process and formally  reinstate U.N. sanctions without delay. Furthermore, once sanctions are  back in place, we must commit to their enforcement. Chinese purchases  of Iranian oil and illicit oil smuggling through third countries have  long violated existing U.N. sanctions. Once U.N. sanctions return, all  member countries will have a duty to crack down on this illegal  activity.

President Trump has once again instituted a maximum-pressure policy  to bring Iran to the negotiating table. I hope our European friends  will also take the next step to counter Iran's threat to regional and  global security for good. This resolution will communicate with our  European friends that it is the intent of this body to do so.

With that, I yield back to Senator Ricketts.",2025-07-23,2025-W30

Cramer Statement on the Defense Cuts in the Administration's 2021 Budget Proposal,"U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a member of the Senate Armed Services and Senate Budget committees, issued the following statement on defense cuts in the Trump Administration's 2021 Budget proposal:

""Each year the President delivers his budget proposal, then Congress gets to work on its own. The Administration's 2021 Budget contains several provisions I do not agree with. This includes cuts to intelligence gathering resources for our military, which protect our troops and global interests. I believe taking these assets off the battlefield and out of the hands of North Dakota's Airmen will create too much risk and hurt our national security. Through the Congressional budget process, I'll fight to ensure the needs of our military leaders are heard, properly addressed, and adequately funded.""",2020-02-10,2020-W07

As chairman of EPW's Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, I'm proud of the role I played in negotiating this draft legislation and the way we worked across the aisle to do so,"" Chairman Capito said. ""During these negotiations, I was able to secure many provisions that will have a positive impact in West Virginia--including improvements to our water and wastewater systems, unlocking more funding for our inland waterways infrastructure, and providing more support for our flood control infrastructure. Additionally, I was especially proud to have included a $120 million program I authored for water and wastewater infrastructure in Central Appalachia. This bipartisan legislation makes important changes and updates such as these that will help not only improve the health and wellbeing of West Virginians, but also others in communities across the nation. I look forward to moving this legislation into the final stages and making sure these measures and other legislative solutions remain in the bill throughout the process.""

The draft America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2020--authored by Senators Capito and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) who serve as chairman and ranking member of the EPW Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure--includes approximately $17 billion in new federal authorizations. Specifically, the bill will support our nation's economic competitiveness by increasing water storage, providing protection from dangerous floodwaters, deepening nationally significant ports, and maintaining the navigability of inland waterways across the country. It will also repair aging wastewater and irrigation systems.

The draft of the Drinking Water Infrastructure Act of 2020 includes approximately $2.5 billion in federal authorizations. It reauthorizes programs under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to provide resources and technical assistance to communities to help meet their drinking water needs.

In lieu of a hearing, the EPW Committee will hold an information gathering process on the draft legislation starting on April 22, 2020.",2020-04-21,2020-W17
Republican,Josh Hawley,"Letter to the Hon. William Barr, Attorney General for the Dept. of Justice - Senator Hawley Requests Criminal Antitrust Investigation of Amazon","Dear Attorney General Barr: 

I write to ask you to open a criminal antitrust investigation of Amazon. Recent reports suggest that Amazon has engaged in predatory and exclusionary data practices to build and maintain a monopoly. These practices are alarming for America's small businesses even under ordinary circumstances. But at a time when most small retail businesses must rely on Amazon because of coronavirus-related shutdowns, predatory data practices threaten these businesses' very existence.

Antitrust law imposes criminal penalties on companies that try to acquire or maintain monopoly power. Amazon's data practices, as reported by the Wall Street Journal,[1] appear to meet that description. Amazon abuses its position as an online platform and collects detailed data about merchandise so Amazon can create copycat products under an Amazon brand. Internal documents and the testimony of more than 20 former Amazon employees support this finding.

The kind of data Amazon can access poses a much greater threat to competition than the data accessible to ordinary retail stores. Brick-and-mortar stores collect data, such as how often third-party products are purchased, when they are purchased, and whether they are purchased in combination with other products. But online retailers like Amazon can collect so much more data. They can track how long a person's attention lingers on a product, which features attract a person's attention, which images a person views and for how long, and what reviews a person reads. Amazon's capacity for data collection is like a brick-and-mortar retailer attaching a camera to every customer's forehead.

Amazon appears to recognize that using this data to develop its own merchandise is problematic. Indeed, Amazon insists it has adopted policies prohibiting this conduct. Yet Amazon's own employees and documents suggest that what Amazon says in its policies and what Amazon does in practice are two different things.

Even if Amazon's statements are true, they are hardly reassuring. Amazon does not deny that it uses precise, intrusive data to create its own merchandise. It simply claims that the data it uses is aggregate instead of ""seller-specific."" But when it comes to anticompetitive data practices, this distinction makes little, if any, difference. The Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon used data to make a copycat product even when 99.95% of the original product came from a single seller. Amazon's aggregate data technically covered two sellers, but it was functionally seller-specific. In any event, aggregate data can still enable Amazon to create or solidify monopoly power. Using aggregate data just means that, when Amazon uses data to create copycat products, it harms multiple small businesses instead of just one.

Abusing one's position as a marketplace platform to create copycat products always is bad, but it is especially concerning now. Thousands of small businesses have been forced to suspend in-store retail and instead rely on Amazon because of shutdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic. Amazon's reported data practices are an existential threat that may prevent these businesses from ever recovering.

The European Union already has opened an investigation into reports that Amazon uses data anticompetitively to target third-party sellers. In the light of the enormous evidence already gathered, I ask that you look into this issue and open a criminal antitrust investigation of Amazon.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.",2020-04-28,2020-W18
