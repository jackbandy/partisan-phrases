Democrat,Christopher A. Coons,"Mayor Garcetti and Sen. Coons call to expand ""locally led and driven' response to COVID-19","Today, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) joined MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Reports to discuss Sen. Coons' legislation to expand national service to respond to COVID-19.

""We have got millions of people out of work and hundreds of thousands of jobs we need filled. The quicker we can get them doing contact tracing, helping individuals and businesses with benefits from the federal government, maybe even doing things like cleaning up cities and investing in infrastructure, the quicker we can get this economy back going. So for a few billion dollars, we could unleash a trillion dollars of economic activity sooner,"" said Mayor Garcetti.

""This would be locally led and driven by commissions that already exist all over our country, appointed by governors, that include nonprofit leaders, state and local government leaders, civic leaders and they would approve specifically targeted programs,"" said Senator Coons. ""In some states and cities they might do contact tracing or testing. In others they might help with combating hunger by supporting food banks. In others they might work to support education, to provide needed enrichment and connectivity over the summer and into the fall. There are lots of different ways that a new generation of Americans can step forward and serve our nation.""

The Pandemic Response and Opportunity Through National Service Act would fund 750,000 national service positions over a three-year response and recovery period to meet the need for hundreds of thousands of people to help with public health efforts like screening and testing, as well as food assistance, education support, and more. Under the bill, the number of AmeriCorps and national service positions could expand from 75,000 to 150,000 the first year and double to 300,000 in years two and three. The bill would also expand partnerships between AmeriCorps and federal health agencies and increase the AmeriCorps living allowance to ensure all Americans can step up to serve regardless of their financial circumstances.

Full audio and video available here. A transcript is provided below.

Q: With states reopening despite warnings of a possible second wave of COVID-19 infections, there's still no unified federal plan to test, contact trace and ensure vital services are not interrupted. But now there is growing support for planning and funding programs like AmeriCorps to do exactly that. Joining me now are Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who are both supporting these initiatives. Senator Coons, we have talked to you before about the legislation which is bipartisan. How would this work? Sen. Coons: Well, Andrea, thanks for a chance to be on, and great to be on with my friend Mayor Garcetti, who's helped lead this initiative in Los Angeles and cities across the country. We have more than 80 co-sponsors in the House and the Senate of a bipartisan bill that would expand the existing national service program best known as AmeriCorps. It would increase the pay modestly. It would increase the education award earned by members, but it would double this year the number of opportunity slots. So that would make it possible for 150,000 Americans who are currently unemployed or who are looking for an opportunity to serve to be engaged in response. This would be locally led and driven by commissions that already exist all over our country, appointed by governors, that include nonprofit leaders, state and local government leaders, civic leadersand they would approve specifically targeted programs. In some states and cities they might do contact tracing or testing. In others they might help with combating hunger by supporting food banks. In others they might work to support education, to provide needed enrichment and connectivity over the summer and into the fall. There are lots of different ways that a new generation of Americans can step forward and serve our nation. I'm grateful Mayor Garcetti has led a letter that has more than 50 bipartisan mayors supporting this bill around the country. 

Q: And Mayor Garcetti, you've been a leader out in Califpornia. You've already started expanding contact tracing. How would this work in cities such as yours, as you have one of the largest cities in the country, obviously? 

Mayor Garcetti: Well I want to thank Senator Coons for his extraordinary leadership. I'm proud to be alongside him and all of my fellow brother and sister mayors from both parties and across this country. Look. Simply put, we have got millions of people out of work and hundreds of thousands of jobs we need filled. The quicker we can get them doing contact tracing, helping individuals and businesses with benefits from the federal government, maybe even doing things like cleaning up cities and investing in infrastructure, the quicker we can get this economy back going. So for a few billion dollars, we could unleash a trillion dollars of economic activity sooner. Our state says we need a certain number of contact tracers. We're quickly trying to get that, but we have got out-of-work people and we've got this need, and this is a beautiful way of coming together just as we did during the depression with the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Cold War with the Peace Corps, during the war on poverty with the Teacher Corps. It's time for this generation to have its C.A.R.E.S. Corps that can step up, stand up and do this for America. 

Q: Let me ask you both of you also; the president is now leaving for Michigan. He's going into a state that requires wearing a face covering. He hasn't said yet, as far as I know, whether or not he is going to wear a mask. He has not been seen wearing one and he's also, as you know, done things that go against CDC guidelines and against FDA warnings in taking a risky medication. Mayor Garcetti, what should the president do in terms of the way he models behavior for the rest of the country? 

Mayor Garcetti: Simply put, he's our Commander in Chief. I say real men wear face masks. When they're going to be with other people in public, it's our gateway to increasing freedom and more economic activity and greater opening up. I think modeling that is something so important for all of our leaders, and any men who don't want to wear face masks, we've got to get over ourselves and just do it. 

Q: Senator Coons, your view on all of this?

Sen. Coons: Andrea, I just took my mask off for the beginning of this interview and will be putting it back on as soon as I'm off camera. Scientific studies have shown if folks simply wear face masks regularly, we can cut transmission by 80%. Our president is a role model for many in our country. As we heard on your last segment, when he started talking about hydroxychloroquine as a possible preventive, the numbers of folks trying to get on this medication, taking this medication went up dramatically in the United States. I was once decades ago on hydroxychloroquine but for an appropriate prescribed purpose, preventing malaria when I was a student in Africa decades ago. There is no demonstrated positive benefit from this. So when President Trump refuses to take simple steps to follow science, to follow our public health leaders like Dr. Fauci and the recommendations that we've heard from organizations and entities around the country that are responsible for leadership on this, he is not just setting a bad example but in some ways actively misleading the American people in a way that has prolonged this tragedy. Sometime in the next few days we will pass the mark of 100,000 Americans who will have died from this pandemic in every state, in every territory. We need leadership that helps us show the way forward out of this. 

Q: Senator Coons, thank you so very much. Mayor Garcetti, as always, it's great to have you with us as well. Thanks and be safe."
Democrat,Margaret Wood Hassan,"Letter to the Hon. Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the Dept. of the Treasury, and the Hon. Jovita Carranza, Admin, of the Small Business Administration - Senator Hassan Urges Trump Administration to Provide Guidance to NH's Small Businesses and Non-Profits Regarding Forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program Loans","Dear Secretary Mnuchin and Administrator Carranza:

 

I write to urge the Treasury and the Small Business Administration (SBA) to promptly issue thorough guidance that details the conditions under which small employers and self-employed individuals are eligible for loan forgiveness under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) that was created by Congress as part of the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

 

According to the SBA, as of May 8, nearly 22,000 employers in New Hampshire have received more than $2.6 billion in PPP assistance. While I commend your agencies for your work in distributing these funds, I have heard from many business and non-profits in New Hampshire who are significantly concerned about the lack of guidance from the Treasury and SBA regarding forgiveness of PPP loans.

 

The relevant section of the Interim Final Rule published by your agencies on April 2 is not sufficient to provide clarity to employers and self-employed individuals who are currently working with their lenders to ensure that they receive PPP loan forgiveness. For example, businesses and non-profits in New Hampshire still need detailed guidance regarding the documentation and calculation of relevant expenses, including payroll and other eligible expenses. This uncertainty makes it impossible for struggling employers in New Hampshire to prepare for and plan on receiving PPP loan forgiveness.

 

Further, for the many employers who received PPP assistance during the first round of applications that began on April 3, it is especially urgent that your agencies publish this guidance as soon as possible. Given the requirement in Treasury and SBA regulations requiring that employers use PPP funds during the 8 weeks following loan disbursal, many employers who received assistance in the first round of PPP will soon approach the end of this period and require clear guidance regarding loan forgiveness.

 

Thank you for your agencies' work in assisting thousands of employers in New Hampshire who are struggling during the COVID-19 crisis."
Democrat,Tammy Baldwin,"Letter to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, and Eugene Scalia, Secretary of Labor - Baldwin Presses Trump Administration to Prioritize Recruitment and Retention at Job Corps Centers","Dear Secretary Perdue and Secretary Scalia, 

I write to inquire about the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Labor's (DOL) actions to prioritize the training needs and enrollment of students impacted by the announcement to deactivate U.S. Forest Service Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers.

On May 24, 2019, the Department of Labor announced the termination of an interagency agreement that provided for the operation of 25 Civilian Conservation Centers (CCC) within the U.S. Forest Service. Over a third of CCC program facilities were slated for permanent closure. Thankfully, after strong bipartisan opposition, this plan was scrapped. However, these facilities now need assistance in retaining and recruiting students.

Following the May 24th announcement, our office heard from students who not only feared they would be unable to complete their training because they were told their Center was slated for closure, but that they also feared they would lose their homes.  Most Job Corps Centers are residential facilities and living on site is a requirement.  For some students their home at Job Corps is the most secure and stable living environment they have ever experienced. 

I also heard from Job Corps Center Directors and Guidance Counselors that student recruitment and retention was impacted by the announced closure. Though the plan to close 25 Job Corps Centers was reversed, the language in that announcement left the door open to future closures and only added uncertainty for counselors recommending the Job Corps programs to students.  Following the closure announcement, some Center Directors were directed to advise students to start looking for a new home before they even completed their training program because their particular facility was slated for closure.

In an email dated August 9, 2019 from DOL's Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, my office was informed that DOL's Employment and Training Administration ""is working with the USDA to prioritize the training needs of impacted students"" including re-admission for those who may have left in the wake of the announcement. Given the media coverage and bipartisan pushback of this plan, it stands to reason that some prospective students and employers are unaware that the CCC is still open or worry that the centers are still slated for closure, hampering the ability of CCC staff to recruit new students. Therefore, I request that your departments establish a plan to recruit and retain students.

In addition, please provide answers to the following questions.

How have student recruitment and retention efforts been impacted by the proposed closure of the 25 U.S. Forest Service Civilian Conservation Centers (CCC) overall and individually at each of the 25 centers?What were the student enrollment numbers for the two reporting periods before, and after the May 24, 2019, announcement to terminate the interagency agreement between the Department of Labor and the U.S. Forest Service at the 25 CCCs?Have CCCs had students who left the Job Corp Program while it was slated for closure and then didn't return to the program after the Administration rescinded its original plan?  If so, what are your departments doing to help these student finish their training?Please explain in detail what DOL and USDA have done to prioritize the training needs of impacted students, including re-admitting students to the program since the May 24, 2019, announcement?Please explain the newly established metrics and ways USDA and DOL plan to collect data that USDA said was necessary to measure success mentioned in Secretary Perdue's July 9th 2019 letter to Congress.What have your agencies done to inform the public, particularly those who direct or recruit students to the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers, that the Centers will not be closed and Centers are still accepting applicants?I look forward to your prompt reply."
Republican,Mitch McConnell,Executive Session,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. McCONNELL.  111. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT"
Republican,Martha McSally,Rep. Kirkpatrick and Sen. McSally Introduce Bill to Designate Jan. 8th Memorial as a National Memorial,"Today, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick and Senator Martha McSally, along with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, introduced companion bills in the House and Senate to affiliate the soon-to-be completed January 8th Memorial in Tucson with the National Park System, thereby making it a National Memorial.

On January 8th, 2011, a gunman opened-fire on Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords ""Congress on Your Corner"" event being held at a grocery store in Tucson. The shooting wounded 13 and killed six members of our community. Congresswoman Giffords was among those wounded, as was her District Director at the time, Ron Barber, who went on to represent AZ-02 in Congress. Today, Ron is once again serving as District Director, this time for Rep. Kirkpatrick, and we are better for having him.

In the wake of this tragedy, the community showed extraordinary resilience. Three spontaneous memorials came together -- at the site of the shooting, at University Medical Center, and at Congresswoman Giffords' Tucson district office. These memorials were maintained for a time, but it soon became clear a more permanent memorial was necessary. Eventually, it was determined the permanent memorial should be located in and around the Old Pima County Courthouse in Tucson. That's where, today, the Memorial is under construction. 

The January 8th National Memorial Act will bolster the Memorial's standing and recognize the events of January 8th, 2011, for what they were -- a national tragedy followed by an incredible outpouring of support throughout our community and the whole country. 

""The heartbreaking attack that took place nine years ago today didn't just impact my hometown of Tucson, it shook the nation. The memorial will honor the victims but also celebrate the resilience of my community, and that resilience deserves to be elevated,""said Rep. Kirkpatrick. ""I am proud to work with my Arizona colleagues on introducing this legislation shinning a light, nationally, on the good resilience that can defeat hateful violence.""

""Nine years ago today, a horrific attack in Tucson shook our community to the core. As Americans, we must all stand united against these senseless acts of violence on our representative government,"" McSally said. ""Our bill will allow for a permanent January 8th Memorial as a tribute to the lives lost and as a reminder of what makes our method of governing so great."" Original Cosponors of the House January 8th National Memorial Act include: Reps. Biggs, Gallego, Grijalva, Lesko, O'Halleran, Schweikert, & Stanton."
Republican,Bill Cassidy,"Cassidy, Hassan Statement on Proposals to Address Surprise Medical Bills from Two House Committees","U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) released the following statement on the surprise medical billing proposals from the House Education and Labor Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. In December, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee -- on which both Senators serve -- and the House Energy and Commerce Committee released a bipartisan, bicameral compromise that incorporated considerable feedback and work from the two Senators. 

""The stories we hear from constituents about surprise medical bills are outrageous and completely unfair. We've been working with members of both parties for well over a year to end this practice, and there is widespread bipartisan agreement in both Congress and the White House that we need to pass legislation to address this issue. We are encouraged to see movement on this issue in the House, and we will continue working with our colleagues in both the House and Senate to get patients these vital protections without delay.""

Cassidy and Hassan have led efforts to address surprise medical bills and worked for months with members from both parties to craft the STOP Surprise Medical Bills Act to end this practice. Last May, Cassidy and Hassan joined President Trump at a White House event on the need to address this issue. Last June, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee -- on which both Senators serve -- passed legislation to end surprise medical bills, and the Senators have continued to work closely with HELP Committee leadership and colleagues from both parties over the ensuing months to get bipartisan legislation to address this pressing issue facing patients across the finish line."
Republican,Marco Rubio,Soto Announces $40 Million Water Infrastructure Loan to Toho Water Authority,"Rep. Darren Soto (FL-09) announced  a $40 million Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  to the Toho Water Authority in Kissimmee, Florida. The loan will help finance projects that will improve the efficiency of the existing sewer and wastewater management systems and support community growth without needing to expand the existing wastewater treatment facility.

 

""We thank the EPA for approving this major project to improve water quality and supply for Central Florida,"" said Rep. Soto ""This will greatly assist our growing region while ensuring our beautiful Kissimmee Chain of Lakes, Kissimmee River and other sensitive water bodies remain protected.""

 

""I have been a champion of Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act funds since I joined the Senate Appropriations Committee, and I am proud that Kissimmee will benefit from this critical federal investment,"" Senator Rubio said. ""Toho Water Authority will utilize the $40 million loan to finance projects that will improve water quality and support Kissimmee's local economy. I applaud the administration for its continued commitment and investment in Florida's critical infrastructure.""

 

Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Noah Valenstein said, ""through these loans, EPA is providing critical funding and support as the Toho Water Authority in Kissimmee, Florida works to improve their sewer and wastewater management systems. We applaud EPA's commitment to improving Florida's water quality.""

""Toho's investment in these projects will continue to improve the reliability of our wastewater infrastructure while demonstrating our ongoing commitment to safeguarding public health and the State's water quality,"" said Toho Water Authority, Board Chairman, Clarence Thacker. ""We are grateful to the EPA and Congress, including our local delegation which includes Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Rick Scott and Congressman Darren Soto, who have made the acceleration of our wastewater infrastructure improvements possible through this low-interest WIFIA loan program.

 

""Toho's investment in these projects will continue to improve the reliability of our wastewater infrastructure while demonstrating our ongoing commitment to safeguarding public health and the State's water quality,"" said Toho Water Authority, Board Chairman, Clarence Thacker. ""We are grateful to the EPA and Congress, including our local delegation which includes Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Rick Scott and Congressman Darren Soto, who have made the acceleration of our wastewater infrastructure improvements possible through this low-interest WIFIA loan program.""

 

""This WIFIA loan will improve water quality and support the economy of Kissimmee while delivering on President Trump's commitment to upgrade our nation's infrastructure, create jobs and safeguard public health and the environment,"" said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. ""With this loan closing, EPA has now issued 16 WIFIA loans totaling more than $3.5 billion in credit assistance to help finance more than $8 billion for water infrastructure projects while creating more than 16,000 jobs.""

 

""By investing in water infrastructure, the Toho Water Authority is improving water quality in their community and protecting public health,"" said EPA Region 4 Administrator Mary S. Walker. ""Through the WIFIA loan program, EPA works to fund critical repairs necessary to strengthen our wastewater treatment and drinking water distribution systems.""

 

Toho Water Authority will repair, rehabilitate and replace sewer mains, sewer lines and manholes, including 65 wastewater pumping station basins and over 900,000 feet of gravity mains. The project will mitigate emergency failures such as sanitary sewer overflows that result from problems with the current infrastructure. The project will also reduce inflow and infiltration into the gravity sewer system. These improvements will benefit 300,000 people by effectively increasing treatment capacity while allowing further community growth without expanding the existing wastewater treatment facility.

 

This project--referred to as the Accelerated Gravity Sewer Assessment and Rehabilitation project--will cost $81.9 million. EPA's WIFIA loan will finance nearly half of that figure--up to $40.1 million. The WIFIA loan will save the Toho Water Authority an estimated $7.9 million compared to typical bond financing. Project construction and operation are expected to create 198 jobs.

Background on WIFIA

 

Established by the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014, the WIFIA program is a federal loan and guarantee program administered by EPA. WIFIA's aim is to accelerate investment in the nation's water infrastructure by providing long-term and low-cost supplemental credit assistance for regionally and nationally significant projects. EPA's WIFIA program plays an important part in President Trump's infrastructure plan, which calls for expanding project eligibility. The WIFIA program has an active pipeline of pending applications for projects that will result in billions of dollars in water infrastructure investment and thousands of jobs. In 2019, EPA selected 38 new projects to apply for WIFIA loans, totaling approximately $6 billion to help finance over $12 billion in water infrastructure investments. The selected projects will help support key agency priorities, including reducing lead and emergent contaminants and developing water reuse and recycling capacity. Together, the selected projects will improve water quality for 24 million people in 18 states."
Democrat,"Joe Manchin, III",Manchin Secures Floor Time For Great American Outdoors Act,"U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, released the following statement after he successfully secured floor time for the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) when the Senate returns from legislative recess in June.

""I am excited to get to work on passing the Great American Outdoors Act when we return from recess in June. The GAOA is an example of the important, bipartisan work that can be accomplished when we put politics aside and work together for the American people. In West Virginia, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is responsible for much of the access to the Gauley and New rivers. GAOA will permanently fund this important program. It will also finally address the gigantic maintenance backlog in our national parks.

""As we all navigate the new reality of the COVID-19 pandemic, our outdoor spaces are more important than ever. They also offer critical economic opportunities at a time when many are out of work through no fault of their own. This bill will be a historic achievement, an economic stimulus when we desperately need one and protect our most treasured outdoor lands for generations to come."""
Democrat,"Joe Manchin, III",Manchin Statement on Impeachment Decision,"U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on his impeachment decision.

""The charges brought against President Trump are serious and carry grave consequences for our nation. In establishing our new republic, the Framers of the Constitution risked everything to rebel against imperial rule and instead form a democratic government of checks and balances in which no one branch would have unlimited power. The greatest fear the Framers had was foreign intervention into our fragile democracy and they warned us of the tremendous harm toxic partisanship could have on our democratic system. Sadly the partisan episode that unfolded in the United States Senate betrays the duties entrusted to this body by the Constitution.

""The evidence presented by the House Managers, including video testimony of witnesses under oath in the House of Representatives, clearly supports the charges brought against the President in the articles of impeachment.

""I have always wanted a fair trial in the Senate, and I am disappointed the President, his counsel, and a majority of my Republican colleagues decided not to support the inclusion of additional witnesses and documents during the trial, resulting in the first Senate impeachment trial of a President without witnesses. And while the President may assert executive privilege, that privilege has limits and is not absolute. Despite the false claim that a President can do no wrong, the President is not entitled to act with blatant disregard for an equal branch of government or use the superpower status of the United States to condition our support of democracy and our allies on any political favor. That is not who we are as a country.

""Voting whether or not to remove a sitting President has been a truly difficult decision, and after listening to the arguments presented by both sides, I have reached my conclusion reluctantly. For the reasons above I must vote yes on the articles of impeachment. I take no pleasure in these votes, and am saddened this is the legacy we leave our children and grandchildren. I have always wanted this President, and every President to succeed, but I deeply love our country and must do what I think is best for the nation."""
Democrat,Richard J. Durbin,Durbin Statement On Bipartisan Coronavirus Aid Relief And Economic Security Act,"U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today released the following statement after the Senate passed, on a bipartisan basis, the third coronavirus stimulus package -- the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act:

""America and Illinois, help is on the way.

""After two emergency bills were enacted with strong, bipartisan support, I'm glad the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, passed this third, historic funding bill. 

""Like all compromises, this bill is not perfect.  However, because Senate Democrats insisted on strengthening this bill, we can now say it is a bill that puts our hospitals and health care professionals first.  Keeping working families strong during this crisis; giving small businesses the means to re-open; and reimbursing our state and local governments for the extraordinary sacrifices they are making were our goals from the start.  We have responded strongly to all of these priorities.

""As we continue to face this unprecedented public health crisis, I urge the House to pass this legislation quickly and for the President to sign it without delay.""

Senate Democrats made these significant improvements, among others, to the bill Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) originally introduced:

-Increases unemployment benefits for four months and expands unemployment insurance to self-employed and gig economy workers.-$55 billion increase in the Marshall Plan for our hospitals and health care system.-$45 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund to provide financial assistance to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, as well as private nonprofits providing critical and essential services. -$150 billion for a state, tribal, and local COVID-19 relief fund.-$10 billion for Small Business Administration (SBA) emergency grants of up to $10,000 to provide immediate relief for small business operating costs.-$17 billion for SBA to cover six months of payments for small businesses with existing SBA loans.-$30 billion in emergency education funding and $25 billion in emergency transit funding.-Make rent, mortgage, and utility costs eligible for SBA loan forgiveness.-Ban stock buybacks for the term of the government assistance plus one year on any company receiving a government loan from the bill.-Establish robust worker protections attached to all federal loans for businesses.-Create real-time public reporting of Treasury transactions under the Act, including terms of loans, investments, or other assistance to corporations. -Provide income tax exclusion for individuals who are receiving student loan repayment assistance from their employer."
Democrat,Richard J. Durbin,Durbin Calls On Trump Administration To Prioritize Health & Safety Working Families In Coronavirus Response,"Amid the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), during a speech on the Senate floor, called on the Trump Administration to prioritize the health and safety of working families during the coronavirus outbreak, including paid sick leave, enhanced unemployment insurance, transportation, food security, educational plans, affordable treatment, and widespread and free coronavirus testing. 

Last week, Durbin, along with Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), helped introduce new, emergency paid sick leave legislation to provide paid sick days immediately to workers in light of the coronavirus crisis, and in preparation for future public health emergencies.  This emergency paid sick days legislation requires all employers to allow workers to accrue seven days of paid sick leave and to provide an additional 14 days available immediately in the event of any public health emergency, including the current coronavirus outbreak.

""As we look forward to the next steps to respond to this public health emergency, it is critical that Congress prioritize the health and safety of workers and their families.  Our public health experts are rightfully telling people to stay home if they are sick.  But, for many Americans, staying home means losing a paycheck that helps them afford rent, pay for food, medication, and child care,"" Durbin said.  ""I'm proud to have helped introduce legislation last week that would immediately provide 14 days of paid sick leave to workers in light of coronavirus.  It also is important that we ensure workers have access to unemployment insurance benefits during this uncertain time.""

Durbin continued, ""We passed a robust funding bill last week, but our work is not done -- there will be far-reaching impacts of this outbreak.  It is imperative that we look toward developing a comprehensive response that benefits everyone-- including America's working families and small businesses--not just large corporations.""

In his speech on the Senate floor, Durbin also highlighted the good work being done at Argonne National Laboratory to combat the coronavirus.  Argonne is helping to address the threat of coronavirus with its Advanced Photon Source.  Researchers are using this high-power X-ray to study the virus.  It was announced last week that a potential drug target has been identified for this coronavirus by a team including the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of California, Riverside."
Democrat,Richard J. Durbin,Durbin Amendments To Subpoena Relevant Witnesses In Crossfire Hurricane Investigation Blocked By Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans,"During today's Senate Judiciary Committee markup of a Republican resolution to authorize Chairman Graham to subpoena 53 named individuals for testimony regarding the Mueller investigation and FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation, U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) offered amendments authorizing and directing that subpoenas be issued to six other individuals with highly relevant knowledge about the contacts in 2016 between the Trump Campaign and Russia that were the predicate for the investigations: Michael Cohen, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, Jerome Corsi, and Roger Stone. Also, Durbin offered a sense of the Committee amendment supporting the right to peaceably assemble and condemning Attorney General William Barr for his actions on June 1 forcing peaceful protestors out of Lafayette Square. Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans voted down each of Durbin's amendments on party line votes. 

""If this is on the up and up, if this is legit, then you bring in witnesses who are relevant. You decide whether their testimony is credible. You put it into the record so we have a complete record. For those who agree or disagree with the investigation, you give each of them an opportunity to come forward and produce evidence that's relevant to the investigation. To say that the investigation of Crossfire Hurricane is really the center of this, and then ignore every predicate that led up to this investigation, frankly calls into question whether this is a credible exercise,"" Durbin said. 

Durbin also gave remarks on his amendment supporting the right to peaceably assemble and condemning Attorney General William Barr for his actions on June 1 forcing peaceful protestors out of Lafayette Square.

""According to press reports, the assault began with law enforcement kneeling--not to express solidarity with the anti-racism efforts, as we have seen with some police officers around the country.  They were kneeling to put on gas masks to protect themselves from the weapons they were about to fire at peaceful demonstrators,"" Durbin said. ""At this critical moment in our nation's history, one would expect the United States Senate Judiciary Committee to consider this measure, to stand up, and to speak upto examine why lawful protestors engaging in their First Amendment rights were attacked by federal law enforcement officers. To discuss pervasive, systemic racism, the incidents of police brutality, and the ongoing fight in this country for civil rights."""
Democrat,Thomas R. Carper,"Letter to Chad Wolf, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security - Heinrich, Senate Democrats To DHS: Halt Transfer Of ICE Detainees, Increase Agency COVID-19 Testing","Dear Acting Secretary Wolf,

We write to urge the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to take immediate steps to halt transfers of individuals in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody between detention facilities, including transfers into the ICE system from the federal prison system or state and local law enforcement agencies. We also urge ICE to expand novel coronavirus (COVID-19) testing at all ICE facilities, including processing centers, privately run facilities, and local jails contracting with ICE.

The revolving door between federal, state, and local jails and ICE facilities, as well as within ICE's network of detention centers accelerates the rapidly growing number of COVID-19 cases in facilities nationwide and puts vulnerable communities in the surrounding areas at a heightened public health risk of an outbreak.

ICE's nationwide detention system constantly shuffles individuals in custody across 200 facilities. Currently, there are approximately 25,911 ICE detainees facing an especially heightened risk of COVID-19 infection due in part to the lack of access to sanitary supplies and the inability to safely socially distance. According to ICE, there have been at least 1,327 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among those in ICE custody in 54 locations across the country. Of the tests conducted, approximately 50% have been positive. This is more than double the infection rate in the overall U.S. population. Further, 44 ICE employees at detention centers have tested positive for the virus. Due to lack of testing and underreporting on infections among contract staff, these numbers are likely much higher. Until now, ICE has only tested 2,620- or approximately ten percent - of all individuals in custody.

Despite crowded and unsanitary conditions that facilitate the spread of the virus, ICE continues to transfer hundreds of individuals between facilities without adequate testing. Between April 30 and May 12, one report documents at least seven instances of transfers to or from a facility with confirmed cases of COVID-19.

In some instances, ICE chose to comply with court directives to reduce detention levels by transferring detainees to other facilities, serving only to increase detention levels in transfer sites and exacerbate the spread of the virus. For example, when a federal court mandated that ICE reduce detention levels in three Florida facilities to mitigate spread of the virus, the agency transferred at least 200 individuals to other facilities across the South. According to reports, none of the receiving facilities had capacity to accept these transfers or adhere to basic social distancing requirements with the influx of transferees.

Testing and outbreak patterns make clear that these inter-facility transfers result in virus outbreak in previously unaffected jails. Yet, ICE has initiated transfers from facilities with high concentrations of COVID-19 positive cases to facilities with no known cases. According to reports, on April 11, ICE transferred 72 individuals from jails in Pennsylvania and New York with a significant number of COVID-19 cases to a facility in Prairieland, Texas. Within two weeks, the Texas facility found itself with 41 cases of COVID-19--far more than it had seen before.

Shuttling hundreds of individuals between facilities also places the communities surrounding detention facilities at a heightened risk of a COVID-19 outbreak. Despite local resistance, a recent ICE transfer of 200 individuals to the Adams County Correctional Facility--a privately-operated facility in a small Mississippi community--has resulted in a COVID-19 incidence over 40% higher in the county than that of the national average. At the time of this transfer, staff at the Adams County facility were not equipped with protective face masks.

Other small communities like Adams County are unfairly burdened with the impact of ICE's failure to appropriately respond to the pandemic. In New Mexico, ICE facilities in Otero County are recent hot spots of COVID-19 outbreaks--reporting at least 92 confirmed COVID-19 cases across an ICE processing center and detention facility. The growing COVID-19 crisis inside the Otero facilities place the surrounding small community of Chaparral at a higher public health risk of an accelerated outbreak amidst already limited health-care resources.

Public health experts are clear that frequent movement into confined or crowded spaces and a lack of adequate testing fuels this pandemic. Until ICE halts transfers and expands testing, the agency will continue to exacerbate conditions for individuals in ICE custody and for all the communities surrounding its facilities."
Democrat,Robert Menendez,Menendez Calls for Focus on Facts During Question Phase of Trump's Impeachment Trial,"U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today hosted a press conference in the U.S. Capitol to discuss the latest on the ongoing impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Flanked by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Senator Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Menendez outlined what he expects to learn as the trial enters the question-and-answer phase this afternoon.  

""When we start questioning period today, I want to hear facts, not spin,"" said the Senator. ""At the end of the day, it is hard to look at the facts, facts are pretty stubborn. It's hard to look at the facts and reconcile it with the President's defense. I have not heard anything that suggests [the President's] own national security officials thought that what he was doing was just fine; or that he wasn't soliciting foreign interference in our elections for his own benefit.""

On claims that the President was concerned about corruption in Ukraine:

""I have listened carefully to the President's legal team and one thing I haven't heard from them is a defense of the facts. What I haven't heard was why the President greenlighted aid to Ukraine 45 times between January of 2017 and June of 2019 to the tune of $1.5 billion. As Ranking Member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I can confirm there were certifications by  the Department of Defense that said Ukraine was meeting its responsibilities and goals as it relates to dealing with its fight against corruption  45 times, $1.5 billion, between January of 2017 and June of 2019, and that money flowed.""

On Republicans' refusal to call witnesses and allow evidence:

""It is amazing that you have a witness who provides essential information to the core of article of impeachment number 1, Abuse of Power, who says, ""I am willing to come forward,' and to ultimately have our colleagues refuse to call on that person to come forward  if the President of the United States can deny all witnesses, all documents  If he can drive the ability to have no witnesses for Congress to do oversight, no documents for Congress to do oversight, added to the fact that this administration believes it can go to war without getting Congressional approval, all while it takes away one of Congress' main roles by transferring away money appropriated for the Defense Department to pay for the President's wall  then guess what? The very essence of our democracy, the essence of checks and balances for the American people are eviscerated."""
Republican,Marco Rubio,"Hearing of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee - Opening Statement of Sen. Rubio, Hearing on Main Street Perspectives on COVID-19's Impact on Small Businesses","U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, convened a hearing titled, ""Perspectives from Main Street: COVID-19's Impact on Small Business.""

Chairman Rubio's opening remarks as prepared can be found below. Chairman Rubio: ""I would like to thank everyone for joining us, both in person and virtually, and welcome to our witnesses for today's hearing, titled ""Perspectives from Main Street: COVID-19's Impact on Small Business.' ""There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every American in some way. ""For some, this pandemic has impacted their health or the health of a loved one.   ""Too many have unfortunately lost loved ones.  ""For others, this pandemic has altered their day-to-day way of life.   ""Many have lost their jobs or have had to shutter their doors.    ""It is clear the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted millions of Americans.   ""By April 2020, the U.S. unemployment rate had increased to 14.7 percent.   ""Only two months prior, in February 2020, the unemployment rate had been only 3.5 percent. ""Similarly, in the first quarter of 2020 the United States saw a 5 percent decrease in the annual real GDP rate, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 which reported a 2.1 percent increase.   ""Our nation's small businesses have, undoubtedly, been amongst the hardest hit by COVID-19's economic impact.   ""The United States Small Business Administration estimated that in 2019 nearly 30 million small firms were in operation, employing more than 47 percent of all American workers or nearly 60 million individuals. ""Now, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is estimated that 54 percent of those small business jobs are considered highly vulnerable, including those in the accommodation and food services industry.  ""A recent snap survey by the U.S. Census Bureau reported that, in data collected between April 26th and May 2nd of this year, 83.5 percent of small businesses surveyed within this industry reported that they had experienced a large negative effect due to the pandemic.  ""Unfortunately, this has been the case for many sectors across our economy. ""That same Census Bureau survey, however, suggests that throughout the month of May, the number of firms reporting large negative impacts had decreased from more than 51 percent of firms to 45 percent of firms.  ""Similarly, the number of small businesses having reported decreased revenue or a decrease in employees has also gone down in the last four weeks. ""As these statistics have decreased, the number of firms having reported that they received financial assistance in the form of either a Paycheck Protection Program loan or an Economic Injury Disaster Loan or Grant have increased substantially over time.  ""According to the most recent SBA data: ""More than 4.4 million PPP loans have been made for a total of more than $510 billion with an average loan size of roughly $114,000; and ""More than 707,000 EIDL loans have been made for more than $55.7 billion. ""While the process of establishing and administering the PPP program has certainly not been without its faults, this program has clearly had an immense and positive impact on the small business community.  ""The PPP was created to provide small firms and their employees with emergency funding to sustain their businesses during this uncertain time.   ""The PPP was designed to allow small businesses to keep their workers on payroll and ensure that firms would once again be able to operate after the crisis has passed.  ""Following the passage of the CARES Act, demand for the program was incredibly high.  So high that the first round of funding was depleted in less than two weeks, requiring Congress to appropriate an additional $310 billion in program funding.  ""Millions of additional small businesses, independent contractors, and sole proprietors were able to participate in the program due to this additional funding. ""A recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business noted that 77 percent of surveyed small business owners had applied for a PPP loan, of which 93 percent had received funding. ""In my home State of Florida alone, approximately 336,000 PPP loans have been made for more than $30 billion. ""Each one of those loans represents a business surviving and a worker receiving a paycheck during this unbelievably trying time.  ""It represents a lifeline given to an American business who has suffered through no fault of their own. ""While these statistics are certainly encouraging, we recognize that small firms and communities throughout our nation is still struggling. ""Just last week, the SBA and the Treasury Department announced that they would be increasing their efforts to ensure the PPP is successful in reaching small businesses in all of our nation's communities by setting aside $10 billion of PPP funds for Community Development Financial Institutions, or CDFIs for short.  ""This effort to improve CDFIs ability to administer PPP loans, and to set aside funding for their use, is meant to ensure that underserved communities can better access the benefits of the PPP.   ""This work is of enormous importance and I welcome the SBA and Treasury's recent efforts in this area.  ""I don't want to go any further in my remarks without acknowledging what has taken place in the last several days, in my hometown in Miami, here in Washington, D.C., in New York, Minneapolis and all across the country.   ""All of us have felt pain, sadness and, of course, outrage at the murder of George Floyd.   ""The African American community is experiencing a deep and unique pain and outrage because of this killing, and at the long history of injustice that this murder evokes.   ""This comes in the context of a pandemic that is already disproportionately harming communities of color, and which has both highlighted and exacerbated racial inequities in our society ""Ensuring that the worker-focused economic relief of the PPP makes it to small businesses in these communities must be an ongoing priority.  ""The work of this committee has its own part to play in helping address the economic challenges facing Americans of color during this crisis.   ""I want to thank Ranking Member Cardin for his longstanding and continued leadership in advocating for underserved communities, and for his partnership on this front.  I look forward to continuing that partnership.  ""We certainly have more work to do. ""Today's hearing will allow members of the Committee the opportunity to explore what the small business landscape currently looks like in various industries and in all of our nation's communities.    ""While this is our first formal committee hearing following the passage of the CARES Act, it will certainly not be our last.  ""The Committee has been actively engaged in oversight over the implementation of the programs in Title I of the CARES Act and we are committed to continuing to conduct vigorous oversight over these programs to ensure they are operating as Congress intended, including addressing fraud and misuse of funding.  ""Our oversight efforts will continue next week, on June 10, 2020, when the Committee will welcome SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza and Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin for our next hearing."""
Democrat,Amy Klobuchar,Klobuchar Leads Bipartisan Resolution Designating January as National Stalking Awareness Month,"U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) introduced a resolution designating January 2020 as National Stalking Awareness Month to raise awareness on the dangers of stalking and educate Americans about how to prevent this serious offense. The resolution is cosponsored by every woman senator on the Judiciary Committee--Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)--as well as Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Mike Crapo (R-ID).

Approximately 1 in 6 women in the U.S. have experienced stalking victimization at some point in their lifetimes. Klobuchar is the author of the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act, legislation that would, among other things, prevent convicted stalkers from buying or owning a gun--a commonsense update to federal law that many states have already adopted. A provision based on that bill was included in the 2019 Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, which passed the House in April 2019 with bipartisan support.    

""As a former prosecutor, I have seen firsthand the serious emotional and physical toll stalking can take on victims, and I know that many fear not only for their own lives but also the safety of their loved ones,"" Klobuchar said. ""Our bipartisan resolution will raise awareness about the dangers of stalking, the need to ensure that victims are protected, and the resources available to help survivors to get their lives back on track.""

Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) will introduce a companion resolution in the House of Representatives. The resolution compliments efforts by the Stalking Prevention, Awareness, and Resource Center (SPARC) to bring attention to Stalking Awareness Month.

Klobuchar is a national leader in the fight to prevent domestic violence. She is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and prior to her time in the Senate, Klobuchar served as Hennepin County Attorney. Last year, Klobuchar and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) reintroduced the Abby Honold Act--the legislation was inspired by Abby Honold, a former student of the University of Minnesota and rape survivor, who brought this issue to the forefront. Minnesota Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN) also reintroduced bipartisan companion legislation in the House of Representatives. 

In 2018, Klobuchar and Cornyn's SAFER Act--legislation that reauthorizes, strengthens, and extends the Sexual Assault Forensic Registry program in an effort to help reduce the national rape kit backlog--was signed into law. In 2016, the Klobuchar-backed bipartisan Justice for All Reauthorization Act was signed into law. The law strengthens the rights of crime victims by providing the protection they need to restore their lives and enhances law enforcement's ability to proactively stop violent criminals. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act also aims to reduce the rape kit backlog by supporting grant programs that fund forensic testing.

Durbin received an update about National Guard operations in Illinois, where hundreds of troops are assisting state and local authorities in response to the crisis.  Durbin also pressed on the need to provide full benefits to all members of the Guard who are activated.  If a member of the National Guard receives orders through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for 30 days or less, they are not fully eligible for a range of benefits, including health insurance for themselves and their family.

""The men and women of our National Guard are being called into action to help states like Illinois respond to this crisis.  They are providing critical roles in logistics by moving medical supplies and equipment and setting up test sites. I urged General Lengyel to keep me updated about operations in Illinois and I promised to assist with anything they need to ensure missions are carried out in an effective and timely manner,"" Durbin said."

February 10, 2020 

The Honorable Elaine Chao

Secretary

U.S. Department of Transportation

1200 New Jersey Avenue SE

Washington, DC 20590

Dear Secretary Chao:

            In light of the recent crisis facing the aviation industry and the parallels to increasing automation in the automotive industry--both of which are regulated by the Department of Transportation--we remain opposed to new autonomous vehicle regulations and legislation that do not include strong safety standards.

            As transportation becomes more automated -- similar to Boeing's 737 MAX Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System that was responsible for two fatal plane crashes -- mandatory safety standards and oversight must keep up. The recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board's recent report about the March 2018 automated vehicle fatality in Arizona should be heeded quickly: the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration must require mandatory, consistent safety self-assessments and establish a process for the ongoing evaluation of testing on public roads.

            Moreover, as the leader of the agency that regulates both aviation and automotive transportation, your position on autonomous vehicles should be informed by the failures of Boeing. A clear lesson from the 737 MAX crashes is that new technologies cannot be rushed to market before rigorous oversight is conducted and comprehensive safety rules are enacted.

            We watched with interest as you recently unveiled the Trump Administration's updated principles regarding autonomous vehicles, and we appreciate your continued attention to this emerging technology. However, we are concerned that the Transportation Department's latest set of guidelines do not contain any legally binding safety standards and requirements. We urge you to ensure that Department of Transportation safety regulators exercise the strongest oversight possible and promulgate meaningful rules, including protections for cybersecurity and consumer privacy, to ensure the safety of the public as these vehicles transform transportation and land use planning in our communities.

            We look forward to your response and to further discussions on this important topic. 

Sincerely,

Dianne Feinstein

Democrat,Jon Tester,"Tester secures nearly $100,000 to help Montana libraries expand access during COVID-19 pandemic","U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced $96,573 in Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding for Montana libraries to expand online services in remote areas that have little access to broadband. This will help meet the needs of students in frontier areas as they continue online learning during the coronavirus pandemic.

""Students in Montana's frontier communities are struggling to stay connected and get the resources they need as they try to access education online with limited broadband. At the same time, Montana libraries are straining to meet this increased demand for resources,"" said Tester. ""This funding will help Montana libraries adapt to online learning and continue to offer critical support for students and communities during the COVID-19 crisis.""

This funding was allocated by the Institute of Museum and Library Services as part of $50 million they received through the CARES Act. The State Library Commission and Montana Libraries plan to use the funds to supplement investments in:

-Expanding digital network access in Montana's frontier communities where such access is lacking, including investing in new routers to replace routers that are five or more years old or libraries that report unreliable service;-Purchasing at least two hotspots per library, including providing additional hotspots to 10 libraries based on need;-Contracting with an online reading program to encourage reading and to prevent the summer reading slide.-Allocating additional aid for technical support services in response to the disruption of schooling and other community services during the COVID-19 crisis;-Investing in MontanaLibrary2Go, an e-book and e-audio service, in an effort to provide more content and resources to supplement students' online learning in relation to the increased demand in content and holds.

As a former teacher and school board member, Tester has been fighting tooth and nail to ensure Montana students have the resources they need to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Last week, he announced more than $41 million for Montana K-12 schools to help meet the needs of students as they transition to online learning. Earlier this month, he announced that the Montana Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund would receive more than $8.7 million in funding to bolster education in the state. Additionally, Tester introduced bipartisan legislation to provide $2 billion in funding for rural communities in an effort to keep internet service available and affordable for low-income families in underserved areas.

Tester has been working tirelessly to ensure that Montanans have the resources they need throughout the COVID-19 crisis. After 72 hours negotiating substantial, bipartisan improvements to COVID-19 stimulus legislation that had previously fallen far short for Montana, Tester voted to deliver critical, urgent relief to Montana workers, families, small businesses, hospitals and others hardest hit by the outbreak, which included $1.25 billion for the state of Montana.

Democrat,Thomas R. Carper,"Van Hollen Joins Markey, Brown in Telling Trump to Immediately and Fully Use All Defense Production Act Authorities to Mobilize War-Scale Manufacturing Effort of Medical Equipment","U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and 17 of their colleagues today in decrying President Donald Trump's partial invocation of the Defense Production Act (DPA), which ignored other key titles in the Act that provide essential tools for rapidly scaling up our national response to the spread of the novel coronavirus. The Senators are calling on Trump to immediately implement all Defense Production Act powers under Titles I, III, and VII to massively scale up production of testing kits, Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as respirators and gloves, ventilators, and other critical materials that our country needs during the coronavirus emergency. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates the United States could need up to 3.5 billion respirators during the coronavirus emergency, but the Strategic National Stockpile holds only 12 million respirators.

""Our domestic industries are ready and waiting for the call to respond to the critical ongoing shortages of key medical equipment and supplies,"" write the Senators in their letter to President Trump. ""But they need capital, federal contracts, and other assurances in order to act. We can activate America's ingenuity and resolve by immediately providing that financial incentive and direction through the full use of DPA authorities. We urge you to move forward in using these authorities immediately, for the sake of the health and well-being of the American people.""

The President's executive order issued days ago invokes only components of Title I of the DPA and delegates its authorities to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar. In their letter, the Senators explain that implementing Title III authorities would allow the executive branch to provide financial incentives to industry, including loans, direct purchases, and purchase commitments, as well as to further help repurpose private manufacturing capabilities to enable manufacturers to produce the materials we need in this crisis, something other countries like South Korea and France are doing. The Senators also highlight that Title VII empowers the President to establish voluntary agreements with private industry and direct coordinated industry efforts and production.

In their letter, the Senators also urged President Trump to follow the advice of his own public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of of Health and Human Services and stop referring to the current coronavirus in an inflammatory and xenophobic manner.

Also signing the letter are Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Angus King (I-Maine), Doug Jones (D-Ala.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.)."
Democrat,Benjamin L. Cardin,Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I want to thank Senator Udall for his  leadership on the For the People Act, and I want to thank Senator  Merkley for his leadership on this bill. 

  This bill contains many provisions that deal with the fundamental  values of this country. I also am proud of my colleague in the House of  Representatives, Congressman Sarbanes, who is the lead sponsor of H.R.  1, which is the For the People Act. It passed the House of  Representatives over a year ago, and there has been no action on the  floor of the Senate as a result of the majority leader's decision not  to bring these bills to the floor. 

  As I said, it includes a lot of different bills that all deal with  America's values. These are the values that are the strength of this  Nation--free and fair elections. That is what we promote globally  because we know that is key to a stable democratic society. Yet when  you look at the way we conduct elections in this country, we are not  setting a very high example. Look at how much money is involved in  elections in this country. From the President of the United States to  our local offices, too much money speaks to who is going to be able to  get the attention of the voters. We need to change that. 

  We know that suppression of voters has been institutionalized as a  strategy to win office. That should have no place in America. We should  want the maximum amount of voters to participate in our political  process, not try to prevent people from exercising their right to vote. 

  The For the People Act brings about meaningful change so that  America, which is the shining example of democracy, can lead the world  by the way we conduct our own elections. Let me mention two provisions  that I am particularly pleased are included in the For the People Act.  One is democracy restoration; that is, to allow those who have been  convicted of crime, after they have served their penalty, to be able to  participate in elections. We are one of only a few western democracies  that permanently disenfranchise an individual who has been convicted of  a felony. There are 6.1 million adults who currently are  disenfranchised as a result of that provision, yet only 22 percent of  those individuals are incarcerated. The other 78 percent have paid  their penalty, have done their time, and are now reintegrated into  society. It is in our interest to have them participate in our  democratic system. It reduces recidivism. And, quite frankly, it is  targeted at people of color. They are who have been most  disenfranchised as a result of this provision. Thirty-four States still  have restrictions, and 12 have lifetime restrictions on those convicted  of a felony. The Democracy Restoration Act would remedy that situation. 

  The second bill I am going to refer to very briefly is the Deceptive  Practices and Voter Prevention Act that targets primarily minority  voters to suppress their vote. It is the modern Jim Crow laws in which  we find we are using modern technology. We have campaign strategies  aimed at minority communities to give them misinformation about how  they can vote or whether they are eligible to vote or where they can  vote. That is being used today. We have to make sure that doesn't  happen in the American election system.  

  For the People provides meaningful changes so that we don't allow  suppression of votes to be an institutionalized strategy to try to win  an election, so that we have the maximum participation of voters in our  process, and it deals with the ever-flowing increase in the amount of  dollars that are put into American elections. 

  The U.S. Senate should not be a graveyard. Majority Leader McConnell  has prevented hundreds of bills--bipartisan bills--from coming to the  floor of the U.S. Senate. It has been a year since we have had the For  the People Act passed by the House of Representatives. It is well past  time for the Senate to take up this legislation so that we can show the  American people we support the values that have made America the great  democracy in our country. 

  Thank you very much.

""First, to be clear, the House impeachment managers have said this is a trial without witnesses.  That accusation is false.  The Senate has had a full presentation of witnesses and documentary evidence.  In fact, the House managers have argued publicly and repeatedly, that ""we have heard from enough witnesses to prove the case beyond any doubt at all.'  Over the course of nine days, we have reviewed testimony from 13 witnesses sworn under oath in the House hearings; over 28,000 pages of evidence; 192 videos; answers to the 180 questions asked by senators; and numerous additional witnesses and documentary evidence for the Senate record including, but not limited to, excerpts from John Bolton's book manuscript. 

""The President's counsel have clearly stated that they will not waive the President's executive privilege as to several of the new witnesses sought by the House impeachment managers.  Nor, for reasons stated below, should they.   Similarly, the House managers have clearly indicated they will object to at least three of the new witnesses sought by the President's counsel.  Resolution of these claims from both sides will require delays in the proceedings for months, if not longer.  For example, this is the very reason the House did not subpoena John Bolton.  In the words of House manager Adam Schiff, it would have delayed their proceedings in the House ""for years.'   

""In neither of the two previous Senate impeachment trials of a President were any witnesses deposed in which the claims of constitutional privilege had not already been resolved in court. 

""It is now suggested that the Senate should simply somehow overrule the right of the President to assert his constitutional rights regarding the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch.  But the Senate could not possibly do so without that act itself being subject to extensive litigation.  If the Senate were somehow to succeed in taking unto itself the power to unilaterally cancel a president's right to executive privilege, it would change our entire constitutional system of government--for the worse.  The Founders of our nation expressly rejected a system in which the President serves at the pleasure of the legislative branch.  This is close to the European system--a system that was widely and wisely--rejected by our Founders in crafting our Constitution.  

""The Senate has allowed the House managers to put their full record and extensive supplementary evidence before it.  The case of the House managers still falls short of justifying the removal of a U.S. President from office and from the ballot in the upcoming election. 

""We have an election only months from now in which the American people can use their Constitutionally-given rights to decide who will be our President."""
Democrat,Gary C. Peters,"Peters Announces Support for Bipartisan Bills to Lower Prescription Drug Costs, Improve Market Competition","U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) today announced that he has cosponsored bipartisan legislation to lower prescription drug prices by improving market competition. The Reforming Evergreening and Manipulation that Extends Drug Years (REMEDY) Act would stop drug companies from filing numerous meaningless patents on old drugs, while the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act would empower the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prevent pharmaceutical companies from altering a product before its patent expires, simply to thwart generic competition.

""Nobody should need to choose between paying to put food on the table for their families or life-saving medication. Unfortunately, too many Michigan families are forced to make those choices every day -- and that needs to change,"" said Senator Peters. ""I'm pleased to support bipartisan efforts that would help lower costs for Michiganders by holding drug companies accountable and preventing them from manipulating the market in their favor.""

The REMEDY Act would promote drug market competition by removing barriers to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for lower-cost generic drugs. Currently, brand-name medications are able to file excess patents to their product, which manipulates the market and prevents competition. The REMEDY Act would crack down on these abusive practices and hold pharmaceutical companies accountable.

The Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act would prevent pharmaceutical companies from manipulating the patent process in order to increase profits. This would also limit the amount of patent infringement lawsuits that drug companies can bring against generic competitors.

Peters has led numerous efforts in the Senate to lower health care costs for all Michiganders. Last year, Peters announced an investigation--through his role as Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee--into the rising costs of prescription drugs and the short supply of critical medications affecting hospitals and patients throughout the country. He held roundtables across the state as part of a listening tour to hear firsthand from medical professionals and families impacted by high prescription drug costs. Following his investigation, Peters unveiled a new report that incudes recommendations to address the cost, supply and national security threats to affordable drugs. Peters also helped advance two pieces of bipartisan legislation to improve the generic market, the Affordable Insulin Approvals Now Act as well as the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Sample (CREATES) Act, that were signed into law as part of the year-end government funding bill."
Democrat,Mazie K. Hirono,"Letter to Gene Dodaro, Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office - Hirono, Grijalva Ask GAO to Investigate Potential Political Interference in DOI Grantmaking Process","Dear Mr. Dodaro: 

In December 2017, the Department of the Interior (DOI) issued guidance establishing a new process for approving discretionary grants and cooperative agreements. The guidance generally states that grants and cooperative agreements to certain categories of recipients, such as universities and public interest groups, must receive high-level scrutiny by political appointees within Interior prior to approval. The guidance further threatens retaliation against grant and cooperative agreement programs that do not comply, stating in bold type, ""Instances circumventing the Secretarial priorities or the review process will cause greater scrutiny and will result in slowing down the approval process for all awards.""

Awards from DOI should be based on the merits to ensure the most productive use of taxpayer funding.  We are concerned that this policy allows political appointees at the Department of the Interior to steer grant funds and cooperative agreements toward or away from certain recipients for reasons other than merit. For example, DOI ordered the National Academies of Sciences to halt a study on the health effects of mountaintop removal mining on local communities, the findings of which would have likely undermined the administration's goal of expanding domestic fossil fuel production.

We are requesting that GAO examine Interior's grants and cooperative agreements review process, including

a delineation of the overall grants and cooperative agreements approval process and what has changed;policies, procedures, and controls governing the grant and cooperative agreement process;trends in funding grants or cooperative agreement awards, including an analysis of grants and cooperative agreements that have been subject to this expanded level of review; impacts of changes to the grants and cooperative agreements process, including economic impacts and impacts of denying and delaying awards on jobs;whether grant and cooperative agreement funds have been redirected; andinformation on the timeliness of reviews and outcomes.Thank you for your timely attention to this request. If you have any additional questions, please contact Jen Burks with Senator Hirono's office at Jen_Burks@hirono.senate.gov or Vic Edgerton with the House Natural Resources Committee at Vic.Edgerton@mail.house.gov.

  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States  contains a number of constitutional protections for the citizens of our  great Republic. Among the many provisions that it contains, in addition  to the structural safeguards of federalism and the separation of  powers, separating out power along two axes--one vertical, which we  call federalism, and the other horizontal, which we call the separation  of powers--the Constitution also includes a number of substantive  restrictions. These are things that the government may not do, and  there are penalties attached to the government's doing those things. 

  Among those many protections can be found the provisions of the Bill  of Rights, including the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The  Fourth Amendment reminds us that it is our right--a fundamental,  inalienable right--as citizens in a free republic, to be free from  unreasonable searches and seizures, and that any warrants issued under  government authority have to be backed by probable cause, and any  probable cause-based warrant has to include with particularity a  description of the places and persons to be searched and to be seized. 

  This is a tradition that reaches not just back a couple of centuries,  but it reaches back much farther than that and has its origins not only  in our own country but in our mother country, in the United Kingdom. By  the time John Wilkes was serving in Parliament in the 1760s, there had  been a long-established tradition and understanding. In fact, there had  been a series of laws enacted to make sure that warrants were not  abused and to make sure the rights of the English subjects would not be  infringed. Among other things, there was an understanding and a set of  laws in place that would make clear that those conducting searches and  seizures would be subject to a warrant requirement. In other words,  they would lose any immunity that they would otherwise have as  government officials if they didn't obtain a warrant and if that  warrant were not valid. 

  In 1763, the home of John Wilkes was searched aggressively. John  Wilkes, while serving as a Member of Parliament, had become critical of  the administration of King George, and he had participated in the  publication of a weekly circular known as the North Briton. Although  the North Briton was not one likely to engage in excessive, fawning  praise of the reigning Monarch, it wasn't until the publication of  North Briton No. 45 in 1763 that the administration of King George  decided to go after John Wilkes. His home was searched, and it was  searched pursuant to a general warrant. 

  A general warrant was something that basically said, in that  instance: Find out who had anything to do with the authorship and  publication of North Briton No. 45. You see, North Briton No. 45  accused, among other things, King George and those who served in his  government of laying aggressive taxes on the people--taxes that they  knew couldn't adequately be enforced or collected without intrusive  measures that would involve kicking open people's doors, rummaging  through their drawers, and doing things that couldn't be justified for  the use of a warrant laid out with particularity. 

  John Wilkes, in that circumstance, was arrested within a matter of a  few weeks. He won his freedom, albeit on something of a technicality at  the moment. He asserted parliamentary privilege and was released.  Eventually, after becoming subjected to multiple searches using general  warrants, Wilkes sued Lord Halifax and those who participated in the  searches and seizures in question. He was able to obtain a large award,  a large judgment consisting of money damages. 

  John Wilkes, at the time, became famous, really, on both sides of the  Atlantic. The name of John Wilkes was celebrated in taverns, saloons,  and other public places in England and in the nascent United States of  America, the colonies in North America that would later become the  world's greatest Republic. John Wilkes' example was something that  helped to solidify a long-standing legal tradition, one that would in  time make its way into our Constitution through the Fourth Amendment. 

  We have to remember that government is simply force. It is the  organized collective official use of force. When John Wilkes and those  who worked with him on the North Briton, culminating in North Briton  No. 45, criticized the King too much, questioned excessively, in their  judgment, the collection and imposition of taxes, the administration of  King George decided they had gone too far and that it was time for John  Wilkes to pay a price. 

  Fortunately for John Wilkes and for people on both sides of the  Atlantic, John Wilkes emerged victoriously. Today, we don't have  general warrants, at least nothing masquerading under that title in the  United States. The fact that we have a First Amendment is a test to his  vigorous defense of the rights of English subjects. 

  What we do have is something that ought to concern every American. We  have the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which we know has been  abused, and we have known for a long time is ripe for opportunities for  abuse among government officials. 

  In fact, what we have seen is that the current President of the  United States has, himself, become the target of abuse under FISA. Back  in 2016 when this started being abused and when we saw the emergence of  things like Operation Crossfire Hurricane, you had the campaign of a  man who would become the 45th President of the United States targeted  and singled out, quite unfairly, using these practices--these  procedures that were designed originally for use in detecting and  thwarting the efforts of agents of foreign powers. 

  As the name of the law implies, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act is not something that is intended to go after American citizens. It  is certainly not something that is intended to be used as a tool for  bullying a Presidential candidate. Now that it has been used to bully  and incorrectly surveil the 45th President of the United States, we  need to do something about it. That is what the Lee-Leahy amendment  does.  

  First, for a bit of background on this particular law, we have three  provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that expired on  March 15, 2020, just a few weeks ago. We have one provision known as  section 215, another provision known as lone wolf, and another  provision known as roving wiretaps. 

  On March 16, the Senate passed a bill to reauthorize those provisions  through May 30, 2020, which would give us a few weeks to debate and  discuss reforms that need to happen under FISA. In order to pass this  bill, the Senate entered into a unanimous consent agreement for votes  on three amendments to the Pelosi-Nadler-Schiff bill passed by the  House of Representatives a few weeks ago. One of those amendments is  the one that I referred to a moment ago, the Lee-Leahy amendment,  introduced by myself and Senator Leahy from Vermont. 

  Unfortunately, however, the House of Representatives never passed  that short-term extension measure, so that the three authorities that I  mentioned--lone wolf, roving wiretaps, and 215--have been expired now  for almost 2 months. 

  Now, this is not for lack of trying on the part of us--the part of  those of us who really want to see meaningful FISA reform. In fact,  just a few days before these authorities were set to expire, I came  down here to the Senate floor and I asked a series of unanimous consent  requests to consider the House-passed reauthorization bill with a  handful of relevant and, I believe, very necessary amendments.  Unfortunately, my friend, a distinguished colleague, Senator Burr,  objected. 

  The Department of Justice Inspector General Horowitz's December  report on Crossfire Hurricane proved what many of us reformers have  been saying now for years. In my case, I have been working on this and  trying to call out the dangers inherent in provisions of FISA now for a  decade. But what the Horowitz report in December demonstrated was that  FISA really is ripe for opportunities for abuse. Inspector General  Horowitz not only found evidence that the FISA process was abused to  target President Trump's campaign. He found evidence that basic  procedures meant to protect the rights of U.S. persons--that is to say,  U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents of the United States--were  not being followed. 

  And so, just as we see that John Wilkes, through his publication of  North Briton No. 45, solidified a preexisting set of rights available  to all English subjects, we now see that President No. 45, Donald John  Trump, has the opportunity to strengthen this right protected in our  Fourth Amendment, harkening back to the example of John Wilkes in the  publication of North Briton No. 45. 

  My amendment with Senator Leahy would make reforms to applications  for surveillance across the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,  including both section 215, the authority that recently expired, and  under title I, which happens to be the authority that was abused in  order to surveil President Trump's campaign. 

  First, the amendment would strengthen the role of the friend-of-the- court provisions--the amicus curiae provisions that we adopted in 2015  in connection with the USA FREEDOM Act, which was introduced by Senator  Leahy and myself back then. It would strength these amicus curiae or  friend-of-the-court provisions and make them applicable in  circumstances in which there are sensitivities inherently in play. 

  Now, these amici curiae, or friends of the court, are people who, as  contemplated under the proposed legislation, would primarily be experts  and would have at least some knowledge or expertise of FISA and of  privacy, civil liberties, secure communications, and other fields that  are important to the FISA Court. They would also be people who would  have clearance to review matters of concern from a national security  standpoint. 

  These amici are essential because, you see, the FISA Court is a  secret court which, by its very design, operates on an ex parte basis,  meaning without the presence of opposing counsel. You have government  counsel and the judges themselves, and that is it. 

  The friend-of-the-court provisions, the amici curiae I am describing,  provide the opportunity for the FISA Court to hear from a fresh  perspective--a neutral, trusted perspective--one that comes with some  expertise in national security clearance but without presenting the  threat to upending the national security investigations entrusted to  the FISA Court. 

  So that is why the amici are so necessary and so important. In the  absence of opposing counsel, we have to strengthen the provisions that  provide for these amici to ensure that there is some advocate somewhere  in front of the court who is in a position to say: Wait a minute. What  happens if we do this? Wait a minute. Is this really what the law  authorizes? Wait a minute. Isn't there a constitutional concern  implicated here, especially where they are dealing with the rights of  American citizens. 

  The December 2019 inspector general report on the surveillance of  President Trump's campaign staffer Carter Page demonstrates the  significant need for an outside expert legal advocate, especially when  a FISA application involves a sensitive investigative matter, like the  surveillance of a candidate for public office or an elected official or  that official's staff.  

  If the Lee-Leahy amendment were in statute, it would have required  the FISA Court to appoint an amicus in the Carter Page case. If an  amicus had been appointed in that case, would she have raised some of  the issues that we now see regarding the credibility of the Steele  dossier? Well, it is quite possible. In fact, I think it is quite  likely. I think it is almost unimaginable that had there been an amicus  curiae present in the FISA Court at that moment, somebody--likely, the  amicus--would have said: Wait a minute. We have got a problem. Wait a  minute. You have got evidence that is unreliable. Wait a minute. You  have got huge credibility problems with the evidence that is backing up  what you are asking for. 

  Our amendment would require the FISA Court to appoint an amicus when  an application involves ``sensitive investigative matter,'' such as the  surveillance of candidates and elected officials or their staff,  political organizations, religious organizations, prominent individuals  within those organizations, and domestic news media. 

  One of the arguments made by those who oppose FISA reform is that the  appointment of an amicus would somehow slow down the surveillance and  the FISA order application process, which, so the argument goes, could  then harm our national security in those instances where there could be  an imminent attack. Anytime this argument is made, it is important for  the American people to listen and listen carefully. It is an important  argument. It is not one that we want to treat lightly. At the same  time, we have to remember the immense harm that has been inflicted, not  only on our own society but elsewhere, when people simply suggest:  Don't worry about this; it is a matter of national security. Don't  worry about it; we have the experts covering it. Don't worry about it;  your liberty is not to concern you. 

  We know the risk. We know that we have to ask the difficult  questions, and that is what we are doing here. 

  In any event, the argument doesn't work here. The argument falls  apart under its own weight here, you see, because our amendment allows  for the FISA Court to have flexibility. In fact, the FISA Court, under  the amendment, may decline to appoint an amicus if the court concludes  it would be inappropriate to do so under the circumstances. All it has  to do is make that finding. 

  Is this too great an intrusion on the ability of the U.S. Government  to collect information on U.S. citizens? I think not, especially as  here we are dealing with this sensitive investigative matter, one  involving an elected official or a candidate for elected office or  religious officials or media organizations. 

  We know in our hearts that these are areas where our foreign  intelligence surveillance authority ought to give way, ought to at  least recognize the rights of individual Americans.  

  Our amendment also provides the amicus with more access to  information regarding applications and requires the government to make  available the supporting documentation underlying assertions made in  applications if requested by the amicus or by the FISA Court itself. 

  Now, this information is, to be sure, required by the FBI's internal  operating procedures, including its so-called Woods procedures, to be  maintained in a series of documents known collectively as the Woods  files. 

  But the FBI's failure to correctly maintain the supporting  documentation or, in some cases, even to assemble it in the first  place--the documentation underlying these FISA applications to surveil  U.S. persons, that is--was itself the subject of the inspector  general's most recent memorandum to FBI Director Christopher Wray. That  memorandum proved, among other things, that the government's failure to  provide all of the evidence, especially evidence that undermined the  government's case before the FISA Court, when considering the  application to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, was not an  isolated accident. Quite to the contrary, after sampling 29 FBI  applications for FISA surveillance of U.S. persons, the inspector  general, Mr. Horowitz, found an average of 20 errors per application,  with most applications having either missing or inadequate Woods files,  leading the inspector general to conclude: ``We do not have confidence  that the FBI has executed its Woods procedures in compliance with FBI  policy.'' 

  This is absolutely unacceptable in any free republic, but especially  in ours, with the existence of the Fourth Amendment. 

  We are not talking about the failure to create or maintain some  obsolete piece of paperwork just for the sake of having it. No, no, no,  this is much more than that. And we are not talking here about  exculpatory evidence being withheld as to suspected foreign terrorists.  These are applications to surveil U.S. citizens and lawful permanent  residents, who themselves have constitutional rights and also have  an expectation that their government will not secretly spy on them, in  violation of that which is rightfully theirs under the Constitution of  the United States.  

  So you can't look at this and credibly, reliably, say: It is OK. Let  the FBI take care of it. The FBI is working on it. 

  We have been hearing that for years. I have been hearing that for 10  years--the entire decade that I have been at this business. And what  has happened? Well, what has happened is that we have seen time and  again that there have been abuses of the very sort that many of us have  been predicting for a long time would inevitably and repeatedly arise  in the absence of reform. 

  This doesn't require us to undertake a dismal view of humanity. No,  it is not that at all. It is simply that government is best understood  as the organized, official collective use of force, officially  sanctioned as part of a government. And, as James Madison explained in  Federalist 51, if men were angels we wouldn't need government. If we  had access to angels to run our government, we wouldn't need rules  about government. 

  But we are not angels, and we don't have access to them. So, instead,  we have to rely on humans. Humans are flawed. They make mistakes, and  they also sometimes decide for nefarious or political or other reasons  to flout the law--hence the need for the night watchman, hence the need  for rules that restricts their ability to do that. 

  So I find it entirely unsatisfactory when people say: Just let the  FBI deal with this, because, first of all, they haven't dealt with it.  They haven't dealt with it even as abuses have become more and more  known under various provisions of FISA and even as we are still coming  to terms with language that was adopted nearly two decades ago that  itself was overly broad at the time and has been abused since then. 

  No, we are not going to just trust that an organization that is able  to operate entirely in secret, with the benefit of protection of  national security laws, with the benefit of over-classification of  documents--we are not simply going to assume lightly that they are  going to fix it, because they haven't and because they won't and  because they don't want to. 

  I understand why they might not want to. All of us can appreciate  that when we do a job, if somebody else adds requirements to that job,  we might be naturally resistant to it. But that doesn't mean that we  don't need to do it here. That doesn't mean that our oath to uphold,  protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States doesn't  compel us to do so here. 

  We know that the FBI is not going to fix it because the FBI has in  the past adopted procedures designed to prevent this kind of  manipulation, this kind of chicanery from arising, including, most  notably, the Woods procedures. Yet we know that the Woods procedures  have been openly flouted. 

  So can we walk away from this and pretend that the 45th President of  the United States didn't have his own rights abused, his own campaign  surveilled abusively by the FBI itself? No, we can't. And I don't know  anyone--Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative or libertarian  or something else--who could look at that and say: Yes, that makes a  lot of sense. It makes a lot of sense that we should just leave  unfettered, unreviewable discretion in the hands of those who are able  to operate entirely in secret. 

  The Lee-Leahy amendment would require that the government turn over  to the FISA Court any and all material information in its position,  including information that might undermine its case as part of the FISA  application. As I said earlier, this information would be made  available to the amicus curiae upon request. 

  As an added protection, our amendment would require any Federal  officer filing an application for electronic surveillance or physical  search under FISA to certify that the officer has collected and  reviewed, for accuracy and for completeness, supporting documentation  for each factual assertion contained in the application. 

  If we are going to require people to go to the FISA Court at all to  get an order, if we are going to call it a court, ought we not require  that such evidence be assembled and at least be made available to those  whose job it is to make sure that the job is actually being done? 

  The Lee-Leahy amendment also requires these officers to certify in  each application that they have employed accuracy procedures put in  place by the Attorney General and the FISA Court to confirm this  certification before issuing an order. 

  Finally, the Lee-Leahy amendment requires the Department of Justice  inspector general to file an annual report regarding the accuracy of  FISA applications and the Department of Justice's compliance with its  requirements to disclose any and all material evidence that might  undermine their case. 

  Now, while I have a lot of ideas for reform, many of which are  included in the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act that Senator Leahy and  I introduced a couple of months ago, we were limited in this  circumstance for our purposes to just one amendment to the Pelosi- Nadler-Schiff bill. That is this amendment, the one that I have been  describing, the Lee-Leahy amendment. 

  We believe that our amendment is a very measured approach to enacting  those reforms that we believe to be most essential to protecting the  rights and the privacy of Americans from a system that, by its very  nature and, in some instances, by design, is ripe with opportunities  for abuse. It is not perfect, but it will go a long way, if we pass it,  toward forestalling this kind of abuse. 

  We have to remember that although we live in the greatest Republic  ever known to human beings and although our rights are, by and large,  respected in this country, we are by no means immune to the type of  abuse that can take hold in any system of government, especially a  system of government with a whole lot of resources at its disposal to  gather information, including efforts to gather information on that  government's own citizenry. 

  If we remember, about 45 years ago, there was a committee put  together, headed by a Senator from Idaho named Frank Church, that  looked at abuses of telephone surveillance by the government and  concluded that in basically every administration dating back to the  rise of the common usage of the telephone, our intelligence-gathering  resources within the United States had been utilized to engage in what  was essentially political espionage. 

  Since the late 1970s when the Church Committee issued its report, we  have had exponential growth in the ability of government and the  ability of everyone else, for that matter, to obtain and process data  and information. In most ways, it has been a real blessing. It is a  great thing. 

  It is also important for us to keep in mind the extent to which our  papers and effects are no longer found exclusively within physical file  cabinet files within someone's home or office. In many instances, they  can be found elsewhere in electronic form. 

  Our security and our liberty need not and ought never to be viewed as  irreconcilably at odds with each other. Many civil liberties and  privacy experts joined together in an effort known as the PCLOB a few  years ago--the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board--and  concluded a few years ago that our privacy and our liberty are not at  odds with each other. In fact, our privacy is part of our liberty. We  are not truly free unless our personal effects and our private  information can belong to us and not simply be open game for the  government. 

  It is sad and tragic that in order for this to come to light, it took  an assault on freedom so bold and so shameless as to loop in the  President of the United States. With this and other revelations that  have come to light in recent days and weeks and months and over the  last few years, we can't forget that these entities are still run by  human beings with their own political views, with their own agendas.  And in some cases, unfortunately--rare cases, I hope--people who are  charged with protecting the people and their liberty may in some cases  be inclined to be at odds with it. 

  It is unfortunate that the 45th President of the United States has  had, quite tragically, to become the victim of this. But I ask the  question, what if your information were on the line? What if you had  been targeted--maybe for political reasons, maybe for reasons that had  nothing to do with politics, maybe for reasons that just had to deal  with a personal vendetta someone had against any American. It is far  less likely that the abuse would ever have come to light. 

  In this circumstance, it did come to light. We can't ignore it, nor  can we pretend that it couldn't happen to any one of us--and I don't  mean as Members of the U.S. Senate; I just mean as Americans. In fact,  each and every one of us is less capable of standing up to this and  less likely to discover the abuse in the first instance. Not all of us  happen to be the President of the United States. 

  I am grateful that President Donald J. Trump has been willing to  speak truth to power and has been willing to call out the flagrant  abuse of FISA and of other procedures within the government. It is our  obligation, it is our solemn duty, and it is my pleasure to do  something about it. The Lee-Leahy amendment does something about it,  and I invite all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

Democrat,Christopher Murphy,"Murphy, Blumenthal Introduce Legislation Requiring Airlines Return Billions to Consumers During Coronavirus Pandemic","Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), joined by Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) today announced the Cash Refunds for Coronavirus Cancellations Act of 2020. This legislation would require major airlines and third-party ticket sellers to offer full cash refunds for all cancelled tickets during the coronavirus pandemic, regardless of whether the airline cancelled an entire flight or the passenger cancelled their individual ticket.

""Congress allocated billions of dollars to airlines to help them stay afloat during this pandemic, but the airlines continue to play games with their customers,"" said Murphy. ""Rebooking is impractical for many consumers, especially given the uncertain nature of the future course of the pandemic. I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing legislation to require the airlines to provide refunds.""

""Americans need and deserve their hard-earned cash back when the pandemic prevents them from flying, no matter when their tickets were booked,"" said Blumenthal. ""Consumers should receive cash refunds, not just credits, regardless of whether they or airlines cancel the flight. Airlines continue to mistreat and mislead taxpayers, after taxpayer money paid for massive bailouts. I'm proud to introduce this legislation with my colleagues to help put an end to this egregious anti-consumer behavior and ensure Americans get cash back in their pockets at this critical time.""

Deciding not to fly is the right choice for public health. Yet, when travelers proactively cancel their tickets, the airline industry only provides vouchers, not cash. And even though airlines are required under federal law to offer cash when they cancel an entire flight, most airlines only offer to rebook passengers or provide a voucher as the default option instead, forcing customers to jump hoops to actually get their money back. In response to these anti-consumer practices, the Senators previously sent a letter to eleven major domestic airlines, demanding cash refunds for all cancelled tickets during the coronavirus pandemic. Their investigation further revealed that the airline industry could be holding onto over $10 billion of hard-earned money from American travelers.

Specifically, the Cash Refunds for Coronavirus Cancellations Act would:

Require major airlines and third-party ticket sellers to offer full cash refunds for all cancelled tickets during the coronavirus pandemic, no matter whether the airline canceled the overall flight or the passenger canceled their individual ticketPermit airlines and third-party ticket sellers to offer travel vouchers as an alternative to cash refunds, as long as that voucher is valid indefinitely and the offer includes clear and conspicuous notice of the flyer's right to a cash refundAllow airlines to pay for cash refunds with any emergency money made available by Congress, except for the CARES Act grants designated for supporting worker payroll expenses and employee benefitsEstablish that the new right is retroactive to any flight on or after March 1, 2020, so that passengers who previously received a travel voucher, but have not used it, can ask for a cash refund nowMandate that cash refunds be available until 180 days after the end of the nationwide COVID-19 emergency declarations, which will give consumers six extra months of flexibility and peace of mind so they don't have to travel until they truly feel safe flying again""The airlines just received a multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailout and want to continue holding onto passengers' ticket dollars as well. Frankly, that doesn't fly,"" said Janet Domenitz, Board Chair of U.S. PIRG and Executive Director, MassPIRG. ""It's customers' money. Airlines have a responsibility to return it on request during this crisis.""

""Offering vouchers might be a defensible policy in ordinary times, but in a crisis of this magnitude, it is simply unfair to deny refunds to customers who canceled their flights,"" said Anna Laitin, Director of Financial Fairness and Legislative Strategy, Consumer Reports. ""The airlines should provide refunds to all customers whose travel plans were impacted by this unprecedented public health and economic crisis. With so many Americans out of work and facing financial hardship, a voucher for future travel is simply not appropriate or useful.  These consumers need their money back.""

""Consumers, facing one of the most devastating economic catastrophes in our nation's history, need every cent to make ends meet,"" said John Breyault, Vice President of Public Policy, Telecommunications, and Fraud, the National Consumers League. ""It should be unconscionable that airlines would play games with giving consumers cash refunds when flights get canceled. We applaud Senators Markey, Warren, Blumenthal, Murphy, and Harris for introducing this common-sense consumer protection bill which will ensure that consumers get the refunds they deserve without having to jump through the airlines' hoops.""

""Airlines are supposed to serve the public and they should be obliged to put passenger welfare first,"" said Susan Grant, Director of Consumer Protection and Privacy at Consumer Federation of America. ""We support Senator Markey's call for the airlines to offer cash refunds to people who don't want to gamble with their lives by flying during this health emergency."""
Democrat,Jon Tester,"Special pandemic watchdog commits to ""report any undue influence' after Tester presses on independent oversight","Continuing his push to hold government accountable and ensure strict oversight over the $2.2 trillion in pandemic relief aimed at helping workers and small businesses during the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. Senator Jon Tester secured a commitment from Brian Miller, the nominee to be Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery, that he would ""report any undue influence on me from whatever source.""

""I've been stonewalled every step of the way trying to get information from this Administration on where this money is going. Every single step of the way,"" said Tester. ""So your position is critically important if we are going to have any level of oversight.""

Tester was instrumental in creating the position of the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery within the Coronavirus Aid, Recovery, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and he and his colleague Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) called on the Administration to provide Congress with details about its plans for rigorous oversight.

Following President Trump's removal of Glenn Fine, the Chairman of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee charged with overseeing the distribution of $2.2 trillion in taxpayer dollars allocated by the CARES Act, Tester urged the heads of every federal agency tasked with pandemic recovery assistance to establish protocols to make sure coronavirus relief funds are targeted to the most affected businesses and individuals, and to update procedures to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. Tester called his removal ""a thumb in the eye to any Montana taxpayer who stands to receive critically-needed financial relief"" from the bill.

And Tester explained to Miller, currently a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office, why Americans could be concerned he will bow to pressure from the Administration to ignore wrongdoing: ""First of all, this is $2.2 trillion dollars in taxpayer money. Second of all, I have watched the President remove Atkinson, the intelligence Inspector General. I have watched him remove Rick Bright when he challenged Hydroxychloroquine. I have watched him remove Colonel Vindeman and his brother when he testified under oath on impeachment. I have watched him remove Glenn Fine. You worked as White House Counsel--the fact is I have no doubt that if you go against the President, he's going to remove you because he's done it time and time and time again."""
Republican,John Cornyn,Letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Kelly Craft - Rubio Joins Colleagues in Urging Administration to Address China's Crackdown of Free Speech,"Dear Secretary Pompeo and Ambassador Craft: As COVID-19 infections spread across the globe, we are grateful for the sacrifices people in every country are making in order to stem the spread of this virus. However, the sacrifice of the freedom of speech is not one that citizens of any nation should have to endure. It has become clear that some leaders are utilizing the virus as a guise to enforce their own illiberal agendas, suppress the free flow of information, increase digital surveillance, and quash dissent. The most visible -- and devastating -- effects of this practice are seen in China, the origin of the pandemic. We now know that suppression of information and censorship of criticism gave room for the virus to propagate and spread. In a March 13 analysis, researchers found that Chinese COVID-19 cases could have been reduced by 86% if measures had been taken two weeks earlier: Reporters Without Borders subsequently created a timeline outlining the progression of the pandemic that could have been halted through free speech and accurate, censorship-free reporting. Globally, the most successful COVID-19 interventions have been those that include transparency, coordination at all levels of government, and an informed and engaged general public. Now, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is using this public health emergency as a thin veil to cover a crackdown on peaceful dissent and freedom of speech. China has expelled at least 13 journalists from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post and banned them from working in Hong Kong and Macau. Additionally, a number of Chinese citizens reporting Wuhan--such as Fang Bin and Chen Qiushi--have disappeared. Populations already suffering under CCP repression, to include Tibetans and Uyghurs, are being targeted and arrested in transparent attempts to suppress their voices. Sadly, China is not unique in its utilization of the pandemic as an excuse to institute surveillance measures or draft new laws that are not necessary, proportionate, transparent, or time-bound. Iran's coronavirus taskforce banned all print media on March 30 to stymie reporting on the virus. Egyptian authorities expelled Guardian correspondent Ruth Michaelson on March 16 after she reported on a scientific study that contained allegedly ""exaggerated"" estimates of the country's number of cases. Venezuelan authorities detained freelance journalist Darvinson Rojas for reporting on the COVID-19 outbreak, and Turkish police detained two executives from the Ses newspaper for publishing a story on local coronavirus deaths. Turkish authorities are also targeting social media, detaining 229 people for making ""provocative"" posts about the coronavirus. Similarly, Cambodian authorities have arrested at least 23 people since January for expressing their views on the virus, and in Niger, activists such as Kaka Touda have been charged with disturbing the public order for posting on Facebook about local cases. Since mid-March, the Bangladeshi government has arrested a dozen people for spreading ""rumors"" around coronavirus, including a doctor, opposition activists, and students, using the draconian Digital Security Act. Thai authorities have arrested artist Danai Ussama for violating the Computer Crimes Act, basing the charge on a Facebook post in which Ussama complained that Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport did not screen him for COVID-19 upon his return from Barcelona. Therefore, we call on the Department of State to document acts of harassment, arrest, increased surveillance, or other forms of suppression or criminalization by regimes in retribution for those nation's citizens expressing their freedoms through media, social media, peaceful assembly, or other peaceful means. These cases should be raised bilaterally at the highest levels. Similarly, we call on the United States Mission to the United Nations to raise the profile of this alarming trend multilaterally at the United Nations, to include leading requests for a dialogue or briefings at the U.N. Security Council. Both the State Department and the U.S. Mission to the U.N. should also consider appropriate diplomatic engagement with like-minded partners on this issue with the goal of building upon existing speech and digital freedoms multilaterally. We stand with the defenders of free speech and expression in China, and in any nation across the globe where an illiberal regime is threatening these fundamental human rights. Thank you for your attention to this important matter. Respectfully,"
Democrat,Benjamin L. Cardin,"Letter to Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury, and Jovita Carranza, Administrator of the Small Business Administration - Senators Jones, Cardin and Colleagues Call for Use of Payroll Processors to Accelerate and Simplify Disbursement of CARES Act Small Business Loans","Dear Secretary Mnuchin and Administrator Carranza, 

Restaurants, main street retailers, and other small businesses across the country are being forced to close their doors or severely limit their services in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Many will go bankrupt without customers, as folks stay home and practice social distancing and as states start enacting forced closures for schools and events. It is critical that all tools be used to distribute federal funds effectively and expeditiously, including payroll processing companies used by many small businesses. 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and. Economic Security Act (CARES) Act authorized $350 billion for the Small Business Administration to provide loans of up to $10 million. Small businesses can use the loans to maintain payroll, keep workers on the books or pay for rent, mortgage and existing debt could be forgiven, provided workers stay employed for eight weeks once they receive the loan.

The Treasury Department, in consultation with the Administrator, can allow for other organizations that do not already participate in Small Business Administration lending programs to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program. 

We write to request that you allow payroll processing companies to disburse these essential funds to small businesses to reduce complications and expedite salaries to workers. In collaboration with lenders, payroll processors can play a key role in verifying payroll data to help facilitate a speedy process while also helping alleviate the risk of fraud.   

Payroll processors have the needed existing infrastructure that will enable businesses to quickly pay their workers and pending bills. Given they originate approximately 40 percent of all the payroll checks in the country and mostly cater to small businesses with 500 employees or less, involving these companies will ensure a deeper dissemination of funds nationwide to the businesses that need it most to keep their doors open.

Please consider permitting payroll processors to partner with small businesses and banks to help alleviate any potential complications for many small businesses during this tumultuous time.

 

Sincerely,"
Democrat,Dianne Feinstein,Feinstein Supports Bill Ensuring National Guardsmen Receive Full Federal Benefits,"Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) joined Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and a group of their colleagues to support the National Guard COVID-19 Response Stability Act, legislation that ensures all National Guard troops activated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic receive additional benefits and allows governors to continue using the National Guard to help coronavirus response efforts.

Currently, National Guard deployments are scheduled to end in June, one day short of the 90-day threshold for Guardsmen to receive additional federal benefits such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

""The California National Guard has played a key role in the state's coronavirus response, including helping conduct tests, treating patients and helping staff homeless shelters. Terminating these deployments in June in order to prevent guardsmen and reservists from qualifying for retirement and federal benefits is a bad decision. We shouldn't cut off this much-needed manpower in the middle of pandemic. I hope the Trump administration allows these deployments to continue and fully supports Guard members,"" said Feinstein.

""The Trump Administration's repeated attempts to nickel and dime members of the National Guard would be wrong under any circumstance, but it is particularly offensive when these troops are responding to a deadly COVID-19 pandemic that has already killed more than 90,000 Americans,"" said Duckworth. ""This legislation would ensure that all National Guard troops activated to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic are provided with the full benefits they've earned and will give states much-needed certainty during these uncertain times.""

In addition to Feinstein and Duckworth, the legislation is also supported by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)."
Republican,Joni Ernst,Fox News - Sen. Joni Ernst: Coronavirus -- Our essential workers are our heroes. It's time we pay them back,"By Joni Ernst

Lia Basemann is a 25-year-old registered nurse at UnityPoint Health-St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids. Early on in her career, and in the middle of planning a wedding for the fall, Lia typically serves in the cardiology department.

But, like all Iowans, the COVID-19 pandemic forced her to make some changes. And, like so many others, Lia is choosing to make a difference in these tough times. Now she's voluntarily working long days on the COVID-19 floor at St. Luke's. Her work is essential to the Iowans she's caring for every single day.

And it's not just our health care professionals who are stepping up during this pandemic. Jeff Hoker, owner of Hoker Trucking in Dixon, Iowa -- who no doubt has been working long hours these days -- gives us a picture of what his truck drivers are doing during this global pandemic.

""These guys are hard workers,"" Jeff said of his drivers. ""I'll tell you right now, these guys are busting their butt every day of the week.""

Our truck and delivery drivers play an essential role during this crisis. They are working around-the-clock to deliver food and supplies to folks across the country.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, essential workers in the United States have continued in their daily jobs -- to care for and protect Americans, to produce and deliver food and essential goods, and to uphold our nation's critical infrastructure. They are on the front lines of a battle, a fight, against an invisible enemy.

The invisible enemy we fight today is far different than when I served in Iraq, but the critical logistics operations, supply workers, medical professionals, and the many others who are on the front lines responding to coronavirus could not be more important to our victory.

Many of these hardworking men and women face added challenges and personal risks in their work during this pandemic, such as health concerns, reduced access to childcare, transportation interruptions, as well as an emotional toll on themselves and their loved ones.

These are nurses, truck drivers, and grocery store workers, and so many more who are all keeping life going right now.

These men and women -- our moms and dads, brothers and sisters -- are putting the livelihoods of their fellow Americans ahead of their own. Each and every morning, despite the pandemic, they wake up and go to work.

I believe these essential, front line workers deserve tax relief. That's why I'm proposing we provide a federal tax suspension for essential workers during this pandemic. I also believe we should suspend federal payroll taxes for these workers.

Our nation cannot weather this pandemic without our essential workforce, who are upholding our most critical infrastructure and industries-- ensuring Americans are fed and providing care for our loved ones. They deserve a reward for their selfless service. That's why I'm proposing we give these heroes a break.

Democrat,Jeanne Shaheen,Shaheen & Hassan Secure NH Priorities in Bipartisan Water Infrastructure and Drinking Water Bills,"U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) issued the following statements in response to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works' (EPW) unanimous approval of the America's Water Infrastructure Act (AWIA) of 2020 and the Drinking Water Infrastructure Act (DWIA) of 2020, two pieces of biennial legislation that authorize water infrastructure projects and drinking water programs around the country.

Shaheen and Hassan helped secure several New Hampshire priorities in the bill to:

-Direct the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) to provide priority funding for and to expedite the completion of the Portsmouth Harbor and Piscataqua River Navigation Improvement Project;-Require the Corps to expedite authorized activities to address shoaling impacts at Rye Harbor; and-Extend the use of the Cape Arundel Disposal Site, the primary site for placement of dredged materials from the harbors of New Hampshire and Maine, to ensure continuation of a regional disposal site for dredging projects.

In addition, Senator Shaheen led efforts to mobilize federal resources for the remediation of emerging contaminants in drinking water, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The DWIA authorizes $300 million for grants that can be used to treat PFAS in underground sources of drinking water, including private wells.

""I'm very pleased the committee heeded my calls and included these important provisions to respond directly to serious concerns about New Hampshire's waterways and water supplies,"" said Senator Shaheen. ""Prioritizing the completion of these vital navigation improvement projects is necessary to keep our fishermen safe and ensure the economic vitality of our coastal communities. Additionally, this robust investment to remediate our water sources that have been contaminated by potentially dangerous chemicals is a necessary step to safeguard public health. For too long, PFAS exposure in drinking water supplies has kept impacted families awake at night -- that's unacceptable. I appreciate the bipartisan work that produced this legislation and I'll work to see this bill through Congress, and ultimately, signed into law.""

""From strengthening navigation safety on the Piscataqua River, to addressing the significant shoaling at Rye Harbor, and improving our state's dredging capacity, these bipartisan bills will help bolster our state's water infrastructure and expand opportunity for our fishermen,"" said Senator Hassan. ""In addition to those important provisions, I am pleased to see that additional federal funding will be made available to clean up PFAS contamination in New Hampshire and across the country. I appreciate the committee's bipartisan work, and will continue pushing to get these bills swiftly passed into law.""  

The Portsmouth Harbor and Piscataqua River Navigation Improvement Project would widen the uppermost turning basin of the Piscataqua River from 800 feet to 1,200 feet, which would improve navigation safety. Due to its current narrow width, vessels navigating the river -- including liquefied petroleum gas tankers and other bulk shippers -- face significant safety risks and transit restrictions. Shaheen first secured authorization for the Portsmouth Harbor and Piscataqua River Navigation Improvement Project as part of the 2016 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). Since then, she has worked with the New Hampshire congressional delegation to prioritize the project, specifically including language in the 2018 WRDA urging the Corps to expedite the project. During a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing in March, Shaheen received assurance from R.D. James, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, that this project would be a priority for the Corps.

As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen helped procure more than $7 billion for the Corps to complete necessary infrastructure projects in New Hampshire and across the country in fiscal year (FY) 2020 funding legislation that the President signed into law. This is $651 million above last year's funding level and included the funding necessary to dredge Rye Harbor. In February, the Corps released their fiscal year 2020 work plan, which provided $4 million to complete dredging work at Rye Harbor -- a direct result of Shaheen's legislative efforts to secure the funding and support needed for the project. This followed Shaheen's successful efforts to address the need for emergency dredging at Hampton-Seabrook Harbor by directing the Corps to prioritize off-cycle, emergency dredging in its Work Plans. Following calls from Shaheen and Hassan, the Corps included $4.6 million in their 2019 Work Plan to dredge the harbor, which has since been completed.

Senator Shaheen has spearheaded efforts in Congress to uncover the potential health effects related to PFAS contamination, respond to the chemical exposure and remediate polluted sites. In March, Shaheen introduced landmark legislation, which Hassan cosponsored, to help communities combat PFAS contamination and exposure by providing substantial federal funding for PFAS remediation in drinking water and groundwater, including private wells. Provisions from this legislation were included in the Drinking Water Infrastructure Act, as was another supported by Shaheen and Hassan that requires the Environmental Protection Agency to establish national drinking water standards for two of the most common PFAS compounds, PFOA and PFOS. Senator Shaheen established the first-ever nationwide health study on the impact of PFAS chemicals in drinking water in 2017. The pilot study at Pease, which Shaheen fought for, began last fall."
Democrat,Benjamin L. Cardin,"Cardin, Booker Release Plan to Prevent Underserved & Underbanked Small Businesses from Falling Further Behind During the COVID-19 Economic Crisis","U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship Ranking Member Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) today released a proposal to prevent underserved and underbanked business owners, including minorities, women, and those in rural areas, from falling further behind during and after the COVID-19 economic crisis.

Cardin and Booker's proposal comes days after the Small Business Administration (SBA) Inspector General issued a report that found that SBA's failure to issue guidance to prioritize underserved and rural markets in the Paycheck Protection Program ""did not fully align"" with the Congressional intent of the CARES Act.

""Many of the communities that have been most affected by the public health consequences related to COVID-19 are also the communities that will be the most harmed economically,"" Ranking Member Cardin said. ""It is clear that Congress must do more to prevent underserved and underbanked communities from falling further behind during our current economic crisis. Senator Booker's and my proposal would make improvements to federal small business relief programs in order to make it easier for underserved small business owners to access the capital they need to survive COVID-19. Our proposal also addresses historical, systemic disparities in access to startup and operating capital, as well as technical training and mentorship, so underserved small businesses have the resources they need to adapt their businesses to the changes caused by COVID-19. Now is the time to make a targeted investment in those businesses and avoid the same mistakes from the past.""

""Across the country, small businesses are on the financial brink. And while federal assistance has provided emergency relief to some, millions of minority-owned and very small businesses--the beating heart of our rural main streets and urban corridors--find themselves on the outside looking in,"" said Senator Booker. ""This white paper outlines a host of concrete proposals to address historic inequities and structural barriers that too often keep these small business owners relegated to the sidelines.""

The proposal has been endorsed by more than a dozen economic development, civil rights, and small business advocacy organizations, including the Black Economic Alliance, National Urban League, Small Business Majority, the National Banker's Association, and the National Minority Supplier Diversity Council."
Republican,Thom Tillis,"Letter to the Hon. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States - Tillis, Colleagues Encourage President Trump to Defend Against Chinese Attacks on National Security","Dear Mr. President: 

As you continue to lead our nation through an unprecedented crisis, we write to express our concern about growing threats to our nation's defense industrial base that require aggressive vigilance and timely action from the federal government fully informed by the input and advice of the Department of Defense, Department of the Treasury, and the Department of State.

We commend the actions you have already taken to combat the coronavirus pandemic. We are committed to working with your administration to ensure the American people remain safe and the American economy remains strong. But, at the same time, we must not forget that this pandemic-with all the ramifications it has for our security and prosperity-is taking place in the context of great power competition. Our adversaries will not hesitate to capitalize on this crisis at the expense of the United States. We must not allow this to happen. We ask that you remain especially vigilant against this threat at this dynamic and uncertain time.

The stark reality is this: our adversaries are waging economic and financial warfare against us every day, and have specifically identified this crisis as an opportunity to insinuate themselves further into our capital markets-undermining our security and stealing our technology. There is clear and compelling evidence that our competitors see this as an opportunity to enhance their strategic position in key industries while other nations are paralyzed by the coronavirus pandemic. Specifically, the Chinese Communist Party and its vast political-industrial apparatus will undoubtedly prey upon cash-strapped American companies during this crisis. 

We commend your invocation of the Defense Production Act Title III program, and strongly support your use of all available national emergency powers and standing authorities to bolster and protect our strategic industries. It is not only the giants of the defense industrial base who need our immediate assistance. We must act-and act now-to shore up the entirety of the strategic supply chain so critical to our national security systems and platforms. This includes ensuring timely access to U.S. and benign foreign investment that is critical to stabilizing and sustaining the small, innovative, high-tech companies that supply our prime large- and mid-tier defense contractors. As cash flow becomes ever more constrained, these smaller companies may soon find themselves at a dangerous inflection point, at which funding from our adversaries could present the only perceived option for survival. We must not allow this to occur. 

First, we believe the nation will be best served if our small businesses never feel pressure to accept investment from our adversaries to begin with. The Department of Defense has established a sound process and open lines of communication with industry to identify the businesses-large and small-in need of our help. We respectfully encourage you to solicit advice and feedback from the Secretary of Defense, including his Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, to ensure we are prepared, if necessary, to augment the authorities and resources that maintain and protect U.S. defense industrial base capabilities.

Second, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), as strengthened by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, provides opportunities to negate adversarial investment in our industrial base. We encourage you to continue to aggressively use the CFIUS authorities to scrutinize any transaction or investment by People's Republic of China (PRC) state-owned or private enterprises that could threaten or undermine the national security of the United States, including any transactions involving nascent technological capabilities with likely national security applications. CFIUS must continue to remain adequately resourced to conduct reviews of these types of transactions as necessary to protect our national security. We encourage you to consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, as chair of CFIUS, to ensure that we are prepared to address any investment security threats.

Third, U.S. allies and partners also play an essential role in protecting U.S. national security. Many U.S. and allied supply chains are integrated, which can present a soft target for malign activities. We encourage you and the Secretary of State to raise· this issue with our allies, share important intelligence and other information, and provide technical support as may be necessary to protect our supply chains and our national security.

We stand ready to support any additional authorities you believe require Congressional authorization.

We look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure the freedom and prosperity of our great nation."
Independent,"Angus S. King, Jr.","As Coronavirus Spreads, King Leading Bipartisan Effort to Proactively Address Global Health Threats","U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) today announced that he is joining a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce the Public Health Emergency Response and Accountability Act, which would create a permanent reserve fund to enable quick and effective responses to future public health emergencies. The legislation comes as the coronavirus epidemic continues to threaten to develop into a pandemic, and after the administration has abolished or ignored programs designed to address these types of international threats. The legislation is also supported by Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawai'i), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.).

""We can't predict every health emergency that will pop up across the globe -- but we know from history that outbreaks will happen, and we must be ready to proactively address them,"" said Senator King. ""Rather than waiting for the next threat to arise, we should be building and supporting our public health infrastructure so we're well-equipped to face the challenges before us. Let's take this bipartisan step to protect the health of American people and make sure we're prepared for the future.""

The Public Health Emergency Response and Accountability Act would create a permanent capability for federal response agencies -- including the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and other federal departments -- to respond proactively to better track and get ahead of infectious diseases and other public health emergencies before they spread or get out of control.

Specifically, the legislation would provide automatic funding for the existing Public Health Emergency Fund, which would be available for a public health emergency regarding an infectious disease, bioterrorist attack, or disaster that is declared by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The bill includes safeguards that the funding will be spent according to best practices learned from previous responses to public health emergencies, appropriated based on historic needs, and properly monitored through robust accountability and oversight mechanisms for expended funds.

Senator King has strongly pushed for proactive efforts to protect global public health, and earlier this month introduced the Global Health Security Act to officially establish a permanent, Presidentially-appointed position to manage outbreak response efforts, advance the goals of the 2014 Global Health Security Agenda, and authorize annual funding towards that goal. Senators King and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter in February requesting details on USAID's recent decision to shutter PREDICT, a program established to identify and combat viruses that may generate global public health emergencies, such as the recent coronavirus. The letter follows up on a November request from Senator King, who asked for information on USAID's decision to end PREDICT. In January, he joined 30 of his Senate colleagues in sending a letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Alex Azar requesting updates on the Administration's response to the novel coronavirus outbreak and information on the steps being taken to keep American families safe."
Republican,John Hoeven,Hoeven Statement on Administration Increasing Medicare Reimbursement for Audio Telehealth Services During Pandemic,"Senator John Hoeven today issued the following statement after the Administration announced it will increase reimbursement for audio-only telehealth services, which will help ensure patients have better access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) today announced that payments for audio-only health services will be reimbursed similarly to services provided in-person or using video telehealth services. 

Hoeven joined a bipartisan group of Senators in urging HHS and CMS to ensure patients in areas without video capabilities for telehealth services have access to care by addressing disparities in reimbursement for audio-only services.

""Health care providers in North Dakota and across the nation are on the front lines during this public health emergency and we need to do all we can to support their efforts,"" said Hoeven. ""Given not all patients have access to video-based telehealth services, we appreciate HHS and CMS heeding our request to increase reimbursement for audio-only services, which will help ensure that patients have access to care whether it be over the telephone or through video-based telehealth services."" 

Earlier this month, Hoeven brought together North Dakota health care providers and administration officials to discuss the assistance passed by Congress to support efforts to combat COVID-19 as well as administrative actions put in place by HHS and CMS to assist health care providers as they address the pandemic."
Democrat,Jeanne Shaheen,"Shaheen Statement on Coronavirus Economic Response Legislation as Bill Clears Congress, Sent to President's Desk","U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, issued the following statement after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved bipartisan coronavirus response legislation to provide urgent relief to workers, small businesses, health care providers, hospitals and families impacted by this public health crisis. Shaheen voted in favor of the legislation on Wednesday night, which was approved unanimously, 96-0. This legislation was the result of around the clock bipartisan negotiations, of which Shaheen helped negotiate provisions to assist small businesses alongside Senators Rubio (R-FL), Cardin (D-MD) and Collins (R-ME).

""Throughout this crisis, delivering desperately needed assistance to the Granite State has been my top priority and I'm very pleased that this bill has passed Congress and will soon be signed into law. I urge the Trump administration to quickly distribute this emergency relief, particularly to working families and small businesses who need these resources as soon as possible to stay financially afloat. The direct payments in this bill will help New Hampshire's working families, particularly hourly and low-income workers, pay their bills, buy groceries, prescriptions and other necessities. In addition, New Hampshire will get at least $1.25 billion to bolster response efforts across the state. I worked very closely with senators from both sides of the aisle to negotiate legislation that helps small businesses get through this crisis and continue to meet payroll for their workers. I also fought for additional assistance for our hospitals that will soon see a terrifying surge in patients in the days and weeks ahead. The importance of keeping New Hampshire's hospitals operational with the resources they need to treat a rush of new patients can't be overstated. At my insistence, this bill provides financial support for child care costs for health care workers and other essential workers so that they can continue their vital work on the front lines.""

Shaheen continued, ""It was also important that this legislation have protections in place to prevent large corporations from misusing funding. This bill is by no means perfect and there are certainly additional measures I wish we could have included, but the fact is this bill provides urgently needed help to families, small businesses, hospitals and states who need this assistance quickly. Our work in Congress certainly doesn't end here -- Republicans and Democrats must continue to work across the aisle to overcome this crisis. This is one of those times in history when all Americans need to unite and do what's best for our communities and our country. We are all in this together.""

Below are topline priorities included in the bipartisan economic response package that were secured and supported by Shaheen:

Direct payments to many Americans of as much as $1,200 per person and $500 per child;Those who make under $75,000 a year will get a check or deposit for the full $1,200 as well as what they're entitled to for their children, as long as a tax return was submitted in 2018 or 2019 or received Social Security benefits.Individuals making between $75,000 and $99,000 will receive a reduced amount based on a sliding scale. Checks or deposits are limited to individuals making under $99,000. One exception to this: those file as a head of household and make below $112,500 will receive the full $1,200 payment.For joint filers making below $150,000, they will get a check or a deposit for $2,400 and there's a similar sliding scale for incomes up to $198,000.More than $377 billion for small businesses, which Shaheen helped negotiate, to meet their payroll and expenses, and receive education and assistance throughout the coronavirus pandemic; 4 months of increased unemployment assistance;   More than $100 billion in much needed assistance for hospitals and frontline health care providers, and billions more in funding for the broader health care system;Provides funding to health care and other essential workers for child care costs so that they can continue their important work on the front lines;$150 billion to help state and local governments cover new expenses related to coronavirus response;Significant restrictions and oversight to help ensure that larger corporations protect workers and don't misuse funding through stock buybacks and executive pay increases; and$10 billion in grants to help our nation's airports as the aviation sector grapples with the most steep and potentially sustained decline in air travel in history.By standing firm during negotiations and demanding a better bill, Senator Shaheen helped secure the following in recent days which was not in the original bill proposed by Leader McConnell:

4 months of expanded unemployment insurance instead of 3 months, to include gig economy workers and independent contractors;$150 billion for a state and local Coronavirus Relief fund of which at least $1.25 billion will go to New Hampshire to assist in COVID-19 response efforts;Increased funding to hospitals and other health care providers from $75 billion to $100 billion;More than $30 billion in additional funding to support the broader health care system;$10 billion for Small Business Administration (SBA) emergency grants of up to $10,000 to provide immediate relief for small business operating costs;$17 billion for SBA to cover 6 months of payments for small businesses with existing SBA loans;$30 billion in emergency education funding and $25 billion in emergency transit funding;$30 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund to provide financial assistance to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, as well as private nonprofits providing critical and essential services; Allowing for rent, mortgage and utility costs to be eligible for SBA loan forgiveness;$900 million for low income heating assistance through LIHEAP;$300 million in assistance for impacted fishermen and processors;Bans stock buybacks during government assistance plus an additional one year for any company receiving a government loan from the bill;A retention tax credit for employers to encourage businesses to keep workers on payroll during the crisis;Income tax exclusion for individuals who are receiving student loan repayment assistance from their employer;Eliminated a $3 billion bailout for big oil;Eliminated a ""secret bailout"" provision that would have allowed bailouts to corporations to be concealed for 6 months; andSaved hundreds of thousands of airline industry jobs and prohibited airlines from stock buybacks and CEO bonuses.Senator Shaheen spoke on the Senate floor about her efforts to improve this legislation for New Hampshire.

In addition to this legislation, Shaheen has fought for and voted in favor of two economic response bills to provide financial relief to states in their response efforts, and to support workers, businesses and families impacted by the spread of the coronavirus. The President signed both bills into law. The first economic package led to New Hampshire receiving an initial $4.9 million in funds from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."

Mr. President, when the framers wrote the Constitution they didn't think someone like me would serve as a United States Senator.

But they did envision someone like Donald Trump being president of the United States. Someone who thinks that he is above the law and that the rules don't apply to him.

So, they made sure our democracy had the tool of impeachment to stop that kind of abuse of power.

The House managers have clearly laid out a compelling case and evidence of Donald Trump's misconduct. They have shown that the president of the United States of America withheld military aid and a coveted White House meeting for his political gain. He wanted a foreign country to announce -- not actually conduct -- announce an investigation into his political rivals. And then he refused to comply with congressional investigations into his misconduct.

And, unfortunately, a majority of United States Senators -- even those who concede that what Donald Trump did was wrong -- are nonetheless going to refuse to hold him accountable.

The Senate trial of Donald Trump has been a miscarriage of justice.

Donald Trump is going to get away with abusing his position of power for personal gain, abusing his position of power to stop Congress from looking into his misconduct, and falsely claiming he's been exonerated.

He's going to escape accountability because a majority of senators have decided to let him. They voted repeatedly to block key evidence like witnesses and documents that could have shed light on the full truth.

And we must recognize that still in America, there are two systems of justice -- one for the powerful and another for everyone else.

So let's speak the truth about what our two systems of justice actually mean in the real world.

It means that in our country too many people walk into courthouses and face systemic bias. Too often they lack adequate legal representation -- whether they are overworked, underpaid or both

It means that a young man named Emmett Till was falsely accused and then murdered, but his murderer didn't have to spend a day in jail.

It means that four young Black men had their lives taken or turned upside down after being falsely accused of a crime in Groveland, Florida.

It means that right now, too many people in America, are sitting in jail without having yet been convicted of a crime but simply because they cannot afford bail.

And it means that future presidents of the United States will remember that the United States Senate failed to hold Donald Trump accountable, and they will be emboldened to abuse their power knowing there will be no consequence.

Donald Trump knows all this better than anybody. He may not acknowledge that we have two systems of justice, but he knows the institutions in this country -- be it the courts or the Senate -- are set up to protect powerful people like him.

He told us as much, when regarding the sexual assault of women, he said, ""When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.""

He said that Article II of the United States Constitution gives him as president the right to do whatever he wants.

Trump has shown us through his words and actions that he thinks he is above the law. And when the American people see the president acting as though he is above the law, it understandably leaves them feeling un-trustful of our system of justice, distrustful of our democracy. When the United States Senate refuses to hold him accountable, it reinforces that loss of trust in our system.

Now, I'm under no illusion that this body is poised to hold this president accountable. But despite the conduct of the United States Senate in this impeachment trial, the American people must continue to strive toward the more perfect union that our Constitution promises. 

And it's going to take all of us, in every state, every town, everywhere to continue fighting for the best of who we are as a country.

We each have an important role to play in fighting for those words inscribed on that United States Supreme Court: ""Equal Justice Under Law.""

Frederick Douglass, who like many, I consider to be one of the founders of our nation, wrote that, ""the whole history of the progress of human liberty that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle.""

The impeachment of Donald Trump has been one of those earnest struggles for liberty. In this fight, like so many before, it has been a fight against tyranny.

This struggle has not been an easy one and it has left too many people across our nation feeling cynical. For too many people, this trial confirms something they've always known: that the real power in this country lies not with them, but with just a few people who advance their own interests at the expense of others' needs.

For many, the injustice in this trial is yet another example of the way that our system of justice has worked--or, more accurately, failed to work.

But here's the thing. Frederick Douglass also told us that, ""if there is no struggle, there is no progress.""

He went on to say, ""Power concedes nothing without a demand.""

And he said, ""It never did and it never will.""

In order to wrestle power away from the few people at the very top who abuse their power, the American people are going to have to fight for the voice of the people and the power of the people. We must go into the darkness to shine a light, and we cannot be deterred, and we cannot be overwhelmed, and we cannot ever give up on our country.

We cannot ever give up on the ideals that are the foundation for our system of democracy. We can never give up on the meaning of true justice, and it is part of our history, our past, clearly our present, and our future that in order to make these values real--in order to make the promise of our country real--we can never take it for granted.

There will be moments in time and history where we experience incredible disappointment, but the greatest disappointment of all will be if we give up.

We cannot ever give up fighting for who we know we are, and we must always see who we can be unburdened by who we have been. That is the strength of our nation.

So, after the Senate votes today, Donald Trump will want the American people to feel cynical. He will want us not to care. He will want us to think that he is all powerful, and we have no power.

But we're not going to let him get away with that. We're not going to give him what he wants. Because the true power and potential of the United States of America resides not with the president, but with the people. All the people.

So in our long struggle for justice, I will do my part by voting to convict this lawless president and remove him from office. And I urge my colleagues to join me on the right side of history."
Republican,Jerry Moran,Sen. Moran Statement on Passing Additional Funding to Fight the Coronavirus,"U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today released the following statement on the Senate's vote to pass a supplemental funding package to protect against the coronavirus:

""The threat of coronavirus is serious, and today the Senate took an important step to ensure our federal, state and local governments have the tools necessary to help protect against the spread of the virus. The Senate passed an $8.3 billion supplemental funding package to supply test kits, quarantine locations, additional medical staff, further research on the virus and more. I am pleased that Kansas will receive $6 million to bolster the state's efforts to protect against the coronavirus. This funding is an important step in protecting the health of the American people, and I will continue to work with the administration, state and health officials to make certain we are ready on all fronts to stop the spread of this virus.""

Democrat,Benjamin L. Cardin,"Rep. Trone, Maryland Congressional Delegation Announce More than $422,000 in Covid-19 Relief Funding for Legal Aid Services","The full Maryland congressional delegation, including U.S. Congressman David Trone, Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, and Jamie B. Raskin, today announced $422,690 in federal funding for Maryland Legal Aid (MLA) to provide legal services to low-income Marylanders.

Funding comes from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which authorized $50 million nationwide to the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), an independent nonprofit established by Congress in 1974 to support civil legal aid services for low-income Marylanders. MLA will use this new federal funding to help Marylanders navigate legal problems stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic -- including job losses, senior scams, evictions and domestic violence.

""The COVID-19 public health emergency has presented far-reaching and complex challenges for many Marylanders across the state, especially for individuals who have lost jobs as a result of the pandemic and those living in underserved communities that lack adequate legal services,"" the delegation said. ""We will continue to fight for robust federal resources to ensure that all Marylanders are protected under the law.""

MLA is the largest provider of free legal aid in Maryland, offering a full range of legal services to low-income Marylanders across the state. MLA handles civil cases involving an array of issues, including child custody, housing, public benefits, consumer law (e.g., bankruptcy and debt collection) and criminal record expungements to remove barriers to obtaining child custody, housing and employment. See here for additional information about MLA's mission and services.

The delegation has previously announced funding for Maryland through the CARES Act including $1.6 million to create temporary disaster relief jobs, $45 million for child care centers, $45 million for the Governor's emergency education relief fund, $170 million for Maryland's institutions of higher education, $107 million for airports, $742 million for hospitals and health care providers, $15.6 million for community health centers and $48 million to Maryland local government jurisdictions."
Democrat,Richard J. Durbin,Providing A 77-Day Extension of Certain Authorities for Foreign Intelligence and International Terrorism Investigations,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are at an extraordinary moment in our  Nation's history. The President of the United States has declared a  national emergency. One has to go back to the early 1900s to the  Spanish influenza to find a similar public health threat to the United  States of America. We are in the midst of not just a threat in our own  country but a global coronavirus pandemic. There are more than 173,000  cases nationwide, and more than 7,300 people have died. 

  What you see today on the floor of the Senate is exactly the opposite  of what we are being advised as a nation we need to do. What you see  today on the floor of the Senate are staff people--thank you for being  here--protective forces outside the Chamber, and others who are  invisible to those coming and going who are part of the ordinary  business of the Senate. You see, we did today what the President has  told America we should not do, what medical experts have told us we  should not do. We have taken unnecessary airline flights to come here  to Washington, DC. I was on a plane this morning from Springfield, IL,  to Chicago. There were six passengers on the plane. Most people are  listening to the advice of the medical experts and avoiding unnecessary  travel. 

  Unfortunately, we were required to come back today from across the  United States. Some Members stayed over the weekend because their homes  are too far away. Some decided to drive this morning just to be  extremely safe. But the fact is, we were asked to take unnecessary  airline flights to come  back here today and this week and, frankly, expose ourselves to the  possibility of some public health risk and ask our staff to do the  same. 

  In addition to that, we have been counseled by the leaders--both at  the State and the Federal levels--not to gather in groups of more than  10. It looks like we are breaking that rule right here on the floor of  the Senate. The obvious question is why: Why would we put ourselves at  risk? Why would we put our staff at risk and their families to come  back here? 

  There are two issues. The first issue is the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act, which was brought up on the floor of the Senate last  Thursday, and Senator Lee and Senator Leahy offered the extension of  this act for a period of time in return for a few amendments to be  debated on the floor. That was rejected. 

  Just minutes ago, what was rejected last Thursday was accepted. We  made this trip back here, and it was not necessary. You have to ask  yourselves: Are we being respectful of ourselves, our family, our  staff? Are we being respectful of our responsibility as setting a model  for the rest of America? I am afraid not. 

  Now there is this bill remaining that just passed the House of  Representatives, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. The  coronavirus act was one that was negotiated by speaker Nancy Pelosi and  the President of the United States through Mr. Mnuchin. That went on  for a week, and the bill was agreed to and supported by both. The  President even tweeted his support for it. That shows his level of  commitment, I suppose. Speaker Pelosi supported it as well. It was a  measure that should have passed by a voice vote here in the Senate over  the weekend. Instead, we are still talking about it today. 

  There are measures included in it that are critical for public  health. May I gave you one example? When the State of Illinois and the  city of Chicago asked for protective masks for healthcare workers so  that they can avoid infection, they sent us an allotment of 25,000  masks. A State of 12.5 million people was sent 25,000 masks. Those  would protect the people working at one major hospital in Chicago for a  month. It is totally inadequate. 

  The last time we faced any kind of epidemic threat like this, we  received 1.5 million masks from the stockpile. What is holding up the  masks? What is holding up the test kits? Those are legitimate  questions. 

  One of the provisions in this bill that is still sitting here  somewhere in Senate limbo would authorize new masks to be released  across the United States to my State and others. So while we talk, the  masks are not being delivered. 

  Why, then, aren't we taking up this bill tonight? The coronavirus  bill should be taken up at this moment by unanimous consent. Let those  who object to it come to the floor if they wish and object and explain  why. If they have an amendment to offer, so be it. But if it is just to  let the ordinary course of things work their way through and maybe we  will get around to this by Wednesday or Thursday, shame on us. This is  a matter of national emergency and a public health crisis in this  country. 

  What kind of example are we setting by coming back to this Chamber at  risk to our staff and the people and ourselves and our families? We  have Members of the Senate going in and out of quarantine. They are  self-quarantining themselves, and we are acting like it is business as  usual. We will get around to it later this week. 

  What are we waiting for? This is a healthcare emergency. It is time  for both political parties to come to the floor--not this empty  Chamber--and do our job tonight. There is no excuse for it. If someone  has a substantive objection to the bill, state it on the floor. You  have plenty of chance to do it. Offer an amendment, if you wish, or  just vote no, but for goodness' sake, the American people expect us to  do our work. 

  We are here at risk to ourselves and others. We should do our work,  and do it quickly. If this is going to end up in some voice vote that  is quietly registered tomorrow, a number of us are going to be very  upset because we made this trip here because we had to represent our  people who elected us and sent us here thinking we would have to vote. 

  If we can do this without a vote, so be it. But couldn't this have  been done without exposing all of the staff people and all of the  protective forces and everyone else to the obvious pandemic that we  think is threatening our country in a massive way? 

  I take this very seriously because I love my family and friends. I  wouldn't want any of them to be hurt because of something I have picked  up--some virus I have picked up. I have increased my exposure today to  be here on this floor, and, tonight, we are going to quietly sneak away  and maybe come back tomorrow and actually do some work. We should do it  tonight. 

  This coronavirus emergency should be taken seriously by both parties  and taken seriously by the U.S. Senate. It is time for us to act. That  is what we were sent here to do. Let's do it. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield. BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. Let me defer to the Senator from Idaho. 

  I have just had this explained by my staff. There is an enrollment  correction that was supposed to be taken up on the floor of the House  today and sent over with the bill. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. I understand a Republican Member of the House is  objecting to the enrollment correction at this point, and it is being  held up there because of his objection. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question? 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I ask a question of the Senator from  Ohio. 

  The Senator from Idaho, who is a friend, raised a parliamentary  issue, and you have gotten to the heart of the matter with the question  of how families are going to survive in the midst of the pandemic and  what we are going to do about it. The Senator from Idaho raised a  parliamentary issue, and we are guided by rules around here. 

  To the knowledge of the Senator from Ohio, in the past, has the  Senate entered into agreement on bills posted in the House before the  papers actually arrived in the Senate? 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question through the Chair? 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. We have the Families First Coronavirus Response Act that  passed the House of Representatives early on Saturday morning, which we  could consider--and have in the past on a parliamentary basis--and  which I have called for, and others have joined me. We should move on  this and move on it quickly. The Senator from Massachusetts has  expanded it to other areas that we should be considering. While we are  here, let's get some work done. 

  Among the things included in this is the testing. The Senator said  there have been 84 tests in the entire State? 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. It is obvious that you cannot measure the actual rate of  infection until you have enough tests of those who are suspicious--who  have a fever or a cough. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. We have faced the same thing with 12.5 million people. We  have tested 360 a day for the entire State. It is ridiculous.      

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. I know. 

  The Governor has told me that we really don't know how many people  are infected. We don't know the rate--whether it is going up and at  what rate--and whether it is in certain areas of our State and not in  others. So, if you don't have testing, you don't have knowledge, and  you can't fight a pandemic. 

  I would just say to the Senator that this was the highest priority in  this bill that passed the House of Representatives on Saturday. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. We should have been here on Saturday. We should take it  up today. What are we waiting for? For goodness' sakes, we ought to do  it. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. The other thing is food assistance, and I know your State  struggles. There are many people, as you said. It is not paycheck to  paycheck; it is week to week. Some of them qualify for food stamps, the  SNAP program. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. It starts with testing. It is food assistance, and it is  also additional Medicaid money coming back to the State. I am sure the  State of West Virginia, like Illinois, desperately needs it. 

  I was surprised to learn today that the capacity of hospitals in the  United States is less than 1 million patients, fewer than 1 million  patients. In a nation of 350 million people, we have hospital capacity  of less than 1 million, and when it comes to the intensive care units,  it is a much, much smaller number than that. So that is our fear. If  this goes rampant, it could overwhelm our hospital system. 

  Certainly Medicaid money back to your State and mine in this bill  that passed the House should be authorized tonight. We should vote on  this tonight. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. Medical leave. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. There is no reason. And if the President was credible-- and I believe he was when he called this a national healthcare  emergency--we ought to act like it. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. Let's do it. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to conclude for the sake of the  staff and yourself and others who are here, who, as I mentioned  earlier, are at risk. We are all at risk with this pandemic. 

  But just to summarize as quickly as I can, we returned this week when  we were supposed to be back in our States. We returned this week  because there was pressing legislative business. One of the items  before us, raised by Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, was the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reauthorization. There are some  Senators who have questions and objections to the bill that passed the  House. Those Senators on the Republican side and on the Democratic side  came to the floor last Thursday and said: We will agree to an extension  of this law if you will give us a chance to actually debate our  concerns on the floor of the Senate. That request was rejected last  week by Senator McConnell. 

  So tonight we were going to have the showdown vote to see whether or  not we move forward on this, and, lo and behold, moments before that  vote, Senator McConnell agreed to what he refused to agree to last  Thursday. Yes, we will have a temporary extension, and we will have  debate and amendments before that extension expires. 

  So one of the reasons that we were drawn back to Washington, when we  were counseled by all the medical experts not to take unnecessary  airline flights, was for a matter that was resolved without a vote  tonight.  

  I came to the floor after that and said: If that is the case, then,  for goodness sakes, the only other remaining matter pending before us  is the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, passed by the House of  Representatives in the early hours of Saturday: free testing for  coronavirus, strengthening food assistance, safeguarding Medicaid  benefits, enhancing unemployment assistance, and establishing paid  leave. My request then was and still is, Why don't we pass that by  voice vote? Let's do it. 

  This was a measure agreed to on a bipartisan basis by Speaker Nancy  Pelosi and by the President of the United States, Donald Trump. If the  two of them can come together and agree on it, are you telling me we  can't agree on it in the Senate? And if someone wants to vote no, so be  it. Place your vote on the record. But for some reason we are not going  to do that. We are going to sit around tonight and come back tomorrow. 

  Will we do it tomorrow? I don't know. But there is no sense of  urgency in the Senate, as there should be--first, for the people in  this country who are facing this virus and the disruption in their own  personal lives. Some of those people are losing jobs, and some are sick  and should stay away from their jobs. They want to know what this bill  says that passed the House of Representatives--that there is medical  leave for them if they are sick and can't work, and then, if they lose  their jobs, if there is going to be some assistance for their families  in this time of trouble. Those are reasonable requests by every family.  That is the highest priority. Why would we wait to take that up? Why  would we delay that decision and leave more uncertainty among the  people of Illinois and across America? There is no reason or excuse for  it. Let's get that done. 

  Secondly, this measure also says that we are going to continue to  work on a bipartisan basis to solve this problem. Let's take this up  tomorrow morning. 

  As was noted before, we raised, in the initial bill to deal with this  pandemic, the President's ask from $2 billion to $8 billion and did it  on a bipartisan basis to put the medical and healthcare resources to  work across America. We should and we did, and we did it with a minimum  of debate on a bipartisan basis. 

  This bill, the second bill in the package, should have been treated  exactly the same way. It should have moved through the Senate without  asking all the Senators to return, the staff to come here, the Capitol  Hill Police and others to protect us, and all the staff support that we  have. We didn't have to go through this. We should have done this. 

  If Senator McConnell and the Republican leadership would have reached  out, he would have found there was a lot of cooperation available on  our side of the aisle--again, on a bipartisan basis. 

  I don't disagree with what the Senator from Massachusetts said. There  is more to be done--a lot more to be done. We will discover it, and we  should move on it quickly. But for the time being, pass this bill. Tell  the American people we heard you and we know what we are up against,  and we are in it together, on a bipartisan basis. 

  Let's not dream up some way in the Senate rules to drag this out day  after weary day and expose one another to the virus that has been  rampantly crossing this country and threatening us every single day. We  need to do this work, get it done, and get it done quickly.

Democrat,Amy Klobuchar,Executive Calendar,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor a  life lost, share in the grief of a family and a Nation in pain, and  call for this body to take action to reform a system that has been  broken for too long. 

  George Floyd should be alive today, but he isn't. He was murdered by  police in my State--a death both horrifying and inhumane but not  unique. We literally saw his life evaporate before our eyes. The whole  country saw it. The whole world saw it. 

  We know that our African-American community in Minneapolis and across  America has seen this horror before and has experienced injustice for  far too long. They have had enough. They are angry and in pain, and  they are calling out for justice. 

  Senators, we cannot answer with silence. That would make us  complicit. We cannot answer with what the President called dominance.  That would make us monsters. We cannot answer with using churches as  props and Bibles as props and inflaming violence. We must answer with  action. That is what makes us lawmakers. 

  For 13 years, here in Washington, change has come inch by inch when  we should be miles ahead. I pick that time because that is when I first  got here. That is when I first started doing work on crack cocaine and  sentencing disparity, and I have seen those changes, but it is inch by  inch. 

  First, there needs to be justice for George Floyd. There needs to be  criminal accountability to the fullest extent of the law. Minnesota  attorney general Keith Ellison, with whom I have worked closely for  years, has taken over the investigation and the prosecution of the  case. I have full faith in his conviction for justice in this case and  beyond. 

  Sweeping reform starts with accountability in this individual case,  but it doesn't end there. We all know that these officers work within a  bigger system, so that is why I called for a full-scale investigation  into the patterns and practices of racially discriminatory policing in  the Minneapolis Police by the Department of Justice, in addition to  ongoing local, State, and Federal investigations. 

  Senator Smith and I led a request with 26 Senators asking the Justice  Department to conduct what is called a pattern-and-practice  investigation. This afternoon, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights  announced that they are going to investigate the police department as  well. 

  The words engraved on the Supreme Court building, ``Equal Justice  Under Law,'' we know have never really been true for millions of  African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, and other minority  groups. There is systematic racism at every level of our judicial  system, and that calls for systematic change. 

  We must take action to end unconstitutional, discriminatory policing  across the country. We can start by making sure that policemen's  conduct is independently investigated and that we hold officers  criminally accountable when they break the law and violate the trust  that is needed between law enforcement officers and the people they  have sworn to protect. 

  We also need strong Federal requirements for State and local police  to collect and report data on the use of force. Right now, a patchwork  of local policies, many of which allow local police to avoid  accountability, make it far too difficult to identify and address  patterns of discrimination and excessive force in police departments.  Better  data will help hold officers and departments accountable. 

  Broader criminal justice reform and the standard for use of force-- all of those things must change. As I mentioned, we have done  something. We passed the First Step Act when it comes to sentencing,  but now we need to take on the Second Step Act to create incentives for  States to restore discretion for mandatory sentencing for nonviolent  offenders and reform the conditions in State prisons and local jails. 

  We know these conditions have gotten even worse during the  coronavirus pandemic. Earlier today, we held a hearing in the Judiciary  Committee about the continued injustice we are seeing in our prison  system during this pandemic. While some people, like Paul Manafort,  have been transferred to home confinement, others, like Andrea Circle  Bear or Andrea High Bear, who is serving 26 months for a nonviolent  drug offense and had just given birth while on a ventilator--why? She  was exposed to the virus. So the question is, Why did a pregnant woman  with a preexisting condition--an American Indian woman who was there  for a nonviolent offense--why was she there in the prison system and  Paul Manafort gets out? 

  We should also create a diverse, bipartisan clemency advisory board-- one that includes victim advocates as well as prison and sentencing  reform advocates--that would look at these issues from a different  perspective. 

  We should strengthen post-conviction reviews with conviction  integrity units across the country. According to data from the National  Registry of Exonerations, there are currently fewer than 60 conviction  integrity units in the United States, and many of those are too weak to  be effective. Attorney General Ellison and I have been working with  prosecutors in Minnesota to set up a conviction integrity unit in the  Twin Cities with strong, strong standards for independence and  transparency. This needs to happen nationally. 

  We should also expand post-conviction sentencing reviews. Ensuring  justice isn't just looking back at a case to see whether the evidence  was right; it is also looking to see whether the sentence was right in  a situation. 

  All of this--expanding our Nation's drug courts, which is something  that I have been leading on in the Senate for years, changing that  conversation about drug and alcohol treatment, reforming the cash bail  system--if there is anything we as a Senate can do to eliminate  injustice within our justice system, we should do it, and we should do  it now. Talk is no longer enough. 

  We know this pandemic has shed a light on the injustice we have  already seen, as Senator Durbin, who was here, and I discussed about  the prison system today. We also see it in the number of people dying.  In Louisiana, African Americans account for nearly 60 percent of deaths  but 33 percent of the population. In Georgia, a study of eight  hospitals found that 80 percent of their COVID-19 patients were African  Americans yet 30 percent of the population. The workers on the  frontline, the people who are working not just in the hospitals, not  just in the emergency rooms, but in the grocery stores, driving the  public transportation, are getting this virus--this sometimes fatal  virus--at a much higher rate. This calls for not only the reforms that  I laid out and that I have been advocating for years but also calls for  investment, like Jim Clyburn's plan to invest in underserved areas and  impoverished areas that have been that way for a long, long time.  Senator Booker is carrying that bill in the Senate.  

  Martin Luther King once said that we are ``all tied in a single  garment of destiny. Whatever affects one of us directly, affects all  indirectly.'' That means, in the long term, an economy that works for  everyone, with fair wages, with childcare, and with retirement savings.  It means closing the wealth gap. Black and Latino households have only  about a tenth of the medium net worth right now of White households. It  means voting rights. 

  The scene that we saw in Wisconsin where people were standing in the  rain with homemade masks and garbage bags just to be able to vote,  risking their lives and their health, while the President of the United  States was able to vote in the luxury of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  because he could get a mail-in ballot from Palm Beach, FL--that is a  split screen for you. That is why people are out peacefully marching.  That is what they are angry about. It is police misconduct. It is the  murder of George Floyd. It is the longtime economic disparities, but it  is also the longtime suppression of the vote and the unfairness of all  of this. 

  This has been a devastating time for Minnesota, but as George Floyd's  family, whom I had the honor to talk with at length this weekend, said:  We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger  others during this pandemic. We will demand and ultimately force  lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and  unacceptable and by winning justice. 

  That is what they are talking about in Minnesota today. That was the  spirit that I saw when my husband and I went to drop off food, where  hundreds of people were there with thousands of bags of groceries  because their grocery stores in that neighborhood had been burned to  the core and their stores had been looted, not by the peaceful,  righteous marchers but the people who were hiding behind them. 

  I will end with this. A few years ago I went to Selma, AL, with  Representative   John Lewis, like so many Senators have done. I stood  there on the bridge where he had his head beaten in. I was in awe of  his persistence, his resilience, and his faith that this country could  be better, if only we put in the work. That weekend, after 48 years,  the White police chief of Montgomery handed his police badge to  Congressman Lewis and publicly apologized on behalf of the police for  not protecting him 48 years before and not protecting his freedom  marchers. 

  I don't want to take 48 years for my city and my State to heal or for  our Nation to fix a justice system that has been broken since it was  built. I want justice now. The people of this country deserve justice  now. Everyone has a role to play in coming back from these crises. The  protesters are shining a light on injustice that we have pushed to the  shadows for far too long. The frontline workers and volunteers are  serving the communities they love, and they are looking to all of us to  deliver the reforms we promised--not just in speeches, not just in  campaigns, but in reality, and not just for George Floyd. His legacy  should be so much more than those 9 minutes--or Philando Castile or  Jamar Clark or Breonna Taylor--because we took an oath. 

  We took an oath, colleagues. We didn't wave a Bible in the air for a  photo op. We placed our hand on that Bible, and we swore to support and  defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,  foreign and domestic. The enemy we face now is racism. The enemy we  face now is injustice. I don't know what else to say because too many  words have been said, and maybe it is time to stop talking. Maybe it is  time to start acting. It is time to get to work. It is time to do our  jobs.

Republican,Ted Cruz,MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019--Motion to Proceed,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, this is a time of extraordinary crisis for  our Nation. 

  In this time of crisis, I call upon each of our colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to rise above--rise above paid partisanship, rise  above the bickering that so often consumes Washington, rise above and  put first the priorities of the millions of Americans who are hurt. 

  Look, there is a time for political disagreements. There is a time  for policy disagreements. I am no stranger to robust political and  policy disagreements. But we are in this midst of a global pandemic.  People are dying. People are suffering. 

  Last night, when this Senate voted on whether to move forward with  emergency relief legislation for the millions of people being  devastated by the economic disaster we are seeing as a result of the  coronavirus epidemic, every single Democrat in this body voted to block  consideration of this bill 

  Now, for those of you at home who are not poring over a Senate  procedural matter, what does it mean to vote to block consideration? It  doesn't mean they voted against the bill. It means they voted against  even starting to take it up. 

  The New York Times headline, moments afterward, said: Democrats block  $1.7 trillion stimulus bill. Of course, that headline had the fault of  being accurate, and so within minutes, the New York Times changed it  to: Democrats block $1.7 trillion stimulus bill citing worker concerns.  That was headline No. 2. 

  But then apparently the partisan leanings of the New York Times were  too strong for that, and so they revised it a third time to say:  Partisan division halts discussion of the bill. 

  No, it wasn't partisan division. It was one party--the Democratic  Party--saying to this Chamber and the American people: Hell, no. We  will not even take this up and discuss it. 

  At a time of crisis, at a time when people are dying, that is wrong.  That is shameful. 

  When we awakened this morning, following the Democrats' obstruction,  worldwide there were 372,563 reported cases of the coronavirus. In the  hours since then, just today, there have been an additional 23,352  cases reported today. While the Democrats are blocking the bill, 23,000  new cases today. 

  In the United States, when we started this morning, there were 35,224  cases--this morning. Right now, as of the latest numbers, there are  41,708 cases in the United States today. That means we have had an  additional 6,484 cases today while the Democrats are blockading--and by  the way, where are the Democrats? 

  C-SPAN doesn't show this whole Chamber often, but it would be nice if  they did because that entire side of the Chamber is empty. They are not  showing up for work. They are not doing their job. 

  In Texas this morning, there had been 668 cases. As of right now,  there are 722--54 more cases today while the Democrats are blocking  consideration of this bill. 

  How about deaths? Look, as we look at this crisis, there are people  right now gasping for breath. You and I, we have friends who have been  diagnosed with this disease. We have read stories. We have talked to  people who have struggled under it. 

  I heard from one individual who is hospitalized right now that  breathing felt like a belt strapped across his chest; that he could  barely breathe. 

  As of this morning, worldwide, there had been 16,381 deaths. I am  sorry--that is the number now. This morning it was only 15,308. That  means today, while the Democrats have been blocking this bill, 1,073  additional people died. 

  In the United States, as of this morning, there were 471 deaths  reported due to coronavirus. As of right now, it is 573. That means  today 102 Americans died while the Democrats were blocking  consideration of this bill. 

  In Texas as of this morning, there had been eight deaths. Now there  are nine. One Texan died while half this Chamber refused to show up and  do their job. 

  Now, this morning when we voted again, we saw the first signs of  cracks. There was one Democrat, a Senator from Alabama, who had voted  no yesterday, decided this morning, well, maybe we should take up the  bill. One. One Democrat. Where are the rest? 

  There are a lot of Democrats who like to hold themselves out as  moderate Democrats. Where are they? 

  Right now, what the Democratic leadership is doing is they are  playing games. They are playing games in a way that is irresponsible. 

  Listen, this bill has a lot of important elements for a lot of people  who are hurting. You have not only the people who are hospitalized, the  people who are suffering, but you also have economic devastation, as  much of this country has ground to a halt. 

  We have people who work in restaurants, waiters, waitresses, bellboys  who haven't gone to work in over a week. We have people in hotels. I  have spoken to business owner after business owner after business owner  for the last week. 

  One hotel owner described how he currently had 6 percent occupancy  rates. You can't keep a hotel running with 6 percent occupancy rates. 

  I talked to one hotel owner who described how he had made 5,000  layoffs in the last week. Another hotel owner had made 6,000 layoffs in  the past week. 

  I talked to an oil and gas business owner who had laid off 5,000  workers in the past week. I talked to another oil and gas business  owner who had laid off 5,000 workers in the last week. 

  You know, today I am thinking about people like my friends, the  Republic Country Club. Now, Republic Country Club is a bit of a  misnomer. It is a barbecue joint outside of Houston. It is owned by my  friend Michael Berry. It is often the venue of country-western  concerts. The venue is sometimes for comedy shows. 

  I went and took my dad to Larry the Cable Guy at Republic Country  Club. I have had multiple election night parties at Republic Country  Club. It is a big old honky-tonk. You have never seen so many confused  national reporters as they walked in and looked around and didn't know  what to make of the place.  

  Father's Day a year ago, I did a Father's Day party at Republic  Country Club. My dad--we roasted up two whole pigs. The cook staff at  the barbecue place, they made them up and had a big  party. We invited people there. It is a Cuban tradition to roast a  whole pig. 

  Now, why am I telling you about Republic Country Club? Because  yesterday, which happened to be my father's 81st birthday--yesterday  Republic Country Club announced they are closing their doors. 

  Yesterday Michael Berry sent out a tweet telling first responders,  telling police officers and firefighters and everyone on the frontline,  he said: Drive by Republic Country Club today--March 23--drive by  during the day, and we will give you free barbecue. We are going to  cook everything we have, and we are just going to give it away and to  go. You can't come in, but we are going to give you to-go boxes. 

  And he went on to say they are emptying out all of the liquor from  the storeroom and from behind the bar, and they are giving it to the  employees because the employees are all being laid off. And he said he  doesn't know if he will open again. 

  Now, I will tell you, those employees--the bartenders, the bouncers-- many of them are veterans. Many of them are big guys, covered with  tats. They are salt of the earth, and right now they don't know where  the rent check is coming from next week. 

  That is happening all across this country. That is happening not just  at one barbecue place in Houston. That is happening at bars. That is  happening at nail salons. It is happening at movie theaters. 

  You know, I love Sunday night to go with a buddy of mine and go watch  a movie. Movie theaters are shut down all over this country. 

  Retail stores--people laid off. Nobody is going to the mall right  now, and for the people who are hurting, they are scared. They don't  know, No. 1, if they are going to get sick, but No. 2, they don't know  how they are going to make ends meet. 

  This is a time of crisis, and we ought to be coming together. 

  Now, listen, this bill that we were moving to, I don't necessarily  agree with every word of it, but there are a number of elements in this  bill that are designed to provide real help to people who are hurting. 

  One element of this bill is to give cash--an immediate check for  $1,200--to every person in this country, every adult in this country  earning under $75,000 a year, $2,400 for every couple earning under  $150,000 a year, plus $500 for every child they have. 

  Now, you want to talk about real relief for people who are scared and  they say: What do I do next? Those are checks that are coming in the  mail. And what have the Democrats said? No. Halt the checks. 

  Right now, those checks aren't coming, and they aren't coming for one  reason: because the Senate Democrats are blocking taking up that bill. 

  In many circumstances, that would not be the right policy outcome, to  just send checks to people, but at a time of crisis, where you need  people just to be able to make it to tomorrow, putting some resources  in their hands makes a big difference. 

  Another element of this bill that is being blocked by Senate  Democrats is $350 billion in emergency loans to small businesses--to  small businesses like Republic Country Club, to small businesses like  restaurants and bars, and small businesses like nail salons and barber  shops and movie theaters and dress shops and hardware stores, small  businesses that are right now putting up the signs saying: ``Closed for  coronavirus.'' 

  Those emergency loans are designed to be given with the condition  that they keep their employees on payroll. A lot of these small  business owners want to keep their employees on payroll, but they don't  have the cash. Under the terms of this bill, those loans are forgiven  if--if--if they keep their employees on payroll. 

  By the way, the Democratic talking point is, oh, this is just cash to  businesses. Tell that to the owner of the barber shop who takes an  emergency loan to not fire all of her employees. That loan, under the  terms, is forgiven if the employees stay on the payroll. The Democrats  are blocking that right now. 

  What about unemployment insurance? The job numbers coming out shortly  I expect to be massive in terms of the job losses. I think we will see  north of 2 or 3 million people who lost their jobs, and the numbers are  getting worse. Every phone call I have is with more people who are  losing their jobs. It is bad. It will come back, but it is bad right  now. We need emergency support to get people through this dark time. 

  This bill has $250 billion for additional unemployment insurance.  What does that mean? That is an additional $600 per week for an  additional 13 weeks. If you are one of the waitresses right now who  have just been told their jobs have gone away and you applied for  unemployment insurance, if this bill passes, you get an extra $600  immediately. But you know what--you don't right now because Senate  Democrats are blocking this. If they have reasonable concerns, they are  welcome to raise them. 

  By the way, this bill was drafted with the participation of nearly a  dozen Senate Democrats who were actively part of the task force's  submitting suggestions. One of the suggestions the Democrats submitted  during the drafting was to plus-up those unemployment insurance  numbers, and they got agreement. This was drafted in a bipartisan  manner. 

  What happened? I will tell you. Yesterday, Sunday, most of us thought  we were going to move with this, but then Nancy Pelosi decided it is  time to play politics, decided to throw a grenade into this whole  process. She had a list of demands--an over 1,000-page bill she drops  out of nowhere--and the demands she is pushing, I ask you, do these  have anything to do with the coronavirus epidemic? 

  A number of people have cited the famed quote of Rahm Emanuel:  ``Never let a good crisis go to waste.'' Sadly, we are seeing the  embodiment of that cynical approach right now because all of the people  out of jobs, the Democrats are using to push--what are they pushing  for? Changing the emissions standards for airplanes. What the hell do  the emissions standards for airplanes have to do with millions of  people out of work during the coronavirus epidemic? Don't treat this  bill like a partisan Christmas. 

  Republicans have things we would like to advance, too, things I  believe in deeply. You want to talk about what I would like to do? I  would like to abolish the IRS. I campaigned all over the country for  that. I will continue fighting for that, but I am not standing here  with an amendment, saying: As part of this emergency relief, let's  abolish the IRS. There is a place for that political and policy  discussion. 

  The Democrats are pushing wind and solar tax credits. What in the  hell does a windmill have to do with this crisis, other than some  Democratic lobbyists getting fat and rich, and they are willing to  extort a crisis to try to advance their political agenda? 

  There are mandates on corporate board diversity. So these are  Democrats who want to social-engineer. Listen, I actually have a lot of  problems with corporate boards. We have far too many corporate boards  that are docile and do what management wants. That is a serious  problem. There is a lot of discussion about stock buybacks. I tell you,  what I am concerned about with stock buybacks is when you have  compensation agreements in place that the executives get rich if they  get a short-term boost in share price, and it ends up hurting the  shareholders. I would love to see more vigorous boards of directors  that make sure you are not creating incentives to gain a stock price.  That is a reasonable question. But they want to mandate, effectively,  quotas on boards of directors. What in the hell does that have to do  with this crisis? 

  The Pelosi wish list wants to restructure the debt of the post  office. Last time I checked, our postal workers go through wind and  rain and snow, but they haven't been laid off. 

  I call upon both sides--don't play games with this. This crisis isn't  going to end tomorrow. It is not going to end the next day. It is going  to last for a considerable time. It is going to require adults to step  up and lead. 

  On the pandemic, we need to follow the science. We need to listen to  the doctors. We need to listen to the physicians. We need to take the  steps we are taking to keep people safe. 

  On the economy, we need to give people who are hurting immediate  relief, and we need to make sure a liquidity crisis doesn't become a  solvency crisis. 

  It is interesting--many Democrats are saying they don't want  corporate  bailouts. I agree. I am passionately opposed to corporate bailouts. One  of the things I was gratefully relieved about as far as how this bill  was structured is that it is structured as loans and not condition-free  grants. It is structured primarily so that it is not picking favored  companies that happen to have a big lobbying presence in Washington. 

  What does it mean to not have a liquidity crisis become a solvency  crisis? Let's take, for example, the airlines. I have spoken with every  major airline CEO in the past 2 weeks. The airlines are losing billions  of dollars every month. They didn't cause this problem. Unlike the  financial crisis in 2008, this crisis was not caused by misconduct of  one industry or another. It is not the airlines' fault that the Federal  Government has shut down flights to Asia and to Europe. That is not  their fault. It is not the fault of the owner of a restaurant in  downtown Houston that the city of Houston has shut down the restaurant.  It is not the small business owner's fault. 

  What we don't want is, when the bills come due for all of those  businesses, for them to have to sell their assets in a fire sale. We  don't want the restaurant owner who has a pizzeria, who has saved to  buy this fantastic pizza oven, to have to sell the pizza oven for  pennies on the dollar because a liquidity crisis has become a solvency  crisis. We don't want our U.S. airlines to put up a garage sale  effectively to sell all their airplanes because they are going bankrupt  in the midst of a crisis. We want to come out of this with a strong,  robust commercial airlines sector. We want to come out of this with  small businesses thriving. We want to come out of this with a thriving  energy sector. We want to come out of this with jobs. 

  I will close this the way I started--by calling on Democrats and  calling on Republicans to rise above petty partisan games. The  Democratic leaders are playing these games to every one of you  Democrats. Listen to the men and women in your States. Don't give in to  the games. Most of the Democratic Senators say they don't even know  what their side wants. But it is just their leadership that is willing  to hold the American people hostage for unrelated, political, partisan  objectives. 

  By the way, one of the reasons I think Senate Democrats are so  willing to engage in this is they expect the media to be utterly  complicit in their cynical gamesmanship. So we stand here this  afternoon--and it is not only the Democratic side of the Chamber that  is empty, but as I look up to the press, nobody is there. There is not  a single reporter sitting in the Chamber. I have seen the New York  Times--actually, nobody is sitting in the Chamber, so they may have  closed the Chamber, in which case that may have been an unfair assault.  But it is not an unfair assault to say that the New York Times is  changing its headline to give political cover to Senate Democrats 

  This is a time of crisis, not a time to play games. It is time to  rise above. It is a time to stand for the American men and women. It is  a time to stand for jobs. It is a time to help protect people's lives.

Republican,Mike Rounds,"Following Rounds Request, Administration Declares Meat Processing Plants as Critical Infrastructure by Invoking the Defense Production Act","U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) today issued the following statement after President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to declare meat processing plants as critical infrastructure. Under the Executive Order issued tonight, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is directed to make certain America's meat and poultry processors continue operations uninterrupted to the maximum extent possible.

""Yesterday, I wrote to President Trump to underscore the need to invoke the Defense Production Act to keep food processing plants open safely,"" said Rounds. ""I'm pleased the president took this necessary action to make certain our food supply chain can continue to provide food to American families during this time of crisis. I'll continue to work with the administration and stakeholders to protect the health of our food processing workers, and get idle plants up and running as quickly as possible.""

Yesterday, Rounds sent a letter to President Trump urging him to take this action. Earlier this week, Rounds sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence calling for the administration to develop a plan that simultaneously protects food workers and public health, as well as addresses the nation's on-farm and on-ranch livestock emergency. He continues to work with producers, stakeholders and the administration to develop a plan to help producers address the food production crisis."
Democrat,Tammy Baldwin,Senator Baldwin to Trump Administration: Take Action to Fix Paycheck Protection Program and Help Rescue Wisconsin Small Businesses,"U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin is demanding the Trump administration take immediate action to fix the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), created in the bipartisan CARES Act, to ensure banks can swiftly provide loans that will help rescue Wisconsin small businesses and non-profits.

In her letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Small Business Administrator Jovita Carranza, Baldwin urged the administration to swiftly work with lenders to provide clear guidance on PPP, change the PPP's rules to allow small businesses to spend a greater amount of their loan on fixed costs, and provide additional technical capability and support so banks and small businesses can access SBA resources.

Baldwin writes, ""Wisconsin small businesses and non-profits need help meeting their payroll and covering other operating expenses and PPP is uniquely suited to achieve those goals by allowing banks to leverage their expertise and offer SBA-guaranteed loans to their customers. However, I've heard from lenders in Wisconsin that are frustrated and confused with the rollout of this program and unable to make loans. I have also heard from small businesses that can't access loans. I ask you to immediately take action to ensure banks can swiftly provide these loans and help rescue Wisconsin small businesses and non-profits.""

Senator Baldwin has heard from Wisconsin businesses who can't access loans because they didn't have an existing relationship with an SBA-approved bank, including Norske Nook, an iconic pie shop with locations in Osseo, Rice Lake, Hayward and DeForest. Currently, Norske Nook can't get a loan because their local bank is not an SBA-preferred lender. Baldwin urges the SBA to make immediate changes to allow companies like Norske Nook to receive this critical aid provided by Congress.

She continues, ""Additionally, last week, the U.S. Treasury issued guidance that in order for loans to be forgiven by the Paycheck Protection Program, 75 percent of the loan must cover payroll costs. I'm concerned that this rule, which was not in the text of the CARES Act, prevents small businesses with high overhead costs from accessing the program and keeping their workers employed.""

Baldwin concludes, ""I urge you to change the PPP's rules to allow small businesses to spend a greater amount of their loan on fixed costs. Without this change, I fear that we will see a wave of small business closures and bankruptcies."""
Republican,Todd Young,MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019--Motion to Proceed,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, growing up, my dad used to tell me on a  regular basis: ``You should never speak up unless you can improve upon  the silence.'' I tried to take that to heart in my personal life and in  my professional life. 

  Today I feel like I can improve upon the silence. I have a deep  conviction that the U.S. Senate is not living up to the expectations of  the American people. The American people deserve a U.S. Senate as good  as the American people. They deserve a U.S. Senate that is responsive  when they need government most. 

  I suppose it is fashionable these days to use so many of our  institutions in society to elevate ourselves. Well, folks, this  institution--this institution--its credibility is at stake. The  American people need this institution to function. 

  I was a U.S. marine after graduating from college, and I never saw a  war. I never saw a national emergency or a major crisis. I am very  straightforward about that, but I have to say, I was ready for a war. I  was prepared for that big day when the United States of America really,  really needed me, and I made sure all of my marines were prepared. We  were prepared to do our duty when it mattered most. 

  As it relates to this pandemic, I have to say that the American  people are ready. Look around. It makes you proud.  

  Are we not a unified people? Are we a Tribal people? There is a lot  of conversation about that among political circles. Spend some time in  my neighborhood. Spend some time back home in Indiana right now. Maybe  it took some separation, some social distancing. Maybe it took some  time away from work, some time away from social gatherings. Maybe it  took cancellation, unfortunately, of March Madness, the NCAA  tournament, to remind us all that we are deeply connected with one  another. And we long for those connections, regardless of political  philosophy and regardless of the fact that we have an election going  on. That is not what is real important to regular people. 

  Americans are coming together. They are ready for this emergency, and  this is, indeed, an emergency. Make no mistake, look across the country  at all the National Guards who are being mobilized. 

  This is an emergency that people in my home State have been  responding to favorably. The Senate needs to as well. Folks in my  neighborhood are putting bags of groceries on people's doorsteps who  are unable to go out and get groceries themselves. I know this from my  own family. They are calling senior citizens they know who they think  are probably lonely at this time. They are coming together. 

  Back in Evansville, one of my friends, J.P., who is a business owner  and very active in the community, and I were on the phone the other  day. I think, like other Members, I have had countless phone calls in  the last week or so with businessowners, not-for-profit leaders,  healthcare providers, and rank-and-file citizens. This active citizen,  this community leader, J.P. in Evansville, says that he was on the  phone with the mayor, local business leaders, local healthcare leaders,  and a bunch of others from Southern Indiana, and they were all on the  same page. They have figured out how to come together, how to solve  local problems together. They were all ready to tackle this because  they sensed what we should all sense: The sooner you can tackle these  challenges, the sooner the pain will end, and the sooner we will reduce  anxiety among our neighbors. They are all determined to work together.  In fact, he said he had not seen such unity within the community of  Evansville, IN, since 9/11. It says a lot. 

  Well, the Senate must be ready. This package, the CARES Act, was  negotiated in a bipartisan way--two Democrats, two Republicans, in  consultation with each of the varying working groups. They put together  a package. It all came together, and it was introduced. It was all  bipartisan until it came time to vote on a procedural vote yesterday 

  You know, this virus may seem to many small because it has impacted a  small percentage of our population directly, but I have to say that its  impact is growing rapidly. The longer it takes us to come together, the  more damage that is going to be done. This is an emergency. 

  It is time, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, to take yes  for an answer and not play games. 

  So what does this bill do? It is nothing controversial. It provides  additional assistance for healthcare needs. This is a pandemic. We need  more masks. We need more PPEs. Our hospitals are swamped. They can't  conduct elective surgeries anymore. Their finances are out of whack. We  need to help them out. 

  What else does it do? It helps individual Americans. Folks are  resource-constrained right now. They can't go to work. So 1,200 bucks,  at least for starters, per American; $2,400 per married couple; and an  additional $500 if you have dependents--that is really going to make a  difference in Hoosiers' lives. 

  We need to make sure that people have lives to go back to once we get  through this, as well, and that is why this legislation is designed to  provide much needed liquidity for these businesses. They still have  debts to pay. They still have debts. They want to make payroll. 

  I can't tell you--I mean, I have talked to so many small businessmen  in tears. I have talked to leaders of our largest corporations as well.  I will tell you, I talked to a lady who didn't think things looked real  good. We didn't really have a whole lot of time to respond to this.  Meeting payroll, paying for rent, paying your leases, paying for  mortgages, these are the essentials, folks. 

  And this is not 2008. That was a horrible crisis. But we are coming  off of the best economy, arguably, in five decades. And because the  economy was so good, people were optimistic about the future. And  through no fault of their own, businessmen did sort of the rational  thing. They invested in the future, the property, the plant, and the  equipment that is required to grow. They were working on taking market  share. All of those who believe in the free enterprise system can  associate ourselves with what they were trying to accomplish. 

  But 2008 was a little different. The economy was lethargic. The  bottom fell out of the economy. In sort of an ironic twist, when the  economy is down, people are paying down their debts. They are  bolstering that balance sheet. They are maintaining some liquid assets  in anticipation of further tough times. We don't have that benefit  right now. We can measure the prospects of our employers in days. For  many of them, it is too late. 

  The U.S. Senate needs to treat this like an emergency because it is  an emergency. 

  So what else does this legislation do? Well, there is a category--let  me just group it together. Let me call it, incontrovertibly, emergency  funding. There is $20 billion for veterans' healthcare; $11 billion for  vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and other preparedness needs,  masks, gloves, and ventilators; $75 billion for hospitals; $4.5 billion  for the Centers for Disease Control; $12 billion for America's military  as it helps respond to this pandemic, and so on. That is what the bill  is all about. That is what we are fighting about. 

  So what happened? How did things go off track? Well, it may surprise  some folks, but I have a very positive relationship with the Democratic  leader. We just happen to have a lot of principled disagreements. And  at the very end of a bipartisan process, when he and other Members of  his caucus try and insert provisions pertaining to the Green New Deal  and other far-left priorities into this package, then, that, of course,  disrupts our emergency response. 

  So now we have Speaker Pelosi, seemingly, hijacking the process. That  is right. She is over in the House of Representatives. She is not even  part of this body, and her folks are all home. The House isn't in  session, but Speaker Pelosi wanted to remain relevant. She decided she  wanted to get some TV time, I suppose, and so her proposal involves  federalizing voting. We can have an honest debate about whether it is  appropriate to federalize the voting system, to mandate early voting,  or same-day voter registration. That is something that should be  debated in the U.S. Senate because I know it is a priority for so many  of my colleagues. 

  Again, there are elements of the Green New Deal. We can debate  whether or not there has to be a full offset of airline emissions by  2025 some other time. We can debate whether or not greenhouse gas  statistics for individual flights should be widely available. Let's  work on that separately after we help the American people. Let's not  work on pet priorities. We can debate permanent paid leave--permanent  paid leave granted by the Federal Government some other time. This is a  pandemic. It is an economic emergency, a public health emergency. The  American people want a response. They don't want us to focus on this  right now. 

  I made a lot of phone calls in recent days back home. None of this is  possible without the wherewithal, without the hard work of sturdy  Americans, and without great American innovation, none of the resources  that are required to actually sustain our government, to feed our  families. People need places to work. 

  Here is what is happening in Indiana, a little snapshot. The RV  industry, the global headquarters of the recreational vehicle industry,  is in Elkhart, IN. We are seeing RV companies temporarily shutting down  in Indiana, and I know we are seeing it across the country. 

  The hotel industry, today, the two largest hotels in Indianapolis had  to shut their doors. I am not just talking about buildings shutting  their doors;  this closure is going to mean the loss of employment for about 780  full-time workers. Think of all of the family members who depend on  those workers. This is an emergency. 

  The auto industry--Hoosiers proudly manufacture the components for  the auto industry. They assemble those components into finished  automobiles. That industry has been brought to a halt on account of  this unique crisis, and the worst, we hear, is yet to come. 

  Airlines, they are feeling the most immediate impact. I flew the  other day from my home in the Indianapolis area. I flew out of the  airport to Washington, DC. It wasn't a chartered flight. I was the only  passenger. I was the only passenger on the aircraft. We know that is  not a sustainable business model when you are paying for the fuel, you  have a pilot, a copilot, a flight attendant, and me. This is an  emergency. St. Elmo Steak House is one restaurant of the restaurants  across Indiana that have had to close their doors. St. Elmo just had to  do it. It is the first time it has had to do it since 1902. They were  even able to keep their doors open in the midst of the 1918 flu  pandemic.  

  This is bad. This is an emergency. The Senate needs to act. 

  We have Sanjay Patel. He is the president of an Indianapolis-based  company, and he and my team spoke recently. He said that he had to lay  off at least 100 workers just last week, with another 150 layoffs  likely this week. These are families. These are individuals who take  pride in their work. They want to go back to work. 

  Here is what Sanjay said:  

       We're thinking of closing a few of them here--it's just       deteriorating every day. It was worse last night than the       night before, and it was worse the night before than 2 days       ago. It's just deteriorating and I think it's just a matter       of time [until] we close down.  

  It is an emergency. It is not time for Nancy Pelosi's priorities. It  is time for the American people's priorities. 

  We have a baking shop with locations in Carmel and Indianapolis that  had to lay some workers off. Their owner said:  

       My heart goes out to my Cake Bake family, whom I was forced       to lay off during this horrible virus. I am working with my       banks, my insurance company, my accountant and the government       to try and create some sort of relief support for my team. I       am doing everything in my power to help all 170 of them. All       tips received at both of our bakery counters will be divided       and shared with our servers. Hoping to get through this       difficult time together, coming out on the other end with the       safety and health for our families.  

  I heard from a small optometry practice in North Vernon. They have 12  employees. The owner says:  

       We simply don't have the cash to fund their wages while       they are off work. I am saving what cash I have to pay them,       their vacation and personal day time. We are in trouble and       need help.  

  This isn't somebody who is used to asking for help. This is the time  to give them help. Let's not allow this legislation to be hijacked.  Let's live up to the high standards of the American people. At this  difficult moment, let's come together like we did in 9/11, like our  country has so consistently when the chips are really down. 

  Let's all take part in this effort. I encourage all of my  constituents and anyone else around the country to encourage your  Senators--Republicans and Democrats alike. Stand up. Speak out. Send  emails. Tell your neighbors. 

  It is time for this body to move. It is time for us to deal with this  crisis once and for all. We will make America great again from the  bottom up. It doesn't have to take that long. We can bounce back, but  the longer we wait, the harder it will be. Let's do our jobs.

Republican,Susan M. Collins,"Senators Collins, King Announce 121 Rural Maine Health Providers to Receive $131.5 Million to Support Fight Against COVID-19","U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced today that 121 Maine rural health care providers--including hospitals, clinics, and community health centers--will receive $131,501,672 through the CARES Act that they voted for.  Senators Collins and King have previously announced a total of $187,806,676 for Maine hospitals and other health care providers to help respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

""Keeping the doors open to rural hospitals is critical to helping protect the health of residents in the surrounding communities.  This funding will provide crucial support to rural medical providers at a time of enormous stress on our health care system,"" said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  ""We will continue our efforts to provide doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals on the front lines with the resources they need to safely treat patients.""

 

Rural hospitals, many of which were operating on thin margins prior to COVID-19, have been particularly devastated by this pandemic. As healthy patients delay care and cancel elective services, rural hospitals are struggling to keep their doors open.  

 

Rural acute care general hospitals and critical access hospitals will receive a minimum $1,000,000, with additional payment based on operating expenses."
Democrat,Doug Jones,Senator Doug Jones Votes to Pass Strengthened Economic Relief Package,"U.S. Senator Doug Jones (D-Ala.) last night voted to pass a strengthened version of the Senate's third major COVID-19 economic relief package. After the measure failed to earn enough votes to advance on Sunday evening, negotiations continued and the final bill now includes significant improvements to help workers, health care providers, and others who are most vulnerable to the economic fallout of COVID-19. 

""I'm relieved that we were able to continue negotiations to create a bipartisan package that meets Alabama's critical needs and provides money for the millions of folks who have been laid off across the country. From robust funding for hospitals and community health centers, to loans and grants to small businesses to keep their doors open and workers employed, this bill will provide help for the people in Alabama who need it most,"" said Senator Jones, who is a member of both the Senate health and banking committees. ""While this is another major step to provide relief for Americans who are struggling right now, Congress and the Administration must continue to work to make sure that we're doing everything we can to prevent the spread of this virus and to provide working people and small businesses with the help they need to keep their heads above water.""

New provisions in the final bill that were not included in Sunday's package:

Unemployment Insurance: Up to 4 months of unemployment insurance benefits instead of 3 months, with an additional $600 benefit per week. In total, unemployed workers could receive 39 weeks of unemployment benefits, through the end of 2020.Health Care System: $55 billion increase from previous drafts, for a total of $150 billion to help hospitals and health care providers who are on the front lines of this pandemic.Increased Funding for States and Local Governments:  $150 billion for a state, tribal, and local Coronavirus Relief fund. Alabama will receive no less than $1.25 billion under this fund.Supporting Students and Schools: includes $30.75 billion for Education Stabilization Fund, provides federal student loan cancelation for students who withdrew due to COVID-19, and suspends federal student loan payments without accrual of interest until September 30, 2020Additional Assistance for Small Businesses: $10 billion for SBA emergency grants of up to $10,000 to provide immediate relief for small business operating costs. Senator Jones advocated for specific Alabama priorities in this bill, including:

Jones-Cassidy legislation requiring insurance companies to cover the costs of a future approved COVID-19 vaccine.$1 billion to Historically Black Colleges and other minority-serving institutions.Jones-Brown legislation to prevent landlords from evicting renters during the coronavirus crisis.Jones-Rounds legislation to establish a Ready Reserve Corps to ensure vital health care jobs are filled when disasters strike in the United States.Jones-Toomey legislation to fix a drafting error in current tax law and help spur Main Street investments.Jones proposal to help small business continue to make payroll for employees through payroll providers.Other important provisions for Alabama workers and businesses include:

Direct payments of up to $1,200 for single tax-filers that make $75,000 or less, and $2,400 for joint tax-filers that make $150,000 or less. Families would receive an additional $500 per child.Extends the federal tax filing deadline from April 15 to July 15.Expands unemployment benefits to allow part-time, self-employed, gig economy, and furloughed workers to access UI benefits.Sets aside $15.5 billion in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) contingency reserve.Provides $3.5 billion in additional funding to provide child care assistance to health care sector employees, emergency responders, sanitation workers, and other workers deemed essential during the response to the coronavirus regardless of income eligibility requirements.As Congress looks to draft future relief packages, Senator Jones will continue to work toward including important policies like expanding early voting and vote-by-mail, and incentives for states to expand Medicaid."

Republican,Chuck Grassley,Coronavirus,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, people often think of prisons as  places only to send criminals and then forget about them. But as I have  noted here before, most inmates will one day be released. 

  Helping former criminals become productive citizens is very much an  important function of our prison system. In recent weeks, inmates in  the Iowa prison system have acquired what you might consider strange  skills--but they are new skills--and even monetary allowances. They  have done this by producing personal protective equipment, like face  shields and masks. During this time of the virus pandemic, we all know  what those are used for. 

  I commend these efforts by our prisoners and our prison system  promoting this sort of training. They will help to protect the health  and safety of the prisons and our State in the short term, but they  will also help inmates in the long term. 

  These inmates are providing an essential public service, and for that  they deserve our appreciation. It is an important contribution that I  hope they will long remember and that will help them to be productive  members of society when they finish their sentences.

Democrat,Tom Udall,N.M. Delegation Request For Holtec Public Comment Period Extension Granted,"U.S. Senators Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich, and U.S. Representatives Xochitl Torres Small, Ben Ray Luján, and Deb Haaland are welcoming an announcement from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that their March 20 request has been met and a 60-day extension on the public comment period will be implemented for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Holtec's proposed spent nuclear fuel storage facility in Southeast New Mexico. 

""Allowing for full public participation, as NEPA requires, is particularly important for projects involving nuclear waste,"" the delegation said. ""Any proposal to store commercial spent nuclear fuel raises a number of health, safety and environmental issues, including potential impacts on local agriculture and industry, issues related to the transportation of nuclear waste, and disproportionate impacts on Native American communities."" 

The delegation added, ""We appreciate the NRC and Chairwoman Svinicki for heeding our request and their careful consideration of the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on an essential, open and transparent review process for Holtec's proposal. As we continue to address and work to contain the spread of COVID-19, we look forward to working with the NRC to monitor COVID-19 guidance and further modify the timing and schedule of public meetings if warranted."""
Republican,John Hoeven,Hoeven Statement After Reports OPEC+ Nations Agree To Cut Production By 10 Million BPD,"Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today issued the following statement after reports that the teleconference between OPEC members and Russia, as well as other oil producing nations, led to an agreement to cut global oil production by 10 million barrels per day.

""We've been working with the President and Administration to end the global oil price war, and we appreciate their efforts,"" said Senator Hoeven. ""It is important that Saudi Arabia and Russia agree to cut oil production, and follow through, given that demand for oil is down due to the coronavirus pandemic. Ending this global price war is a critical part of our efforts during the pandemic to support our domestic energy producers in North Dakota, and across the nation, who are vital to our economic and national security.""

Hoeven has been working to stop the global oil price war. Specifically, the senator has pressed to resolve the issue, including:

In meetings and phone calls with President Trump, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other Administration officials.In phone calls with Princess Reema Bandar Al Saud, the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the U.S., where the Senator emphasized that Saudi Arabia needs to work with the United States and the community of nations to end the price war. Through a letter to the Saudi Crown Prince Hoeven joined with his Senate colleagues.With energy officials from our international partners, urging their support to reach an agreement on global production.In addition, the Senator has worked to support the domestic oil and gas industry, by:

Announcing bipartisan, bicameral legislation to provide $3 billion in funding to purchase crude oil produced in the United States for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The legislation aligns with the request made by President Donald J. Trump and Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette to fill the SPR. Working with Energy Secretary Brouillette to open the SPR to American producers for leased storage on a temporary basis.Encouraging ""Buy American"" efforts.Earlier this week, Hoeven hosted Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg and Small Business Administration (SBA) North Dakota District Director Alan Haut in a video conference with the North Dakota Petroleum Council and its members, where the senator outlined efforts to support the domestic oil industry and end the global oil price war, as well as highlighted support available to North Dakota's energy producers through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act."

I write to you today regarding the efforts for the Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF) to secure direct, non-stop air service to the San Francisco Bay Area. I ask that your company engage with partners in the Buffalo region to explore this opportunity for its potential to benefit both United and the airport.

The Buffalo Niagara Partnership and the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority are pursuing the development of non-stop air service from BUF to the San Francisco Bay Area. This service will not only benefit current customers traveling to and from this California region but will also serve the growing technology sector which has operations in Buffalo and a need for reliable and direct service to the Bay Area.

In addition, the volume of Canadian customers choosing to fly out of BUF rather than Toronto for their US-bound final destinations has only continued to grow in the past few years. Toronto Pearson Airport is the only Southern Ontario airport with non-stop service to the Bay Area; however, it has high fares and taxes. United's significant presence in both the Buffalo and San Francisco areas and its market brand power would be an asset to maximize an opportunity for non-stop service from Buffalo.

I ask that the appropriate members of your staff be in touch with the Buffalo Niagara Partnership and the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority and notify my staff when you do reach out directly. As the CEO of United, you know your company best, but I believe this presents a beneficial opportunity for both the Buffalo airport and for United. Should you come to the same conclusion, know that I stand ready to help United in any way that I can.

I look forward to hearing from you regarding this matter. Please do not hesitate to follow-up with me or my staff."

""The Inspector General's review falls far short, taking the word of Treasury Department officials that they did nothing wrong at face value and dismissing contradictory interviews.

""The report notes that there was no formal documentation of how Chairman Neal's request was handled. It provides no legal explanation for the Treasury Department's decision to ignore the normal process and a crystal-clear law that requires that these records be turned over. It also provides no legal explanation for the unprecedented decision to seek a Justice Department opinion in response to a request from one of the tax committee chairmen.

""In addition, the report provides no factual basis for its conclusion that an unsolicited letter from the president's personal attorney had no effect on the process other than assurances from these same Treasury officials that it didn't. This is a serious matter that deserved a much more thorough investigation."""
Democrat,Kyrsten Sinema,"Letter to Mark Esper, Secretary of Defense - As Reports of Sexual Assault Spike at Military Academies, Ernst Leads Calls for Answers","Dear Secretary Esper,

We write today to address the disheartening report  from the Pentagon, obtained by USA Today , revealing a significant increase in incidents of sexual assault at our nation's military academies. While it seems that the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program is empowering cadets and service members to report and seek restorative care, the continued increase in reported incidents from year to year point to a disturbing trend that now requires us to reexamine our efforts to find solutions.

The Pentagon's annual report on sexual harassment and violence at the military service academies states that there were 122 sexual assault reports during the 2018-19 school year compared to 92 reports from 2017-18, a 32 percent increase. While this sharp increase may reflect an increased willingness to report, it also shows an alarming trend that is heading in the wrong direction.  

We request a briefing on this report to complete our own analysis, as well as a meeting with the appropriate DoD personnel to discuss its overall findings, with a particular focus on the suspected causes and proposed plans of action moving forward.

The DoD and Congress have prioritized combating sexual assault in our military formations but we must continue to evaluate and reassess our efforts. It is our shared responsibility to ensure the men and women who will be the next generation of leaders in our nation's armed forces are being instilled with the necessary values to combat the scourge of sexual assault and are immersed in a safe environment where they do not fear becoming a sexual assault victim themselves.

We look forward to hearing from you and working with you to ensure we are doing everything we can to stop sexual assault from degrading our readiness, lethality, and combat effectiveness."
Democrat,Jeanne Shaheen,Shaheen Applauds Quick Release of $4.9 Million for NH to Support Coronavirus Response as a Result of Congress' Bipartisan Work,"U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, issued the following statement after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released $4.9 million to assist the Coronavirus response in New Hampshire. The funding was the result of bipartisan, bicameral Coronavirus response legislation that was signed into law on Friday. 

""I'm pleased the CDC moved quickly to release these funds to New Hampshire to assist efforts to contain and mitigate the spread of the Coronavirus,"" said Senator Shaheen. ""This funding will provide a welcome boost to support state and local efforts to protect public health. I appreciate the bipartisan cooperation we've seen from every level of government to respond to this emergency and I hope that continues as we work together to confront this crisis. The public health of Granite Staters and the American people is my top priority and I'll keep working across the aisle to ensure our state has the resources it needs to combat the full scope of this threat."" 

Senator Shaheen joined with New Hampshire's delegation in calling for the emergency Coronavirus funding legislation signed into law last week to include reimbursement for states who are already bearing a substantial financial burden as they respond to the Coronavirus.    

The bipartisan emergency funding bill provides:   

$8.3 billion for the national effort to respond to the Coronavirus;A formula grant that ensures New Hampshire will receive an initial $4.9 million to support NH's response efforts;$350 million for areas of the country where there are high concentrations of the virus;$500 million to procure pharmaceuticals, masks, protective equipment, and other medical supplies to distribute to state and local hospitals;Funding to reimburse states for expenses stemming from Coronavirus response efforts;Replenishes the CDC Infections Disease Rapid Response Fund which helps send CDC personnel and resources around the country;And provides funding for training local responders and bed capacity in areas with high concentrations of the virus.   Shaheen has been sounding the alarm on the need for additional federal funding and access to public information in preparation for the spread of the Coronavirus. Ahead of President Trump's budget announcement earlier this month, Shaheen sent a letter with the New Hampshire congressional delegation calling for the administration to appropriately fund Coronavirus prevention efforts in the President's budget proposal for fiscal year (FY) 2021. Shaheen also sent a letter with fellow senators urging the Trump administration to put forward an emergency funding request to Congress. Further, Shaheen joined a group of 25 Senators earlier this month, calling on the National Security Council (NSC) to address and coordinate administration efforts in response to the Coronavirus and other global health security threats."
Democrat,"Robert P. Casey, Jr.","Casey, Capito Introduce Bill to Support Farmers' Efforts to Mitigate Climate Change, Improve Water Quality","Recently, U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) introduced a bill that would direct the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a process through which it could measure, evaluate and report on conservation program outcomes. The Farmer-Driven Conservation Outcomes Act of 2020 would authorize a system through which USDA could quantify the environmental benefits of conservation activities in order to demonstrate their impact and further improve program performance. U.S. Representatives Marcia Fudge (D-OH-11) and Glenn ""GT"" Thompson (R-PA-15) are introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.

""Farmers are leading stewards of the land, and they can and must be part of the solution when it comes to mitigating climate change and improving water quality,"" said Senator Casey. ""In order to be able to tell the story of farmers' conservation efforts, as well as to demonstrate the return on taxpayer investment, it is essential that we be able to accurately measure outcomes, including metrics like how many tons of carbon farmers are sequestering in the soil and how much nitrogen they are keeping out of our Nation's waterways. We also need to be able to evaluate and improve program and practice effectiveness to help farmers mitigate climate change, improve water quality and protect other critical natural resources. I am glad to introduce the Farmer-Driven Conservation Outcomes Act with Senator Capito to advance these critical goals.""

""West Virginia has made great strides in improving its water quality and land management practices, benefitting ecosystems throughout the state and better protecting the headwaters of the Chesapeake Bay, but there remains much work to be done. Over the years, the number of conservation programs across departments and agencies have proliferated, and there has never been a full accounting of their individual efficacy. Assessing these programs is needed to ensure taxpayers are receiving the best bang for the buck for their investments as well as to confirm federal conservation initiatives are having their intended effects in benefitting the environment. I am pleased to work across the aisle with Senator Casey to introduce this legislation to better inform the public and policymakers about best practices in our agricultural conservation efforts -- this is just the sort of good governance policies we need more of,"" Senator Capito said.

""As Ohio and states across the Great Lakes region continue to face significant environmental challenges, conservation programs play an increasingly important role in addressing climate change, protecting water quality and improving soil health,"" said Representative Fudge. ""To increase farm productivity and protect environmental health, USDA must collect and evaluate data on the effectiveness of conservation practices and share its findings with farmers.  I am proud to introduce this bipartisan, bicameral legislation to establish new forms of data measurement and reporting that will strengthen our nation's conservation efforts.""

""Voluntary conservation programs provide farmers and ranchers important tools to incorporate management practices that produce lasting environmental benefits,"" said Rep. Glenn ""GT' Thompson. ""While Pennsylvania continues to see great improvement in soil and water health, additional data will help identify outcomes and meet our long term conservation goals. I am thankful for the partnership of our country's farmers and ranchers, who provide the food, fiber and energy that all Americans rely upon every day."" 

""We thank Senators Casey and Capito for their leadership in working to establish a process through which we can guarantee farmers and their communities quantifiable data on the environmental outcomes they achieve through participating in USDA conservation programs. These programs play an essential role in supporting Pennsylvania's farmers as they work to mitigate climate change, build soil health and improve water quality, but we lack the comprehensive data to demonstrate the measurable impact of conservation practices and to hone those practices for maximum effect. The Farmer-Driven Conservation Outcomes Act of 2020 would improve the efficacy of conservation programs and ensure the greatest return on investment on activities that protect human and environmental health, which are inextricably linked,"" said Hannah Smith Brubaker, Executive Director of Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture (PASA).

The Farmer-Driven Conservation Outcomes Act of 2020 is endorsed by the following organizations: American Farmland Trust, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, National Farmers Union, National Milk Producers Federation, National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, National Wildlife Federation, National Young Farmers Coalition, Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture, Penn State University, R Street and Taxpayers for Common Sense."
Republican,Susan M. Collins,"Following Push by Senator Collins, HHS Releases New Guidance to Ensure Nutrition Needs of Seniors are Met During Coronavirus Pandemic","Following a letter U.S. Senator Susan Collins, the Chairman of the Aging Committee, sent to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) earlier this week, Secretary Alex Azar issued new guidance that will expand access to Older Americans Act (OAA) senior nutrition programs.  Senator Collins urged Secretary Azar to make these changes in order to meet the needs of millions of seniors during the coronavirus pandemic.

 

""At a time of heightened demand for nutrition services due to seniors self-isolating during the coronavirus pandemic, flexibility for Area Agencies on Aging was urgently needed,"" said Senator Collins.  ""This updated guidance will ensure that these organizations can continue to serve older Americans by delivering more meals directly to seniors' homes and reaching them where they are.""

 

Senator Collins authored the reauthorization of the OAA, which includes a seven percent across-the-board increase for all OAA programs, including nutrition services.

 

In her letter on Monday, Senator Collins called on Secretary Azar to use his authorities triggered by the President's March 13th emergency declaration to direct the Administration for Community Living to issue guidance to:

 

1. Grant nutrition transfer authorization giving states the flexibility to transfer funds to home-delivered services, based on their own determination of need, without requiring any waivers from the Assistant Secretary. 

1. Expand the definition of homebound to include older adults who are staying at home or practicing ""social distancing"" during this emergency. 

As requested, Secretary Azar provided the transfer flexibility and expanded the definition of homebound.

 

The latest guidelines from the CDC recommend that organizations that serve people who are at higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness cancel events for groups of 10 people or more.  This has created significant challenges for Area Agencies on Aging, which have been forced to close congregate meal sites.  In addition, seniors who have been encouraged to self-isolate to protect themselves from the increased risk of fatalities caused by the coronavirus have less access to food."
Democrat,Maria Cantwell,"Letter to the Hon. Mark Morgan, Acting Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection - Murray, Cantwell Demand Answers from CBP Following Reports of Delays and Enhanced Screening for Iranian Americans","Dear Acting Commissioner Morgan,

We write to express our concern and request information regarding Customs and Border Protection (CBP) practices relating to secondary inspections of U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and other travelers at ports of entry.

On January 4, 2020, and continuing over the weekend, it appears that CBP officers detained people based solely or predominately on their Iranian national origin. Those subjected to this prolonged inspection included U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, who were asked, among other things, about their political views, allegiances, social media profiles, family relationships, and military service.      

 As you are aware, CBP has the crucial responsibility of facilitating legitimate trade and travel through our ports of entry. It is imperative that CBP follows our laws and does not discriminate based upon protected characteristics, as prolonged detainment of travelers based on discriminatory practices is a clear violation of CBP guidance. It is also vital that U.S. citizens and other travelers posing no risk to the homeland are not subject to unnecessary delay or unjustified intrusions as they transit across our border. 

Given these concerns, we ask CBP for answers regarding policies that target certain U.S. citizens and other travelers arriving at ports of entry. We ask that you provide this information as soon as possible, but no later than January 20, 2020.

1.       Provide us with any and all directives, instructions, policies, memos or any guidance, either verbal or written, relating to additional scrutiny, enhanced screening, vigilance, and/or non-routine or secondary inspections at ports of entry and airports issued in response to international events that have taken place since December 27, 2019.a.       If no directives were issued, what level of discretion do CBP port directors have for operationalizing CBP orders for enhanced screening, additional scrutiny, or vigilance at ports of entry?2.       Have any agencies or personnel within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including CBP port directors, issued or received any directives, instructions, guidance, or any policies or memos, either in writing or by any other means, to engage in prolonged detainment or enhanced screening of individuals of Iranian heritage entering the United States? a.       If so, who issued the directive, memo, teleconference, or guidance and when?  How was the directive or guidance delivered?b.       What policies, if any, exist to ensure that port directors and/or field leadership alert CBP leadership of directives issued at a local level?c.       How does CBP, on a headquarter level, monitor port and/or field directors' compliance with overall CBP policy?3.       Please list any and all instances in which CBP referred Iranians and Iranian-Americans for non-routine or secondary inspection, detention and/or questioning at the port of entry at the Peace Arch Border Crossing over the weekend of January 4, 2020.  Please include the percentage of Iranians and Iranian-Americans subject to non-routine or secondary screening as compared to the total number of applications for admission into the United States at Peace Arch Border Crossing on January 4, 2020, and January 5, 2020.a.       How many of them were U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents?b.       How many minors were detained, questioned or placed into non-routine or secondary screening at Peace Arch Border Crossing over the weekend of January 4, 2020? Were they allowed to remain with their parents/guardians at the port of entry?4.       Have CBP officers at ports of entry or U.S. airports questioned U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents of Iranian heritage, or those perceived to have Iranian heritage, about their political views or the current situation with Iran?5.       What measures, if any, has CBP put in place to prevent leadership at ports of entry from either directly or indirectly telling or encouraging frontline CBP officers to engage in profiling of U.S. citizens based on national origin? a.       Has CBP consulted with the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) at DHS regarding the incidents described in these reports?b.       Will CBP commit to cooperating with any CRCL investigation into this matter?6.       CBP stated that holiday-related staffing shortages contributed to the extensive delays travelers faced over the weekend of January 4, 2020.  How many CBP employees were staffing the Peace Arch Border Crossing over the weekend of January 4, 2020, and how many are there on any other given day?"
Democrat,Brian Schatz,"Schatz Releases New Guide To Help Independent Contractors, Gig Workers Access Federal Aid During Coronavirus Pandemic","U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai""i) released a new guide to help independent contractors, freelancers, those who are self-employed, and gig-economy workers, including ride sharing drivers, better understand how to apply for new benefits established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

""These federal programs can help thousands of Hawai""i workers who are struggling to get by,"" said Senator Schatz. ""If you're an independent contractor and need some help, please visit our website to learn more about what kind of federal support is available.""

Schatz's guide includes information on eligibility and coverage for federal programs and benefits, including expanded unemployment assistance, small business loans, and tax relief.

The full guide for independent contractors is below and available at schatz.senate.gov/coronavirus/contract-workers.

 

RESOURCES FOR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS

Overview

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provide the following resources for independent contractors to help them cover their financial needs during the public health emergency.

Unemployment Insurance

The CARES Act provides independent contractors, self-employed individuals, and gig-economy workers with access to unemployment benefits.  Income verification procedures for independent contractors have yet to be released.  Our office is monitoring these updates so please check back frequently for more details.  For more information, click here.

Direct Cash Payments

The CARES Act also directs the Department of the Treasury to make a one-time direct payment to individuals to help them recover from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  For more information, click here.

Small Business Assistance

Relief is also available for small businesses that have trouble covering payroll and operating expenses because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The new law creates a Small Business Administration (SBA) loan program, called the ""Paycheck Protection Program"" (PPP), that expands benefits and eligibility for SBA disaster loans, covers payments on existing SBA loans, and creates new tax credits to help cover the cost of paid leave and payroll.  For more information, click here.

Tax Relief for Individuals

The Internal Revenue Service and the CARES Act are providing several categories of tax relief for individuals to help them cover their financial needs during this time.  For more information, click here."
Republican,Marco Rubio,Chairman Rubio Statement on Additional Funding for the Paycheck Protection Program Vote,"U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, released the following statement after Senate Democrats blocked an additional $250 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program. Congress recently appropriated $349 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program through the CARES Act. However, the program needs more funding to meet the demands of small and medium sized businesses due to the pandemic. The Trump Administration requested the additional $250 billion to meet these unprecedented times.

""While funds for other programs in the CARES Act have not even been disbursed, the demand for the Paycheck Protection Program remains incredibly high,"" Chairman Rubio said. ""We are seeing a rate of $3.5 billion an hour on a nearly $350 billion program. We have days, not weeks, until PPP runs out of money. Today's  unemployment numbers remind us that now is not the time for congressional horse trading or partisan politics. Small businesses are being forced to lay off employees and close their doors. I really hope my Democratic colleagues will reconsider their decision to block more money for PPP."""
Republican,James Lankford,Senator Lankford Praises Updates to Outdated Labor Laws,"Senator James Lankford (R-OK) praised the Department of Labor's finalization of a rule on January 12 that provides a much-needed update to the joint employer provisions under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The final rule will take effect March 16, 2020.

""The previous joint employer rule had the potential to devastate America's franchise, small-business economy,"" said Lankford. ""Oklahoma small businesses consistently tell me they want greater clarity and consistency from the federal government when applying federal labor rules and laws. This important rule update provides more of both to businesses in my state. At a minimum, employees and businesses deserve to know who they work for and who can be held liable. I support President Trump's decision to roll back the confusing and overreaching joint employer rule put in place by the previous administration.""

In August 2019 Lankford and Senator Angus King (I-ME) introduced a bill to help protect the franchise model by codifying in law what constitutes a joint employment relationship. The bill corrected a decision by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in which the Board reversed a 30-year standard that a business needs ""direct and immediate"" control over their subcontracted businesses or franchisees. The NLRB decision ultimately means that actions taken by a trademark owner to maintain brand standards may cause courts to consider the trademark owner a joint employer of a franchisee's employees, which could make the trademark owner liable for wrongdoing committed by the franchisee.

As the Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management, Lankford remains actively engaged in addressing broken regulatory processes government wide."
Democrat,Dianne Feinstein,Feinstein on April Jobs Report,"Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today released the following statement on the April jobs report, which said the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent last month, the highest level since the Great Depression:

""News that the nation's unemployment stands at 14.7 percent confirms what we already believed: We're in a huge economic downturn brought about by this global pandemic.

""The problem is made worse by the fact that to fight the disease, we have to physically distance and stay at home, which causes economic output to suffer. But that's the only way we'll succeed in decreasing new COVID-19 cases and deaths.

""Simply put, the economy will recover only when the disease is under control. That will require, among many things, a massive national testing and tracing strategy and a laser-like focus on vaccine development to give Americans confidence that they can slowly return to normal activities.

""Until then, Congress needs to continue to support economic relief programs to help families, businesses and local governments stay afloat. Moving too quickly to reopen the country without proper safeguards will only make the situation worse."""
Republican,Kevin Cramer,Senators Introduce Legislation to Remove United States Armed Forces from Saudi Arabia,"U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, introduced legislation this week to remove United States Armed Forces from Saudi Arabia.

""The United States has been a strong and reliable partner to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for decades,"" said Senator Sullivan. ""That partnership has included a long history of helping to protect Saudi Arabia from threats in the region, including a recent surge in U.S. troop presence to protect the Kingdom and other countries from Iran. Such protections have helped stabilize the region and have served to defend American interests. Now, however, as the United States and the rest of the world are battling the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kingdom continues to reject its leadership role in serving as a stabilizing force for global energy markets. This is unacceptable, particularly because the Kingdom's actions are directly and negatively impacting the American citizens I am honored to represent. If Saudi Arabia refuses to change course when we've requested that it do so, the United States must seriously reconsider the level of American support -- including military support -- for such partnerships that fail to support us in turn."" 

""Saudi Arabia has shown indifference, if not malintent, for American energy producers during its feud with Russia. These are not the actions of a supposed ally or friend, and they will not be tolerated,"" said Senator Cramer. ""U.S. troops are deployed to other countries to serve our national interests, not theirs. With friends like this, who needs enemies?"" 

The bill, S.3572, would remove all forces and equipment from Saudi Arabia and relocate them to another location in the Middle East. Click here to read the text of the legislation.

This is the most recent move in Senators Cramer and Sullivan's efforts to urge Saudi Arabia to stop this oil dispute, which has caused significant, long-term harm to American energy producers. Click here to learn more."
Democrat,Tim Kaine,Kaine Statement On Senate Passage Of Coronavirus Economic Relief Package,"U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement after the Senate approved a bipartisan coronavirus (COVID-19) economic relief package. The legislation includes Kaine's priorities to provide direct payments to Americans, protect small businesses, expand access to child care, provide much-needed assistance to state and local governments, strengthen our health care system, ensure that funding for larger businesses is used to protect their employees, fund improvements to the nation's public health data systems, help manufacturers affected by this crisis, expand unemployment assistance, put a temporary moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, support schools, strengthen America's medical supply chain, increase nonprofit funding for maternal health, and increase funding for community action agencies.

""I'm so proud that Senate Democrats stood together and made sure that the bill we passed today will backstop the American economy by protecting workers and their families. Compared to the partisan proposal that the GOP hoped to jam through, this bill is far better for working people and the small businesses that make up the heart of our economy. It makes sure that funds to large businesses cannot be used to raise executive pay or for stock buybacks and guarantees transparency so that all Americans can know immediately who is receiving help. Finally, it is a Marshall Plan for the American health care system as it deals with a pandemic.

""These gains for regular Americans and our health care system would not have occurred had Democrats just gone along with the GOP proposal. There was enormous pressure to simply vote on a bill and be done, but we stayed on task until we got the details right.

""We now have to make sure the three bills we have passed in recent weeks are implemented promptly and fairly. And we need to keep our eye on our number one priority: getting through this health crisis by following science-based guidance. We lost 6-8 weeks at the front end of this pandemic due to the President choosing to downplay the threat of COVID-19 even as other nations like South Korea and Australia were ramping up testing and production of critical medical supplies. We cannot waste any more time on foolishly denying the scope of the problem.

""For America to get back to work, and for Americans to get past their natural fears and anxieties, we have to be smart from this point forward as we battle this virus. All people have a role to play in this by practicing social distancing to protect one another. I have confidence that Virginians and all Americans will meet this challenge.""

The following Kaine priorities were included in the package:

Direct payments to Americans: The legislation includes direct cash payments to all low- and middle-income Americans: $1,200 per single filer and $2,400 for joint filers, with an additional $500 per minor dependent. Kaine and his Democratic colleagues successfully called for cash relief that does not leave out America's most vulnerable families, while the initial Republican proposal provided insufficient relief for these households.Small business funding: The legislation provides nearly $350 billion in funding for forgivable small business loans. Funding will be provided through local banks, and can be used to cover payroll, rent, mortgage interest, utilities, and other expenses. The portion that is forgiven will be scaled related to how many workers the business retains through the crisis.Expand access to child care: The legislation includes Senator Kaine's proposal with Senator Todd Young to increase funding, flexibility, and eligibility for the Child Care & Development Block Grant (CCDBG) to help ensure health care providers and other essential workers have access to child care during the pandemic.State and local coronavirus relief fund: The legislation includes a $150 billion fund to support state, local, and tribal area efforts to address COVID-19. Funding will be provided directly to states, counties, and tribal areas.Historic investment in the health care system: Democrats fought for and secured a $150 billion Marshall Plan for the health care system to support hospitals and other health care providers impacted by COVID-19 with necessary personal protective equipment, testing supplies, infrastructure, and more.Guardrails for large business assistance: Democrats were able to secure additional guardrails on loans made to larger businesses, including restrictions on stock buybacks and protections that will lead to more workers being maintained on the payroll. Additionally, funding provided under this section will be subject to strict transparency and accountability requirements, including the establishment of a new Inspector General to oversee distribution, usage, and repayment of funds.Data modernization: The legislation includes $500 million for public health data modernization, which Sen. Kaine has long championed. Last year, he introduced with Senators Isakson and King the Saving Lives Through Better Data Act, bipartisan legislation to modernize public health data infrastructure so clinicians, state health departments, and the CDC can work together more quickly and seamlessly to identify and respond to health threats like the coronavirus.Help for American manufacturers: The legislation includes key provisions of bipartisan legislation Kaine introduced with Senator Chris Coons to help Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) centers, including the Commonwealth's MEP affiliate Virginia GENEDGE, stay open during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond. MEP centers provide critical resources for small and medium manufacturers.Expand unemployment assistance: The legislation includes key provisions of legislation Kaine cosponsored to provide federally-funded unemployment assistance to those affected by the coronavirus. Under the agreement, unemployment insurance would be provided to workers impacted by the coronavirus, including gig workers and freelancers.  Moratorium on evictions and foreclosures: The legislation implements temporary moratoriums on eviction and foreclosure proceedings. Single- and multi-family property owners in mortgages backed by federal agencies will be given the option for forbearance -- allowing them to defer payments and add onto the end of the loan. Renters in buildings backed by federal funding will be protected against evictions for 120 days. Last week, Senator Kaine urged Senate leaders to place a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures, and defaults for families and businesses during this national emergency.Support for schools: The legislation provides $30.75 billion for grants to provide emergency support to local school systems and higher education institutions to continue to provide educational services to their students and support the on-going functionality of school districts and institutions. Last week, Kaine joined Senator Casey in urging Senator leaders to address concerns he has heard from Virginia institutions of higher education like providing stable housing and issues accessing technology needed for online learning.Strengthen America's supply chain: The legislation includes elements of the Strengthening America's Supply Chain and National Security Act, bipartisan legislation Kaine introduced with Senator Rubio to combat vulnerabilities in America's pharmaceutical supply chain.  Increase nonprofit funding for maternal health: The legislation includes Kaine's bill to smooth pension funding for March of Dimes, based in Arlington, Virginia, allowing the organization to boost its public health work at this critical time.Increase funding for community action agencies: The legislation includes $1 billion for Community Service Block Grants (CSBG) to support local community-based organizations providing social services and emergency assistance to those most in need. Last week, Kaine joined Senator Collins in calling for appropriators to include robust funding for CSBG to help address on-the-ground challenges that communities are facing."
Democrat,Jeanne Shaheen,"The President Signs Into Law Bipartisan Legislation Cosponsored by Senators Shaheen, Hassan to Reauthorize the Older Americans Act","President Donald Trump signed into law bipartisan legislation cosponsored by Senators Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen to reauthorize the Older Americans Act, which will strengthen and increase funding for Meals on Wheels and other programs critical to older Americans.

Given the impact of COVID-19 on older Americans' health and economic stability, this reauthorization is particularly important. Since 1965, the Older Americans Act has supported and improved the lives of seniors -- particularly low-income seniors -- through programs that improve transportation options, support caregivers, offer employment and community service opportunities, prevent abuse and neglect, and support nutrition, including Meals on Wheels. This year's reauthorization includes increased funding for these programs, and also takes additional measures including increasing the focus on addressing detrimental impacts of social isolation.

The latest Senate-passed COVID-19 response package also includes an additional $500 million for Meals on Wheels and other nutrition service programs.

""As a result of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, millions of seniors are facing tremendous risks to their health, safety and well-being and need our support now more than ever,"" Senator Shaheen said. ""I'm very pleased that the Supporting Older Americans Act is now law, because it reauthorizes and bolsters important meal programs, like Meals on Wheels, which provide nutritional assistance to aging Granite Staters. These programs are especially critical to seniors amid this pandemic as we rely on local organizations to step up and help ensure our vulnerable populations are able to safely access basic necessities and services. I'll keep to fighting to ensure seniors and all Americans receive the resources they need to live safe, healthy and full lives.""

""Older Americans face immense challenges right now -- not only is their health at high risk if they were to contract COVID-19, but many older Americans are also increasingly struggling to go about their daily lives, from ensuring that they have food and groceries to paying their bills to maintaining their mental health as they self-isolate,"" Senator Hassan said. ""The reauthorization of the Older Americans Act is a significant step forward in supporting Meals on Wheels and other critical programs that promote the health and well-being of older Americans. As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads, I will continue working across the aisle to help support seniors and other vulnerable populations.""

Specifically, the bipartisan bill will:

Reauthorize the Older Americans Act for five years with funding levels that better meet the growing needs, including a 7 percent increase in the initial year, and 6 percent increase annually for the remainder of the authorization;Extend the RAISE Family Caregivers Act for one additional year;Extend the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Council for one year;Increase the focus on addressing detrimental impacts of social isolation;Improve the availability of transportation resources to seniors;Enhance flexibility for states to better address the needs of grandparents raising grandchildren;Ensure that those living with younger onset Alzheimer's disease are included in key Older Americans Act services;Improve elder abuse prevention activities through increased outreach and education activities;Increase transparency of home-modification opportunities for eligible older adults.Senators Shaheen and Hassan are working to protect and support high-risk individuals from COVID-19, including seniors. The senators recently joined their colleagues in introducing a bill to mitigate the risks that COVID-19 poses to seniors and people who experience disabilities. The senators also pressed the Coronavirus Task Force on the steps the administration is taking to protect the health and safety of nursing home residents, workers and their families.

Additionally, in January, Senator Shaheen, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Senator Hassan sent a letter with the New Hampshire congressional delegation calling on the Trump Administration to boost funding for the Older Americans Act in his budget proposal to Congress for fiscal year (FY) 2021. More than 30,000 seniors in New Hampshire rely on the Meals on Wheels program, which operates under the Older Americans Act, for nutritious food. The program has become strained for resources in parts of the state as New Hampshire keeps up with an aging population, and now has become even more strained as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic."
Democrat,Tom Udall,Udall Introduces Legislation to Increase Tribal Public Health Security and Preparedness,"Today, as the United States combats the global novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-N.M.), vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, introduced the CDC Tribal Public Health Security and Preparedness Act.

 

This legislation would allow Tribes to apply directly to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) program and authorizes the CDC to make any necessary modifications to the program to fit the needs of Tribal applicants. The CDC PHEP grant program seeks to increase the capacity and response timelines of local public health entities during public health emergencies. States, territories, and some U.S. cities are eligible to apply for the PHEP program, but Tribes are currently ineligible.

 

""We need to ensure that Tribes have the same access to resources as everyone else to face down public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Indian Health Service serves as the primary federal agency charged with providing healthcare in Indian Country, all federal agencies -- including the CDC -- share equally in the requirement to fulfill our trust and treaty obligations,"" said Udall. ""This new legislation will improve Tribal access to federal resources meant to help communities better prepare for public health emergencies. As vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I will continue to push Congress and the Administration to make sure Indian Country has access to federal public health resources it needs and that there is meaningful engagement with Native communities and Tribal leaders in our national response to COVID-19."""
Democrat,Charles E. Schumer,Executive Session,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, a short time ago, in conjunction with  the memorial service being held today in Minnesota for George Floyd, I  joined the rest of the Democratic caucus in Emancipation Hall to  recognize a moment of silence in honor of his memory as well as the  memory of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Aubery, and the unimaginable number of  Black Americans who have had their lives ended in police custody. 

  Standing before the statue of Frederick Douglass, a Black American  who fought his whole life for a measure of racial equality, the moment  of silence lasted 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the length of time that the  White police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee on George Floyd's  neck. Standing there in silence, you feel the horrifying length of  George Floyd's final 9 minutes. You cannot help but imagine his horror  and fear, knowing that his trauma and the trauma of his family and his  friends has been felt by so many Black families and Black communities  across the country and across the centuries. 

  Of course, a moment of silence, a moment of solidarity, is no  substitute for real action. That is why Senate Democrats are working  with our House colleagues on policing reform legislation. 

  That is why we are demanding that the Republican majority leader  commit to addressing this issue on the floor of the Senate. 

  Leader McConnell, why don't you admit that we have to do something  here and not just say: Well, maybe we will take a look at it, as you  did on gun control after the violent shootings and then did nothing?  Make a commitment here and now to the American people that we will put  on the floor--that you will put on the floor police reform and racial  justice legislation this month. 

  Will our Republican colleagues ever join us in this effort? I know  these issues aren't easy, but we can't begin to make progress if the  Republican leader and the Republican majority will not even let us try  or address these issues in a legislative manner. 

  The Republican leader has said:  

       The coin of the realm in the Senate is floor time. What are       you going to devote time to?  

  Well, it has been 5 weeks since Leader McConnell called the Senate  back into session during the height of a pandemic. The Republican  majority has yet to put a single bill on the floor of the Senate  related to COVID-19. 

  We passed a much needed extension of PPP reform last night, a very  popular and bipartisan program, only after Democrats forced action here  on the floor. I don't believe our Republican majority would have done  anything. 

  We announced we would UC the bill, and we did, and it was blocked.  Then, of course, faced with the public pressure of moving, Leader  McConnell came on the floor late last evening and moved the bill. 

  Make no mistake about it, without the pressure that we Democrats  placed on the Republican majority to make these changes, it would  certainly have been further delayed and might never have happened. 

  Now, Leader McConnell has said that another emergency relief bill was  likely before July 4, but then on Tuesday, when listing his priorities  for the June session, Leader McConnell did not mention COVID  legislation. 

  Republican Senators are starting to say that another relief bill  might--might--come in late July--shocking. This past week--just today  it was announced--nearly 2 million more Americans filed for  unemployment, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to  over 42 million. 

  The monthly jobs report tomorrow is expected to report over 20  percent unemployment, and we should wait? As people are losing their  jobs, as parents are not sure they can feed their kids or stay in their  homes, as small businesses, where people put their blood, sweat, and  tears over the years and even decades to build them are collapsing--and  we should wait? Why? Because maybe some rightwing ideologues or some of  the very big leaders of the Republican Party and benefactors don't like  spending money on anything? 

  I don't know if that is the reason. I hope it isn't. But we can't  wait. We can't wait. 

  The economic disaster, as with so many issues in society, will  disproportionately affect Black Americans. So far, 109,000 fellow  Americans have died. More are dying every day, every single day, but  Senate Republicans want to wait until late July to maybe--maybe do  another relief bill. 

  The coin of the realm in the Senate is floor time. Leader McConnell,  every Senate Republican, what are you going to devote time to? 

  Today, toward the end of one of the more tumultuous and painful weeks  in recent memory, marked by emotional protests about racial justice and  police violence, Senate Republicans are holding sessions in the  Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees related to President Trump's  favorite conspiracy theories about the 2016 election. 

  I am not making this up. That is what they are doing, American  people--not talking about COVID, not talking about racial justice but  focusing on some Russian-originated theory that has been discredited by  our intelligence agencies. That is what the Republican Senate is doing.  No wonder they are in trouble. 

  The American people are looking for some kind of real help, some kind  of real discussion, and the Republicans are talking about conspiracy  theories. 

  Then the Senate Judiciary Committee is about to approve another  rightwing judge, a McConnell protege, Justin Walker--seriously. At  least, if you look at the record and history of Justin Walker, the  chances of him being for strengthening voting rights and  antidiscrimination legislation is very, very tiny. Yet they move  forward on him. 

  By the end of the day, the two Republican-led committees will have  approved up to 100 subpoenas--unprecedented in modern history. In the  midst of national crises, Senate Republicans are trying to use the  Senate to do opposition research for the President's reelection  campaign. Seriously? 

  The Republican majority will approve up to 100 subpoenas to chase the  President's wild conspiracy theories but has not put one bill on jobs,  one bill on testing, one bill on employment on the floor of the Senate  since Leader McConnell called us back. They will not even commit to a  debate on law enforcement reform. 

  You might think that an economic crisis, a public health emergency,  on top of the searing reminder of racial injustice, might have put the  conspiracy caucus on pause, but no--no such luck. 

  The American people should call their Republican Senators. They  should demand action. The Republican Senate is failing to meet this  important moment, and the Republican President isn't doing any better. 

  In a week marred by unacceptable violence and rioting in some places,  the President advocates more violence, more chaos, more disorder,  including appalling attacks on the constitutional rights of protesters  on his front porch 

  I am heartbroken by stories of peaceful protesters being injured when  the protests turn ugly. I am heartbroken by reports of police officers  who are doing their job the right way, striving to keep the peace, who  have been gravely injured.  

  Three of New York's finest were injured yesterday while assigned to  prevent looting. A New York State trooper in Buffalo was run over the  other night. I wish New York State Trooper Ron Ensminger and the  Buffalo police officers injured in these disturbing incidents a speedy  and full recovery and thank them for their service and commitment to  public safety. 

  Let me state, once again, unequivocally, that the cause of justice  and change sought by protesters in and beyond is undermined by  lawlessness and violence. President Trump, however, seems to be  incapable of acknowledging the fact that the overwhelming number of  peace protesters are peaceful and are simply advocating change. He  seems incapable of turning the temperature down to prevent more  violence. Quite the opposite. The President wants Americans to falsely  believe that all the people who are protesting for a good cause-- equality and racial justice--are violent. Nothing could be further from  the truth. The overwhelming majority are doing what our Founding  Fathers did: protesting to make this Nation a better nation. They  should be praised, not vilified. 

  In a week marred by unacceptable violence and rioting in some places,  the President advocates chaos and disorder, including appalling attacks  on constitutional rights on his front porch. My goodness. My goodness. 

  Earlier this week, Americans watched Federal officers, under the  direction of the President and the Attorney General, use gas and rubber  bullets to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters in the park. The  Lincoln Memorial was blocked off by rows of camouflaged officers. 

  There are reports right now that troops from Fort Drum and Fort Bragg  are camped outside Washington, DC. I would ask the leaders of our  military, if these reports are true, what are they doing there, and  what are their orders? 

  The leader, a few minutes ago, mentioned Tiananmen Square. Of course,  no one believes that we are China or like China--of course not. We are  a democracy, and we are proud of it. Most of us love and praise the  right for peaceful protests. But I would remind the Republican leader,  when any President, particularly an overreaching one like this, steps  over the line, if good people don't raise their voices, that is the way  to erode democracy, which China does not have. 

  Where is Leader McConnell's voice? Instead of spinning these crazy  theories, why doesn't he just speak out against what the President did  Monday night? Why did he block our resolution, our simple resolution,  which called for only three things: one, praise the protesters; two,  condemn violence; and, three, condemn the President for what he did? 

  Our Nation's Capital is being patrolled by Federal officers commanded  by President Trump and Attorney General Barr, who refuse to identify  who they are and where they come from. 

  What is President Trump doing to this democracy, to the rule of law,  to the primacy of the Constitution? And where are the Republican Senate  voices--Leader McConnell and everyone else here--condemning what he  did? 

  Again, democracy will be eroded if we don't stand up for it, if we  are afraid to speak out, afraid to tell President Trump he is  overreaching and has done bad, bad things when he does them. 

  I am not the only one who feels this way. We have had statement after  statement from Americans of all political stripes. I read George Will,  for instance, the other day. He is a conservative, but he cares about  America, and he has got some principle. 

  Then, the most remarkable of all, issued by President Trump's former  Secretary of Defense. I want to read some of what former Secretary  Mattis said:  

       When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an       oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I       dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered       under any circumstance to violate the constitutional rights       of their fellow citizens--much less to provide a bizarre       photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military       leadership standing alongside. We know that we are better       than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in       Lafayette Square.  

  Mattis continues:  

       Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does       not try to unite the American people--does not even pretend       to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the       consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are       witnessing the consequences of three years without mature       leadership. We can unite without him, drawing on the       strengths inherent in our civil society. This will not be       easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our       fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our       promise; and to our children.  

  That was President Trump's former Secretary of Defense, James Mattis.  Like all former members of the military, I know that Secretary Mattis  strives to avoid political statements. He has assiduously avoided them  so far. But it was a searing indictment of President Trump's failures  that importuned Secretary Mattis to speak out so strongly about the  President's divisiveness, immaturity, and abuse of power. 

  Make no mistake about it, General Mattis's comments were a shot  across the bow to our military leaders: Don't let the President push  you into doing things you know that are wrong, that should not be done,  and that could very well violate the Constitution.

Democrat,Margaret Wood Hassan,Senator Hassan Statement on Senate Passage of Bipartisan Bill to Strengthen Loan Program for Small Businesses and Nonprofits,"U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan released the following statement after the Senate passed bipartisan legislation to give small employers in New Hampshire and across the country more flexibility in using the federal funds provided to them through the Paycheck Protection Program.

""Tens of thousands of small businesses and nonprofits across New Hampshire have received vital Paycheck Protection assistance,"" Senator Hassan said. ""I am glad that Congress could come together on a bipartisan basis to provide more flexibility to Granite State businesses and nonprofits who are doing everything they can to get by right now. I urge the President to sign this bipartisan legislation into law without delay, and I will continue working on additional measures to help meet the needs of our local economy during this unprecedented time.""

Right now, loans provided to employers under the Paycheck Protection Program can only be fully forgiven if loan funds are used by June 30, and if 75 percent of a loan is spent on payroll expenses. This bipartisan legislation passed by Congress would provide loan forgiveness flexibility by extending the number of weeks over which employers can spend Paycheck Protection Program funds and by increasing how much of the loan an employer can use for non-payroll expenses, such as rent or utilities.  

Senator Hassan is working to support small businesses during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, and in April voted in favor of bipartisan legislation to significantly bolster funding for programs that support small businesses, including the Paycheck Protection Program. Last month, following conversations with businesses and nonprofits in New Hampshire, Senator Hassan also urged the Trump administration to quickly provide guidance to New Hampshire's small businesses and nonprofits regarding forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loans."
Republican,John Hoeven,"Hoeven Statement on Fish & Wildlife Service Establishing Appeals Process for Wetlands Maps, Clarifying Easement Boundaries","Senator John Hoeven, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee and a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today issued the following statement after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) announced that it would work with landowners to clarify pre-1976 wetlands easement boundaries and provide a process to appeal wetlands maps. This follows Hoeven, along with Senator Kevin Cramer, hosting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt in North Dakota to highlight the need for due process and regulatory relief for farmers and ranchers impacted by FWS wetlands easements.

""We appreciate the efforts of Secretary Bernhardt regarding perpetual easements and wetlands determinations at the FWS,"" said Hoeven. ""Our landowners, including farmers and ranchers, deserve due process without having to bear the burden of costly litigation. We look forward to continuing our work with the administration to ensure these reforms provide an adequate appeals process and much-needed regulatory relief."" 

""I appreciate the leadership of Senators Hoeven and Cramer in bringing this issue to light as we have taken action to minimize needless conflict with farmers in protecting waterfowl,"" said Secretary Bernhardt. ""President Trump and I are committed to ensuring that we have a government that better serves the American people and is responsive to addressing real concerns.""

During the meeting with Bernhardt, Hoeven outlined the differences between the wetlands regulations at the FWS compared to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), under which Hoeven sought to provide regulatory relief as a member of the 2018 Farm Bill conference committee. This includes:

-Maintaining Private Property Rights: In defense of the private property rights of farmers and ranchers, and at Hoeven's urging, a proposal to authorize permanent easements was not included in the farm bill.-NRCS Site Visit: Improves the quality of the wetland appeals process by requiring NRCS to conduct a site visit with the participant after an appeal has been filed.-Report on Small Wetlands: Directs the NRCS to report the number of wetland acres in North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa that have been delineated and are less than one acre."
Republican,Todd Young,Young and Warner Resolution to Honor 75th Anniversary of Iwo Jima,"U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) today introduced a Joint Resolution to honor the 75th Anniversary of the Battle for Iwo Jima during World War II. The resolution recognizes the gallantry and heroism demonstrated 75 years ago during the victory that was led by the United States Marine Corps over Imperial Japan on the island of Iwo Jima. A companion resolution was introduced in House by U.S. Representatives Greg Pence (R-IN-06), Pete Visclosky (D-IN-01), and Ken Calvert (R-CA-42).

 

""Iwo Jima is hallowed ground for me, my fellow Marines, and all those who lost loved ones in the battle. This resolution helps to recognize those who gave their lives in Iwo Jima seventy-five years ago,"" said Senator Young. ""The resolution also calls upon Americans to honor these veterans and reaffirm the deep bonds of friendship between the United States and Japan that have developed over the seventy-five years since we were at war.""

 

""As we mark 75 years since the battle of Iwo Jima, I'm reminded of the many servicemen who sacrificed so much for our nation. Many of these individuals, including my father -- a Marine Corporal at Iwo Jima -- witnessed their fellow servicemen lose their lives in defense of our freedoms. This resolution is a tribute to the resilience of the Greatest Generation and the courage of those who fought in the 36-day battle,"" said Senator Warner.

 

""As a Beirut Veteran, I understand that our first duty is to remember. The 75th anniversary of the Battle for Iwo Jima is a time to remember and honor the relentless courage of our men and women in uniform. Our Marines took Iwo Jima at a heavy cost, but their bravery made possible the Allied Victory in World War II. It is one of the deadliest days in Marine Corps history, and those heroes will never be forgotten,"" said Congressman Pence. ""I had the solemn experience of going to Iwo Jima when I was deployed as a Marine. I am honored to return this year with the Commandant of the Marine Corps to remember the nearly 7,000 Marines who made the ultimate sacrifice at the Battle for Iwo Jima.""

 

The Senate resolution was cosponsored by Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Richard Blumenthal (D- Conn.), Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), Joe Manchin (D- W.Va.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Mitt Romney (R- Utah), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), Josh Hawley (R- Mo.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Doug Jones (D-Ala.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.)."
Democrat,Maria Cantwell,Cantwell: Marshal American Innovation To Fight COVID-19,"As Congress continues to work on legislation and new resources to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, used her written opening statement in today's paper Commerce committee hearing to highlight the potential for technology and innovation to better model, track, and ultimately stop, the spread of the novel coronavirus without compromising the privacy of individual consumers.

""We are conducting this hearing to examine how technology and information can help us in the fight against COVID-19 and how we can ensure that strong privacy protections are in place to protect the public,"" Ranking Member Cantwell wrote in her opening statement for the hearing.

In her statement, Cantwell pointed to examples from Washington state that demonstrate the power of technology and publically available data to help fight the pandemic. A multidimensional model developed by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) that focuses on forecasting hospital and medical equipment capacity has used data from local and national governments and health organizations to help estimate the need for ICU and ventilator resources across the United States. The model has been used to help emphasize the importance of social distancing practices to slow the outbreak, as well as to provide data on how the number of cases and hospitalizations in Washington state has declined.

Cantwell also highlighted the successful adaptation of an existing Seattle Flu study to provide more information on the coronavirus. The information and resources provided by this project formed the basis for the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN), which is modeling data to help public health officials better understand who might have COVID-19 and how it is being spread.

While Cantwell pushed for technology and data to help in the fight, she also cautioned about the need to do so responsibly, with critical safeguards in place to promote openness and protect privacy: ""We must always focus on exactly how we expect technology to help, and how to use data strategically to these ends. We must resist hasty decisions that will sweep up massive, unrelated data sets. And we must guard against vaguely defined and non-transparent government initiatives with our personal data. Because rights and data surrendered temporarily during an emergency can become very difficult to get back.""

Ranking Member Cantwell has been a leader in pushing for resources for fighting the coronavirus. She and her Democratic colleagues helped secure hundreds of billions of dollars to support workers, families, and the health care system in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed by the Senate signed into law last month. Also last month, she joined her Democratic colleagues in demanding answers about supplies and equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile. And at the beginning of the outbreak, she requested more protective equipment for Washington state at the beginning of the outbreak.

Senator Cantwell has also been a leader in pushing for a strong federal data privacy law that protects American consumers. In November 2019, she unveiled the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act to establish privacy rights, outlaw harmful and deceptive practices, and improve data security safeguards for millions of Americans. Senator Cantwell has also called attention to the evolving challenges of combatting digital misinformation, championed the importance of investing in cybersecurity measures throughout the U.S. economy, and pushed federal agencies including the FTC to take a more robust role in protecting Americans from privacy threats.

Questions from Senators will be posted by the end of the day, and witnesses will then have 96 business hours to respond in writing."
Democrat,Jeanne Shaheen,Shaheen Statement on Bipartisan Agreement on Coronavirus Economic Response Legislation,"U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, issued the following statement after Senate Democrats and Republicans reached a final agreement on new coronavirus response legislation to provide urgent relief to workers, small businesses, health care providers, hospitals and families impacted by this public health crisis. This legislation was the result of around the clock bipartisan negotiations, of which Shaheen helped negotiate provisions to assist small businesses alongside Senators Rubio (R-FL), Cardin (D-MD) and Collins (R-ME).

Commenting on the agreement as a whole, Shaheen said, ""Throughout these negotiations, I've been in constant communication with small businesses, public health officials and local leaders in New Hampshire. Delivering desperately needed assistance to the Granite State has been my top priority -- I've been adamant that we get this legislation right so that it provides real relief to those who need it most, particularly families and small businesses who are struggling. Because of persistent bipartisan negotiations, urgently needed help for New Hampshire is on the way. This bill provides real relief to New Hampshire's working families, particularly hourly and low-income workers, so that they can pay their bills and afford groceries and other necessities. In addition, New Hampshire will get at least $1.25 billion to bolster response efforts across the state -- funding that was secured in recent days during negotiations. I worked very closely with senators from both sides of the aisle to negotiate legislation that helps small businesses stay afloat and continue to meet payroll for their workers. I also fought for additional assistance for our hospitals that will soon see a terrifying surge in patients in the days and weeks ahead. The importance of keeping New Hampshire's hospitals operational with the resources they need to treat a rush of new patients can't be overstated. At my insistence, this bill provides financial support for child care costs for health care workers and other essential workers so that they can continue their vital work on the front lines.""

Shaheen continued, ""It was also important that this legislation have protections in place to prevent large corporations from misusing funding. This bill is by no means perfect and there are certainly additional measures I wish we could have included, but the fact is this bill provides urgently needed help to families, small businesses, hospitals and states who need this assistance quickly. Our work in Congress certainly doesn't end here -- Republicans and Democrats must continue to work across the aisle to overcome this crisis. This is one of those times in history when all Americans need to unite and do what's best for our communities and our country. We are all in this together.""

Below are topline priorities included in the bipartisan economic response package that were secured and supported by Shaheen:

Direct payments to many Americans of as much as $1,200 per person;More than $377 billion for small businesses, which Shaheen helped negotiate, to meet their payroll and expenses, and receive education and assistance throughout the coronavirus pandemic; 4 months of increased unemployment assistance;   More than $100 billion in much needed assistance for hospitals and frontline health care providers, and billions more in funding for the broader health care system;Provides funding to health care and other essential workers for child care costs so that they can continue their important work on the front lines;$150 billion to help state and local governments cover new expenses related to coronavirus response;Significant restrictions and oversight to help ensure that larger corporations protect workers and don't misuse funding through stock buybacks and executive pay increases; and$10 billion in grants to help our nation's airports as the aviation sector grapples with the most steep and potentially sustained decline in air travel in history.By standing firm during negotiations and demanding a better bill, Senator Shaheen helped secure the following in recent days which was not in the original bill proposed by Leader McConnell:

4 months of expanded unemployment insurance instead of 3 months, to include gig economy workers and independent contractors;$150 billion for a state and local Coronavirus Relief fund of which at least $1.25 billion will go to New Hampshire to assist in COVID-19 response efforts;Increased funding to hospitals and other health care providers from $75 billion to $100 billion;More than $30 billion in additional funding to support the broader health care system;$10 billion for Small Business Administration (SBA) emergency grants of up to $10,000 to provide immediate relief for small business operating costs;$17 billion for SBA to cover 6 months of payments for small businesses with existing SBA loans;$30 billion in emergency education funding and $25 billion in emergency transit funding;$30 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund to provide financial assistance to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, as well as private nonprofits providing critical and essential services; Allowing for rent, mortgage and utility costs to be eligible for SBA loan forgiveness;$900 million for low income heating assistance through LIHEAP;$300 million in assistance for impacted fishermen and processors;Bans stock buybacks during government assistance plus an additional one year for any company receiving a government loan from the bill;A retention tax credit for employers to encourage businesses to keep workers on payroll during the crisis;Income tax exclusion for individuals who are receiving student loan repayment assistance from their employer;Eliminated a $3 billion bailout for big oil;Eliminated a ""secret bailout"" provision that would have allowed bailouts to corporations to be concealed for 6 months; andSaved hundreds of thousands of airline industry jobs and prohibited airlines from stock buybacks and CEO bonuses.Yesterday, Senator Shaheen spoke on the Senate floor about her efforts to improve this legislation for New Hampshire.

In addition to this legislation, Shaheen has fought for and voted in favor of two economic response bills to provide financial relief to states in their response efforts, and to support workers, businesses and families impacted by the spread of the coronavirus. The President signed both bills into law. The first economic package led to New Hampshire receiving an initial $4.9 million in funds from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."
Democrat,Benjamin L. Cardin,Cardin: Martin Luther King Jr. Led a Movement Guided by Peace and Compassion that Challenged the Forces of Hate and Intolerance,"To commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day 2020, U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly, released the following statement.

""On January 20, we honor Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his prolific fight for freedom and equality. At the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement, he called upon the nation and its leaders to codify legal and social equality for black Americans, to eradicate poverty and to ensure fair treatment for all citizens under our great nation. He led a movement guided by peace and compassion that summoned the power to challenge forces of hate and intolerance deeply embedded in our legal system and our national identity. 

""He championed the legislative milestones that continue to shape our society today, but we can't ignore the fact that many who marched with Dr. King, their children, grandchildren, still carry the weight of the economic disparities, ongoing systemic prejudice, and social biases seeded far before the Jim Crow Era. 

""Our broken criminal justice system continues to disproportionately -- and sometimes fatally -- target black lives and communities. Discriminatory profiling still threatens economic progress, health outcomes, and educational and job opportunities. We are still fighting to restore one of the landmark achievements of the Civil Rights Movement, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was gutted in the 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision and opened the floodgates for the disenfranchisement of black and minority voters. As the current administration continues to unravel the social safety net, embolden hateful rhetoric and take precise aim at the policies in place to address injustice and inequality, Dr. King's message is more important than ever. 

""It's easy to use this holiday to say ""look how far we've come.' However, when we measure the distance between the ideologies of the past and our present realities, the gulf between freedom and equality for all Americans across racial and socioeconomic strata, we must understand that more than 50 years after his death, we still have much work to make Dr. King's dream a reality.

""Therefore, we must honor him by following in his footsteps and using his legacy to inform the work we do -- in Congress, in the world and within ourselves -- to get there. Dr. King taught us that this fight is ongoing and that it doesn't end after one speech, one protest, or even after one law is passed.

""As long as injustice lives, we must continue the fight to end it. He famously said that ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice,' in his work, he reminds us that it does not do so on its own but rather through the work of ordinary men and women who choose to be extraordinary citizens and fight hate and injustice wherever it arises."""
Democrat,Jack Reed,Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolution,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Strengthening UI  for Coronavirus Impacted Workers and Students Act. For the 30 million  American unemployed workers, the enhanced jobless benefits created in  the CARES Act are a lifeline. However, the Federal Pandemic  Unemployment Compensation, which provides a $600-per-week benefit on  top of an individual's regular unemployment insurance (UI) benefits are  set to expire on July 31, 2020. Arbitrarily cutting these benefits off  in the midst of an ongoing pandemic could make a desperate situation  worse for individuals and harm the economy. Moreover, if these workers  are prematurely pushed back into unsafe work environments, it will  ultimately harm families, businesses, and communities. 

  That is why my new legislation seeks to expand and enhance the  unemployment insurance of the CARES Act. Specifically, this bill would  continue to offer out-of-work Americans the $600-per-week additional  benefit through the end of the year and make it retroactive to the date  of the coronavirus pandemic disaster declaration date. This legislation  would also exempt these pandemic-specific benefits from being factored  into eligibility for means-tested programs, such as Section 8 housing,  SNAP, TANF, and WIC. Furthermore, it would create a $300 Federal  benefit for recent college graduates, students, and others who are  willing and able to work absent COVID-19. but who do not have recent  work history. Finally, this legislation would codify guidance by the  Department of Labor requiring employees who are participating in ``work  sharing'' programs to be able to receive the $600-per-work boost. I  added provisions to the CARES Act to Federally finance these cost- effective and job saving ``work sharing'' programs, which give  struggling companies the flexibility to reduce hours instead of laying  off their workforce, while allowing the employees to collect  unemployment insurance on the days they are not working. 

  The bill is supported by numerous organizations including the  American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations  (AFL-CIO), International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the National  Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), National  Education Association (NEA), National Employment Law Project (NELP),  National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), The Arc, United Auto  Workers (UAW), National Alliance on Mental Illness. National  Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities, National  Disability Rights Network, and National Women's Law Center. 

  We have to be smart and this targeted, temporary measure will help  ensure Americans who are out of work through no fault of their own can  afford food, housing, and medicine until it is safe to go back to work.  I am pleased to join my colleague in the other body, Representative  Kildee, in sponsoring this legislation, and I look forward to working  with my colleagues here and across the Capitol to secure passage of  this important legislation.                                  ______                                   

      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Tester, Mr. Schatz, Mr.          Jones, Ms. Smith, Ms. Warren, Ms. Sinema, Mr. Warner, Mr.          Menendez, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Cortez Masto, Mr. Kaine, Mr.          Udall, Mr. Booker, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Merkley, and          Mr. Wyden): 

  S. 3620. A bill to establish a Housing Assistance Fund at the  Department of the Treasury; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and  Urban Affairs. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. REED. Mr. President, along with Senators Brown, Tester, Schatz,  Jones, Smith, Warren, Sinema, Warner, Menendez, Van Hollen, Cortez  Masto, Kaine, Udall, Booker, Feinstein, Durbin, Merkley, and Wyden, I  am introducing legislation that would create a $75 billion Housing  Assistance Fund that builds on the success of the Hardest Hit Fund at  the Treasury Department that I championed in 2010. 

  The Hardest Hit Fund provided funds to 18 State-level Housing Finance  Agencies, directing targeted foreclosure prevention assistance to  households and neighborhoods in States like Rhode Island hit hard by  the economic and housing market downturn. 

  The Housing Assistance Fund expands this model to provide a flexible  source Federal aid to all State-level Housing Finance Agencies. This  Federal funding could then be used to help struggling households remain  in their homes while they search for new employment or wait to get back  to work. Financial assistance could go towards preventing eviction,  mortgage delinquency, default, foreclosures, or loss of utility  services, such as water, gas, and  electricity. Funds could also be used to keep the Internet connected  and remain current with property taxes. 

  In the midst of responding to the coronavirus, we clearly need to do  everything we can to help our constituents. According to CNBC, 8.7  million jobs were lost in the Great Recession, and as of April 23,  2020, more than 26 million Americans filed unemployment insurance  claims in just five weeks. Just for comparative purposes, CNBC also  reported that 22.4 million jobs were created since the Great Recession. 

  This means we're facing job losses at an unprecedented scale and  pace. 

  What this also means is that we could be facing a potential wave of  evictions and foreclosures, so there is no time to waste. We should  respond accordingly so that more families can make it to the other side  of this public health emergency while staying safe in their homes. This  is precisely the goal of this Housing Assistance Fund legislation we  are introducing today. 

  I thank the National Council of State Housing Agencies; Habitat for  Humanity; National Housing Conference; National Community Reinvestment  Coalition; National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders; National  Leased Housing Association; Americans for Financial Reform; National  Consumer Law Center, on behalf of its low-income clients; Center for  Responsible Lending; Rhode Island Housing; and the Rhode Island  Association of Realtors for their support. 

  I urge all of my colleagues to join in pressing for inclusion of the  Housing Assistance Fund in our continued response to the coronavirus  pandemic.                                  ______

Republican,Marsha Blackburn,"Blackburn, Menendez Lead Bipartisan Bill  to Increase US Prescription Drug Manufacturing","Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) have introduced the Securing America's Medicine Cabinet (SAM-C) Act to increase American manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), the building blocks of prescription drugs. Currently, only 28% of API-producing facilities are in the United States and the number of Chinese facilities has more than doubled since 2010.

""When confronted with a serious challenge such as the corona virus, it is important to take stock, look at lessons learned and build upon them in order to respond better the next time,"" said Senator Blackburn. ""Currently, we are too reliant on foreign manufacturing of critical APIs. The SAM-C Act is one step on the right path to strengthen our drug supply chain.""

""The COVID-19 is a real health emergency and we have to do everything in our power to increase our preparedness and response,"" said Senator Menendez. ""This bipartisan proposal will do that by encouraging drug manufacturers to partner with our best minds in higher education on new advancements, creating good jobs and increasing the national production of vaccines and drugs that can save lives. With New Jersey's concentration of pharmaceutical companies and institutes of learning, we can lead the way and make a difference.""

The corona virus outbreak has heightened concerns about dependence upon China and India for prescription medications. On February 27, 2020, the FDA announced the shortage of one drug used to treat patients with coronavirus. They attributed the shortage to difficulties obtaining the API from a site in China affected by coronavirus.

Additionally, in its 2019 report to Congress, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission revealed ""serious deficiencies in health and safety standards in China's pharmaceutical sector."" Dependence upon China and others for prescription drugs combined with safety concerns needs to be addressed. This urgent health event provides an impetus to improve our pharmaceutical supply chain.

The SAM-C Act will encourage pharmaceutical drug manufacturers to spur innovations similar to those in other industries such as automotive, aerospace and semiconductors and bring drug manufacturing back to the United States, where ingredients and processes can be more easily verified. 

The legislation would expand upon the Emerging Technology Program within the Food and Drug Administration to prioritize issues related to national security and critical drug shortages, as well as bring pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs to the United States. In addition, the SAM-C Act authorizes $100 million to develop centers of excellence in advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing in order to develop these innovations as well as train the workforce needed in this industry. These centers will be partnerships between institutes of learning and the private sector. 

RELATED

Last month, Senator Blackburn wrote about how the coronavirus outbreak exposes the U.S.'s pharma supply chain vulnerability: ""Without intervention, the FDA expects the pharmaceutical industry will continue to rely on Chinese companies to make active pharmaceutical ingredients The status quo has made us vulnerable. The fix, however, is sitting right in front of us."""
Republican,Marsha Blackburn,Blackburn Votes to Acquit President Trump,"Today, Senator Marsha Blackburn gave the following statement after the United States Senate voted to acquit President Donald Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress:

""Over the past three weeks, the Senate considered arguments for and against two articles of impeachment sent over by the House of Representatives: one, charging the President with abuse of power for asking Ukraine to assist him in investigating Hunter Biden's work for Burisma, and a second, charging him with obstruction of Congress.

""To prepare for such a serious event, I read the House Managers' brief and the reports prepared by the House Republicans and the President's counsel. I identified gaps in the case and drafted over three dozen questions I believed required answers, including, How can we be sure the whistleblower's account is accurate? What do public reports of the coordination between the whistleblower and Adam Schiff reveal about his political bias? What is the standard for impeachment in the House, and how does it compare to that for conviction in the Senate?

""Unfortunately, instead of focusing on the facts, the Democratic House Impeachment Managers tried to rely on the pandemonium and rage created by a historic moment to convince their colleagues--and the American people--that justice demanded a do-over.

""The impeachment trial of President Donald J. Trump was a moment in history that should have been shrouded in the gravity of its potential consequences; instead, day after day, we endured hyperbole in its most unserious form.

""One of my colleagues--who is running for President Trump's position--seized an opportunity to pull a political stunt and belittle the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. How could something as serious as a presidential impeachment warrant forcing a soundbite on the Senate floor? This is exactly why I previously called on the four candidates running for the Democratic nomination to recuse themselves from the trial. Their ambitions prohibited their ability to view this trial through an objective lens--and we saw that on full display in the Senator's question. While this is the first time impeachment has been used as a partisan political tool, it was unseemly that it made its way to the Senate chamber.

""The process was a waste of time and resources, its motivations completely divorced from reality. At taxpayer expense, President Donald Trump's counsel spent weeks litigating a policy disagreement over the President's foreign relations strategy; meanwhile, seven House Democrats shamelessly questioned whether American voters could be trusted to decide for themselves whether the President's agenda and policies were appropriate. By the end of the trial, we'd heard about a cover-up, a quid pro quo, extortion and bribery--all despite the fact that no crime was alleged in the two articles the Senate was tasked with debating.

""History must take note of the lessons we've learned from these destructive methods.

""The House overstepped the bounds of its Article I oversight power, abused its authority and used impeachment for political gain. The House Managers' actions ignored the fact that Congress is guided by history, precedent, and above all, the Constitution; we should thank the Framers for troubleshooting diligently enough that we could be prepared for this scenario.

Fortunately, we saw that when the House ignores precedent in favor of partisan politics, the Senate will not hesitate to put the lower chamber back in its place.

""That's exactly why today I voted to acquit President Trump--because lowering the high bar of impeachment such that any American could be found guilty is far more dangerous than anything the Democratic ""resistance' has asserted.

""My fellow Tennesseans saw right through the games and the intentional mishandling of the Democratic House Managers' constitutional duty. They know this was nothing more than a dangerous and desperate attempt to pre-litigate the 2020 election, and remove President Trump from office--and the ballot. Thanks to the tireless leadership of Majority Leader McConnell, the Senate completed its task. The House Managers failed to prove their case, even by their own standard.

""Will this resolution put an end to Democrats' seemingly endless efforts to remove President Trump from office? I'm not optimistic. But I do know this: It's time we get back to work making everyday life better for Tennesseans.

""I am devoted to making 2020 a productive year for growth, health, and prosperity in the Volunteer State. We need to focus on expanding broadband connectivity, and implementing policies that will support health care delivery in rural communities. We will take new steps to protect online privacy and the ""Virtual You,' and build on the success of last year's efforts to strengthen our national defense.

""The first three years of President Trump's tenure have brought success in securing fairer trade agreements, lowering taxes, confirming rule-of-law judges, protecting life, and rolling back regulations--and believe me, we're just getting started.

""The impeachment of President Donald J. Trump was not a matter of procedure--it was an attempted coup, brought forth at the expense of the safety and prosperity of the American people. Every member of Congress must now reflect, remember, and take to heart the real legacy of this dark moment in history, when ruthless partisanship undermined due process, trampled the rule of law, and very nearly erased from precedent those rules that underpin our democratic republic."""
Republican,Patrick J. Toomey,"Letter to the Hon. Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, and the Hon. Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve - Congressional Oversight Commission Publishes Initial Report","Dear Secretary Mnuchin and Chairman Powell:

Please find enclosed a copy of the first report of the Congressional Oversight Commission (the ""Commission""). The Commission was created by the CARES Act to conduct oversight of the Treasury Department (the ""Treasury"") and the Federal Reserve's implementation of Division A, Title IV, Subtitle A of the CARES Act (""Subtitle A"").

Subtitle A provided $500 billion to the Treasury to help support and stabilize the economy by lending and providing liquidity to businesses and state and local governments. Of this amount, $46 billion is set aside for the Treasury to provide loans or loan guarantees to the airline industry and businesses critical to maintaining national security. Any unused portions of this $46 billion, and the remaining $454 billion, may be used to support emergency lending facilities established by the Federal Reserve.

This report reviews actions by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve implementing Subtitle A to date, including designing lending programs and facilities. It also outlines some preliminary questions based on those actions that we intend to examine. These questions are not meant to be comprehensive and will not prevent the Commission from reviewing other matters in the future.

We look forward to meeting soon to discuss these matters."
Republican,Marco Rubio,Rubio Releases Critical Provisions for Florida in the CARES Act,"U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) released a list of provisions in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act that will be critical to the State of Florida during the coronavirus pandemic. These critical provisions include Rubio's bipartisan Keeping American Workers Paid and Employed Act, a small business emergency economic relief plan that provides more than $377 billion for small businesses to meet their payroll and expenses, and receive education and assistance throughout the coronavirus pandemic. Rubio applauded the passage of the CARES Act in the Senate last night by a vote of 96 to 0. ""Communities across Florida and our nation are reeling from this unprecedented crisis, and last night the Senate acted on an unprecedented response to provide relief to Americans, small businesses, and our economy,"" Rubio said. ""Our bipartisan small business package, which was included, will provide emergency relief so that millions of American workers can keep their jobs and millions of small businesses can stay open. As our nation works to contain the spread of the coronavirus, I remain in close contact with the Trump Administration and Governor DeSantis to ensure that Florida has the resources it needs during this public health crisis."" A timeline of Rubio's actions related to the coronavirus can be found here.  Critical provisions for the State of Florida in the CARES Act include: State of Florida:Extends Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and related programs through November 30, 2020.6.2 percent increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for Medicaid.$8.238 billion for Florida to use for expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with respect to COVID-19 in the face of revenue declines.FEMA: $45.4 billion for response and recovery activities and reimbursements provided to states and localities nationwide by the Disaster Relief Fund for emergency and major disaster declarations, as well as funding for FEMA facilities and information technology required to support FEMA's lead role in coordinating federal response activities. The bill also includes $400 million for grants that can be disbursed in a timely manner for firefighters, emergency managers, and providers of emergency food and shelter.On Wednesday, March 25, President Trump granted a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of Florida triggering the release of Federal funds to help people and communities recover from COVID-19. Healthcare:Prevents scheduled reductions of $4 billion in Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments.Expands telehealth flexibilities for providers.Provides $1.32 billion in supplemental funding to community health centers on the front lines of testing and treating patients for COVID-19. Requires COVID-19 testing for everyone at no out-of-pocket costs -- Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, privately insured, and the federal government covers the costs for the uninsured.20 percent Medicare payment increase for hospitals providing inpatient care for COVID-19 patients.Suspends 2 percent across-the-board payment reduction from the sequester for Medicare payments through 2020.Appropriates $100 billion for hospitals and healthcare providers to cover costs and lost revenue related to COVID-19.$250 million for hospital preparedness to improve their capacity to respond to public health emergencies.$16 billion for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to procure personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other medical supplies for state and local response efforts. Combined with the first supplemental, Congress has allocated roughly $17 billion for the SNS.$1.5 billion for the CDC to disperse for state and local government preparedness and response activities. When combined with the first supplemental, Congress has provided $2.5 billion for state and local needs. Airports:Includes $10 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airport Improvement Program (AIP) to maintain airport operations at a time when there is a record drop in passengers. Small Businesses: $350 billion to support forgivable loans through a new Paycheck Protection Program for:Small employers with 500 employees or fewer, as well as those that meet the current Small Business Administration (SBA) size standards; Self-employed individuals and ""gig economy"" individuals; and Certain nonprofits, including 501(c)(3) organizations and 501(c)(19) veteran organizations, and tribal business concerns with under 500 employees.The size of the loans would equal 250 percent of an employer's average monthly payroll. The maximum loan amount would be $10 million. Covered payroll costs include salary, wages, and payment of cash tips (up to an annual rate of pay of $100,000); employee group health care benefits, including insurance premiums; retirement contributions; and covered leave. Unemployment Assistance:Creates a new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program to provide unemployment benefits to those who do not qualify for traditional Unemployment Insurance (UI), such as the self-employed and gig-workers.Provides Florida with funding to run its Short-Time Compensation program (also known as the ""work sharing"" program), where employers reduce employee hours instead of laying off workers and the employees with reduced hours receive a prorated unemployment benefit. This provision would pay 100 percent of the unemployment insurance costs Florida incurs in providing this short-time compensation through the end of the year.Creates an additional $600 per week payment to each recipient of unemployment insurance or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for up to four months. Higher Education:Waives the institutional matching requirement for campus-based aid programs, and enables institutions of higher education (IHEs) to transfer unused work-study funds to be used for supplemental grants.Allows IHEs to award additional Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) funds to assist undergraduate or graduate students needing aid for unexpected expenses and unmet financial needs.For students who drop out of school as a result of a qualifying emergency, they can exclude the semester or term they were unable to complete from counting toward their federal academic requirements, lifetime subsidized loan eligibility, and/or their Pell Grant duration limit.Waives the requirement for IHEs to calculate and refund Pell grants or federal loan assistance to the Department of Education for students who drop out of school due to a qualifying emergency.Protects students from suddenly losing their Pell grants or federal loan assistance for the semester or term they had to drop out as a result of a qualifying emergency.The Secretary will defer all loan payments, principal, and interest due on Direct and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) student loans for 6 months, through September 30, 2020, without penalty to the borrower. Nutrition:Waives nutrition requirements for Older Americans Act (OAA) meal programs during the public health emergency related to COVID-19 to ensure seniors can get meals in case certain food options are not available.$15.51 billion in additional Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding to cover the waiver authorities granted in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, as well as anticipated increases in participation as a result of coronavirus.$8.8 billion for Child Nutrition Programs to fund additional food purchases and demonstration projects to increase flexibility for schools.$450 million for the Emergency Food Assistance Program for the purchase of commodities and distribution of emergency food assistance through community partners, including food banks$9.5 billion in emergency response funding to support agricultural producers impacted by COVID-19. Individual Assistance:All U.S. residents with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 ($150,000 married), who are not a dependent of another taxpayer and have a work eligible social security number, are eligible for the full $1,200 ($2,400 married) rebate.In addition, they are eligible for an additional $500 per child. For the vast majority of Americans, no action on their part will be required in order to receive a rebate check as the IRS will use a taxpayer's 2019 tax return if filed, or in the alternative their 2018 return.This includes many low-income individuals who file a tax return in order to take advantage of the refundable Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC). The rebate amount is reduced by $5 for each $100 that a taxpayer's income exceeds the phase-out threshold. The amount is completely phased-out for single filers with incomes exceeding $99,000, $146,500 for head of household filers with one child, and $198,000 for joint filers with no children.Provides up to 90 days of forbearance for multifamily borrowers with a federally backed multifamily mortgage loan who have experienced a financial hardship. Borrowers receiving forbearance may not evict or charge late fees to tenants for the duration of the forbearance period.For 120 days beginning on the date of enactment, landlords are prohibited from initiating legal action to recover possession of a rental unit or to charge fees, penalties, or other charges to the tenant related to such nonpayment of rent where the landlord's mortgage on that property is insured, guaranteed, supplemented, protected, or assisted in any way by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the rural housing voucher program, or the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. Notable Tax Provisions:Refundable payroll tax credit for 50 percent of wages paid by employers to employees during the COVID-19 crisis. The credit is available to employers whose (1) operations were fully or partially suspended, due to a COVID-19related shut-down order, or (2) gross receipts declined by more than 50 percent when compared to the same quarter in the prior year.  Allows employers and self-employed individuals to defer payment of the employer share of the Social Security tax they otherwise are responsible for paying to the federal government with respect to their employees.Relaxes the limitations on a company's use of losses. Net operating losses (NOL) are currently subject to a taxable-income limitation, and they cannot be carried back to reduce income in a prior tax year. The provision provides that an NOL arising in a tax year beginning in 2018, 2019, or 2020 can be carried back five years. The provision also temporarily removes the taxable income limitation to allow an NOL to fully offset income.Accelerates the ability of companies to recover those Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credits, permitting companies to claim a refund now and obtain additional cash flow during the COVID-19 emergency. The corporate AMT was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but corporate AMT credits were made available as refundable credits over several years, ending in 2021. Temporarily increases the amount of interest expense businesses are allowed to deduct on their tax returns, by increasing the 30-percent limitation to 50 percent of taxable income, with adjustments, for 2019 and 2020.Enables businesses, especially in the hospitality industry, to write off immediately costs associated with improving facilities instead of having to depreciate those improvements over the 39-year life of the building."
Republican,Kevin Cramer,Sen. Cramer Statement on President Trump Signing The Emergency GI Fix for Coronavirus School Closures Bill,"U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee member, issued the following statement on President Trump signing into law S.3503, the ""Emergency GI Fix for Coronavirus School Closures"":

""I'm grateful to President Trump for signing this important legislation quickly. Schools moving to online classes because of the coronavirus exposed an obvious flaw in the GI Bill, which threatened to upend the education of many of our veterans simply because they could not participate in online learning like their peers. Thankfully we were able to unite behind an immediate solution for our veterans.""

Senator Cramer joined his colleagues on the Senate VA Committee in introducing this legislation earlier this month."
Democrat,Robert Menendez,"Letter to Dr. Stephen Hahn, Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration - Pascrell, Menendez Demand FDA Heed Science Over Politics","Dear Commissioner Hahn,

We write to express concern with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) recent grants of emergency use authorization (EUA) to drugs and the approval of potential treatments for clinical trials. We are in the midst of the greatest test of our time, and as such our duty to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of Americans is more important than ever. The FDA is the gold standard worldwide for scientific review of medical products and we must maintain superior scientific judgement at this perilous time.

Specifically, we are concerned about two recent moves to fast-track drugs.  First, the FDA issued emergency approval of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19. While there is anecdotal evidence showing some initial positive outcomes from this decades-old malaria drug, there has been no adequate and well-controlled trial demonstrating safety and efficacy for COVID-19 patients. Second, the FDA approved a clinical trial for an experimental stem cell therapy, CYNK-001, whose objective is to prevent the severe symptoms of COVID-19 by using ""natural killer"" cells to boost the immune system of infected patients. There is very little evidence that this approach will work as intended. In both cases, we are concerned the FDA acted in the absence of  scientific data, raising questions about whether the agency faced political pressure to act.

Former FDA officials have questioned the EUA as well, noting the total lack of scientific evidence that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19 and that an EUA should only be issued when the evidence indicates that benefits outweigh the risks. A leading stem cell researcher also observed that therapies like CYNK-001, which uses ""natural killer"" cells derived from the placenta, presents serious risks, including exacerbating respiratory issues -- a particularly serious complication given COVID-19's threat to respiratory function.

In addition to the FDA's actions, there are other consequences to Administration officials and advisors promoting drugs and therapeutics in contravention of scientific data and process. As a result of non-scientific promotion of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients, individuals who take these medications regularly for autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus have faced severe barriers getting their prescriptions. Now, these patients face a nationwide shortage of these critical drugs because the drugs were promoted at a press conference despite a clear lack of evidence of their safety and efficacy in treating COVID-19. Additionally, we are seeing evidence that providers are using their prescription authority to acquire and hoard the products for themselves, further straining the supply for patients who take the drug.

While we understand the FDA is under immense pressure to quickly evaluate therapies for COVID-19, it is more important than ever that the FDA remain true to its standard processes in issuing EUAs. There is a chance that these two potential therapies could be more harmful than helpful. The FDA and the administration must also consider the damage done in the form of giving false hope to the American people. We represent a state on the frontlines of this pandemic. Statements promoting a therapy with no evidence, combined with the FDA's issuance of an EUA outside of its standard process, may cause many Americans to believe that these experimental drugs are a cure-all, and worse over may inspire some to abandon social distancing and other proven preventative measures critical to controlling this virus.

The FDA must maintain its global status as the gold standard for drug approval and review. It must not cede its responsibility to base decisions on rigorous scientific evidence. As this pandemic grows exponentially, your agency's decision-making process must not succumb to political pressure. An agency charged with protecting the public health can only do so by total dedication to the safety, efficacy, and security of human drugs and biological products. We look forward to your response."
Republican,Michael B. Enzi,"After Senate passage, Enzi urges House to quickly pass third coronavirus relief package","U.S. Senator Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., issued the following statement after the Senate unanimously passed the third package in response to COVID-19:­­""After a lot of tense discussions, I'm pleased the Senate finally passed this third bipartisan relief package to help individuals, small businesses and the economy. It helps to fill in the gaps of the previous packages and provide the financial assistance needed for small businesses and employees in order to avoid massive unemployment lines and a complete economic collapse of our country. Employees are losing their jobs and businesses are having to shut down, through no fault of their own. They need our help. This entire situation is unprecedented and unique -- and it calls for unprecedented solutions. I urge the House to quickly pass this legislation so folks can get the relief they need.""

The third Senate package:

Provides a one-time check of $1,200 to every American whose 2018 tax return, or 2019 if filed, showed income at or below $75,000, with an extra $500 per child. There is no minimum threshold. It is reduced for those earning between $75,000 - $99,000 and ends at $99,000.Expands unemployment insurance to self-employed workers and makes more money available for longer periods of time.Helps small businesses keep employees and stay open by creating a ""Paycheck Protection Program"" that would provide 8 weeks of cash-flow assistance through 100 federally guaranteed loans to small businesses that maintain their payroll.Helps families stay in their homes by implementing a foreclosure moratorium.Mobilizes America's health care sector and expands telehealth.Allows the use of Health Savings Accounts to cover telehealth and over-the-counter drugs.Stabilizes the economy by authorizing the Federal Reserve to provide liquidity to markets.Provides loans to support passenger airlines, cargo airlines, and businesses important to ""maintaining national security."""
Democrat,Christopher Murphy,Murphy to the Administration: Don't Paint a Rosier Picture than what exists on Coronavirus Test Kit Availability,"U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Friday held a press conference after the U.S. Senate voted 96-1 to approve $8.3 billion in emergency funding to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. Connecticut is expected to receive millions of dollars in aid to support state efforts to prepare for and combat a potential outbreak. President Trump signed this funding into law on Friday.

On the issue of testing for coronavirus, Murphy said: ""There were a lot of us that were stunned when the administration said at the beginning of this week they'd have a million testing kits out by the end of the week. We all knew that that was impossible, and it indeed has proved to be impossible. There's nowhere near a million of testing kits available.""

Murphy continued by stressing the importance of only telling the American people the truth: ""So what's really important is that this administration deals only in the truth, doesn't try to sugarcoat this crisis for political purposes. What we need are facts. If there's only going to be a couple thousand testing units for Connecticut, then let us know so that we can plan. Don't paint a rosier picture than exists. Tell us what we can expect for health here in Connecticut.""

Murphy also discussed a letter he sent today to the federal government requesting more test kits: ""We are sending a letter to the federal government today requesting more testing kits. We're doing that at the request of Governor Lamont, and we hope we will receive an answer very, very soon. We need the testing kits here in Connecticut. And, you know, I'm disappointed the administration didn't get to work on testing kits earlier, but we are where we are. And we're going to try to do the best with what we have.""

Murphy voted to support the bipartisan $8.3 billion supplemental funding bill in the Senate, which President Trump signed into law on Friday, and called for swift passage once it was released in the House. Earlier this week, Murphy questioned Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr. Stephan Hahn on the emerging threat of coronavirus and what officials are doing in response. Murphy also pressed U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar on the administration's coronavirus response and slammed the Trump administration's recent emergency funding request to protect from the coronavirus epidemic that was sent to Congress.

A full transcript of Murphy's remarks can be found below:

""Thank you to Stephen and the team here at St. Mary's for inviting us back.

""I've spent a lot of time here having represented Waterbury for going on two decades now. It's great to be here with a committed group of public health professionals. Let me also thank Governor Lamont for the great work he's done to get Connecticut ready. Governor Lamont has stood up Connecticut's preparedness system early on, and while he's requesting additional help from the federal government, Connecticut is doing everything necessary to be ready for an outbreak here. Let me thank Mayor O'Leary for early on convening a task force here in Waterbury to make sure that the city was prepared.

""The risk of exposure for Americans today is still relatively low, but the risks still exists. And the difficulty today is that we don't know how many cases we have in this country because we don't have the ability to test. As of this morning, we had somewhere short of 200 confirmed cases across the country. But we know that's not the right number. We know there are far more than 200 people who have coronavirus, but we have not been able to reach that conclusion definitively because we don't have the ability to test. There could be people in Connecticut that have coronavirus -- we don't know. What we need are more testing devices.

""And I share Senator Blumenthal's frustration at the overly rosy estimates that the administration has given us on the distribution of testing kits. There were a lot of us that were stunned when the administration said at the beginning of this week they'd have a million testing kits out by the end of the week. We all knew that that was impossible, and it indeed has proved to be impossible. There's nowhere near a million testing kits available. So what's really important is that this administration deals only in the truth, doesn't try to sugarcoat this crisis for political purposes. What we need are facts. If there's only going to be a couple thousand testing units for Connecticut, then let us know so that we can plan. Don't paint a rosier picture than exists. Tell us what we can expect for health here in Connecticut.

""The good news is with this supplemental emergency appropriations bill, we know the amount of funding that's going to be available to hospitals, to states, to municipal health departments, to the CDC and to NIH. $8.3 billion is going to be allocated under this bill. The first tranche of money will come to Connecticut within the next 30 days. 475 million will be distributed to 50 states to then be distributed out to local public health systems. Stay tuned for what that number will be for the state but we will within 30 days get the first round of funding. The NIH and the CDC is receiving money as we speak, ramping up their vaccine program, working on therapeutics and treatments. There's almost a billion dollars in this supplemental to reach out to the world and to make sure that we are helping vulnerable nations stem the reach and the spread of coronavirus.

""What we worry about is that even if we're able to contain it here in the United States over the course of the next several months if there are massive new outbreaks in countries with weak public health systems, that may ultimately harm our ability to contain the virus here in the United States. So pandemics are global. They don't care about state boundaries. They don't care about national boundaries. And this supplemental funding bill acknowledges that the United States, as the leading public health authority in the world, has to be deployed outside our boundaries as well.

""We are sending a letter to the federal government today requesting more testing kits. We're doing that at the request of Governor Lamont, and we hope we will receive an answer very, very soon. We need the testing kits here in Connecticut. And, you know, I'm disappointed the administration didn't get to work on testing kits earlier, but we are where we are. And we're going to try to do the best with what we have.

""It's important for us to all be on the same page here in Connecticut. And so we're working hand in hand with the Governor and the rest of the congressional delegation, with the legislative leadership in Hartford to be as ready as we can here in Connecticut.

""So, I think it's probably time for us to hear from some experts. I think Dick and I are trying to defer to experts as much as we can. So we'll talk about the funding and policy response, but then when it comes to the medicine and the epidemiology, we'll hand that over to Dr. Paul Porter and then Adam Rinko, Bill Quinn from the city and Shawna Edwards in that order,"""
Democrat,Kyrsten Sinema,"Following Sinema's Urging, Treasury Department Releases Partial Coronavirus Funding for Tribal Communities","Following Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema's urging, the Treasury Department finally released $4.8 billion of the $8 billion in coronavirus relief funding allocated for Tribal communities in the CARES Act. Today's funding announcement comes over a month after Congress passed the CARES Act, and Sinema continues to call on the federal government to immediately release the full $8 billion from the Coronavirus Relief Fund to ensure Tribal governments have the resources needed during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Tribal communities in Arizona need all available resources to fight the coronavirus pandemic now. While I am glad the federal government listened to our calls and released this funding, the Treasury Department must immediately disburse the total amount of CARES Act funding to Tribal communities; lives are depending on it,"" said Sinema.  Congress designated $8 billion from the Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF) established in the CARES Act to ensure sovereign Tribal governments have the resources needed during the coronavirus pandemic. The CARES Act was passed over a month ago, yet today the Treasury Department only disbursed $4.8 billion to tribal governments. Sinema recently urged the Treasury Department and SBA to reverse course and allow Tribal gaming operations access to PPP funding. Following Sinema's letter, the federal agencies reversed course.  Sinema holds regular calls with Tribal leaders on the coronavirus outbreak in their communities and needed coronavirus relief. Sinema, along with a bipartisan and bicameral group of lawmakers, urged the administration to swiftly implement the bipartisan CARES Act law and ensure resources are deployed quickly to support Tribal communities in Arizona. Sinema also asked the administration to make a stronger effort in consulting with Tribal Nations in order to truly reduce the spread of coronavirus throughout Arizona. Following Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez's request that the non-federal cost-share portion of the FEMA-Tribal Agreement be waived, Sinema urged the Director of FEMA to waive tribal governments' portion of costs of FEMA's coronavirus response efforts to protect the health and safety of tribal communities."
Republican,Steve Daines,-9999,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, it is an honor to stand here today in  support of one of the most historic pieces of conservation legislation  in decades--some are saying 50 years. 

  The Great American Outdoors Act will have a lasting impact on  generations to come. That is why, as Montana's voice in the Senate, I  am standing here today to make the Great American Outdoors Act a  reality. 

  Over the last few days, we have seen very strong bipartisan support  both here in the Senate and around the Nation. Senators from both sides  of the aisle, representing States all across our great Nation, have  been coming down to the floor to share stories and photos and to show  support for the bill. It is a very personal piece of legislation  because we all love the outdoors. 

  At this point, plenty of us have spoken in support of this bill, but  today I want to share some quotes from Montanans who are also in  support of the Great American Outdoors Act. 

  David Brooks from Montana Trout Unlimited says:  

       As the Senate takes up the legislation this week, we are       also excited to see progress on addressing decades of       maintenance backlogs on our public lands that benefit our       wild and native fish and their habitat.  

  Speaking of trout, this picture was taken at the Yellowstone River.  The main channel is over here. There is a little side channel as well.  That is Emigrant Peak. That is in a valley called Paradise Valley. It  is appropriately named. It is south of Livingston--between Livingston  and Gardiner. If you were to come visit Yellowstone National Park, one  of the entrances is in Gardiner, and that would be on the way to  Yellowstone Park. 

  As I mentioned before, that is, in fact, where in 1979 we had our  high school homecoming dinner, and I proudly took a date in a Griswold  station wagon with some couples, and we drove down to Chico's. It is  right by where this picture was taken. There are a lot of memories when  I see a picture like that. There was a lot of fish caught as I fished  that river many, many times. I do it several times a summer. 

  Ben Horan with Mountain Bike Missoula says:  

       There is a good reason the Land and Water Conservation Fund       has enjoyed bipartisan support since the 1960s. It is just       good policy. For more than 55 years, LWCF has supported and       funded open spaces and public lands that we in Montana rely       on for our work, for our play, and for our way of life.  

  Kyle Weaver from the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation had this to say:  

       This important conservation program allowed the Rocky       Mountain Elk Foundation to complete more than 80 land       protection and access projects that conserved more than       152,000 acres of habitat for elk and other wildlife. RMEF       strongly urges Members of the Senate and House to rally       alongside Senator Daines, pass this measure, and forward it       to President Trump's desk so it can be signed into law.  

  Land Tawny with the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers said this:  

       Sportsmen and women have been the leading voices in this       effort to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund as       well as providing maintenance funding for the agencies that       manage places critical for public access and fish and       wildlife. Our public lands and our waters have traditionally       been places of refuge, of solace, and of adventure.  

  Never has this been truer than right now when we need to recenter and  get our minds right. Now is the most strategic time for investing in  these places of refuge by funding shovel-ready projects that sustain  important habitat, increase public access opportunities, and get people  back to work. 

  Mayor Bill Cole of Billings said:  

       Over the years, Billings has received almost $2 million to       fund construction repairs on our parks. The Great American       Outdoors Act will be a great help as we plan future projects       that address the backlog of maintenance needs. Parks and       trails are critical to our Western quality of life, they       attract visitors, and they support our economy.  

  The city manager of Great Falls, Greg Doyle, said this:  

       For many years, the city has utilized the LWCF       appropriations to complete a wide variety of projects. These       projects help support and develop park land and recreational       facilities for Great Falls residents and visitors.  

  Alex Kitchens with the Mystery Ranch. The Mystery Ranch--that sounds  kind of mysterious, doesn't it? They actually make some of the best  backpacks in America. In fact, when my wife and I and children get out  in the wilderness area every summer, we all are carrying Mystery Ranch  backpacks. They are some of the very best. In fact, in the early days  of this company, back in the seventies when I was going to high school  in Bozeman, I had a Kletterworks pack. Kletterworks was the precursor  to Mystery Ranch. In fact, the book bag that I then took to Montana  State University and carried my books in throughout my college  experience in Bozeman--I took that same pack to the top of Granite  Peak, our highest point in Montana, and the summit of the Grand Teton,  just south of Montana there--beautiful country outside of Jackson,  WY. It was a small pack. We went very ultralight with bivy bags, kind  of a sense of a quick up and down because of weather. We wanted to get  up there quickly on both peaks, and we made it. That was the precursor  to the Mystery Ranch, which are the packs we have today. They are  larger packs. You can carry more weight into the backcountry.  

  Alex said this: The Great American Outdoors Act is landmark  conservation to protect our public lands. The full funding of the LWCF  is a benefit to our parks and our forests at the local and State level. 

  We have Glenn Marx with the Montana Association of Land Trusts. I  will quote Glenn:  

       Passage of the Great American Outdoors Act means LWCF       funding and tremendous rural community, national park, and       outdoor recreation economic benefits for Montana and the       nation. More legislative steps to go. Let's finish the       journey.    

  I couldn't agree more, Glenn. 

  Finally, I want to highlight a letter. It is a letter signed by every  former Secretary of the Interior, from Secretary Babbitt, who served in  1993, to Montana's very own Secretary Ryan Zinke. 

  In fact, Ryan and I were Boy Staters together back in 1979. Ryan was  a junior, soon to be a senior, at Whitefish High School, and I was a  junior, soon to be senior, at Boozman High in 1979. Little did we know  when we were Boy Staters then that Ryan, after a distinguished military  career in the U.S. Navy as a Navy SEAL, would go on to be our Secretary  of the Interior. 

  The letter says this: ``The Great American Outdoors Act will help  ensure a better, brighter future for nature and for all of us.'' 

  By the way, if you look at those Secretaries, those are Secretaries  who served under Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents. 

  Needless to say, Montana has its fair share of support for the Great  American Outdoors Act, and the list of support goes on. 

  Montanans know what it takes to conserve their public lands. Ensuring  full mandatory funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund will  make sure our public lands are managed correctly and that Montanans and  Americans around the country will have better access to share public  lands. 

  Dealing with the $12 billion maintenance backlog in our national  parks will be so beneficial for the employees who are working so hard  in national parks. We are seeing record visitation levels in many of  our parks, but our employee housing in many cases is terrible-- crumbling infrastructure, wastewater treatment systems that are in  desperate need of repair and upgrades. That maintenance backlog needs  to be addressed, and that will improve the visitor experience. 

  When I think about our national parks, I think of these parks as the  office of first impression. For visitors who come to our great country  from around the world, when they visit our national parks, they leave  with a profound impression. It is what sets America apart from any  other country--our national parks, our outdoor heritage, and preserving  and protecting that for generations to come. 

  The Great American Outdoors Act will directly impact everybody who  visits, who recreates, and who enjoys our public lands. This will be  truly one of those defining moments for conservation that so many will  remember for generations to come. It is one of these laws that we will  pass, and when the President signs it, it will truly be a legacy for  future generations. It makes me smile just knowing that so many others  will be able to have our public lands to enjoy, just as my wife and I  and my children all have done and continue to do, once we pass the  Great American Outdoors Act. 

  Thank you. 

  I yield back.

Republican,John Hoeven,Hoeven: Treasury announces initial allocation from $8 billion of historic CARES Act funds to Indian Country,"Senator John Hoeven (R-ND), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs (SCIA), today issued the following statement on the announcement by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that it will allocate 60 percent of the $8 billion from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to assist tribes with COVID-19 relief efforts.

 

""We worked hard to secure these funds for tribal communities as part of the CARES Act and we appreciate Secretary Mnuchin and his team for working to distribute this initial payment of $4.8 billion in tribal relief funds, the largest ever direct federal payment to Indian Tribes,"" said Hoeven. ""I encourage both Secretary Mnuchin and Interior Secretary Bernhardt to continue their outreach with the Tribes as they work to distribute the remaining dollars within the Relief Fund. I appreciate the important work that has been completed thus far in providing direct assistance to mitigate, prevent, and respond to COVID-19 across the country. We must continue working together to respond to and defeat the coronavirus.""

 

Coronavirus Relief Fund Allocation Requirements

The CARES Act allocated $8 billion for payments to Indian Tribes. With the newly allocated funds, the CARES Act mandates that the Relief Fund dollars will be used to cover:

-Necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with respect to COVID--19;-Expenditures that were not accounted for in the most recently approved budget, as of the date of enactment of this section for the State or Tribal government; and-Expenditures incurred during the period that begins on March 1, 2020, and ends on December 30, 2020. 

In an effort to ensure tribal input was included in the distribution of relief funds, the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and the Interior held multiple consultation sessions with Indian Tribes prior to the allocation.

 

As Chairman of SCIA, Hoeven worked with his Senate colleagues, including Senators Martha McSally and Steve Daines, to ensure these relief funds were available to provide direct assistance to mitigate, prevent, and respond to the impacts of COVID-19. Hoeven recently held a video conference with North Dakota tribal leaders and Administration officials to discuss the importance of quickly implementing the CARES Act in tribal communities.

 

Under the population distribution formula released by Treasury, North Dakota Tribes will receive approximately $109 million in funds to combat COVID-19:

-Spirit Lake Nation: $12 million-Standing Rock Sioux Tribe: $21 million-MHA Nation (Three Affiliated Tribes): $17 million-Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate: $15 million-Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians: $44 million  

According to the formula released by Treasury, Indian Tribes will receive 60% of the $8 billion based on the population count under HUD's Indian Housing Block Grant Formula. Distribution of the remaining $3.2 billion will be weighted between employees the Tribe employed prior to the COVID-19 epidemic and the expenses incurred since March 2020. Treasury will be sending out further guidance on this distribution at a future date."
Democrat,Kyrsten Sinema,Sinema Highlighted Importance of Affordable Transportation in Ensuring Arizonans have Access to Health Care,"Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema today in a Senate Banking Committee hearing highlighted the importance of public transportation in ensuring Arizonans have access to affordable health care. ""Having a great doctor doesn't matter if you can't get to your appointment. Good public transit can make it easier for Arizonans of all ages and from all corners of our state to see a doctor and access essential health and wellness services,"" said Sinema. In today's Senate Banking Committee hearing, Sinema questioned transportation officials about how to strengthen and expand transit programs to help ensure all Arizonans have access to quality health care. Sinema also discussed the public-private partnerships that helped build the Tempe Streetcar in Arizona. Sinema asked officials how Congress can encourage similar public-private partnerships to support infrastructure growth."
Republican,Chuck Grassley,Executive Session,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, in the last several weeks, a lot of  information relating to the FBI's Russia investigation has been  declassified and made public. That is in large part thanks to action  taken by Attorney General Barr and action taken by Acting Director  Grenell at DNI on declassification of a lot of things that should have  been declassified a long time ago. Their acts of transparency are  finally shining a light on the dark corners of the Federal Government.  The public's business ought to be public. There is too much  overclassification in the Federal Government. Barr and Grenell are  doing what they ought to do, and I hope they keep it up. 

  In the last several weeks, we have also seen a lot of denial from  some quarters in the media about the information that has been  released. 

  Also last week, former President Obama said the rule of law is at  risk because of the Justice Department's dismissal of the Flynn case.  Contrary to what President Obama believes or the media might say, I  believe the opposite is true. The rule of law is at risk if the Federal  Government can get away with violating the Constitution to do what they  did to Lieutenant General Flynn. 

  When it comes to those violations and other misconduct by former  government officials, Obama and the mainstream media pundits all seem  to be silent all of a sudden. I have heard no comment from Mr. Obama  about the independent inspector general's findings that Andrew McCabe  lied under oath to Federal investigators multiple times or about how  Department of Justice prosecutors falsely told the court that they had  produced all Brady material to Flynn. I didn't hear them when the  Federal Government surveilled an American citizen connected to the  Trump campaign without probable cause and based on intelligence that  the FBI knew was questionable at best. There is too much silence on  something that now is so obvious. 

  Since 2017, I have aggressively pursued the Flynn investigation to  find out more about why the FBI decided to  interview Flynn, make him a subject of an investigation, and then why  the Justice Department eventually charged him. From the beginning, I  wanted to know the facts of the case, and from the beginning, none of  what I found looked right. Having done good government oversight for  over 40 years, I know a government foul-up when I see it. 

  The public knows a lot more than they did in 2017 when the news first  broke about this Flynn case. For example, we know that on January 4,  2017, the FBI wrote a closing memorandum on Flynn, who was code-named  ``Crossfire Razor'' by the FBI. That memorandum said the intelligence  community could find no derogatory information on the general. 

  On the very same day the FBI was ready to close the Flynn case, Peter  Strzok asked another FBI agent something like this: ``Hey, if you  haven't closed Razor, don't do it yet.'' So Strzok obviously had  another agenda. The case was still open at that moment, and Strzok  asked that it be kept open ``for now.'' Strzok then quickly messaged  Lisa Page, saying that Razor still happened to be open because of some  oversight and said: ``Yeah, our utter incompetence actually helps us.  20 percent of the time . . . '' 

  During the course of my oversight activities of the FBI, I have  uncovered and made public large amounts of Strzok's and Page's  messages. When reviewing all the faults and disasters of the Russia  investigation, these text messages are very, very important. They are  the free expression of these top FBI employees' mindset, unencumbered  by rules or decorum. They give us a look at what the drivers of the  Russia investigation actually believed. 

  In August 2016, just after the FBI opened the Russia investigation,  Page said: ``Trump's not ever going to become president, right?  Right?!?'' She is the one who edited Flynn's 302 summary along with  Strzok, which contradicted the original 302. Strzok responded to the  Page quote that I just gave about whether Trump would ever become  President this way: ``No. No he won't. We'll stop it.'' Their animus  towards Trump helps to explain why they cut corners and why they didn't  follow regular protocol in running their inquiry. 

  On January 5, 2017, the day after Strzok moved to keep the Flynn case  open, President Obama met with Director Comey, Deputy Attorney General  Sally Yates, Vice President Biden, and National Security Advisor Susan  Rice. At that meeting, they briefed President Obama on the Russia  investigation. It is unclear to what extent they discussed the details  of the investigation amongst each other, but given all that we know now  regarding the fake foundation to the inquiry, it is time we asked: What  did Obama and Biden know, and when did they know it? 

  During the course of my oversight, I acquired an email from Susan  Rice. She sent herself an email on Obama's last day in office, January  20, 2017. That email memorialized the alleged contents of the January  5, 2017, meeting with Obama that I previously referred to. As I noted  in 2018 when I made the email public, I found it very odd that among  her activities in the final moments of the final day of the Obama  administration, that she would write herself an email about a meeting  that happened several weeks prior about this investigation. According  to Rice, Obama wanted everything done ``by the book.'' 

  Of course, we now know that never happened. She also said, in part:  ``The President''--as in Obama--``asked Comey to inform him if anything  changes in the next few weeks that should affect how we share  classified information with the incoming team.'' 

  Then, 1 week later, on January 12, 2017, somebody in the Obama  administration leaked the Flynn-Kislyak call to the Washington Post  that, for the very first time, ignited rumors about Flynn's association  with Russians and a possible violation of the arcane Logan Act. 

  Now, wasn't this really a perfectly timed leak--one that would help  to create a fake foundation to interview Flynn? 

  Well, guess what happened. Twelve days later, on January 24, 2017,  Strzok interviewed Flynn in the White House. Prior to that interview,  Comey chose not to follow normal protocols to inform the White House  that the FBI intended to interview an employee. Now, we all know that  the FBI would normally work through the White House counsel to have  discussions for approval and who would be present at that interview. 

  You have seen it on television several times this weekend: Comey  bragging about getting away with skirting the rules. When he was asked  in a 2018 interview about how he did it, Comey said--and this is what  showed up in these last weekends:  

       I sent them--  

  Meaning he sent the FBI agents to interview.  

       I sent them. Something I probably wouldn't have done or       even gotten away with in a more organized investigation, a       more organized administration.  

  According to Comey's former assistant, Comey said: ``We just decided,  you know, screw it,'' in reference to their breaking protocol with the  White House. 

  Now, I referred to an email that said the President wanted to do this  by the book. Well, what I just described to you is hardly ``by the  book.'' Flynn was never told during this interview what he was being  secretly interrogated for, and the whole thing was done without Flynn  having an attorney present. In fact, I think I recall they even told  him he didn't need an attorney. 

  Now, we know that the FBI had no real investigative purpose to  interview Flynn. We also know, based upon FBI notes, that agents  apparently interviewed Flynn to trick him in a lie so that they could  prosecute him or get him fired. That prosecuting him or getting him  fired are very clear in some notes that we got from the FBI,  handwritten notes. 

  Keep in mind that the FBI had prepared to close this case weeks  before, except it didn't quite get closed because Strzok came in and  said: Can we keep it open--or something to that effect. 

  The FBI already had the transcript of the Flynn-Ambassador Kislyak  call. They knew exactly what was discussed. So what was the point of  interviewing Flynn if they already had the transcript? 

  Well, lucky for Strzok, the FBI had not technically closed the Flynn  case. So he figured yet they could lay a trap for Flynn, and they did  lay a trap. 

  In doing so, they didn't warn him that he was under investigation.  They went around the Justice Department, and I made it very clear how  they bypassed the White House on interview protocols, because Comey was  bragging on television about that. 

  Under Comey's leadership, the FBI abused government powers in ways  that our Founders and Framers feared most, because they had had enough  of George III. They weren't going to let it happen again in the United  States. That is why they wrote the Constitution the way they did. 

  The Russia investigation, in other words, is a textbook example of  what not to do. At every step of the investigation, the government  sought evidence to advance it, never got the evidence that they needed  to advance it, and advanced the investigation anyway. 

  That is pretty clearly an abuse of power. 

  Let's recall that Comey also leaked his memos of his private  discussions with President Trump to get the special counsel, Mueller,  appointed. Comey is pretty smart. He had a plan. It worked. That plan  worked to get Mueller appointed. Mueller did his work for 2 years, and  it cost the taxpayers $30 million. In the end, Mueller found no  collusion and no obstruction, which is exactly the same information  that the House Intelligence Committee's 50-plus depositions told us.  Those were done way back--not way back but a little way back--in 2017.  Mueller finished his job in 2019. That is more than $30 million just to  reinvent the wheel. 

  Now, with respect to Comey, I think it is monumentally important to  point out a piece of his testimony from 2017, before the House  Intelligence Committee. Comey said the following:  

       . . . we had an open counterintelligence investigation on       Mr. Flynn, and it had been open since the summertime, and we       were very close to closing it. In fact, I had--I think I       had authorized it to be closed at the end of December,       beginning of January.  

  Now, Comey leaked his memos so that the public would know the  President allegedly said to him that he  hoped Comey would let the whole Flynn thing go. That is what the hook  was to getting a special counsel appointed. 

  Not once in Comey's memos did he mention that by the time that  conversation occurred, he had already authorized the Flynn case to be  closed. Don't you think that is a material fact that would put the  proper context on his interactions with Trump? 

  Attorney General Barr is exactly right. What the FBI did to Flynn  cannot be justified by any angle of review. What the FBI did is to  flout the rules, the law, and the Constitution. Entrapment is  unconstitutional. 

  That is where the outrage ought to be--not on the dismissal of the  case but on facts that the case was brought in the first place and a  good man's life was destroyed. 

  Mueller had all these facts. He had documents. He had the Brady  material. He had the FBI notes and contradictory 302 summaries. He had  the emails. He had all the information that showed Flynn was set up,  targeted, and pressured to plead guilty in a secret side deal between  the Mueller team and his former lawyers, only because he was running  out of money and the government was coming after his son. 

  Flynn did what maybe a lot of people would do when your family is at  stake. Flynn did what he did to save his family from financial ruin and  his son from reputational ruin. He did what any father would do for his  family. 

  If it can happen to Flynn, it can happen to you. It can happen to any  American, and, in some ways, this also happened to a person named  Carter Page and with the illegal surveillance on Carter Page. 

  You know, in this business of self-government and this business of  constitutional safeguards, we still are in a constant battle between  liberty and tyranny, and we have seen some tyranny in regard to Flynn.  My fellow Americans, let's use the Russia investigation and all of its  shortcomings to forever guard against the tyranny of the Federal  Government. 

  On one last thing, people are constantly phoning our offices and  wanting to know when all the people who did the injustice to Flynn are  going to be prosecuted, because they think there are two standards of  justice. You know, they announced yesterday that McCabe isn't going to  be prosecuted. But Flynn was entrapped to be prosecuted, and how wrong  that is. A lot of people want justice brought to the people who did the  injustice, and I think they ought to be prosecuted. 

  But even more important than prosecuting him, it is about time that  these facts get out so the public knows the injustice that is going on  within our government, within the FBI, in the highest levels of the  FBI. 

  We aren't finding fault with the people in the FBI who are doing what  needs to be done to bring law and order to our country, but when we  have these unusual, illegal, unconstitutional, corrupt things that  happened to Flynn, it ought to wake up the American people. It ought to  wake up those of us in government to make sure it never happens again.

Democrat,Dianne Feinstein,"Rubio, Scott, Colleagues Introduce Bipartisan, Bicameral American Space Commerce Act","U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Rick Scott (R-FL), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) introduced the bipartisan, bicameral American Space Commerce Act of 2020. At a time when the U.S. has steadily decreased its dependence on foreign rockets and launch infrastructure, the American Space Commerce Act would bolster U.S. leadership in the space industry, enhance public-private partnerships with American companies, and further increase U.S. innovation. U.S. Representatives Bill Posey (R-FL) and Charlie Crist (D-FL) introduced the House version of the legislation (H.R. 6783). The legislation is supported by the Aerospace Industry Association, Blue Origin, Boeing, Space Florida, SpaceX, and ULA. Last year, Rubio wrote an op-ed that highlighted America's space leadership and how ""[o]ur commercial space industry is thriving, and its unique partnership with NASA is producing innovation and technological advances once unthinkable.""  ""American leadership in the space industry has, and will continue to be, a pillar of our nation's economy that every American should take pride in,"" Rubio said. ""The American Space Commerce Act will strengthen the space industry's public-private partnerships with American companies and ensure that our nation continues to be a global industry leader. Our nation's history is made brighter by our incredible achievements in space. I am proud that Florida's Space Coast continues to be America's gateway to the stars, including this past weekend when NASA and SpaceX successfully launched the first American astronauts from American soil on an American rocket to the International Space Station in almost a decade."" ""Our nation is competing against known adversaries like Communist China and Russia in the space launch industry, and we must put American interests and national security first,"" Scott said. ""I'm proud to sponsor the American Space Commerce Act to enhance our nation's self-reliance in the space industry, prioritize American businesses, and ensure our nation remains a leader in space exploration."" ""Following SpaceX and NASA's successful and historic launch just last week, it's important we foster a tax environment where the U.S. space industry can charter the next generation of space exploration,"" Cruz said. ""By allowing full expensing for space launch property, the American Space Commerce Act will strengthen America's renewed leadership in space and bolster our commercial partners that are critical to that effort as we continue to explore the final frontier."" ""This past weekend, Americans were thrilled to see the launch of two American astronauts from U.S. soil for the first time since 2011,"" Wicker said. ""This legislation would support investments in our domestic space industry at a critical time and ensure American companies are competing on a level playing field with their international rivals. I hope that with continued investment our nation's space capabilities will remain the envy of the world.""  ""Last week, SpaceX partnered with NASA to send Americans to space from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade,"" Feinstein said. ""It was the first manned U.S. launch from a commercial space provider.  This and other public-private partnerships are essential to our future space endeavors, and they need to be supported. I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing this bill to extend the tax deduction allowance for domestic space launches so we can continue to foster the growth of our domestic commercial space industry in California and other states."" Specifically, the American Space Commerce Act of 2020: Extends the additional allowance of depreciation deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) for qualified domestic space launch property from December 31, 2023 until January 1, 2033 if the recovery period is less than twenty years; Defines ""qualified space launch property"" as a space transportation vehicle or payload that is launched from the United States, or other property or equipment placed in service for the purpose of facilitating a space launch from the United States. Only considers a spacecraft launched from the United States if the spacecraft is substantially manufactured in the United States or launched from an aircraft on a flight that originated from the United States. Background: America has steadily decreased its dependence on foreign rockets and launch infrastructure over the last few years. Last month, NASA and SpaceX completed the first successful launch of an American astronaut from American soil on an American rocket to the International Space Station in almost a decade. This is made possible in part by public-private partnerships with American companies. The American Space Commerce Act of 2020 would extend the full expensing treatment, currently available to all businesses under the TCJA through 2022, to ""qualified domestic space launch property"" for an additional ten years beyond current law. According to the U.S.- China Economic and Security Review Commission: ""Beijing is executing a long-term strategy to exploit U.S. technology, talent, and capital to build up its military space and counterspace programs and advance its strategic interests at the expense of the United States. China's zero-sum pursuit of space superiority harms U.S. economic competitiveness, weakens U.S. military advantages, and undermines strategic stability."" China is currently on track to complete most of its space exploration goals established by its 13th five-year plan, set in 2016. These goals include science satellites, deep space exploration, China's first uncrewed Mars mission, Earth observation and navigation, new space vehicles, and heavy-lift rockets."
Democrat,Bernard Sanders,Senator Sanders Introduces Bill to Protect Graduate Student Workers' Right to Unionize,"Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced the Respect GraduateStudent Workers Act today, which prohibits the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) from enacting a proposed rule which would strip graduate student workers' right to unionize. 

Since 2017, the Trump Administration has unleashed a wave of attacks on workplace rights. Most recently, the NLRB proposed a rule to strip graduate student workers' ability to unionize at their employing institutions, which would immediately impact nearly 58,000 graduate assistants and would jeopardize the rights of the more than 1.5 million graduate students enrolled in the country's private universities. 

""For far too long, the trend in our higher education system has been going in the wrong direction: longer hours, lower pay, weaker job security, and more debt,"" said Sen. Sanders. ""Too many Americans working within this field have to take on two or even three jobs just to get by. Stronger unions and worker protections are a key part of solving this crisis in our colleges and universities. But instead of protecting graduate workers, the National Labor Relations Board is trying to strip them of their rights. I am proud to join Representative Pocan on this effort to push back against yet another assault by the Trump administration against working people."" 

""Graduate workers are a vital part of teaching and research in colleges and universities and should have an equal voice in their workplace,"" said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), who introduced the House version of the bill. ""I am proud to work alongside Senator Sanders in the fight to protect graduate workers against the Trump administration. Stripping graduate students of their rights to unionize is a blatant attempt to profit off the backs of workers without giving them their due. Every worker in every industry deserves the right to form a union, because all workers deserve respect in the workplace."" 

Colleges and universities increasingly rely on graduate students for research, teaching, assisting professors, and other essential work as they pursue their advanced degrees. Collective bargaining rights for graduate students allows for a legally binding contract for wages, benefits, and working conditions, including paid time off and a safe working environment. 

The legislation is endorsed by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), United Steelworkers (USW), and the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). 

Senator Sanders has previously voiced his support for graduate workers' efforts to unionize at Boston College, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Marquette, New School, St. Petersburg College, University of Chicago, University of Pittsburgh, Valencia College, Vanderbilt, and others."
Republican,Lamar Alexander,"Alexander: Senate ""Pulls Out All the Stops"" to Help Increase COVID-19 Testing","U.S. Senate health committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today said that the Senate has ""pulled out all the stops"" to help increase COVID-19 diagnostic testing in order to contain the disease and give Americans the confidence to go back to work and back to school.

Senator Alexander made his remarks after the Senate passed legislation containing provisions he co-authored with Senate health appropriations committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) that will provide an additional $25 billion for COVID-19 testing, including funding a competitive ""shark tank"" designed to create brand new technologies to produce tens of millions of diagnostic tests by August.

""There is no safe path forward to combat the novel coronavirus without adequate testing,"" Alexander said. ""To contain COVID-19 and persuade Americans to leave their homes and return to work and school, the United States will need tens of millions of diagnostic tests. We should squeeze every test possible out of current technologies, but we need tens of millions more to really get a handle on how far and wide this disease has spread.""

Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the coronavirus task force, says there are now 1 million tests available weekly; by mid-June, there will be 2 million to 2½ million available.

""That is impressive,"" Alexander said, ""but not nearly enough. This demand will only grow as the country goes back to work and some 100,000 public schools and more than 5,000 colleges reopen, we hope, in August.""

 ""We now have a funded competitive ""shark tank' -- much like the reality-TV show about entrepreneurs, but this time utilizing the capacities of government itself, in coordination with the private sector -- to pull out all the stops and create new technologies designed to produce tens of millions of diagnostic tests by August. If there's a bold idea out there that will work, this bill will help make sure the funding is available to get these tests in the hands of health care providers quickly. We also should improve serologic tests to determine whether someone already has had the disease and has now created the necessary immunity to hopefully fight off the disease in the future.

""The first place to find these technologies is at the National Institutes of Health, where two dozen early-stage testing concepts are under development. Some utilize CRISPR gene-editing technology. At least one allows you to use your cellphone to photograph your test swab result and send it to a doctor. Several may incorporate wearable technology. By incorporating a shark tank environment in government research, we can more quickly develop the necessary technologies to get more tests into circulation. While there is a risk of failure with any research -- in science, success is not guaranteed -- we also could produce the one mighty great white shark that will help us combat this disease.""

Alexander said that last month, Congress gave BARDA, NIH and other agencies up to $38 billion for testing, treatments and vaccines to fight this virus. This new funding will advance even further other research, and give money to states to buy testing equipment, improve data reporting, conduct tests and operate testing centers, and implement contact tracing to identify those who've come in contact with sick people so they, too, can quarantine themselves -- instead of the rest of us quarantining ourselves.

Congress has now provided $63 billion to date in order to help develop tests, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19.

The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act includes $25 billion in funding to improve diagnostic and immunity testing for COVID-19 including:

$11 billion for states$825 million for Community Health Centers and rural clinics$1.8 billion for NIH, some of which will support a new ""shark tank""$1 billion for BARDA$22 million for FDA$1 billion for CDC"
Republican,James Lankford,Senator Lankford Introduces Bill to Clarify Federal Guidance Authority,"Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today introduced the Guidance Clarity Act, which clarifies that federal agency guidance documents are not legally binding. The bill requires a brief statement at the beginning of all federal agency guidance documents that clearly tells the reader the guidance does not have the force and effect of law.

""Federal agencies have previously attempted to use their guidance documents to avoid the formal rulemaking process and have treated guidance documents as if they are legally binding,"" said Lankford. ""With more and more bureaucracy to wade through on a daily basis, it is sometimes difficult for Americans to discern when a federal directive is a suggestion or a legal requirement. This good-government bill clarifies that guidance documents are agencies' interpretations of how to comply with federal law, but they are not law. This bill does not change policy; it simply recognizes what courts have long held: guidance is not legally binding.""

In October 2019 the White House issued Executive Order (EO) 13891 to require transparency in how federal guidance is issued and to ensure federal agencies are not using guidance documents as vehicles for creating law out of thin air. The White House clarified how the EO should be implemented including deadlines for agencies in a follow-up memorandum. The Guidance Clarity Act would codify in law a long-held legal policy and the principles of the EO and would clarify what guidance is and what it isn't. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO) introduced the House companion bill in November 2019.

Lankford serves as Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management."
Republican,Kevin Cramer,Sen. Cramer Statement on the Energy Department Awarding Funds for Project Tundra,"U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee member, issued the following statement on the U.S. Department of Energy announcing $17 million in funding for the University of North Dakota's (UND) Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) for Project Tundra today:

""The Energy Department is continuing the Trump Administration's work to bolster American energy dominance and support carbon capture projects in North Dakota. I thank Secretary Brouillette for delivering these funds for Project Tundra and supporting our energy efforts. This is a positive step as we await the Administration finally completing its final rules on the 45Q tax credit, allowing more producers and utilities to confidently invest in carbon capture projects.""

Today's announcement came as part of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Fossil Energy announcing $131 million for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) research and development (R&D) projects nationwide. Project Tundra is a project led by Minnkota Power Cooperative, along with UND's EERC, to retrofit the Milton R. Young Station with carbon capture technology."
Republican,Ben Sasse,"Cyberspace Solarium Commission Calls for ""Speed and Agility"" in Comprehensive Report to Improve American Cyber Defenses","U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) and Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), co-chairs of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC), today announced the release of the CSC's report on how to best protect the nation's critical infrastructure from a cyberattack of significant consequence. In today's report, the CSC lays out a comprehensive strategy to restore deterrence in cyberspace and provides extensive policy and legislative actions to enable this strategy. The report recommends a strategy of ""layered cyber deterrence"" that seeks to: shape behavior in cyberspace, deny benefits to adversaries who would seek to exploit cyberspace to their advantage, and impose costs against those who would nonetheless choose to target America in and through cyberspace.

The report details the extensive threats to our security, from nation states like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, but also from non-state actors like criminals and extremist groups. It highlights the unique challenges in defending the nation's cyberspace, which is largely owned and operated by the private sector, and is intended to provide a path forward to building the robust public-private collaboration that is needed to establish effective cybersecurity. Unlike the previous model of many major policy reports, the Commission's recommendations serve more as a roadmap for the U.S. to improve its posture in cyberspace. Major recommendations contained in the report include establishing a Senate-approved National Cyber Director to lead the federal government's work in cyberspace, the development of a continuity of the economy plan to ensure the rapid recovery of national critical functions following a major disruptive cyber event, and the creation of House Permanent Select and Senate Select Committees on Cyber to provide integrated oversight of the federal government's cybersecurity efforts.

In recent weeks, Commissioners have briefed Congressional leaders and members, and the staffs of relevant committees. In the coming months the Commissioners will work with Congress, the Administration, and private sector partners to implement the CSC's recommendations. Congressional hearings are already on the calendar for the Commission to share its views with relevant Committees in both chambers.

The full report can be read HERE.

""The reality is that we are dangerously insecure in cyber,'' write King and Gallagher in the report's Chairmen's Letter. ""Your entire life--your paycheck, your health care, your electricity--increasingly relies on networks of digital devices that store, process, and analyze data. These networks are vulnerable, if not already compromised. Our country has lost hundreds of billions of dollars to nation-state-sponsored intellectual property theft using cyber espionage. A major cyberattack on the nation's critical infrastructure and economic system would create chaos and lasting damage exceeding that wreaked by fires in California, floods in the Midwest, and hurricanes in the Southeast.""

""We didn't solve everything in this report. We didn't even agree on everything,"" the Chairmen continue. ""Yet every single Commissioner was willing to make compromises in the course of our work because we were all united by the recognition that the status quo is not getting the job done. The status quo is inviting attacks on America every second of every day. The status quo is a slow surrender of American power and responsibility. We all want that to stop.""

The report includes more than 75 specific recommendations, organized into 6 pillars. These include:

1. Reform the U.S. Government's Structure and Organization for Cyberspace. The U.S government's existing infrastructure is not up-to-date to meet the opportunities and challenges presented in cyberspace, with fractured responsibilities slowing our response in a domain that is constantly shifting. To that end, recommendations in this pillar include:

Congress should create House Permanent Select and Senate Select Committees on Cyber to provide integrated oversight of the federal government's cybersecurity efforts.Congress should establish a Senate-confirmed National Cyber Director, and an accompanying office, within the Executive Office of the President. The position will serve as the President's principal advisor for cyber issues and lead national-level coordination of cybersecurity strategy and policy, both within government and with the private sector.Congress should strengthen the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in its mission to ensure the national resilience of critical infrastructure, promote a more secure cyber ecosystem, and serve as the central coordinating element to support and integrate federal, state and local, and private-sector cybersecurity efforts.2. Strengthen Norms and Non-Military Tools. A system of norms, built through international engagement and cooperation, promotes responsible behavior and dissuades adversaries from using cyber operations to undermine our nation's interests. The United States can strengthen the current system of cyber norms by using non-military tools, including law enforcement actions, sanctions, diplomacy, and information sharing, to more effectively persuade states to conform to these norms and punish those who violate them.  Recommendations include:

Congress should create an Assistant Secretary of State in the Department of State, with a new Bureau of Cyberspace Security and Emerging Technologies, who will lead the U.S. government's effort to develop and reinforce international norms in cyberspace.3. Promote National Resilience. Resilience -- the capacity to withstand and quickly recover from attacks -- is key to denying adversaries the benefits of their operations and reducing confidence in their ability to achieve their strategic ends. We must improve our national resilience, in both the public and private sectors, and enhance our ability to accurately identify and mitigate risk across all elements of critical infrastructure. Recommendations include:

Congress should direct the U.S. government to develop and maintain Continuity of the Economy planning in consultation with the private sector to ensure continuous operation of critical functions of the economy in the event of a significant cyber disruption.Congress should codify a Cyber State of Distress tied to a Cyber Response and Recovery Fund to ensure sufficient resources and capacity to respond rapidly to significant cyber incidents.The U.S. government should promote digital literacy, civics education, and public awareness to build societal resilience to foreign, malign cyber-enabled information operations.4. Reshape the Cyber Ecosystem Toward Greater Security. Raising the baseline level of security across the cyber ecosystem will, over time, reduce the frequency, scale, and scope of our adversaries' cyber operations. This pillar requires partnering with the private sector and adjusting incentives to produce positive outcomes. Recommendations include:

Congress should establish and fund a National Cybersecurity Certification and Labeling Authority empowered to establish and manage a program on voluntary security certifications and labeling of information and communication technology products (an ""Underwriters Laboratories"" for cybersecurity products).Congress should establish a Bureau of Cyber Statistics charged with collecting and providing statistical data on cybersecurity and the cyber ecosystem to inform policy making and government programs.Congress should pass a national data security and privacy protection law establishing and standardizing requirements for the collection, retention, and sharing of user data.5. Operationalize Cybersecurity Collaboration with the Private Sector. Unlike in other physical domains, in cyberspace the government is often not the primary actor. As a result, it must support and enable the private sector efforts to understand and confront threats. Recommendations include:

Congress should codify the concept of ""systemically important critical infrastructure"", whereby entities responsible for systems and assets that underpin national critical functions are ensured the full support of the U.S. government and shoulder additional security requirements befitting their unique status and importance.Congress should direct the executive branch to elevate and strengthen a public-private, integrated cyber center in CISA to support its critical infrastructure security and resilience mission and to conduct a one-year, comprehensive systems analysis review of federal cyber and cybersecurity centers.6. Preserve and Employ the Military Instrument of Power -- And All Other Options to Deter Cyberattacks at Any Level. Cyberspace is already an arena of strategic competition, where states project power, protect their interests, and punish their adversaries. The U.S. must defend forward to limit malicious behavior by our adversaries below the level of armed attack, deter conflict, and, if necessary, prevail by employing the full spectrum of its capabilities. To achieve these goals, the U.S. must demonstrate its ability to impose costs and establish a clear declaratory policy that signals to rival states the costs and risks associated with attacking the U.S. in cyberspace. Recommendations include:

Congress should direct the Department of Defense to conduct a force structure assessment of the Cyber Mission Force to ensure that the United States has the appropriate force structure and capabilities in light of growing mission requirements and increasing expectations, in both scope and scale.Congress should direct the Department of Defense to conduct a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment of all segments of the nuclear control systems and continually assess weapon systems' cyber vulnerabilities.The Cyberspace Solarium Commission was established by statute in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and officially launched in April 2019. Over the last 11 months the Commissioners convened 29 times, and the Staff conducted more than 300 engagements, drawing upon the expertise of corporate leaders, federal, state and local officials, academics, and cybersecurity experts. The goal of this engagement was to understand America's posture in cyberspace and find opportunities to improve our national preparedness to defend ourselves against cyberattacks.

In addition to Senator King and Representative Gallagher, the Commissioners included Senator Ben Sasse (R-Neb.); Congressman Jim Langevin (D-R.I.); Frank Cilluffo, Director of the McCrary Institute for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Security at Auburn University; Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and CEO of the Southern Company; Chris Inglis, Professor of Cybersecurity Studies at U.S. Naval Academy and former Deputy Director of the National Security Agency; Patrick Murphy, Former Congressman and former Under Secretary of the Army; Samantha Ravich, Vice Chair of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board and former principal deputy National Security Advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney; Suzanne Spaulding, Senior Adviser for Homeland Security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former Under Secretary of National Protection and Programs Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security; Christopher Wray, Federal Bureau of Investigation; David Norquist, Department of Defense; David Pekoske, Department of Homeland Security; and Andrew Hallman, Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

""Warning lights have been blinking for a long time,"" said Senator Sasse. ""China and Russia have attacked the United States in cyberspace, and Washington has been caught flat footed without a cyber doctrine. This report lays out a vision for defending the world's most advanced digital society through a strategy of layered cyber deterrence. There are a lot of recommendations in here -- some of them are great and some of them need more work. This report is the beginning, not the end. Now, it's time to execute.""

""The cybersecurity threats facing our nation have never been more urgent, and they are poised only to grow,"" said Congressman Langevin, co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus. ""In my more than a decade working on cybersecurity issues, I have never felt more optimistic about our path forward than I do with the release of the Solarium report. We have a long way to go as a nation to close our aperture of vulnerability in cyberspace. But the strategy we lay out today will make us much more secure if we have the political will to execute it. I sincerely thank my fellow commissioners, particularly our steadfast co-chairs Senator King and Congressman Gallagher, for their immense dedication to this project, and I thank Speaker Pelosi for giving me this opportunity to serve.""

The CSC was established in the 2019 NDAA in the spirit of the original Project Solarium convened by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. The original Solarium was created to develop a consensus strategy to counter the Soviet Union as it was threatening the United States and its allies in the early days of the Cold War. This work contributed to the strategies that guided the United States through the Cold War ending with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The newest iteration of the Solarium seeks to create a path forward that will guide the United States through a new age of warfare."
Democrat,Maria Cantwell,Cantwell Announces $587K Grant for Kitsap County Shipyard,"U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, announced today that SAFE Boats International (SBI) -- a shipyard in Kitsap County -- will receive $587,035 in funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation's 2020 MARAD Small Shipyards Grant program. The funding will help SBI upgrade equipment at its shipyard to allow the company to modernize and increase capacity.

""With grant funding, SAFE Boats International will continue to modernize and expand, creating new jobs and continuing its delivery of state-of-the-art, reliable vessels,"" Senator Cantwell wrote in a letter of support for the shipyard's grant application in February 2020.

SBI is the leading maritime employer and one of the largest private employers in Kitsap County, with more than 250 employees. The shipyard is an important supplier for the U.S. military and law enforcement agencies."
Republican,Mitch McConnell,Coronavirus,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate is back for its second week  in session, and we have more important work to do for the American  people. 

  While our Nation fights the coronavirus pandemic, many of our fellow  Americans have been taking new safety precautions but continue to show  up to perform essential work. Because of delivery drivers and grocery  clerks, families can keep food on their shelves. Because of utility  workers, people hunkered down at home have power. Because of  pharmacists manning their counters, Americans have been able to keep  getting the medicines they need so this health crisis does not compound  itself. Then, of course, there has been the selfless work of so many  doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. 

  Frankly, even the word ``essential'' does not do full justice to all  the new American heroes we have met these past weeks. 

  In my home State of Kentucky, we met people like Leilani Krause. She  is a 30-year nursing veteran who now oversees care at a senior living  facility in Louisville. A few weeks ago, she herself contracted the  coronavirus. Even as she stayed home to recover, she never stopped  working. She still did all she could to coordinate her patients' care  over video calls. As soon as she  felt better and doctors gave her the all-clear, she checked right back  into work right on the frontlines. 

  I want to thank all of my Senate colleagues as we continue to perform  our essential responsibilities to serve citizens like Miss Krause and  so many other American heroes all across our country. Of course, much  of the work before us relates to the pandemic itself. Our committees of  jurisdiction are attacking COVID-19 and its effects from every angle. 

  This week, Chairman Alexander and our colleagues on the HELP  Committee will hold a major hearing on smart and safe ways for  Americans to get back to work and back to school. They will hear expert  testimony from the very top leaders: Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield, Dr. Hahn,  and Admiral Giroir from HHS. 

  Chairman Crapo and the Banking Committee will hear from  representatives from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC on financial  regulation. Obviously, that is an essential topic as the government  continues to push out billions and billions of dollars in emergency  liquidity following the CARES Act. 

  With huge numbers of Americans working, teaching, and learning from  home and with telemedicine more important than ever, the Commerce  Committee will hear from experts about access to broadband internet  during the crisis. 

  The Judiciary Committee will hold an important hearing on issues of  legal liability during this unprecedented time. It is crucial that as  we continue to fight the pandemic itself, we ensure it is not followed  up by a second job-killing epidemic of frivolous lawsuits. This would  be just about the worst time in living memory to let trial lawyers line  their pockets at the expense of the rest of our country. The Senate is  going to play a strong role in ensuring that does not happen. 

  While our committees are working away, here on the floor, we will  start this week by confirming two more qualified nominees to important  posts that should not remain empty at this time. We will begin with  Brian Montgomery of Texas, named by President Trump to serve as Deputy  Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Then we will turn to Troy  Edgar of California to be Chief Financial Officer at the Department of  Homeland Security. 

  I understand some of my distinguished Democratic colleagues complain  that the full Senate should not have to spend more time on these sorts  of uncontroversial executive branch nominees. I agree. But as long as  their own Democratic leadership continues to hold important posts open  for as long as possible in order to just spite the White House, as long  as the minority continues to break from longstanding Senate precedent  to obstruct even the least controversial nominees, then, frankly, they  will have to continue to show up and vote on them. The floor votes they  say they dislike are the direct result of their own tactics. 

  We are also going to take up important legislation this week. While  COVID-19 rightly dominates headlines around the world, the United  States of America also faced many serious threats before this virus  began to spread, and they are still with us today. 

  Later this week, we will turn back to reauthorizing important  authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This is  urgent because the House refused to take up the Senate's short-term  extension of important counterterrorism and counterintelligence  authorities before they left town. House Democrats let these tools  expire, so we must act quickly to clean up their mess and renew these  authorities, which our government needs to fight terrorists and check  the agents of China and Russia. 

  The bipartisan bill we will take up was negotiated exhaustively by  House Republicans and the Attorney General of the United States.  Determined advocates for reform after the shameful abuses of 2016 sat  down with determined defenders of the good parts of these tools, and  they hammered out a strong compromise. The legislation will introduce  more daylight and more accountability into the FISA process where  appropriate, but it will ensure that the embarrassments of 2016 do not  jeopardize these essential national security tools altogether. 

  I hope the Senate will be able to dispatch the amendments that we  will consider and pass this important legislation on a bipartisan basis  to keep the American people safe.

Republican,Steve Daines,Daines Introduces Bill to Require Insurance Companies to Cover COVID-19 Vaccines,"U.S. Senator Steve Daines today introduced legislation to require private health insurance plans to cover treatments or vaccines for the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, with no cost sharing. Once a vaccine is available for coronavirus, this critical legislation will ensure it is available to Montanans and Americans across the country as soon as possible.

""This bipartisan bill mitigates the coronavirus outbreak by ensuring that folks have access to testing and vaccines without costs,"" Daines said. ""Montana families need access to these important preventive services, and financial barriers should not stand in the way during this national emergency.""

Under the Affordable Care Act, private health plans are required to cover preventive services that receive a rating of A or B by the United States Preventive Health Services Task Force (USPSTF) and immunizations recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) with no cost sharing.

The Rapid Coverage for Coronavirus Vaccines Act would require private insurance plans to cover, with no cost sharing, any coronavirus treatment or vaccine that gets an A or B rating by the USPSTF or is recommended by ACIP no later than 15 business days after the recommendation to ensure Americans receive timely coverage.

Background:   

Daines has been leading the efforts in Congress to respond to the coronavirus outbreak impacting the country.    

Three weeks ago, Daines brought his proposal and ideas to President Trump at a meeting in the White House.    

On March 17th, 2020, Daines announced the Trump administration will be expanding access to Medicare telehealth services during the coronavirus outbreak.

On March 17th, 2020, Daines called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) to enable thousands of federal civil servants, who have experience with rapid emergency response, to assist rural communities that are increasingly overwhelmed by the challenge of responding to the Coronavirus outbreak.   

On March 17th, 2020, Daines announced the Small Business Administration (SBA) declared that Flathead, Gallatin, Missoula, Sheridan, Silver Bow, Wheatland, Beaverhead, Broadwater, Daniels, Deer Lodge, Fergus, Glacier,  Golden Valley, Granite, Jefferson, Judith Basin, Lake, Lewis and Clark, Lincoln, Madison, Meagher, Mineral, Park, Pondera, Powell, Ravalli, Roosevelt, Sanders, Sweet Grass, and Teton counties will be eligible to apply for additional funding under the SBA's Economic Injury Disaster Declaration.

On March 17th, 2020, Daines introduced a bipartisan bill that directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to delay enforcement of REAL ID for at least one year in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Daines has been proactively working with the Trump administration on a delay of REAL ID for Montana.

On March 17th, 2020, Daines unveiled three more major proposals that will help protect Montana's workers, families, first responders and small businesses during the coronavirus outbreak.

On March 16th, 2020, Daines announced that the Senate passed his bipartisan bill that protects veterans and their dependents from losing GI Bill education benefits during the Coronavirus outbreak while they take part in online classes.

On March 16th, 2020, Daines announced $4.5 million awarded to Montana to help support the coronavirus response and protect public health. 

On March 16th, 2020, Daines urged President Trump to ensure Montana tribal communities have access to federal assistance during coronavirus outbreak.

On March 14th, 2020, Daines urged Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Azar and the Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Gaynor to ensure Indian Health Service (IHS) has the resources needed to provide coronavirus testing for tribal communities.

On March 13th, 2020, Daines issued a statement yesterday on President Trump declaring a national emergency for coronavirus.

On March 12th, 2020, Daines introduced bipartisan legislation to provide disaster unemployment assistance to people who are unable to work due to the current coronavirus outbreak. Assistance would be available to individuals, including self-employed individuals and independent contractors, who are sick, quarantined, furloughed, or whose family circumstances keep them from working or reduce their pay as a result of the coronavirus outbreak or government containment efforts.

On March 9th, 2020, Daines unveiled a slate of proposals and priorities he's working to advance that will help protect Montana families and their finances during the Coronavirus outbreak including paid leave, temporarily waiving payroll taxes, providing relief from tariffs, and ensuring access to affordable testing.

On March 9th, 2020, Daines sent a letter urging the Trump administration to take swift action to make testing for the Coronavirus affordable.

The following day the IRS immediately announced it would adopt Daines' proposal to remove financial barriers to testing and treatment for the Coronavirus by allowing high deductible health plans to cover Coronavirus-related testing and treatment before a patient has met their deductible.   

Congress passed the Coronavirus emergency supplemental earlier this month which included $8.3 billion to combat this crisis, including nearly $1 billion for state and local preparedness and response."
Democrat,Sherrod Brown,"Letter to the Hon. Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the Dept. of the Treasury, and the Hon. Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System - Tillis Calls for Additional Measures to Ease Borrowing Costs for State and Local Governments Fighting COVID-19","Dear Chairman Powell and Secretary Mnuchin:

Thank you for your work to help stabilize the U.S. economy during this unprecedented time. We appreciate the steps the Treasury and Federal Reserve have taken to provide short-term cash flow support to state and local governments facing tax collection delays and unforeseen emergency expenditures. We write to encourage the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to take further action to stabilize the municipal bond market to ensure state and local governments have access to needed medium- and long-term financing.

State and local governments are on the frontlines in the fight against COVID-19. These entities are quickly deploying desperately-needed funds to hospitals, public health departments, nursing homes, water and power utilities, public transit, and other essential services. At the same time, business closures and rising unemployment are expected to lead to significant revenue declines for nearly every state and local government in the country. In fact, the economic upheaval has already led some cities and states to furlough or lay off public workers. This dynamic will become more widespread as the pandemic further weakens state and local finances. Ultimately, a retrenchment of state and local government spending will pose a grave threat to the Federal Reserve's goal of maximum employment.

Consequently, the municipal bond market has been under extraordinary stress. New bond issuances have declined drastically. Yields compared to U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturity have skyrocketed. Investors in the secondary market have withdrawn their funds at record speed. Such disarray in the market will only make it more difficult for states and cities to finance the economic recovery.

Your effort to address the immediate challenges through the Municipal Liquidity Facility is a sensible and necessary first step. However, to enhance state and local governments' continued ability to finance the delivery of key public services for the COVID-19 health emergency and rebuild our economy, the Treasury and Federal Reserve must also ensure sufficient access to medium- and long-term capital for state and local governments. The authority provided under Section 4003 of the CARES Act enables Treasury and the Federal Reserve to design a program that can support all types of issuers and credits. Establishing a facility to purchase municipal bonds from issuers and in the secondary market across all points of the yield curve would ensure state and local governments across the country can meet their financing needs as they respond to the health crisis and lay the foundation for future economic growth.

Thank you for your dedication to this issue and we look forward to your support of our state and local governments in our joint fight against COVID-19."
Republican,John Hoeven,Hoeven Statement After Senate Vote on War Powers Resolutions,"Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee, today released the following statement after the U.S. Senate vote on the Iran War Powers resolution: 

 ""I do not support this resolution because I think it undermines our nation's maximum pressure campaign on Iran, including diplomatic, economic and military pressure. I believe it sends the wrong message to Iranian leaders that the U.S. is relieving, rather than increasing, pressure on the regime, particularly in the context of widespread anti-government protests in Iran."""
