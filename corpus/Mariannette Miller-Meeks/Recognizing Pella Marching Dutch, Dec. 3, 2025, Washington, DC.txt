Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Pella  Marching Dutch for their outstanding 2025 season and their well-earned  invitation to perform at the celebration of our Nation's 250th birthday  in Washington, D.C., next year.

This remarkable ensemble consists of 226 students who represented  their community with excellent success, competing across multiple  prestigious competitions. The Marching Dutch delivered their strongest  performance at the Band of America Regional Competition, where they  claimed first place in Class 2A and earned the Outstanding General  Effect award.

They advanced to the open class finals and placed tenth overall. They  celebrated competitive success in Iowa's largest class size for the  first time in the program's history.

Their invitation to perform on the 250th birthday of our great Nation  is a tremendous honor. I am proud of all of the members of the Pella  Marching Dutch and look forward to watching them represent Iowa at this  historic celebration.                          Recognizing Marley Morris

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  extraordinary young Iowan, 8-year-old Marley Morris, whose kindness and  compassion are making a meaningful difference in the lives of children  battling cancer.

Marley has turned her passion for crafting handmade bracelets into a  mission of hope and joy, donating 100 of her creations to young  patients at the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital.

Marley began making bracelets at just 3 years old, and she continues  today to use that talent to brighten the lives of others. Her generous  spirit and heartfelt efforts reflect the very best of Iowa.

Even at such a young age, Marley reminds all of us that one person,  no matter how small, can have a powerful impact on their community.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Marley Morris for her inspiring  generosity, for leading by example, and showing what it means to serve  others.                          Recognizing Corey Leonhard

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an  outstanding Iowan, Corey Leonhard of Muscatine, on his induction into  the Special Olympics Hall of Fame.

For more than four decades, Corey has been a proud representative of  Iowa in athletic competitions at every level, from local meets to the  world stage.

Corey's accomplishments are remarkable. At the 2003 Special Olympics  World Games in Dublin, Ireland, he earned a Bronze Medal in the 100- meter dash and a Silver Medal in softball.

Mr. Speaker, 4 years later in Shanghai, China, he brought home a Gold  Medal in the long jump, a Bronze Medal in the 400-meter dash, and  placed fourth in the four-by-four relay.

Mr. Speaker, Corey's impact extends beyond athletics. In 2015, he  served as cocaptain for the United Relay Across America, helping carry  the torch from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles.

Today, he remains active in Special Olympics Muscatine, embodying the  values of perseverance, dedication, and sportsmanship.

I congratulate Corey, who is an inspiration to all Iowans, and his  legacy of excellence and determination is well deserving of this honor.                             Honoring Julie Humes

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent,  Julie Humes of Donnellson, Iowa, a flight nurse with Air Evac Lifeteam  and a recipient of the American Ambulance Association's prestigious  Star of Life award.

For over 30 years, this award has recognized the best of our EMS  professionals, those who go above and beyond the call of duty. Julie  was nominated by her peers for her heroism during a severe car  accident, volunteering in dangerous icy conditions to help save the  lives of multiple trauma victims. Thanks to her quick thinking and  courageous actions, every victim survived.

Julie's service is a shining example of the bravery and selflessness  of our first responders, and they demonstrate this every day. It was an  honor to meet Julie and hear about her incredible dedication firsthand.

I congratulate Julie and thank her for her steadfast commitment to  saving lives and protecting Iowans.                          Recognizing Georgia Clark

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Georgia  Clark, a student from West Liberty, Iowa, who represented our State  with pride and excellence at the 2025 National Civics Bee.

Competing against top middle schoolers from across the country,  Georgia placed in the top ten, a tremendous achievement.

Held in Washington, D.C., on Veterans Day, the National Civics Bee  celebrates civic knowledge and encourages young Americans to engage  with their communities and understand their government.

Georgia was 1 of only 39 State champions invited to participate,  representing the West Liberty community school district.

Georgia's dedication, leadership, and love of learning reflect the  best of Iowa's youth. Her passion for civic engagement and  understanding of our Nation's founding principles are truly inspiring.

I thank Georgia for her commitment to excellence and for stepping up  as a young leader with ideas that will strengthen our community and our  country. Her achievement makes all of Iowa proud.                               Pearl Harbor Day

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I remark that Sunday, December 7, is  the 84th anniversary of Pearl Harbor Day, the day that will live in  infamy.

Like 9/11, we must never forget. Always prepared, always ready.

I ask for a moment of silence for those whose lives were lost on that  fateful day.
