Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2026

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Madam Chair, America's warfighters rely on more  than courage and training. They rely on an uninterrupted supply of  expertly manufactured weapons, parts, and ammunition. That lifeline  begins with our Army arsenals.

My amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act protects  that lifeline by prohibiting any Federal funds from being used to  reduce the workforce at Rock Island Arsenal, Joint Munitions Command,  Army Sustainment Command, or any other active U.S. Army arsenal.

Rock Island Arsenal is more than just a military installation. It is  a critical node in our Nation's defense infrastructure. Its civilian  experts, many of them veterans, produce, repair, and innovate the  equipment our troops depend on from the front lines to forward  operating bases.

Every rifle sight calibrated, every artillery shell inspected, and  every 3D-printed replacement part shipped from Rock Island shortens the  time between a soldier's need and the answer that keeps that soldier  alive.

When rumors surfaced of workforce reductions at the island, I wrote  to Secretary of the Army Driscoll, made a site visit with him, and  spoke directly with the men and women whose skills cannot be replicated  overnight. This amendment cements their mission readiness. It prevents  talent loss, preserves irreplaceable know-how, and keeps our defense  industrial base resilient against any adversary who hopes to see it  weakened.

In addition to being a pillar of our national defense, Rock Island  Arsenal supports more than 15,000 jobs. Nearly one-half of those  workers live in Iowa. It also contributes over $1.2 billion annually to  the economy of the Quad Cities region. These are good-paying jobs that  support families, grow our communities, and, most importantly, provide  the backbone of our military supply chain.

As a 24-year Army veteran, I know how vital these arsenals are, not  just to the military, but to the Nation. This is about protecting  readiness, our military, and America.

With the assurance of the chair that he will work with me to ensure  that this amendment does what we intend it to do and continues to  supply our military with the munitions they need, I will always fight  for Rock Island Arsenal, and the men and women in and out of uniform  who power its mission and protect our Nation.

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Madam Chair, with the assurance that the chairman  and I will work together, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  withdraw the amendment.
