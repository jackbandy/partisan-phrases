Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  National Nurses Day to thank the women and men across our country who  care for the sick, comfort the hurting, and keep our healthcare system  running.

I began my own medical career as a nurse. My sister was a nurse, and  my husband was a nurse. I understand the long hours, emotional toll,  and deep responsibility, commitment, and gratification that come with  the job.

Today, we face a nationwide shortage of nurses, especially in rural  areas like many in Iowa. This isn't just a workforce issue. It is a  public health crisis.

We must do more to strengthen nursing by expanding training  opportunities, reducing burnout, and investing in the future of care.

Nurses don't ask for recognition, but they sure deserve it. Mr.  Speaker, on National Nurses Day and every day, I thank all nurses, and  I promise to keep fighting for nurses in Congress.
