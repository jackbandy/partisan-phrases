Recognizing Jones Regional Medical Center Project Funding


Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the $2 million in  community project funding I secured for Jones Regional Medical Center  in Anamosa to build a permanent, state-of-the-art medical simulation  lab.

For the past several years, JRMC has trained nurses out of two  temporary trailers. Despite those challenges, their program continues  to produce highly skilled providers who are urgently needed across  Iowa.

This funding will create a 1,700-square-foot advanced simulation  center that will allow more students to graduate each year and expand  training for high-demand medical fields.

This investment strengthens Iowa's healthcare workforce, supports our  rural hospitals, and ensures that communities across Jones County have  access to trained, qualified providers. I am proud to have secured this  funding and remain committed to strengthening healthcare access and  training across Iowa.

Mr. Speaker, I wish a very happy birthday to Ambassador and Iowa's  longest-serving Governor, Governor Terry Branstad. Happy birthday,  Ambassador and Governor Branstad.
