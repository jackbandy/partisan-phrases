Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act

Mrs. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I will state that nobody should ever  be denied basic healthcare, period. No one is better off when people  are forced to receive healthcare in emergency rooms or receive a later  stage diagnosis because of lack of preventive care and seeing a doctor  on a regular basis.

Over 22 million people, including 400,000 Arizonans, with marketplace  coverage are seeing their premiums skyrocket.

I cannot state this any clearer: People cannot afford to pay more for  their healthcare and shouldn't be forced to. Allowing premiums to  skyrocket, enacting a backdoor abortion ban, and allowing plans to not  cover things like maternity care and preexisting conditions is not a  solution. It is abandonment.

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.
