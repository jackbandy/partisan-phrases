Recognizing Monique Peralta


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1700216/recognizing-monique-peralta


Mrs. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise today to recognize an  extraordinary educator from Arizona's Seventh Congressional District  and Tucson Unified School District, Mrs. Monique Peralta, and to  celebrate a true full-circle story of public education.

Mrs. Peralta is proudly Tucson Unified grown. She attended Vesey  Elementary School and Morgan Maxwell and graduated from Cholla High  School. Today, she teaches in the same community that raised her.

For 25 years, she has walked into her classroom determined to make  every student feel seen and to make sure they learn and they believe in  themselves.

Her students, including all of my three children, know her as someone  who cares deeply and inspires lifelong learning.

Her colleagues know her as a mentor, and her community knows she  never forgot where she came from.

Mrs. Peralta reminds us that public schools build futures and that  great teachers change lives.

On behalf of Arizona's Seventh Congressional District, we thank Mrs.  Peralta for 25 years of dedication, compassion, and service. We are  proud of her, and we are so grateful for her.

``We love you very much, Mrs. Peralta''; ``Te quiermos muchos, Sra.  Peralta.''
