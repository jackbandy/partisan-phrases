Epstein Files Transparency Act

Mrs. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the  survivors, family members, and advocates who are here today and have  never given up.

The legislation in front of us at its core is about something very  simple. The survivors deserve justice. The American people deserve the  truth.

To every survivor watching, their courage is inspiring. They are the  reason why this vote is happening today. Protecting women and children  from pedophiles should not be a Democratic issue. It should not be a  Republican issue. It should be a human rights issue and a matter of  justice.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Epstein File  Transparency Act.
