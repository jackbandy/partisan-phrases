Protecting Education for Children with Disabilities

Mrs. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Hayes for her  leadership and advocacy.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in defense of one of the most  important civil rights laws Congress has ever passed, the Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act and to oppose the dangerous and  unlawful efforts to dismantle the Department of Education.

IDEA is not a suggestion. It is not discretionary. It is the law of  the land, and for more than four decades, it has represented a  bipartisan commitment that children with disabilities have the right to  a free, appropriate public education, one that meets their individual  needs and recognizes their full potential.

Before IDEA, millions of children with disabilities were excluded  from classrooms, denied services, or told they did not belong in public  school at all. IDEA changed that. It affirmed that a disability does  not diminish a child's worth and that access to education is a civil  right, not a privilege reserved for a few.

Today, more than 7 million students across the country rely on IDEA  for individualized education plans, services, and due process  protections. These are real students whose ability to learn,  communicate, and thrive depends on fulfilling the promises made in  Federal law.

Those promises are enforced, overseen, and protected by the  Department of Education.

The Department plays an essential role in ensuring that IDEA is  implemented fairly and consistently across all States. It provides  guidance, oversight, enforcement, and accountability. Without it, IDEA  becomes words on paper with no meaningful guarantee.

Let us be clear. People cannot claim to support students with  disabilities while dismantling the very agency responsible for  protecting their rights. Efforts to hollow out or get rid of the  Department of Education without congressional authorization are not  only reckless, they are illegal. Congress created IDEA. Congress  assigned its enforcement. Attempting to undermine that structure  violates the law and the Constitution's separation of powers.

Without Federal oversight, enforcement of IDEA will vary widely from  State to State. A child's access to services will depend on their ZIP  Code. Families will face confusion, delays, and costly legal battles  just to secure what the law already guarantees their children. States  and school districts will be left without clear guidance or support,  increasing litigation, and diverting resources away from classrooms.  Families, especially those without financial or legal resources, will  pay the highest price.

The measure of our commitment to public education is how the students  who need us the most are treated, and today, those students are  watching.

I urge my colleagues to reject the efforts to weaken IDEA or  dismantle the Department of Education. Congress has a legal obligation,  a moral responsibility, and a constitutional duty to protect students  with disabilities and ensure they receive the education they deserve.

I will continue to stand with students, families, educators, and  advocates, and I call on this body to do the same.
