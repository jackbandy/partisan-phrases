Horrific Ice Abuses

Mrs. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, today, while Kristi Noem staged yet  another photo op, this time in Nogales, Arizona, families across this  country are still grieving people who should be alive.

Let's be clear: Border communities are not war zones. Border towns,  like Nogales, which I represent in Congress, are vibrant, binational  communities where families live, work, and thrive.

Instead of listening to local leaders, this administration keeps  choosing militarization, fear mongering, and political theater, and it  is costing people their lives.

On January 7, an ICE agent murdered Renee Good, an unarmed U.S.  citizen, in Minneapolis. Two weeks later, just miles away, Alex Pretti  was shot and killed by Federal agents. In both cases, the  administration lied about what happened, smeared the victims, and  blocked independent investigations. These are not isolated incidents.  They are part of a growing pattern.

For border communities, this violence is not new. In 2012, 16-year- old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez was shot and killed by Border Patrol  through a border fence while he was walking home on the Mexico side of  the border in Nogales, Sonora. He was unarmed. He was a child.

For far too long, communities like mine have been told to accept this  as the cost of enforcement. That is why, yesterday, I voted against  continued funding for DHS. I will not rubberstamp an agency that  enables violence, racial profiling, and terror in our neighborhoods.

ICE has already been handed $75 billion through the Republican's big,  ugly bill, money that was ripped away from SNAP, Medicaid, and working  families. That money is being used to militarize our cities, not keep  people safe.

This is a moral infliction point. We can choose dignity,  accountability, and real solutions, or we can keep funding abuse,  pretending its policy.
