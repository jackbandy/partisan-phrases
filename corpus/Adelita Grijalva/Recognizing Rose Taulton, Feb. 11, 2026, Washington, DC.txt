Mrs. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  extraordinary southern Arizonan, Rose Taulton, recently named Volunteer  of the Year by Southern Arizona Volunteer Management Association.

Rose is truly the heart of volunteerism in Tucson. In 2025 alone, she  logged more than 1,000 hours of service, positively impacting over  5,000 people across our community.

There are few people I see more often at community events than Rose.  Whether it is helping organize the annual Tucson Juneteenth Festival or  volunteering at a neighborhood food bank, she is always there, quietly,  consistently, and with joy.

From mentoring youth and distributing books to supporting families  facing food insecurity, Rose shows up, not for recognition but because  she believes in the power of community.

Southern Arizona is stronger because of people like Rose. Her  determination, compassion, and service embody the very best of us.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Rose for everything she does for Tucson. We are  grateful beyond words. I congratulate her on her new grandbaby.
