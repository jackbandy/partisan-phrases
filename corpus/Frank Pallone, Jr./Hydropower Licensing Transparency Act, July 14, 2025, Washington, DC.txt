Hydropower Licensing Transparency Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3657, which will provide  transparency into the hydropower licensing process at the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC.

Today, FERC is responsible for issuing licenses for hydropower dams,  but it is often dependent on other regulatory entities, such as the  Army Corps, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine  Fisheries Service, or State water agencies, to provide information and  approvals that FERC relies on to issue licenses. It can also be  dependent on the dam developer itself to give FERC necessary  information.

With all these different entities involved in the process, it is  often difficult to monitor from the outside and understand where things  stand on a particular project.

This bill helps to bring more transparency to the process. It  requires an annual report to Congress on the status of each license  application and outstanding actions that are required of regulatory  agencies or the applicants themselves. This is particularly important  now because 15 percent of the electric capacity at hydropower dams will  come up for relicensing in the next decade.

Forecasts for electricity demand also seem to be increasing by the  day, and that is why it is critically important that we have  transparency into where the hangups are in the hydropower licensing  process.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Schrier for her hard work on this  bipartisan bill. I also thank Representative Fulcher, Chairs Guthrie  and Latta, and Republican committee staff for accommodating  commonsense, bipartisan amendments to the bill, such as expanding it to  cover new hydropower projects.

Schrier), who is the sponsor of the bill.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge bipartisan support for this  important bill related to hydropower dams, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
