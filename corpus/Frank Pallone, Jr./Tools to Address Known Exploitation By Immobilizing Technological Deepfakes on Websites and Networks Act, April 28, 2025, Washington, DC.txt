Tools to Address Known Exploitation By Immobilizing Technological Deepfakes on Websites and Networks Act


I rise to speak in support of S. 146, the TAKE IT DOWN Act. The  legislation addresses the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images  online, one of the most significant harms proliferating on the internet  in recent years.

Advances in generative artificial intelligence and other photo  manipulation software have enabled the creation of digital forgeries  that place victims in sexually explicit situations that never actually  occurred but can still cause massive reputational and financial damage  to those who were targeted.

Some of the platforms hosting actual and computer-generated  nonconsensual intimate images have promised to address such abuses  online and protect their users but, nevertheless, victims report great  difficulty in getting such images removed from the internet. They tell  us they feel powerless as it spreads or even resurfaces years later.

The TAKE IT DOWN Act will require social media and other online  public platforms to provide a mechanism for people to notify the  platform of nonconsensual intimate images in which they are depicted.  It also requires the platforms to take reasonable steps to remove the  images from their platforms within 48 hours.

I thank Representatives Dean and Dingell for their leadership on this  issue, and I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation.

Mr. PALLONE.  Dean).

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge unanimous support for this  legislation. Once again, this is another very important bill as part of  this consumer protection agenda today.
