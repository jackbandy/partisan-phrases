Critical Infrastructure Manufacturing Feasibility Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1721, the Critical  Infrastructure Manufacturing Feasibility Act.

Our Nation's manufacturing base was once the envy of the world.  Unfortunately, it faced steady headwinds for decades. The United  States' share of global manufacturing activity declined from 28 percent  in 2002 to less than 16 percent in 2021.

Fortunately, the work we did under the Biden administration, passing  the bipartisan infrastructure law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the  CHIPS and Science Act, started to turn the tide. Our Nation added over  700,000 manufacturing jobs during President Biden's time in office.

However, we must not allow President Trump to put this great progress  in jeopardy with his chaotic trade wars and uncertain tariff policies.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stand with the  domestic manufacturers they claim to support by speaking out against  the uncertain market environment that this administration has thrown  manufacturing into. We should be working together on commonsense  investments and legislation to strengthen domestic supply chains and  manufacturing, as we have done before, instead of allowing President  Trump and his friends to crash our economy, including the manufacturing  sector, with careless policies.

H.R. 1721 will commission the Department of Commerce to study the  costs, benefits, and feasibility of manufacturing products within  critical infrastructure sectors so we can take well-informed and  strategic next steps to bolster our Nation's supply chains.

I thank our Democratic sponsor, Representative Schrier, for her work  on this bill. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
