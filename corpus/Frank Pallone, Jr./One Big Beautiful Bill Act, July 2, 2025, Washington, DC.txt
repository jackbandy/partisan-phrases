One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, this is the most shameful bill that I have  ever seen. It takes healthcare away from 17 million people in order to  give giant tax breaks to billionaires and large corporate interests.

The increase in uncompensated care will force hospitals and nursing  homes to close and increase costs for those who still have insurance.

Costs are going to soar for hardworking families across the country,  as health insurance premiums, energy bills, and medical debts rise for  millions, while the rich get richer.

However, this bill doesn't just destroy Americans' access to see  their doctors or afford their monthly medications. It also makes  devastating cuts to American energy and jobs, which will further  increase energy bills and eliminate jobs across the country.

This bill is fundamentally cruel. Hardworking Americans don't deserve  to be treated this way by the Republicans in Congress, but the  Republicans simply don't care.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the strongest terms to join me  in voting ``no.''
