Recognizing Recardina ``dina'' Boccippio's 100th Birthday


Mr. PALLONE. Mr Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Recardina  Boccippio, also known as Dina, as she celebrates her 100th birthday  this year. It is my pleasure to join Dina's family and friends in  honoring the wonderful life she has led.

On September 16, 1925, Recardina DePalma was born to Dominick and  Michelina DePalma in Port Reading, New Jersey where Dina resided for 21  years. On October 27, 1946, she married the love of her life Angelo  Boccippio and in 1953, they purchased their forever home in Woodbridge,  New Jersey. Her loved ones refer to her as a pleasure to be around and  a true inspiration.

For 10 years, Dina worked at Flagstaff Foods and Liquors. For the  next 35 years, Dina worked as a private secretary and head bookkeeper  for the Mauro Family at Mauro Motors. Now retired, it is clear she is  living her best life as she is happiest spending time with family and  friends. In her free time, Dina enjoys watching game shows and soap  operas and is always ready for her next hair and nail appointments.  After many incredible years, Dina Boccippio's contagious positivity and  kindness is truly deserving of this body's recognition.

Mr. Speaker, once again, please join me in wishing Dina Boccippio  another year of good health and happiness she celebrates the milestone  of her 100th Birthday.
