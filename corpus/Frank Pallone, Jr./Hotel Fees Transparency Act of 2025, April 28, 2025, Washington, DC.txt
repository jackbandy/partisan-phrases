Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1479, the Hotel Fees  Transparency Act.

Far too often, when consumers go to check out of their hotel rooms,  they are hit with surprise fees. Hotels and online travel agencies have  many names for these types of fees: resort fees, amenities fees, and  facilities fees, to name just a few. Regardless of what they are  called, surprise fees that consumers do not expect make it impossible  to comparison shop and impose undue burdens on household finances.

H.R. 1479, the Hotel Fees Transparency Act, is a bipartisan bill that  would ensure that companies disclose all mandatory fees when they  advertise the price of a hotel room or other place of short-term  lodging.

This bill would also require hotels and other providers of short-term  lodging to provide the total cost of a room to any internet website or  other third party that the provider has allowed to advertise, market,  display, or otherwise offer the short-term lodging for sale.

By ensuring everyone in the short-term lodging ecosystem displays the  full price of a stay, we will protect consumers from being caught  paying extra when they go to check out.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Castor, Mullin, Kim, and Fry for  their bipartisan leadership on this issue, and I reserve the balance of  my time.

Mr. PALLONE.  Castor), who is the Democratic sponsor of the bill and who  is also the ranking member of our committee's Energy Subcommittee.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge bipartisan support for this  legislation. It is another consumer protection bill, like the TICKET  Act, that provides transparency where it doesn't exist right now.
