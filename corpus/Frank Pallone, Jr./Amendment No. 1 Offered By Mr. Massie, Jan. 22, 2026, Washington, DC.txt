Amendment No. 1 Offered By Mr. Massie


Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise also in strong opposition to this  amendment.

In 2023, 12,429 people died in drunk driving crashes nationwide. In  Kentucky alone, 198 people were killed. In  Pennsylvania, 321 people lost their lives. These deaths were  preventable.

Advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology will  prevent impaired drivers from illegally operating vehicles and causing  deaths and injuries. I understand that my Republican colleagues are  concerned about privacy, but the technology being developed does not  track the vehicle's location or collect, use, or store any data that  would compromise the privacy of vehicle occupants.

Privacy is a concern, and my friends should weigh in on the  rulemaking process. NHTSA, the agency involved with this, should work  with government agencies that have expertise in this area to ensure  that consumer data is secure, anonymous, and protected from  unauthorized use. That can and should be addressed as part of the  rulemaking process.

It is not right, though. Preventing impaired drivers from illegally  operating vehicles and causing fatalities should be a nonpartisan  issue, and the work on that needs to continue.

The problem here is that while NHTSA has not finalized the rule, they  would not be able to do any work related to the rule or advanced  alcohol monitoring technology if this amendment passes. That is going  to just cause more deaths from drunk driving.

I would implore everybody: Please, privacy can be addressed, but we  should not stop this work from continuing. We can't have drunk drivers  on the road. It is not just them but everyone else who is killed and  injured as a result of those drunk drivers.
