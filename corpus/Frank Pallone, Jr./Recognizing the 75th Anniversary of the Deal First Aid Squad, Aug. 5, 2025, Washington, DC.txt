Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Deal First  Aid Squad as they celebrate their 75th Anniversary this year.

In 1950, residents of the Borough of Deal, New Jersey founded the  Deal First Aid Squad to provide emergency medical services day  and night. For 75 years, this organization has operated uninterrupted,  completely volunteer-based, and performed a range of reliable services  from routine transport to emergency response. With exemplary civic  dedication, members have fostered an immeasurable dependability that  stands out as a pillar to the Deal community and beyond. I commend the  Deal First Aid Squad for their commitment to support residents during  times of need, including life-saving interventions and storm-related  emergencies. As the country braces with more extreme weather, like  severe flooding and heat, it is rewarding to know that safety is the  priority to the Deal First Aid Squad

Today, the community outreach by the Deal First Aid Squad is truly  inspiring. The organization reached hundreds of residents with classes  to CPR, AED, and First Aid training. Over the past few decades, they  have answered tens of thousands of calls, while participating in  several town parades, health fairs, and local school events. The strong  community connection is reflected in the generations of families that  have joined the Deal First Aid Squad. Notably, they have served in key  mutual aid roles and frequent interagency cooperation across Monmouth  County.

Mr Speaker, I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in marking  the 75th Anniversary of the Deal First Aid Squad and celebrating its  rich impact on the Borough of Deal and greater Monmouth County.
