Recognizing the 50th Anniversary of the National Organization for Women of New Jersey


Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the National  Organization for Women of New Jersey (NOW-NJ) as they celebrate their  historic 50-year milestone of promoting equal rights for women and  girls. It is my privilege to recognize the powerful impact made by NOW- NJ to build a New Jersey where everyone, regardless of race, gender  identity, or background has the freedom and opportunity to thrive.

Since 1975, this multi-issue, multi-strategy organization has gone  above and beyond for marginalized communities and stands as one of the  oldest and largest women's organizations in our country. NOW-NJ  continues to lead the charge in efforts to combat violence and  harassment against women, and push back against renewed attacks on  reproductive rights, civil rights, and LGBTQ+ rights. I commend NOW-NJ  for their outstanding holistic approach to advocate for social change.

For half a century, this group has led with purpose, through  intersectional, anti-racist grassroots activism, to expand  opportunities in education and the workforce. It is valuable for New  Jersey residents to have NOW-NJ as a resource for guidance and  leadership. NOW-NJ's legacy of resilience will live on for generations.

Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in honoring  NOW-NJ for their exceptional contributions to the community and  congratulating them on their 50th anniversary of service.
