Recognizing the Spiritual Head, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize His All-Holiness  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the Spiritual Head and leader of the  second largest Christian Church in the world. His All-Holiness is  visiting Washington, D.C. in conjunction with his acceptance of the  distinguished Templeton Prize in New York City--an honor previously  bestowed on Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu,  among others. While here, he will visit both the White House and the  Congress.

Elected in October 1991 as the 270th Archbishop of the 2,000-year-old  Church founded by the Apostle Andrew, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew  is the spiritual leader of 250 million Orthodox Christians worldwide.  He is also a leading figure in the dialogues among the Abrahamic  Faiths--Judaism, Christianity, and Islam--and his presence in our  Nation's capital is an opportunity to highlight the positive role  religious leaders of his stature bring to the cause of peace and  religious liberty.

The true peacemakers of history not only sought to reduce conflict  but also showed compassion toward those who persecuted them. Patriarch  Bartholomew fits that definition precisely. Despite facing harassment  by foreign governments and attacks by extremists, he has remained  steadfast in his mission to promote reconciliation, environmental  stewardship, and human dignity.

His contributions have been recognized around the globe. In 1997, he  was awarded the Gold Medal of the United States Congress. The Guardian  identified him as one of the world's foremost leaders in raising  environmental awareness. And Time Magazine, in its category of Leaders  and Revolutionaries, named him one of the world's most influential  people.

Mr. Speaker, as we welcome His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew to Washington, D.C., let us also celebrate his unwavering  commitment to interfaith dialogue, peace, and religious liberty. His  leadership serves as a reminder of the power of faith to unite people  across nations and traditions.
