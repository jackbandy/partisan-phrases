Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 2481, the Romance  Scam Prevention Act.

As more consumers report using online dating services, it is  important that they are made aware of potential harms. This bill  ensures that when an online dating service bans a user for fraud, it  notifies all the other users who have been in contact with that banned  person on the service. This will help to reduce the number of people  who fall victim to identified fraudsters looking to extort money from  dating app users.

Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important first step in addressing harm  in the online dating space. However, there is a lot more to be done,  and vulnerable consumers need a strong and independent Federal Trade  Commission to prosecute fraudsters and scammers and to protect them  from having their emotions exploited for financial gain.

I encourage my Republican colleagues to support this legislation as  well as the bipartisan FTC that ensures consumer protection measures  like this one are fully and fairly enforced for all Americans. I thank  Representatives Pettersen and Valadao for their leadership on this  legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I will close by saying I do think this is  an important bill for avoiding fraud. I am very concerned about fraud  on these dating service apps. I commend Mr. Valadao for bringing this  forward, and I urge everyone to support the bill.
