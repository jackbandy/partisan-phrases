Moving National Woman's Relief Corps Incorporation and Domicile to Illinois; Principal Office to Murphysboro, Illinois


Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 988) to amend title 36, United States Code, to move the  place of incorporation and domicile of the National Woman's Relief  Corps to Illinois, to move the principal office of such Corps to  Murphysboro, Illinois, and for other purposes.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 988

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. MOVING NATIONAL WOMAN'S RELIEF CORPS INCORPORATION                     AND DOMICILE TO ILLINOIS; PRINCIPAL OFFICE TO                     MURPHYSBORO, ILLINOIS.

(b) Principal Office.--Section 153708 of title 36, United       States Code, is amended by striking ``Springfield'' each       place it appears and inserting ``Murphysboro''.

(2) by striking ``Mayor of the District of Columbia or       another office designated by the Mayor'' and inserting       ``Secretary of State of Illinois or another office as       designated by Illinois law''.

Mr. JORDAN.  988.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 988 amends the congressional charter for the  National Woman's Relief Corps.

In 1883, the National Woman's Relief Corps was founded as an  auxiliary to the Grand Army of the Republic. This nonprofit  organization was founded to perpetuate the memory of those who  sacrificed much, and sometimes all, in the American Civil War. Today,  the National Woman's Relief Corps provides assistance to veterans of  all wars and their families.

In 1962, Congress granted the corps a congressional charter under  title 36 of the U.S. Code. Congressional charters often stipulate an  organization's place of incorporation and corporate domicile.

In the case of the National Woman's Relief Corps, their charter  requires that the organization be incorporated and domiciled in  Washington, D.C. Due to changes in the organization over the years, the  corps would like to move its domicile to Illinois, and this bill does  just that.

H.R. 988 amends the corps' congressional charter to formally change  the organization's place of incorporation and domicile from Washington,  D.C., to Illinois. The bill further amends the charter by moving the  location of the organization's headquarters to Murphysboro, Illinois.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an estimate from the  Congressional Budget Office for this bill.      H.R. 988, A BILL TO AMEND TITLE 36, UNITED STATES CODE, TO MOVE THE PLACE OF INCORPORATION AND DOMICILE OF THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S RELIEF CORPS  TO ILLINOIS, TO MOVE THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF SUCH CORPS TO MURPHYSBORO,    ILLINOIS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES, AS ORDERED REPORTED BY THE HOUSE              COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY ON NOVEMBER 20, 2025 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                           By fiscal year, millions of                                                    dollars--                                      -----------------------------------                                          2026      2026-2030   2026-2035 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Direct Spending (Outlays)...........          0           0           0 Revenues............................          0           0           0 Increase or Decrease (-) in the               0           0           0  Deficit............................

H.R. 988 would change the location of the congressionally       chartered National Woman's Relief Corps, Auxiliary to the       Grand Army of the Republic. Because organizations chartered       under title 36 of the U.S. Code are not federal agencies, CBO       estimates that enacting this bill would have no effect on the       federal budget.

The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew       Pickford. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss,       Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                              Director, Congressional Budget Office

Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 988 is a great bill. I appreciate the  sponsor  and his great work. He told me that I did pronounce ``Murphysboro''  right, so we are off to a good start. I hope everyone votes for it.
