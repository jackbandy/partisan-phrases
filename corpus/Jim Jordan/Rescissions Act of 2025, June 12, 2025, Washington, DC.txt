Rescissions Act of 2025


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692525/rescissions-act-of-2025


Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, this bill is really simple. Don't spend money on stupid  things, and don't subsidize biased media.

There are all kinds of media that are biased. They can take care of  themselves. MSNBC proves that every single day.

Think about the statement just made about NPR. Uri Berliner, an  award-winning journalist who worked for NPR for over 20 years, decided  NPR had lost its way and asked a basic question: What is the political  affiliation of the editors for NPR in the Washington, D.C., area? Guess  what he found? Eighty-seven editors' political affiliation was 87  Democrats, zero Republicans--not 44-43, not 50-37, not 60-27. It was  87-0.

This bill simply says to stop subsidizing--they can make money on  their own; all the other media outlets do it--and quit spending  taxpayer money, hard-earned taxpayer money, on stupid things.

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
