Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share positive news about  young people from Ohio's 4th Congressional District. Today, I am  pleased to commend to the House twelve high school students who are  being honored for their outstanding leadership skills and volunteerism.

On February 11, 2026, the Noon Optimist Club of Lima will recognize  Andrew Baldauf, Vivian Elrod, Sheldyn Fetter, Daniela Garcia, Jackson  Niesen, Emersyn Painter, Eli Pohlman, Russell Powell, Aniya Prowant,  Michael Sherrick, Alexandria Weber, and Laila Woods at its annual youth  appreciation luncheon. These students were each nominated by their  schools for being good role models for their peers.

I thank the Optimists for their efforts to celebrate the many  achievements of these students and am proud to join in the accolades to  them. They have my very best wishes for continued success in their  lives in the years to come.
