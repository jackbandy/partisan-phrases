Economic Anxiety

Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his  steadfast devotion to highlighting for the American people the state of  our fiscal health, which is not good, and the extent to which we are  complicit in it.

I would just point out that this thing that the gentleman from  Arizona is talking about is so central to everything we are trying to  deal with right here, right now, in Congress, and if we don't fix that,  then we will have failed.

I want to be clear to my Republican colleagues: If we do not fix this  scheme, this scam--the gentleman didn't misspeak. It is a scam. If we  don't fix that, we will have failed.

Let me ask the gentleman a couple of questions.

Prior to the existence of Medicaid, there was no Federal subsidy at  all. This scheme couldn't have possibly existed in this way.

Mr. ROY. So Medicaid was created, and Medicaid was created to  ostensibly provide an avenue to healthcare for the poor and vulnerable,  right, as a broad statement. Is that true?

Mr. ROY. It was supposed to then be a shared arrangement between the  States and the Federal Government, correct?

Mr. ROY. Now, fast-forward, and the current vulnerable population-- what we call the vulnerable population--the indigent, the poor, those  who need it, single moms, people who are sick, the frail--that  population, even under today's law, gets a Federal--we will call it a  match; it is really a formula--a match of 50 to 70 percent, depending  on the jurisdiction. Is that correct?

Mr. ROY. Let's fast-forward. What we are really talking about--for  everybody at home watching C-SPAN, all 14 of you--we have a situation  where ObamaCare expanded the Medicaid population, and it expanded it  massively to a population that is much bigger and much more able- bodied, i.e., healthier.

Now, you would think is that good or bad? I have my problems with it  facially, but even if you were going to do it, would you then say, as  it does, that that population, the healthier, able-bodied population,  should get a 90 percent match from the Federal Government? Because that  is what is happening. They get a 90 percent rate for that expanded  population, then layer on top of that, and this is what you are now  dealing with.

The gentleman's chart that The Wall Street Journal did, where you  have the provider taxes, you have this high rate that they are able to  collect, and they are juicing it using the provider taxes. They get  this 90 percent Federal dollars, and then they are openly--California,  for example, has stated they are gaming the system to get Federal  dollars to use that to subsidize illegal aliens and people who are not  the vulnerable population and, frankly, put it in their general budget.  That is what the gentleman is talking about. That is the current state  of affairs.

Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I don't want to take away any of his thunder.

Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, the question I have for the gentleman: When I  graduated from law school at the University of Texas in 2003, the  national debt was somewhere in the $6 trillion range, $6.5 trillion  dollars. When I came to Congress, when I was campaigning to come to  Congress, it was just over $20 trillion. That was 2018. Today, we are  pushing $37 trillion. Is that roughly correct?

Mr. ROY. Correct.

Mr. ROY. Now, I bring that up because nobody at home understands  that. You are doing a good job trying to put it in context.

Mr. ROY. You are trying to explain it about the amount of money we  are borrowing per family or taxpayer per second. Yet, to put it in  stark terms, what  we are talking about with the debt and the deficits, what it really  means is the inability to afford a house for the average American,  right, because the impact that flows from it is, as you alluded to,  higher interest rates, an inability for the Fed and for Congress to  continue to borrow and print money because of what you are describing  worldwide. The ability to have people to buy, our debt goes down.

The cost of debt is going to go up, the interests are going up,  inflation is going up, and the average American family is going to take  it on the chin. That is what we are talking about.

The reason I bring that up is because our colleagues, as you point  out, run around here saying: I need more money for the program. I need  more money for--fill in the blank. I need more money for Medicaid. I  need more money for SALT. Why? It is because they feel like they have a  political interest in doing so.

I am sure the gentleman had, like I did yesterday, the farm bureau  coming into your office and needing help. Guess what? I understand why  they need help. It is because we, the Federal Government, have messed  up their lives quite vociferously.

Mr. ROY. We distort, and so they want help. I get it. Yet, what do I  do? Do I vote for food stamps?

I am a cancer survivor--you know that--and I have cancer groups  coming in and asking for money. I look at them, and I say: Well, can  you go find some way to pay for it?

A lot of my colleagues don't want to do that.

I will close with this. President Reagan had a great quote on ``The  Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,'' a late-night show in the 1970s,  before he was President, in which he said:

Every program that a politician brings forward should have to come  with a tax increase attached to it.

Why is that? Was President Reagan pro tax increases? I know the  gentleman from Arizona knows that not to be true. President Reagan  believed in tax cuts and more money in the pockets of Americans to  create wealth and to create economic growth.

Yet, why he said that was because we promise things that we can't  deliver. We promise things that we deliver that are fake because we are  doling out money and printing money to pay for programs. Then, on the  other side of the ledger, we never want to say: We need a tax increase  to pay for it because we rightly understand that tax increases  constrain the economy. In other words, in short, we put ourselves in  the box we have created.

Mr. ROY. Correct.

Mr. ROY. Correct.

Mr. ROY. Yes.

Mr. ROY. Yes.

Mr. ROY. Yes.

Mr. ROY. Yes.

Mr. ROY. Yes.

Mr. ROY. Would the gentleman yield on that?

One of the things that I have been saying in this building for the  last several months is this debate about what we call, I think somewhat  wrongly and incorrectly, ``mandatory spending,'' because it is not  mandatory. We have just chosen to put it on autopilot. It is automatic  spending. It is not mandatory.

Mr. ROY. I have been saying in this building repeatedly that the math  has to math. The math has to add up.

Would the gentleman agree that that is the fundamental and core  problem in this town when we are talking about the state of affairs?

For example, we in this process have taken Medicare off of the table  politically. The President has asked us to take Medicare off of the  table. We have taken Social Security off of the table because, by law--

Mr. ROY.--we are not allowed to touch Social Security in the  reconciliation process, and then interest is off of the table because  you have to pay it. You can't just magically not pay the interest. That  adds up to what? It is about 47 percent of the total fricking budget.  It is half the budget.

Mr. ROY. Correct.

Mr. ROY. I have done it before.

Mr. ROY. Right.

Mr. ROY. Right.

Mr. ROY. Yes.

Mr. ROY. If the gentleman is asking a rhetorical question and the  gentleman does not have his--

Mr. ROY. Yes.

Mr. ROY. I will yield back.
