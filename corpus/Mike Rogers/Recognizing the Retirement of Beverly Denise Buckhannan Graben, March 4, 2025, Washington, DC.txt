Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  retirement of Beverly Graben from my Oxford District Office.

Beverly, a native of Clay County, Alabama, was born on May 6, 1959,  to W.T. and Eulene Buckhannan. She graduated from Lineville High School  in 1977 and married Andy Dale Graben on April 8, 1979. Beverly obtained  a cosmetology degree from Ayers State Technical College. She and Andy  have been blessed with two sons: Adam (married to Jayme) and Kevin  (married to Kimberly). They have five grandchildren who are the light  of Beverly's life: Seth, Ella Jaymes, William, Charlotte and Joseph.

Beverly is a former member of Center West Baptist Church and  currently attends Barfield Baptist Church.

Beverly has worked at Burger Quick, RL Harris Dam, Graben Wood  Products, Midway Ford, Wright and Sprayberry Insurance and former  Congressman Bob Riley. Beverly has worked for me since I took office in  2003. She is an outstanding employee and has a heart for the people of  Alabama's Third Congressional District. She will be greatly missed.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Beverly for her retirement  and thanking her for her dedication and service to our great State of  Alabama. I congratulate Beverly.
