Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  birthday of Wilbert D. Payne, Jr. Mr. Payne turned 75 on July 13th.

Mr. Payne was born on July 13, 1950, and has devoted almost 50 years  to serving his community and country, becoming a historic figure in the  City of Opelika and a respected voice among Alabama veterans and civic  leaders.

As former Commander of the Disabled American Veterans Twin Cities  Chapter 95, he spearheaded the Vietnam War 50-Year Commemoration in  Central Alabama, organizing the first ceremony of its kind in Lee  County in 2016 and ensuring hundreds of veterans were honored and  presented with commemorative pins and the public gratitude they had  long deserved. He became an advocate for veterans' rights, mental  health care, and public recognition for Vietnam veterans who, like  himself, returned home without fanfare or acknowledgment.

His civic service roles include: Chief Voting Inspector for Lee  County at the Covington Recreation Center, Chairman and member of the  City of Opelika Zoning Board, Member of 100 Black Men of America. Inc.,  Greater Auburn-Opelika Chapter, where he served as All Pro Dad's  Chairperson for Carver Primary School and West Forest Intermediate  School, Longtime coordinator of the Lions Tamers Social and Civic  Club's Family Fun Day/Juneteenth Celebration, Certified Member and  Volunteer with the American Red Cross for 19 years, including service  as a former Shelter Manager on the Disaster Action Team (DAT).

Darden Foundation, Member of the  Opelika-Auburn News Editorial Board, Board Member of the Lee-Russell  County Council on Aging, Active with People of Action for Community  Enrichment and recipient of the Arthur Hill Community Service Award  (2023).

Mr. Payne retired from the City of Opelika Engineering Department  (1990 to 2000) after previous employment with the Augusta Environmental  Company (1981 to 1989) and Diversified Products (1976 to 1980), while  balancing his long and honorable military service in U.S. Army (1970 to  1971) and Army Reserve (1971 to 2000). He is supported by his loving  wife, BBB4 Wilbert D. Payne, Jr., and has been blessed with 4 children  and 12 grandchildren.
