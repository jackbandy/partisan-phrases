Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  commend Annie Wilcox Boyajian, President of Freedom House, for more  than a decade of tireless dedication and exemplary service in advancing  the cause of global democracy, particularly during the most recent  disruptions in the freedom and democracy landscape globally and within  the United States.

In an era marked by profound challenges to democratic institutions,  Ms. Boyajian has demonstrated unparalleled leadership and resolve.  Relentlessly, alongside the entire leadership team and staff of Freedom  House, she has protected dissidents from harm around the world,  leveraging her extensive network and strong, trusted relationships to  safeguard those who stand against oppression and tyranny. Her efforts  have provided critical support to vulnerable individuals and  communities, ensuring their voices are heard and their rights defended  amid rising threats.

Furthermore, with great determination, Ms. Boyajian has transitioned  Freedom House with dignity and care for its staff and partners, while  incredibly navigating the volatile worldwide of democratic backsliding,  resulting from years of unchecked authoritarian rule. Under her  guidance, the organization has adapted to these turbulent times while  maintaining its core mission, emerging stronger and more resilient in  its commitment to human rights, freedom of expression, and the rule of  law.

Freedom House, founded in 1941 by Eleanor Roosevelt and Wendell  Willkie, remains a cornerstone of American leadership in the global  fight for freedom and democracy. Ms. Boyajian's stewardship has upheld  and enhanced this legacy, positioning the institution as an  indispensable force in countering authoritarianism and fostering  democratic renewal worldwide.

Her leadership and commitment will be missed greatly at Freedom  House, as her mark of excellence will be recorded in the historical  annals and remembered by all who have witnessed her profound impact. On  behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, we wish her continued  success and look forward to her enduring leadership in the continuous  struggle for a world where all are free.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Annie Wilcox Boyajian's  extraordinary service and the enduring legacy of Freedom House--a  legacy that continues to inspire hope and action in the pursuit of  freedom for all.
