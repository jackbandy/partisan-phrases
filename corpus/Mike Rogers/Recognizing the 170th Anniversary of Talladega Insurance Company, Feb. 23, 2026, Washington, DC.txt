Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  170th anniversary of Talladega Insurance Agency in Talladega, Alabama.  Talladega Insurance is currently under the leadership of Boyd McGehee.

Talladega Insurance Company was incorporated in 1856 making it the  oldest insurance agency in the State of Alabama and the second oldest  in the United States.

The company attributes its longevity to its superior staffing. The  Talladega Insurance Agency is built on family, as it is a family-owned  and operated business and has had four generations leading the way. In  the 1920s, Turner Joel Jones acquired the Talladega Insurance Company  renaming it Talladega Insurance Agency and his brother, George, soon  joined him in the business.

In 1950, William Boyd McGehee, Jr. (Billy) left his family's pharmacy  in Montgomery, Alabama, seeking new directions. He and his wife moved  to Talladega to join her father in the insurance business.

In 1974, Billy's son, William Boyd McGehee, III (Bill), returned with  his wife, Evelyn, to Talladega to work at Talladega Insurance after  leaving Atlanta, where he worked for the Great American Insurance  Company. In 2004, Bill's son, Boyd, joined the agency.

Today, Boyd runs the agency. He is an alumnus of The University of  Alabama and The National Alliance's Producer School. In 2008, he was  named Alabama's Young Agent of the Year by the Alabama Independent  Insurance Agent Association. Boyd has carried on the family tradition  and has made Talladega Insurance Agency not only successful in  business, but a community partner as he continues to invest in the City  of Talladega.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in wishing my friend, Boyd, and his team  at Talladega Insurance Agency a happy 170th anniversary.
