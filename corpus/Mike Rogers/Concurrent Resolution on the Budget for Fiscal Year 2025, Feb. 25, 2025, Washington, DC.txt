Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I  commend the Chair, the leader, and Chairman Arrington on their  tremendous work.

We have heard about all the ways the House budget resolution will  deliver on President Trump's America First agenda. That includes making  a generational investment in our national defense.

The $100 billion in defense spending this resolution unlocks will  enable us to begin restoring American deterrence, prioritizing  lethality, and ensuring peace through strength.

It will help defend the DOD's mission at the border because border  security is national security.

It will help improve the quality of life for our servicemembers and  their families.

It will help us start to revitalize our defense industrial base and  restore readiness accounts to ensure we can fight tonight. It will also  help us start to expand U.S. shipbuilding capacity and enhance our  missile defense. It will also help begin restocking our Nation's  arsenal of critical munitions. It will help us position our military to  out-compete and out-innovate China.

Achieving the President's goal of peace through strength will  ultimately require us to get defense spending back above 4 percent of  GDP. However, none of that can happen unless we pass this budget  resolution today.

Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  resolution.
