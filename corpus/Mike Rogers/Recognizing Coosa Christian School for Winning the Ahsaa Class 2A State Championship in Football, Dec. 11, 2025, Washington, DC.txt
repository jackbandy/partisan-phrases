Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Coosa Christian School football team for winning the Alabama High  School Athletic Association (AHSAA) 2A State Championship.

At Protective Stadium in Birmingham, Alabama, on December 5, 2025,  the Coosa Christian School football team, with a record of 13-2,  secured the school's first state championship over Lanett High School  with a score of 29-22. Two touchdowns were scored in the final few  minutes of the game with a 20-yard touchdown run by Mac Long with 22  seconds left on the clock.
