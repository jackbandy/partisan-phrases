Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding  and for his leadership throughout this process.

Mr. Speaker, years of chronic underinvestment in our national  security have shattered American deterrence. It has allowed our  adversaries to threaten and challenge us in new and unprecedented ways.

That ends today because, with the passage of the One Big Beautiful  Bill Act, we begin implementing President Trump's peace through  strength agenda.

H.R. 1 includes a historic $150 billion investment in America's  national defense that will help us begin building the Golden Dome  missile defense shield to protect our homeland, begin to revitalize our  defense industrial base, help us secure our border because border  security is national security, begin to rebuild our munitions  stockpiles and critical mineral supply chains, and continue to improve  the quality of life of our servicemembers and their families.

With these investments, we will work to restore American deterrence  and build the ready, capable, and lethal fighting force President Trump  promised.

I commend the President, the Speaker, and Leader Thune for  prioritizing national security in this bill, and I thank Chairman  Wicker for his strong partnership throughout this process.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill.
