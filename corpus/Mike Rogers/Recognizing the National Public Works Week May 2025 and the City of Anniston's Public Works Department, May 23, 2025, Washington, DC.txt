Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Public Works Week, which takes place from May 18-24, 2025, and  to offer a special greeting to the City of Anniston Public Works  Department.

Our public works professionals dedicate their time and talent to  maintaining the infrastructure and facilities essential to public  health and our quality of life. In Anniston, that work is carried out  under the capable leadership of David Arnett and Supervisory staff who  oversees a dedicated team of 58 employees.

Without the efforts of the Public Works Department, essential  services we all rely on, like safe roads, clean public spaces and  functional public buildings--simply could not be provided. The Anniston  Public Works team works every day to rebuild, improve and safeguard our  transportation systems, structures and facilities.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing National Public Works Week  and thanking the City of Anniston's hardworking Public Works  professionals, engineers, managers and employees for their unwavering  commitment to help maintain our city's health, safety and advancing the  quality of life.
