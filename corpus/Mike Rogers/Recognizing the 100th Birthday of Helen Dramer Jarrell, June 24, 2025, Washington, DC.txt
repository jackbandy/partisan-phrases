Recognizing the 100th Birthday of Helen Dramer Jarrell


Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  birthday of Helen Dramer Jarrell. Helen will turn 100 years old on July  3rd.

Helen Dramer Jarrell was born the eighth child of the nine children  Ida Mae and Walter Hubert Waldrop on July 3, 1925. Helen had two  sisters and six brothers.

On January 16, 1943, Helen married Efton Harrison. They were blessed  with a baby girl, Helen Diane, on November 20, 1943. In 1945, Helen and  Efton divorced, and she raised Diane on her own. On June 10, 1948.  Helen remarried after meeting Jim Jarrell at work at the cotton mill.  They were married for 55 years until Jim passed away in 2003.

Helen has always had a servant's heart. She cared for her mother  until her passing and worked for many years at the Mary Brandon Nursing  Home in Oxford, Alabama, as a nurse's aide. Helen has two  grandchildren, six great-grandchildren and eight great-great  grandchildren. After retiring from the nursing home, Helen helped raise  her great-grandchildren and later helped at the Senior Center until she  retired at 90 years old.

On March 13, 2011, her daughter passed away. In December, she moved  into the Oxford House Apartments. She has made many friends in the past  14 years. She enjoys playing dominoes and exercising. Helen is a woman  of faith and loves her family deeply.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Helen on this milestone  and wishing her a very happy 100th birthday.
