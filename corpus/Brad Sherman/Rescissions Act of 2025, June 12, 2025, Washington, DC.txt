Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, last month Secretary Rubio responded to me  and said no one had died as a result of the gutting of USAID, but  Boston University School of Public Health shows us that 300,000 people  have died already because they were cut off from food and medicine for  tuberculosis, AIDS, and malaria.

The Center for Global Development says that 3.3 million preventable  deaths will occur because of the gutting of USAID, but they won't just  die there. Americans will die, too, because when malaria, tuberculosis,  and AIDS infect anyone in the world, those diseases replicate. They  mutate, and they migrate back here in more virulent forms.

Evan Anzoo, a 5-year-old boy, was cut off from his HIV medications in  February and died. He is the first to die at the hands of Elon Musk and  Donald Trump.

Let us remember Evan Anzoo.
