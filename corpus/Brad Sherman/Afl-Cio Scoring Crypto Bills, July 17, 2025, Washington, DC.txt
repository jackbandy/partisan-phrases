Afl-Cio Scoring Crypto Bills


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693667/afl-cio-scoring-crypto-bills


Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, today is the so-called culmination of  crypto week.

The AFL-CIO has sent a letter to every Member, saying that these  bills are an attack on working families and that they will score your  vote on these issues, and to vote ``no'' on both bills.

Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, this shows what Trump had to say about  crypto before he learned he could make money from it.

The bills we have allow the President and the Vice President to  sponsor crypto. It means they can print their electronic monopoly  money. China is buying $300 million, and Abu Dhabi has agreed to buy $2  billion of Trump coin or Trump stablecoin.

It allows for bailouts by the Fed. Jerome Powell won't bail out Trump  coin, but the next Fed Chair will.

It allows for the purchase with your U.S. tax dollars of Bitcoin or  Trump coin.

The third bill says that innovation is wonderful except if the U.S.  Government does it.

Vote ``no'' on all three bills.
