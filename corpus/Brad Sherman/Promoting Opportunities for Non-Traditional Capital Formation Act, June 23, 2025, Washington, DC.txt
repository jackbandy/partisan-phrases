Mr. SHERMAN.  Waters), the ranking member of our  full committee.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bill of my good friend  and ranking member of the Financial Services  Committee (Ms. Waters), which requires the SEC's Office of Small  Business Advocate to provide educational resources and host events to  promote capital-raising options for small businesses.

Her bill would also require the Small Business Office to coordinate  on an annual basis with State securities commissions to ensure both  Federal and State regulators are working as effectively and efficiently  as possible to address the needs of small businesses.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support Ms. Waters' bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
