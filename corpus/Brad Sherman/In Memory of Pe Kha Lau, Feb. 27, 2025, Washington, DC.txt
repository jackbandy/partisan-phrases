In Memory of Pe Kha Lau

Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, there is one other cut they made, and that  is they cut oxygen in a clinic for people who have fled the terrible  deaths in Burma/Myanmar. As a result, a 71-year-old woman, Pe Kha Lau,  died without her oxygen.

I ask that this House not only reflect on the other 10,000 people in  that refugee camp who are without medical care, but I ask that we  adjourn in silence in the memory of Pe Kha Lau  who died at the hands of Elon Musk and DOGE.
