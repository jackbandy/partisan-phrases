Baby Changing on Board Act

Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan  bill, the Baby Changing on Board Act. This is a simple, commonsense  bill, and it is long overdue.

Every parent deserves the basic dignity of a clean, safe space to  change their baby's diaper, no matter how they travel. Right now, many  long-distance trains can go for hours without a single stop.

Families riding Amtrak shouldn't have to change their babies on the  floor of a train car or in unsafe, unsanitary conditions. It is simply  unacceptable, and it is avoidable.

Mr. Speaker, my bill ensures that every new Amtrak train includes a  baby-changing table in at least one restroom per car, including ADA- compliant restrooms, because, let's be real, babies don't wait for  layovers when they need to be changed.

Mr. Speaker, I will paint the picture: You are holding your baby in  one arm, a diaper bag in the other, and probably some other stuff, too.  You make your way to the restroom with your kids and your bags, only to  realize there is no changing table. What are you supposed to do?

This is not a hypothetical. Millions of Americans ride Amtrak every  year, so those trains should work for everyone, including families with  young kids. Yet, on many of those trains, parents, usually moms, are  forced to make an impossible choice: change their child on a dirty  floor or seat, or just sit there and hope for the best.

Mr. Speaker, I have heard from families and parents in my northern  Illinois community who rely on Amtrak, and they are tired of getting  stuck in this impossible position on trains that don't have safe  facilities for the littlest riders.

Since this is a safety issue for these children, it is a public  health issue. Frankly, it is about dignity. These parents aren't asking  for luxury. They are asking for a clean, flat surface and some basic  respect.

Mr. Speaker, we all know diaper changes are not optional, which is  why safe baby-changing stations shouldn't be optional, either.

The Baby Changing on Board Act is about building a country where  every family has what they need to thrive. That starts with recognizing  that caregiving matters, parenting matters, and infrastructure should  actually support it.

This bill will not solve every challenge that parents face, but it is  a meaningful step toward a more family-friendly future.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  their support of this bill. In particular, I thank the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew) for working to introduce it with me. I urge  everyone in this Chamber to vote ``yes.''

Let's make changing a diaper on a train a little less gross and a lot  more humane.
