Breaking the Gridlock Act

Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill to  extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits and to put an end to the  Republican healthcare crisis.

This Republican majority wasted all of 2025 by refusing to extend the  tax credits in time to prevent the premium hikes that families across  the country are facing right now. Costs are outrageous. House Democrats  had to use a discharge petition to force them to do the right thing and  finally hold this vote.

We have heard a lot of confusing lies from the majority today. Mr.  Speaker, the truth is that the ACA tax credits from my legislation  work. They are incredibly popular, yet Republicans chose to let them  expire on December 31.

Today, we have a chance to fix their mistake, lower costs, and  protect care for millions of Americans. I urge a ``yes'' vote.

I thank Leader Jeffries, Mr. Neal, Speaker Pelosi, and Brandon Casey  for working with me on this.
