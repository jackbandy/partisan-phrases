Recognizing Girl Scouts of San Jacinto County, Texas At the United Nations 69th Commission on the Status of Women


Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Carolyn Durso,  Lana Ngyuen, Jaya Sheth, and Elise Peneguy from Girl Scouts of San  Jacinto, for their selection to represent Girl Scouts of the USA at the  United Nations' 69th Commission on the Status of Women.

Each year, Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) joins more than 5,000 women  and girls from around the world at the United Nations headquarters in  New York to participate in the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW).  Delegates representing GSUSA undergo a rigorous application process and  training to prepare them for their participation in the CSW. As  delegates, girls have the opportunity to engage with GSUSA's work  around global advocacy, learn about global issues, see firsthand how  global entities function, and have their voices heard on global issues  impacting girls and young women.

The CSW is a functional commission of the United Nations, dedicated  to shaping global standards on gender equality and the advancement and  empowerment of women and girls. Each year, national representatives of  Member States gather for a two-week session to evaluate progress on  gender equality, identify challenges, set global standards, and  formulate concrete policies to promote gender equality and the  advancement of women worldwide. As NGO Consultative members, GSUSA and  the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts participate to  bring the voice of girls and young women to the global stage.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Texas' Seventh Congressional District, I  congratulate these four young women on their selection. I thank them  for their leadership and send best wishes for their future endeavors.
