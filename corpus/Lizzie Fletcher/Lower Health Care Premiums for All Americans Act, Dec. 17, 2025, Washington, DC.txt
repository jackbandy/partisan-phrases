Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act

Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  disingenuously named Lower Healthcare Premiums for All Americans Act,  which does not, in fact, lower healthcare premiums for all Americans.

In response to political pressure from the very real healthcare  crisis before us, House Republicans have rushed this bill to the floor  without input from House Democrats and without going through the Energy  and Commerce Committee, as it should, or any actual legislative  process.

That might sound like it is in the weeds, but it is not. It is a  glaring failure to engage in real and meaningful policy that the  country is demanding. It is a response to the crisis that this  Republican Congress has created with the cuts it made earlier this year  and its failure to extend the premium tax credits, which we can fix  today. It is another example of this Congress failing to do its real  work.

We have to see the big picture here. Congress isn't working as it  should. Speaker Johnson and House Republicans are pushing this bill on  the floor to address a political crisis, not the healthcare crisis.

If House Republicans were serious, this bill would actually do  something to lower costs. Instead, the experts tell us this bill will  do nothing to decrease costs for Americans and nothing to curb junk  plans, but it does have a backdoor ban on abortion for people on ACA  plans.
