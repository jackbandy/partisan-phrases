Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, the era of woke and wasteful spending in  the people's government is over, and it is sad to watch this last-ditch  effort by my Democratic colleagues to fight for status quo. The status  quo is a cesspool of these leftist ideological programs that they would  say is soft power for America's interests or that they would say are  lifesaving services.

Mr. Speaker, the American people rejected this radical agenda. They  rejected the failed policies of my Democratic colleagues and their  unbridled spending that is bankrupting this country.

They sent President Trump here with a mandate and unified Republican  leadership to restore competent leadership, commonsense policies, and a  commitment to America First. There is nothing common sense or America  First about transgender comic books in Peru and all the other woke and  wasteful programs that my Democratic colleagues are fighting to defend.

Mr. Speaker, I am thankful that we have a President who has heard  from the people and is hell-bent on rightsizing this bureaucracy,  reining in this waste, and restoring fiscal sanity here in Washington,  D.C., not only for the taxpayers of today but for the future, for  prosperity, for freedom, and for our children.

This is why my colleagues are going to wander in the wilderness for  years to come. While that might benefit us politically, it is sad for  my country. I am sad as an American to see the defense of these crazy,  divisive, and dangerous ideological programs that my taxpayers in west  Texas are spending their hard-earned money for.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage and urge my colleagues on both sides to  support this rescissions package.
