Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026

Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Chairman, my amendment makes good on President  Trump's executive order to supercharge U.S. energy dominance by  harnessing advanced nuclear technologies.

In the heart of west Texas, at Abilene Christian University, we are  building a first-of-its-kind molten salt research reactor, a game  changer, no doubt, for making nuclear energy safer, more efficient, and  deployable.

This project, Mr. Chair, isn't just pie in the sky. It has generated  over $110 million in private investment, $112 million from the State of  Texas, and just last month, thanks to the leadership and vision of  Secretary Chris Wright, has received a conditional commitment from DOE  to provide its fuel.

This is the only molten salt reactor to ever receive a construction  permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the first research  reactor to  receive an NRC construction permit in over 30 years. All that is needed  now for this reactor to become operational is for the Federal  Government to do what it has always done for every research reactor in  the country for decades, which is to provide the fuel at no cost to the  university. That is to those reactors that have met those stringent  requirements.

Mr. Chair, this advanced nuclear technology is the best chance for  America to beat China in the very important nuclear power race and  secure our Nation's future energy security.

I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

God bless west Texas, and go Wildcats.
