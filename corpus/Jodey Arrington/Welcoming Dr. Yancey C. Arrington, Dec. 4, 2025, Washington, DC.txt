Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, what a joy and honor it is to hear the  voice of my older brother leading the people's House in prayer this  morning, continuing the sacred tradition since 1789 of calling on  Almighty God to consecrate our service for the good of the American  people.

Dr. Yancey Cook Arrington is an eighth-generation Texan who, for over  25 years, has served as the teaching pastor at Clear Creek Community  Church in the bay area of Houston.

He is joined today in the Chamber gallery by his lovely wife,  Jennefer. They are proud parents of my three nephews, Thatcher, Haddon,  and Beckett.

Mr. Speaker, I am eternally grateful for my brother's spiritual  influence over the years and have always been inspired by his  unwavering devotion to God's Word, to God's people, and to God's only  begotten Son, Jesus, our Lord.

Thanks be to God for men like Yancey, pastors and preachers  throughout these United States, who have dedicated their lives to  reminding us that America is great because God is good, and only--and  only--if we continue to trust in Him, the sovereign and eternal source  of that goodness, will America continue to be great.
