Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, as I listened to the ranking member talk  about China's need for U.S. energy, thank God it is that way and not  the other way around.

If we followed the green new manifesto, with the regulatory assault  on U.S. energy, and kept throwing hundreds of billions of dollars in  distorting Green New Deal energy subsidies, that is exactly what would  happen, we would wake up and be dependent on China for yet one more  critical product.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand alongside Chairman Guthrie and my  fellow west Texan, August Pfluger, in support of the Unlocking our  Domestic LNG Potential Act. America is the world's top exporter of LNG,  a vital pillar of both our economic strength and national security.

In an effort to placate the radical left, which I think was primarily  the motivation, the Biden administration, with its whole-of-government  assault on American energy, froze new LNG export permits with no  economic, environmental, or national security justification. That  reckless decision threatened billions of U.S. investments, undermined  our allies, and harmed energy-producing regions like west Texas.

Thankfully, we now have a President in the White House who is  committed to doing the right thing for the country, for our producers  and consumers, and committed to making American energy great again, not  weaponizing  this authority for purely ideological purposes.

This bill removes politics from the export permit process and secures  America's position as the world's energy superpower. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill and prevent future administrations from  threatening America's energy dominance. I thank the chairman again for  his leadership.
