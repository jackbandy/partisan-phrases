Supporting Safety Net Services

Mr. ARRINGTON. Well, first of all, Mr. Speaker, my Democratic  colleagues--maybe not all of them, but what I just heard--gave a  complete mischaracterization of the program integrity measures that  Republicans put in the big, beautiful bill. While the fraud, waste, and  abuse is on display for all Americans, not only in Minnesota, but all  across this country, we find it unacceptable. We believe that one of  our first responsibilities here in the people's House is to steward the  people's sacred treasure.

We put financial controls, anti-fraud measures, and, again, program  integrity reforms so that people who need these safety net programs can  avail themselves. They will not be drained anymore by people who are  illegally in this country, ineligible, or who are able-bodied adults  who just simply refuse to work. That is all. I mean, I think that is,  as we say, an 80-20 issue in this country.

No, people aren't starving and being thrown into the streets with no  support who need it. We are protecting and preserving not only the tax  dollar, but these important critical safety net services for the  American people who are eligible.

I am grateful for that leadership from the President and from my  Republican colleagues. I can't imagine that most Democrats throughout  this country actually support us protecting their tax dollars, too.
