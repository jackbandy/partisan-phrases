Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor and delight to hear  the familiar voice of my pastor, Elliott Powell, opening up the  people's House with prayer, a tradition that began at the very first  Congress in 1789.

Reverend Powell is the pastor of Westminster Presbyterian Church in  Lubbock, Texas, USA. He is joined today in the Chamber gallery by his  wife, Shannon Aycock Powell, and their three children: Lila, Charyssa,  and Adam; and his niece, Chloe.

My wife, Anne, and I have been blessed beyond measure to be a part of  the Westminster community, and we are exceedingly grateful for the  prayers, support, and friendship of our fellow parishioners.

Mr. Speaker, the 19-century French philosopher, Alexis de  Tocqueville, traveled across the United States in the early 1800s in  search of what he said was ``America's genius and greatness.'' He said  that it wasn't in the commodious harbors or the fertile fields, not the  public schools or institutions of higher learning, not the democratic  Congress even, or our matchless Constitution, believe it or not.

He said that it wasn't until I entered into the churches of America  and with their pulpits aflame with the Gospel of Jesus that I  understood ``the secret of her genius and power.''

That is when he coined that famous phrase: ``America is great because  America is good.''

Mr. Speaker, may God continue to bless America through the goodness  of His church and His many faithful under-shepherds like my dear  friend, Elliott Powell.
