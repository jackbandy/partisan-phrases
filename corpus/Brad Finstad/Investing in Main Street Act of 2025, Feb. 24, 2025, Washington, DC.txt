Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Williams for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 754, the Investing in  Main Street Act of 2025, legislation which I am honored to co-lead with  my colleague from California.

The Investing in Main Street Act of 2025 makes critical improvements  to the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, allowing Small Business  Investment Companies, or SBICs, to invest more resources in Main Street  businesses across southern Minnesota and across the country.

From Winona to Worthington, small business owners across the district  I have the honor to represent rely on early access to capital to start  and grow. This legislation will spur further investment in our business  community and assist businessowners in accessing the capital needed to  pursue the American Dream of owning and operating a small business.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Chu for partnering with me on  this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support  of the Investing in Main Street Act of 2025.
