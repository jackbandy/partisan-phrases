Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Rochester  Area  Chamber of Commerce and congratulate the organization on celebrating  160 years of support for local businesses and economic growth.

Since 1866, the Rochester Area Chamber of Commerce has been a strong  advocate for the business community, helping build the Rochester area  into the epicenter of economic activity that it is today.

For more than a century and a half, the chamber has supported  generations of entrepreneurs, employers, community members, and  businesses across the Rochester community, shaping the economic  development in our region with strong business advocacy, investments in  workforce and professional development, and meaningful networking  opportunities.

Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the work of the chamber members and  their leaders and for the many contributions to fostering the  connections that make the Rochester community a great place to live,  work, and do business.

I congratulate the entire Rochester Area Chamber of Commerce family  on celebrating this incredible milestone, and I wish them continued  success for the next 160 years and beyond.
