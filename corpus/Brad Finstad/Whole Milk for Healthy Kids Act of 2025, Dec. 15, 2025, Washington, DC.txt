Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  yielding.

I rise today in support of S. 222, the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids  Act, which I was proud to help introduce alongside Chairman Thompson.

As a fourth generation farmer raising the fifth generation, I know  firsthand the importance of ensuring families have access to healthy  and nutritious milk products. As a father of seven, my wife and I have  purchased our fair share of milk on trips to the grocery store.

This legislation has been in the making for a long time, and it is  past due that we send it to the President's desk and make this the law  of the land.

Moving forward, every child across southern Minnesota and the rest of  the Nation will have access to whole and 2 percent milk products when  they go through the school lunch line. Moreover, this legislation will  support our dairy farmers and the rural communities they call home.  Farming is one of the most honorable and noble professions this country  has to offer, and southern Minnesota is the home to some of the best  dairy farmers and manufacturers in the world.

This legislation is a win-win for school-age children and dairy  farmers across this country. I am proud that we now, once again, can  say loudly: ``Milk: It does a body good.''

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
