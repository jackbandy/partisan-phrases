Recognizing Brian Buhr


Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brian Buhr, one  of my former professors at the University of Minnesota, who is stepping  down after 13 years of serving as the dean of the College of Food,  Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences and the director of the  Minnesota Agriculture Experiment Station.

As our State's premier institution for agricultural education, the U  of M has a longstanding reputation of excellence in developing and  training future ag leaders.

Thanks to Dean Buhr's leadership, CFANS has become a global leader in  ag education, offering a diverse range of studies for 14 undergraduate  majors, 25 minors, and 13 graduate programs.

By working shoulder to shoulder with farmers, agribusiness, and  public policymakers, Dean Buhr has worked to cultivate a student  experience that combines classroom learning with cutting-edge research  and public engagement, preparing CFANS graduates to become the world's  ag leaders of tomorrow.

I thank Brian for his years of service to the College of Food,  Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences and the many contributions  he has made to the U of M's legacy in ag education. I wish him all the  best as he starts this new chapter.
