Recognizing Vannah Heil


Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding  young leader from southern Minnesota, Vannah Heil of St. James. This  November, Vannah will join more than 700 youth from across the Nation  at the National 4-H Congress in Atlanta.

Vannah is one of only nine students selected to represent Minnesota  at this prestigious event, where she will take part in workshops,  service projects, and opportunities to strengthen her leadership and  communication skills. As a Minnesota 4-H State Ambassador, Vannah has  already shown her commitment to building stronger communities and  inspiring her peers.

The 4-H program has a long tradition of equipping young people with  the tools they need to succeed in school, careers, and civic life.  Vannah embodies the very best of that mission. I am proud to represent  her and look forward to seeing the great things she will accomplish in  the years ahead.
