Mr. FRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Navy Club of  Georgetown, South Carolina, as it celebrates an extraordinary  milestone, its 100th anniversary. Since 1925, this group has united  veterans of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. From the shores of  South Carolina to all around the world, they've served our Nation with  honor.

For generations, the Navy Club has remained deeply embedded in the  life of the Georgetown community--supporting Navy Junior Reserve  Officers, honoring naval heritage, and fostering a spirit of unity  among veterans and civilians alike.

What began in 1925, as a gathering of like-minded servicemembers, has  grown into a lasting institution, one that continues to support  generations of veterans through friendship, mentorship, and tradition.  The Club's annual shrimp dinners have become a beloved local occasion,  bringing people together to share stories, remember the past, and  strengthen community ties.

The Navy Club's mission is clear: to honor the proud legacy of naval  service in South Carolina. Through veteran outreach, youth engagement,  and the preservation of time-honored customs, it safeguards our  maritime traditions for the future.

As we mark this centennial, we are reminded of the enduring values  that define our armed forces: honor, courage, and commitment. The Navy  Club's story is one of lasting impact, civic pride, and a devotion to  service that transcends generations.

Over the decades, it has built a strong foundation of fellowship and  support, uplifting those who served, commemorating those we've lost,  and building bridges within Georgetown. Its events have become more  than social gatherings--they are touchpoints of history, community, and  service.

Their passion for service, fellowship, and patriotism continues to  inspire the next generation. On behalf of the people of South  Carolina's Seventh District, I thank them and congratulate them on 100  years.
