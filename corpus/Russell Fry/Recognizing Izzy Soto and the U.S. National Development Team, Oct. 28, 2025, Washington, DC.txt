Recognizing Izzy Soto and the U.S. National Development Team


Mr. FRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Izzy Soto and her  teammates on the United States National Development Team for winning a  gold medal at the 2025 Pan American Inline Hockey Championships in  Oaxtepec, Morelos, Mexico.

Representing our Nation with pride and determination, the team  demonstrated remarkable resilience by winning four consecutive games to  capture the championship title. I am especially proud to note that Izzy  is from Myrtle Beach and was the only member of the Women's Junior Team  from South Carolina, making her achievement even more meaningful for  our state and the Grand Strand community.

Their accomplishment reflects the best of American spirit, teamwork,  and perseverance. Competing at this level not only showcased their  skill but also provided invaluable experience playing alongside and  against some of the best athletes in the world.

I commend Izzy, her teammates, and their coaches for their dedication  and sportsmanship, and I extend my best wishes to all those continuing  to compete in future tournaments. Their success brings great pride to  the United States and serves as an inspiration to young athletes  everywhere.
