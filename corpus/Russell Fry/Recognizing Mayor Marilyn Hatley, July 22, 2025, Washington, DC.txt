Mr. FRY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an incredible  public servant and a great friend, Mayor Marilyn Hatley of Myrtle  Beach, South Carolina, who is retiring after two decades of public  service.

Marilyn has been a constant force for many years, leading with  strength, dedication, and a genuine heart for the people of North  Myrtle Beach.

She is a pioneer. She has worked harder than anyone. In fact, she is  one of the hardest-working women that I know to make North Myrtle Beach  not just a premier tourist destination but a place we are all proud to  call home.

She has championed beach renourishment, expanded recreational  opportunities, and helped build major infrastructure, all while keeping  North Myrtle Beach on budget with some of the lowest taxes and crime  rates in South Carolina.

The entire city is proud of the lasting impact Marilyn has made on  North Myrtle Beach. I know she will enjoy this next chapter. She has  earned it.
