Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025


Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this isn't about spending $46 billion; it  is about saving $20 billion.

The Democrats' partisan supersized IRS funding is something we have  been battling over for a couple of years now. It is a textbook example  of the type of out-of-control spending that President Trump and  Republicans have rightly opposed.

Rather than working together to help the IRS solve its massive  taxpayer service and IT shortcomings, the misnamed Inflation Reduction  Act went to fund untargeted and heavily handed enforcement improvement.

As I had mentioned at the time, the last thing hard-working Americans  need is an IRS funding bloat that disproportionately hurts them.

I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment to provide the  IRS nearly two times its entire annual budget in unaccountable  enforcement dollars.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1273
