Brown Statement On News That Fannie, Freddie Will Offer Borrower Relief


ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs -- released the following statement following  news that Fannie and Freddie would suspend foreclosures and offer borrowers relief.

"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing what everyone should be doing -- offering borrowers relief if they fall behind on their payments during this pandemic and giving them tools to get back on track when it's over. Every homeowner should have the same opportunity. That's why we need to pass my legislation which would protect hardworking homeowners facing economic hardship due to natural disasters or a public health crisis. We must do more to ensure that Americans can focus on keeping themselves and their family safe during times of crisis," said Senator Brown.

Earlier this week Brown introduced legislation that would protect American families who are facing financial hardship due to the economic consequences of coronavirus from falling behind on their loan or facing foreclosure.
