Crapo Statement on Iran Airstrikes


U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) made the following statement regarding Iran's missile airstrikes against U.S.-Iraqi bases last night: 

"I strongly condemn Iran's continued attacks on Americans and our allies, including last night's airstrikes on U.S. troops in Iraq.  I will continue to monitor the situation in Iraq and the Middle East.  My prayers remain with our American military and civilian personnel abroad for their continued safety.  

"Iran's nefarious behavior is a threat to U.S. national security and it has gone on for too long.  President Trump's decisive recent actions have demonstrated that the United States will not follow a path of appeasement when it comes to attacking our personnel or allies.  President Trump has clearly stated he does not want to escalate war with Iran, but the United States will defend its citizens and its national security interests.  As further actions by Iran play out, I will work with my colleagues and the President to ensure the U.S. responds accordingly and with the best interests of Americans in mind."
