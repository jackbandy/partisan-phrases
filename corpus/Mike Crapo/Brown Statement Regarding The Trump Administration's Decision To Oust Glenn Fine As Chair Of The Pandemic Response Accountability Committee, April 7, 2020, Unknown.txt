Brown Statement Regarding The Trump Administration's Decision To Oust Glenn Fine As Chair Of The Pandemic Response Accountability Committee


U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) -- ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs -- released the following statement following the news that the Trump Administration has removed Glenn Fine from his post as Chair of Pandemic Response Accountability Committee:

"In another erratic move by the President, the Inspector General he appointed two weeks ago to oversee the pandemic response has now been removed. This inexplicable action raises even more questions about how the president is handling this crisis, what he's potentially hiding, and how Congress will conduct essential oversight," said Senator Brown.
