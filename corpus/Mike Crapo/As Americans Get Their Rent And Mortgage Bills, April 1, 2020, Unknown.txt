As Americans Get Their Rent And Mortgage Bills, Brown Pushes For More Help For Homeowners And Renters During Coronavirus Pandemic


U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) -- ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs -- released the following statement today (April 1st) when rent and mortgage payments are due for millions of households whose jobs have been affected by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.

"Many Americans have their rent and mortgage payments due today. Too many won't have the income to pay them. This pandemic is a painful reminder of how vulnerable millions of workers are to a single setback -- whether that's a missed paycheck, a broken down car, or an expensive medical bill," said Senator Brown. "We need to act now and in the months ahead to keep families in their homes and to stabilize our housing market. When Congress returns I will be introducing new legislation to provide emergency rental assistance to help renters stay in their homes even after eviction bans expire.  I will also continue my fight to provide direct assistance to homeowners so that they can weather this crisis without losing their homes. We cannot afford to allow this health crisis to become a national housing crisis for millions of families and individuals.  We need to give Americans tools to rebuild and recover from this pandemic."
