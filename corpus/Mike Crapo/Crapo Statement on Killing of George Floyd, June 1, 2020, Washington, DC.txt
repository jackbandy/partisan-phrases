Crapo Statement on Killing of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor


U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) issued the following statement on the recent killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor:

"The senseless killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor have rightfully hurt and angered Americans across the country. Their deaths should be investigated and dealt with to the fullest extent of the law. I endorse the right of Americans to exercise their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble and demand of redress for their grievances, and I condemn acts of violence that thwart and exploit that right. The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on police use of force, and I pledge to work to find a path forward for our country. I continue to pray for the safety of law enforcement protecting their communities and those gathered peacefully to demand justice."
