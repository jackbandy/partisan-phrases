Ms. LEE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome His  All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, Archbishop of  Constantinople-New Rome and spiritual leader of more than 300 million  Orthodox Christians worldwide, to Washington, D.C.

This week, His All-Holiness is visiting our Nation's Capital to  receive the Templeton Prize, the most prestigious international award  in religion and science. With this honor, he joins the ranks of Mother  Teresa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and the Dalai Lama. The recognition  reflects not only his scholarship and spiritual leadership but his  unwavering witness for peace, human dignity, and care for creation.

For more than three decades as Ecumenical Patriarch, His All-Holiness  has been a global voice for reconciliation among peoples of different  faiths and traditions. He has also been one of the first religious  leaders to insist that harming the environment is not simply a failure  of policy but a moral failing. His leadership reminds us that  stewardship of our planet is inseparable from justice for our  communities.

His leadership has been honored across the world. In 1997, he  received the Congressional Gold Medal here in the United States, and he  has been recognized internationally as one of the most influential  figures of our time. Yet the true measure of his ministry lies not in  awards, but in his call for peace over division, compassion over  violence, and responsibility over indifference. As he has said, ``We  have it in our power either to increase the hurt inflicted on our world  or to contribute toward its healing. The choice is ours.''

His life's work reminds us that building a better world depends on  moral courage, the same courage we need to meet our own fights for  justice at home.

The people of Pennsylvania's 12th District, including the faithful of  the Presentation of Christ Greek Orthodox Church in East Pittsburgh and  St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Pittsburgh, are proud to share  in this welcome.

I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary  ministry of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and in congratulating him  on this well-deserved honor.
