Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2025


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699822/financial-stability-oversight-council-improvement-act-of-2025


Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3682) to amend the Financial Stability Act of 2010  to require the Financial Stability Oversight Council to consider  alternative approaches before determining that a U.S. nonbank financial  company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System, and for other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3682

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Financial Stability       Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2025''.       SEC. 2. FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL.

Section 113 of the Financial Stability Act of 2010 (12       U.S.C. 5323) is amended--

(1) in subsection (a)--

(A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``The Council'' and       inserting ``Subject to paragraph (3), the Council''; and

(B) by adding at the end the following:

``(3) Initial determination.--The Council may not vote on a       proposed determination with respect to a U.S. nonbank       financial company under paragraph (1) unless the Council       first determines, in consultation with the company and the       primary financial regulatory agency with respect to the       company, that a different action by the Council or the agency       (including the application of new or heightened standards and       safeguards under section 120), or by the company under a       written plan that is submitted promptly to the Council, is       impracticable or insufficient to mitigate the threat that       material financial distress at the company, or the nature,       scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix       of the activities of the company, could pose to the financial       stability of the United States.''; and

(2) in subsection (f)(1), by striking ``subsection (e)''       and inserting ``subsections (a)(3) and (e)''.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this fine bill offered by Mr.  Foster and Mr. Huizenga. It is a bipartisan bill, Mr. Speaker, the  Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act, after a decade  of collaboration across four Presidential administrations that has led  to this consensus on this measure.

The Financial Stability Oversight Council, FSOC, created in the  aftermath of the global financial crisis, plays an important role in  understanding and examining nonbanks, and that is because many  nonbanks, large nonbanks, are not subject to the same regulations and  supervision as traditional banks, so the Congress created this process.

Unfortunately, its own structure, as composed by political  appointees, can inhibit the Council's ability to effectively critique  fellow agencies or itself when monitoring potential systemic risk to  financial stability by a large nonbank.

H.R. 3682 requires the FSOC to explore alternatives to designating a  nonbank for enhanced supervision by the Federal Reserve. This is at the  heart of the collaboration in this bill.

If a nonbank were improperly designated, it could hinder innovation  and make the United States' financial system less competitive as a  result.

This bill will impose rigorous procedural guardrails and enhance due  diligence protections and a stronger analytic framework before a firm  can be designated as a systemically important financial institution, or  SIFI.

I thank, again, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster) and the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) for their collaboration in  producing this solid, bipartisan bill that will protect U.S.  competitiveness and deliver financial stability consistent with FSOC's  mission, but do that in a thoughtful, analytic way that can support a  review of systemic risk.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO  estimate on this bill.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois and his  collaboration with the gentleman from Michigan to tackle and bring  definition to something that has been a big issue for the past decade,  which is what is the proper method, style, and oversight of designating  a nonbank a systemically important financial institution.

I congratulate them on their bipartisan work. For the reasons I have  stated, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.
