Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome today's  guest chaplain, my friend, Rabbi Pinchus Ciment.

Rabbi Ciment is the director of Chabad Lubavitch of Arkansas in  Little Rock and is currently the longest serving rabbi in our State.

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and moved to Little Rock with  his wife in 1992.

Rabbi Ciment has lectured on matters in Judaism at several  universities in Arkansas and has been a frequent author in the ``Ask  the Clergy'' section of our statewide newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat- Gazette. He studied at the Rabbinical Seminary in Morristown, New  Jersey, and the Central Lubavitch Yeshiva in Brooklyn, New York,  receiving his rabbinical ordination in 1990.

Rabbi Ciment is a devoted husband to Estie and a proud father of 10  children.

I extend my heartfelt thanks to Rabbi Ciment for delivering a  beautiful opening prayer.

Mr. Speaker, I wish him, his family, and Chabad Lubavitch of Arkansas  continued success in serving the central Arkansas community.
