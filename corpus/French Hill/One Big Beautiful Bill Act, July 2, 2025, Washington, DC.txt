Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding  time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1, the One Big  Beautiful Bill Act. For too long, government spending has gone  unchecked.

Last November, American voters sent a clear message. We need to rein  in government spending. Our Financial Services title exceeds our $1  billion budget instruction by over $600 million. It caps the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau's budget authority by nearly half.

It rescinds unobligated and unused funds from the SEC's reserve fund  and HUD's Green and Resilient Retrofit Program.

It targets $1 billion for strategic use under the Defense Production  Act to ensure that America can meet its national security supply chain  requirements for the 21st century.

Overall, this bill stops a huge tax increase for our working families  in Arkansas. It spurs major investments for small businesses. It gives  law enforcement the tools they need to secure our southwest border. It  strengthens energy security. It reduces government spending.

Mr. Speaker, it delivers on the promises that we made to American  voters. I strongly support this bill, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.
