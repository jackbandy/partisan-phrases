Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Arrington for yielding  this time.

Mr. Chair, what is irresponsible, to those watching this debate, is  the truth about the Biden-Harris policies, that when you combine  irresponsible fiscal policy in this Nation over the past 4 years and an  irresponsible monetary policy--what is irresponsible, Mr. Chair, is the  fact that our families are suffering from inflation, the highest in 40  years. It takes $1.21 for what cost $1 just 4 years ago.

The resolution before us changes the direction. It delivers on  President Trump's agenda to put the American people first. This  resolution does protect the American people from the largest tax  increase in American history.

Let's set the record straight: The top 1 percent are paying more in  taxes than they have ever paid in the history of the country. They pay  45 percent of all the taxes in this country, and 50 percent of us are  paying the least amount of tax they have ever paid in American history.

This bill goes on to support border security and national defense,  which President Trump campaigned on and Republicans campaigned on, and  it reins in wasteful spending. It reduces our long-term debt to GDP.

In the Financial Services Committee, we are pleased to follow the  direction of the House Budget Committee and deliver on spending reforms  by cutting back one of the most wasteful agencies that we have, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
