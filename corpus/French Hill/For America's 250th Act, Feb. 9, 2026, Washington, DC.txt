https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699867/for-americas-250th-act


Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5616) to amend title 31, United States Code, to  require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue $2.50  numismatic coins and $2.50 circulating coins, and for other purposes,  as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5616

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``$2.50 for America's 250th       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration       of Independence was a turning point in the history of the       United States and the world that warrants national       recognition.

(2) The 68th Congress celebrated this fact by authorizing       the United States Mint to commemorate the 150th anniversary       of American independence by issuing $2.50 coins.

(3) The issuance of a $2.50 anniversary coin for the 250th       anniversary serves as a historically grounded continuation of       this numismatic tradition and connects Americans today with a       legacy of national celebration through coinage.

(4) The design and distribution of this coin offer a unique       and accessible opportunity for the American people to engage       with and take personal ownership of their national heritage       through a tangible and lasting tribute.

(5) Every citizen deserves the opportunity to acquire such       a coin as a means to connect to the founding principles of       liberty, democracy, and self-governance.

(6) In addition to the congressionally authorized       activities already planned by the mint, this new anniversary       coin will serve not only as a lasting tribute to the founding       generation and the ideals we share with them to this day, but       also as a unifying and educational gesture on the occasion of       the semiquincentennial.       SEC. 3. MINTING AND ISSUING OF $2.50 NUMISMATIC COINS.

(a) In General.--Section 5112 of title 31, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill sponsored by the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), my good friend, the $2.50 for  America's 250th Act.

The greatest experiment in the history of the world, the United  States of America, is still going stronger than ever, and 2026 marks  our Nation's 250th birthday, an incredible feat as our Founders came  together, found common ground, and voted to declare independence from  Great Britain.

Over the past 250 years, America has embodied the shining city on the  hill that John Winthrop envisioned in his famous 1630 sermon. Grounded  in the ideas at the heart of the Declaration that all men are created  equal and that governments derive their power not from the divine right  of kings but from the consent of the people, the United States has made  the world more free and more prosperous over our two-and-a-half  centuries.

To celebrate our semiquincentennial, H.R. 5616 will authorize the  United States Secretary of the Treasury to issue special $2.50  numismatic coins. This continues a long tradition of marking  significant milestones with coins that give everyday Americans tangible  reminders of these historic moments.

Mr. Aderholt and I are both old enough, Madam Speaker, to recall the  bicentennial tradition of that feature of special coin or printed bill  issuance and how our grandfathers instilled in us American history and  a love of country.

We were not there for the first $2.50 coin authorized under the  legislation that we have today because it marked the 150th anniversary  of the United States a century ago.

America is the land of freedom and the beacon of hope for many around  the world, something that all of us who have the privilege and honor of  living here should never take for granted, and certainly no one on this  House floor who has the privilege of representing our citizens takes  for granted.

Every day I wake up proud to be an American, and I thank Mr. Aderholt  for his contribution in celebrating 250 years of independence.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a CBO  estimate for this bill.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), the author of  this bill for our semiquincentennial, and the chair of the House Labor,  Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee  on Appropriations.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Aderholt for using this historic precedent  to, again, have a numismatic memory of our semiquincentennial with this  $2.50 coin. I commend him for his work, his loyalty to this country,  and for his service to the people in Alabama.

Mr. Speaker, for all the reasons I explained earlier, I urge my  colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
