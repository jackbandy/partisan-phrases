Middle Market Ipo Cost Act


Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3395) to require the Comptroller General of the  United States to carry out a study of the costs associated with small-  and medium-sized companies to undertake initial public offerings, as  amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3395

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Middle Market IPO Cost       Act''.       SEC. 2. STUDY ON IPO FEES.

(a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States,       in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission       and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, shall carry       out a study of the costs associated with small- and medium-      sized companies to undertake initial public offerings       (``IPOs''). In carrying out such study, the Comptroller       General shall--

(1) consider the direct and indirect costs of an IPO,       including--

(A) fees of accountants, underwriters, and any other       outside advisors with respect to the IPO;

(B) compliance with Federal and State securities laws at       the time of the IPO; and

(C) such other IPO-related costs as the Comptroller General       may consider;

(2) compare and analyze the costs of an IPO with the costs       of obtaining alternative sources of financing and of       liquidity;

(3) consider the impact of such costs on capital formation;

(4) analyze the impact of these costs on the availability       of public securities of small- and medium-sized companies to       retail investors; and

(5) analyze trends in IPOs over a time period the       Comptroller General determines is appropriate to analyze IPO       pricing practices, considering--

(A) the number of IPOs;

(B) how costs for IPOs have evolved over time for       underwriters, investment advisory firms, and other       professions for services in connection with an IPO;

(C) the number of brokers and dealers active in       underwriting IPOs;

(D) the different types of services that underwriters and       related persons provide before and after a small- or medium-      sized company IPO and the factors impacting IPOs costs;

(E) changes in the costs and availability of investment       research for small- and medium-sized companies; and

(F) the impacts of litigation and its costs on being a       public company.

(b) Report.--Not later than the end of the 360-day period       beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Comptroller General of the United States shall issue a report       to the Congress containing all findings and determinations       made in carrying out the study required under subsection (a)       and any administrative or legislative recommendations the       Comptroller General may have.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3395, the Middle Market IPO  Cost Act. Currently, companies have two options for raising capital: an  initial public offering, an IPO, or a private offering. Fewer companies  are choosing to take the IPO path because of the up-front costs of  going public, as well as the high operating costs public companies  experience due to SEC reporting rules.

Before a company files for an IPO, they often spend tens of millions  of dollars to gather and compile information to submit to the SEC.  These mandatory information requirements exclude or dissuade many  companies from even considering an initial public offering.

The study required by Mr. Himes' bill will help Congress and the  market better understand the costs associated with small- and medium- sized companies going public through the IPO process.

I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO  estimate for this bill.        H.R. 3395, MIDDLE MARKET IPO COST ACT, AS REPORTED BY THE HOUSE              COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES ON JUNE 3, 2025 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                            By fiscal year, millions  of                                                      dollars--                                          -------------------------------                                             2025    2025-2030  2025-2035 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Direct Spending (Outlays)...............        0          0          0 Revenues................................        0          0          0 Increase or Decrease (-) in the Deficit.        0          0          0 Spending Subject to Appropriation               *          1         **  (Outlays).............................. ------------------------------------------------------------------------  * = between zero and $500,000.  ** = not estimated.

Increases net direct spending in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036? No.

Increases on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive       10-year periods beginning in 2036? No.

Statutory pay-as-you-go procedures apply? No.

Mandate Effects:

Contains intergovernmental mandate? No.

Contains private-sector mandate? No.

H.R. 3395 would require the Government Accountability       Office (GAO), in consultation with the Securities and       Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory       Authority, to study and report to the Congress within one       year of enactment on the costs small- and medium-sized       companies incur when conducting initial public offerings       (IPOs). An IPO is a process where a private company offers       shares to the public for the first time, making it a publicly       traded company.

Based on the cost of similar activities, CBO estimates that       implementing H.R. 3395 would cost $l million over the 2025-      2026 period. Any related spending would be subject to the       availability of appropriated funds.

The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew       Pickford. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfbss,       Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                             Director, Congressional Budget Office.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote from both  sides of  the aisle, and I yield back the balance of my time.
