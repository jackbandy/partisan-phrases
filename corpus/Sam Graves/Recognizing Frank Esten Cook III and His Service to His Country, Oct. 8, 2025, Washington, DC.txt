Recognizing Frank Esten Cook III and His Service to His Country


Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Frank Esten Cook  III and his service to his country. Frank was born in Washington, D.C.  on March 25, 1963, and passed away in Richmond, Kentucky on September  13, 2025. He was an avid outdoorsman, boater, and hunter.

Frank was a U.S. Army veteran and served his country as a  commissioned officer. His first love, however, was serving as a non- commissioned officer as a Blackhawk helicopter Crew Chief with the  160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR).

In 1994, Frank was awarded Night Stalker Soldier of the Year for  Outstanding Individual Contribution to Army Special Operation Aviation.  This award was sponsored by Robertson Research Group, Inc.

Frank was tough in every sense of the word, but he also cared deeply  for his friends, family, and country. He would give you the shirt off  his back, if you really needed it. He taught his family the value of  being tough and rolling with what life gives you. He was fond of the  saying ``rub some dirt on it, you'll be fine'', which carries weight  with everyone who knew him.

Frank took immense pride in being a Night Stalker. These men and  women are some of the best rotary wing aviator crews in the world.  Frank's attention to detail, his skills, and his tenacity drove him to  join this elite regiment.

Frank was very proud of both of his sons, Frank E. Cook IV (Frankie)  of Jersey City, NJ and Anthony Guidi of Aloha. OR. As Frankie says,  ``My dad wouldn't want anyone to cry over him.'' So today Mr. Speaker,  we won't cry over him but rather honor this man as a veteran, a father,  a brother, a son, and an American.
