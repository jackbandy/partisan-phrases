Cassidy Votes in Favor of Coronavirus Stimulus Package


U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) joined the majority of the Senate in passing the CARES Act -- the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act -- that provides $2 trillion in emergency assistance for American families and businesses.

"The Coronavirus epidemic has damaged our physical and our economic health. This bill supports the economic health of individuals, families and employers. It also advances the fight to make us safe from the disease," said Dr. Cassidy.
