Cassidy Announces $778,000 for Port of New Orleans


U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) announced today that the Port of New Orleans is receiving more than $778,000 in federal highway funds to improve the port.

Port intends to build and install more storage area for cargo to be held before it is loaded onto ships. This will increase the use of barges and traffic at the port.

"Now is the time to invest in infrastructure. Louisiana ports are the gateways to the world. This grant allows the Port of New Orleans to increase its storage ability so that more goods will flow through the port and onto the global marketplace," said Dr. Cassidy.
