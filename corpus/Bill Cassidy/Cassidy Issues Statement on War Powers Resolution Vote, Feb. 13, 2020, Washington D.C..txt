Cassidy Issues Statement on War Powers Resolution Vote


U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) today released the following statement regarding his vote on the War Powers resolution:

"This resolution protects our constitutional system of checks and balances while allowing presidents to defend our country from attacks. If this resolution was in effect at the beginning of the year, President Trump would have still been able to carry out strikes against Iran and General Soleimani (which I supported). The founders gave Congress the power to declare war under Article 1 of the Constitution; we should fulfill this responsibility," said Dr. Cassidy.
