Cassidy's Bill to Help Veterans During Coronavirus Outbreak Headed to President Trump


Legislation originally cosponsored by U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) that protects student veterans' housing allowance during the coronavirus outbreak is heading to President Trump's desk for his signature to make it law.

Veterans using their GI Bill benefits to attend classes receive a base housing allowance to live on campus. Online students receive only 25 percent of those benefits. Coronavirus has forced many universities to shift to online classes, meaning that veterans receiving housing allowance could see their benefits slashed. 

The bill would allow for on-campus veterans to receive their full housing allowance even if they have shifted to online classes in the wake of coronavirus. The Senate and House have passed the bill, and President Trump is expected to sign it.

"Veterans should not lose the benefits they have earned because of coronavirus. This bill ensures veterans can focus on their educations without worrying about housing," said Dr. Cassidy, a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
