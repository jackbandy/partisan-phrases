Cassidy Introduces Senate Resolution Congratulating LSU on National Championship Victory


U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and graduate of Louisiana State University, filed a resolution in the U.S. Senate today congratulating LSU for winning the NCAA College Football National Championship.

The resolution recognizes the feats of the Tigers' historic 15-0 season that culminated with LSU bringing college football's ultimate prize home to Baton Rouge. This season marked the Tigers' first undefeated season since 1958 and first national championship since 2007.

"Think about the storylines of this season: Coach Orgeron was everybody's second choice and now is the national coach of the year. Joe Burrow was riding the pines at Ohio State and won the Heisman Trophy at LSU. Many of our best players, like Justin Jefferson and Clyde Edwards-Helaire, were overlooked as recruits. This LSU team's is a story about folks hitting obstacles and overcoming those obstacles. If you cannot draw inspiration from that, then you cannot be inspired. The LSU Tigers have made the entire state of Louisiana very proud," said Dr. Cassidy.
