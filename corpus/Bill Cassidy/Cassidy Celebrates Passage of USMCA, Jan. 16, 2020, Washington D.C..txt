Cassidy Celebrates Passage of USMCA


U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) today voted for passing the US-Mexico-Canada Act (USMCA), a huge accomplishment that will benefit American farmers, manufacturers and energy workers for years to come.

"This is a landmark win for every American farmer, manufacturer and energy worker who does business with Canada and Mexico. This deal leads to billions of dollars of growth in Louisiana's top industries, which will directly benefit the people of our state. President Trump committed to modernizing our trade agreements, and he is following through with that promise," said Dr. Cassidy.

Louisiana exports $12.7 billion in goods and services to Canada and Mexico, according to the U.S. trade representative's office. Top exports include petroleum products, chemicals, agriculture products and oil and gas.

The USMCA is expected to raise U.S. real GDP by more than $68 billion and create 176,000 new jobs. Total American exports to Canada and Mexico. Are expected to increase by $33.3 billion. 

This is the first U.S. free trade agreement with a digital trade chapter, which provides intellectual property protections and the ability to continue growing the digital economy.
