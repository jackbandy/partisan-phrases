Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise on a very sad occasion,  recognizing Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office Deputy Christopher  Ohlmeyer, a motorcycle officer who was just killed in a traffic motor  vehicle accident. His death will be felt by his family, his fellow  officers, and our entire State.

Christopher Ohlmeyer was a great officer, but he was more than the  uniform he wore. He was a husband, a father, and a friend.

The way that he died, though tragic, is a testament to the way he  lived. Deputy Ohlmeyer was struck as he was serving as a motorcycle  escort for a funeral procession and was hit by a car from behind. In  his final moments, he was serving someone else.

I am told that those who did not have a family were invited to be  part of his; that he brought people together; that he was deeply  committed to serving his community.

May we pray for his family, remember his sacrifice, and strive to  live our legacy and our lives in whatever way we can, as he did his.

With gratitude for Deputy Ohlmeyer's service and remembrance of his  life, Mr. President, I ask that we pause for a moment to remember  Deputy Ohlmeyer.
