Cassidy Statement on Trump Designating Antifa as Domestic Terrorists


U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) issued the following statement today after President Trump designated Antifa as a domestic terror organization.

"Looting, destroying personal property, and violence cannot be tolerated. Antifa seized upon a movement of legitimate grievances to promote violence and anarchy, working against justice for all. The President is right to recognize the destructive role of Antifa by designating them domestic terrorists," Dr. Cassidy said.

In July 2019, Cassidy and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced a resolution in the Senate to condemn the violent acts of Antifa and to designate the group a domestic terror organization.
