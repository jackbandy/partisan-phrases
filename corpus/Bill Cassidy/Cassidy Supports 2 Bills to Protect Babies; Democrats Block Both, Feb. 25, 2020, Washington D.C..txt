Cassidy Supports 2 Bills to Protect Babies; Democrats Block Both


U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) released the following statement after Senate Democrats blocked two bills to protect babies who can feel pain from abortions and babies who survive abortions.

The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act requires that medical services be provided for babies who survive abortions. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act bans abortions after 20 weeks when babies can feel pain inside the womb. Cassidy cosponsored both bills.

"Life is precious. This was central to my medical practice. If a child can live outside the womb, she should not die by abortion. Congress should pass these bills, which recognize that life is precious," said Dr. Cassidy.

A February 2019 YouGov poll found that an overwhelming percentage of Americans support medical protections for viable babies. The poll showed 82 percent of Americans oppose removing medical care for a viable child after birth, and 77 percent of pro-abortion rights Americans oppose removing medical care for a viable child.
