Cassidy Issues Statement Following June Medical Services v. Russo Arguments


U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D., (R-LA) earlier today attended oral arguments at the Supreme Court in the case of June Medical Services v. Russo, Louisiana's law that requires that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges to protect women should a medical complication occur during the procedure. He released this statement on the case:

"This is about the safety and health of the mother. If you care about women, you must care whether they have a complication after an abortion. If you care about women, you care about the Supreme Court upholding Louisiana's law. If you care about women, you should care that the woman who has a complication has all that she needs to be restored to health," said Dr. Cassidy.
