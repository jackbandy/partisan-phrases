Trump Touts Cassidy's Paid Family Leave Bill in State of the Union


President Donald Trump used his State of the Union address to endorse the Advancing Support for Working Families Act, the paid family leave bill by U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ).

"As we support America's moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce paid family leave," said Trump. "Now, I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across the nation." 

"Republicans and Democrats both agree that our country needs a sensible paid family leave policy. President Trump's support moves us closer to passing this bill for the benefit of America's new parents and their children," said Dr. Cassidy, chairman of the bipartisan Senate Finance Committee paid family leave working group.

The Cassidy-Sinema bill is the only bipartisan, bicameral paid family leave bill in Congress. U.S. Representatives Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Colin Allred (D-TX) are leading efforts in the House to pass the bill.

The bill allows parents to pull forward a portion of their child tax credit up to $5,000 to provide for their newborn or newly adopted child. The credit can be used for childcare, income loss during maternity/paternity leave, baby supplies, and other needs related to caring for a new child.

The plan does not raise taxes, increase the deficit, or impose new mandates. It can supplement existing paid leave policies parents might receive.
