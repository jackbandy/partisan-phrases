Cassidy Proposes Language to Give Equity to States for Coastal Resiliency Efforts


U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and chairman of Senate Energy Subcommittee, today said he has prepared an amendment to the Great American Outdoors Act to increase the amount of offshore revenue Gulf Coast states receive to address coastal resiliency and restoration efforts.

Cassidy's legislation removes the existing cap on the amount of money Gulf states receive from energy production on the Outer Continental Shelf. The funds generated go to support costal resiliency and restoration efforts.

"Sea level rise and land loss threaten coastal ecosystems. My proposal ensures Gulf and coastal areas receive their fair share of resources to address unique environmental challenges," said Dr. Cassidy.

The legislation also makes additional leases eligible for revenue sharing to further maximize funds available to invest in coastal resiliency. Cassidy will continue working with his Senate colleagues to address coastal environmental challenges, including support for funding the National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund.
