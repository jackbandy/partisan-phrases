Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the leadership of Chairman  Jason Smith in getting this bill to the floor.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of President Trump's One  Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Here are the facts, Mr. Speaker: If Congress fails to pass this bill,  taxpayers across the Nation will get a big tax increase. In Tennessee's  Eighth Congressional District, the average household would face a 26  percent tax hike. This would be catastrophic for families, for farms,  and for small businesses across the Nation. This bill not only stops  this massive tax hike, but it will reduce taxes for Americans  nationwide and turbocharge our economy.

When Americans voted last November, they voted for these policies put  forth by President Trump and House Republicans. Now is the time for us  to do this job and pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Too much is at  stake.
