Mr. SORENSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Jeff Nelson,  CEO and Managing Director of MetroLINK, on the occasion of his  retirement in September 2025 after more than 35 years of dedicated  service to the Quad Cities.

Mr. Nelson has transformed public transportation in our region. Under  his leadership, MetroLINK became a model of innovation--connecting  people to Jobs, education, and opportunity while advancing economic  growth, clean energy, and smart technology.

He introduced the Channel Cat water taxi service, which has provided  over one million rides, giving residents and visitors a unique way to  travel the Mississippi River. He also led the adoption of electric  buses, placing the Quad Cities at the forefront of sustainable transit  solutions.

His vision and dedication have earned national recognition, including  the American Public Transportation Association's Outstanding Public  Transportation System Award. Beyond these honors, Mr. Nelson built a  system that strengthens the community every day.

I thank Jeff Nelson for his decades of leadership, creativity, and  commitment to the Quad Cities, and I extend my best wishes to him in  retirement.
