Mr. SORENSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a true  institution in Central Illinois--WJBC Radio--as it celebrates its 100th  anniversary. For a century, WJBC has been the trusted voice of McLean  County, keeping families informed, entertained, and connected to the  heart of our community.

As an avid listener and frequent guest, I know firsthand the  dedication of WJBC's incredible team--past and present--who have made  this station a pillar of local journalism. From legendary broadcasters  like Don Munson and Steve Vogel to today's voices like Scott Miller,  WJBC has been a reliable source of news, sports, and thoughtful  discussion.

WJBC continues to cement its legacy as a cornerstone of regional  media--but more than that, WJBC has been a constant companion to its  listeners, always delivering the stories that matter most. On this  historic milestone, I congratulate WJBC on 100 years of excellence and  look forward to many more years of trusted reporting and community  service.
