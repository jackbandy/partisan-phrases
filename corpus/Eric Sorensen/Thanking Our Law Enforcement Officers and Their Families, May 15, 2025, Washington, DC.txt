Thanking Our Law Enforcement Officers and Their Families

Mr. SORENSEN. Mr. Speaker, this is National Police Week when we honor  the brave men and women who serve and protect us every day, but it is  also a good reminder that they deserve our thanks every day. We also  need to thank the spouses and the children of our law enforcement who  deal with the risk of their loved ones who may not come home.

Finally, we remember the family members who made the ultimate  sacrifice for our safety. Serving in the people's House means we  support law enforcement. I am proud to have secured funding for police  training and safety.

From Rockford to the Quad Cities, Peoria to Bloomington-Normal, our  officers go above and beyond every day to keep us safe, many days  without the support that they need to deal with the stress.

That is why I am so proud of the Invest to Protect Act, my bipartisan  legislation that gives small and midsized police departments the  funding that they need for training, recruitment, and mental health  resources.

Mr. Speaker, happy National Police Week. My hope is that everyone  wearing a badge right now stays protected, safe, and feels their  Nation's thanks.
