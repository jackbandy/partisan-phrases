Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families

Mr. SORENSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleagues today to call  out the House GOP's big billionaire bailout at the expense of my  neighbors back home in Illinois-17.

Their bill would take away food from hungry families and kick people  off their health insurance, all so the richest people who walk the face  of the Earth get a bigger tax break.

The other side claims to be fiscally responsible, but they are  blowing a $5 trillion hole in our national debt to do it.

What am I supposed to say to Mary Anne from Morrison, Illinois, who  says she can't feed her kids without SNAP, or a veteran like Mike, who  stopped in for his one meal a day at the veteran drop-in center in  Rockford?

Republicans in committee voted unanimously against our amendment that  would protect veterans from cuts.

They are saying this is about waste, fraud, and abuse? Give me a  break. This bill is a disaster for anyone who is struggling to make  ends meet, and it will be a disaster for our country, all so the filthy  rich get richer. Vote ``no.''
