Recognizing the 30th Anniversary of the Channel Cat Passenger Ferryboat Service in the Quad Cities


Mr. SORENSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary  milestone in the Quad Cities--the 30th anniversary of the Channel Cat  passenger ferryboat service. What began as a bold idea in 1994, led by  Kathy Wine, Executive Director of River Action, has since become a  vital part of our region's transportation network and a celebrated  symbol of innovation along the Mississippi River.

With early support from the Riverboat Development Authority and a  coalition of local leaders, the first water taxi launched over the July  4th weekend in 1995, connecting communities and offering a new way to  experience our historic river. Since MetroLINK assumed operation in  1998 under the direction of CEO Jeff Nelson, the Channel Cat has grown  tremendously. Federal grants have helped fund three ADA-accessible  vessels powered by biodiesel, construction of improved riverfront  docks, and even plans for future electric ferries.

The Channel Cat has provided over one million rides, giving residents  and visitors alike a unique and sustainable way to cross the  Mississippi River--connecting two states, three downtowns, and  countless cultural and recreational opportunities.

On May 23, 2025, we celebrate three decades of impact and innovation.  I proudly recognize the Channel Cat for its outstanding service and  commend Kathy Wine and Jeff Nelson for their visionary leadership and  unwavering dedication to environmental stewardship and public access  along our riverfront. The Quad Cities is a better, more connected place  because of their work.
