Compressed Gas Cylinder Safety and Oversight Improvements Act of 2025


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1182, the Compressed Gas  Cylinder Safety and Oversight Improvements Act.

The bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to advance a  rulemaking to make the standards for foreign manufacturers of  compressed gas cylinders sold in the U.S. the same as standards for the  domestic makers of these same cylinders.

Compressed gas cylinders are used every day in life for medical,  auto, defense, oil and gas, residential, firefighting, and other  purposes.

In January, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety  Administration issued a safety advisory notice regarding unsafe  cylinders being sold online to consumers, shippers, and heating,  ventilation, and air-conditioning folks. These were not manufactured to  American or even United Nations standards and lacked certification  markings.

Using these unsafe compressed gas cylinders could cause significant  damage to property, physical injury, or even death. PHMSA determined  that the unmarked empty cylinders being sold in the United States on  major commercial websites are primarily manufactured by non-U.S.  companies. This bill requires a consistent standard for both domestic  and foreign manufacturers of compressed gas cylinders.

Mr. Speaker, I support this bipartisan bill and urge my colleagues to  do the same.

Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I will close by saying that I  support the Compressed Gas Cylinder Safety and Oversight Improvements  Act. I encourage my colleagues to do the same, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
