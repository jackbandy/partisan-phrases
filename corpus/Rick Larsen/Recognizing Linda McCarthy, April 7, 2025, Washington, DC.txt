Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Linda McCarthy on her retirement from Mt. Baker Planned Parenthood and  thank her for her many decades of service and dedication to the people  of Northwest Washington.

Since 1977, Linda McCarthy has been an advocate for women's health at  Mt. Baker Planned Parenthood, starting as a secretary and eventually  rising to become the CEO for 21 years.

Under Linda McCarthy's leadership, Mt. Baker Planned Parenthood  expanded access to exceptional and essential health and social services  to many people in Whatcom, Skagit and San Juan counties.

It has been an honor and a privilege working with Linda, and I will  continue to honor her work by supporting women's health care,  reproductive rights and family planning services in Northwest  Washington.
