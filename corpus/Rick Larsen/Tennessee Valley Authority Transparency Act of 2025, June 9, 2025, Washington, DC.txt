Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1373, as amended, bipartisan  legislation to promote additional transparency of board meetings of the  Tennessee Valley Authority.

I thank Representatives Cohen and Burchett of Tennessee for their  leadership on this bill and their tireless work to improve the TVA.

TVA is the Nation's largest government-owned wholesale power  producer, supplying power to 10 million people across the States of  Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and  Kentucky.

This legislation requires TVA's board meetings to be open to the  public when possible, which will increase transparency for the  communities impacted by TVA's decisions.

Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 1373, as amended, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.

Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, in closing, Congress must  ensure that TVA's operations are transparent.

I support H.R. 1373, as amended, and urge my colleagues to do the  same.
