Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act of 2025


Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Wagner for yielding and  supporting my legislation. I would also like to thank Representative  Green of Texas for co-leading H.R. 910 and making this a bipartisan  effort.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 910, the  Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act.

This bill is simple. It requires the Treasury Department to advocate  for Taiwan to join the International Monetary Fund, or IMF.  Unfortunately, China has consistently blocked Taiwan's participation in  international forums, including IMF. China pursues these tactics  because they know that financial security is just as important as  military security.

Defense experts have identified that China could exploit Taiwan's  financial system by raising tariffs, short-selling stocks, and freezing  bank transfers. Joining the IMF would allow Taiwan to access resources  that promote financial resilience and deter China's economic coercion.

It has been the longstanding U.S. policy toward Taiwan to support its  membership in international organizations where statehood is not a  prerequisite. We must continue to advocate for Taiwan's voice to be  heard where membership is not possible. This principle has lasted  decades across Republican and Democratic administrations, and it has  repeatedly been reaffirmed in bills passed by this Congress.

Mr. Speaker, advocating for Taiwan's membership in the IMF would also  unlock access to other international financial institutions. The World  Bank, for instance, requires members to first be a part of the IMF.

I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 910 and send the  Taiwanese people a strong message of solidarity and support for their  democracy.
