Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a very heavy heart to honor  our colleague Doug LaMalfa.

Doug was larger than life, but what I will remember most is how he  lived big in the small moments with warmth, attention to detail, and  genuine kindness.

Doug was the only Member of Congress who ever called me by my Korean  name, Kim Young Oak. He didn't have to remember it. He never needed to  do that, but that small, thoughtful gesture meant the world to me and  spoke volumes about who Doug was.

Doug was a strong, conservative leader who served with a deep love  for our country and brought the heartland to Washington, not the other  way around.

As a fourth-generation rice farmer, he never forgot who he worked  for--farmers, families, and rural communities who were too often  ignored by Washington.

He will be missed. We will all miss him. My heart is with his family,  his staff, and all who are mourning this tremendous loss.
