Recognizing Black April


Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Black April and 50  years since the Fall of Saigon.

Over 8.7 million Americans served during the Vietnam war, including  2.7 million who put boots on the ground.

We will always remember the 58,281 U.S. servicemembers who gave  everything for freedom, and we rally with our Gold Star families and  the loved ones of the 1,573 Americans who remain missing in action.

Many of my constituents fled Vietnam in the Fall of Saigon and found  their new home in Orange County in southern California. I am proud to  have witnessed many of them becoming very successful members of our  society, thriving in all sectors that make America great, and I am so  proud to call many of them friends.

Our Vietnamese-American community knows well that we cannot take  freedom for granted.

To our Vietnam-era veterans: Welcome home. Know that your service  protected freedom on the world stage, and we are very grateful.
