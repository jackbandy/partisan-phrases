Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 142,  disapproving of D.C.'s recent decision to decouple from key provisions  of the Internal Revenue Code.

This resolution ensures that D.C. residents can benefit from  President Trump's historic tax cuts, just like hardworking families  across the country.

Unfortunately, I can't say the same for my constituents in  California's 40th District. Under Governor Newsom's rule, California  has repeatedly chosen to decouple from Federal tax relief, denying  hardworking families and small businesses much-needed breathing room  after years of Bidenflation.

Californians are struggling with some of the highest taxes and cost  of living in the Nation and are getting no relief from Governor Newsom  and Democrats in Sacramento.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this resolution because workers  and families in D.C., California, and across the country deserve a  chance to get ahead.

I hope this resolution inspires California's leaders to come to their  senses and allow the full relief of the important wins in the One Big  Beautiful Bill Act that provided the working families tax cuts to take  effect for Californians.
