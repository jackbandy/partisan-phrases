Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Baumgartner, for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4490, the PARTNER Act.  This bill represents a bold and necessary commitment to strengthening  America's engagement with our allies and partner organizations  worldwide by granting tailored immunities and privileges.

Of note is the inclusion of provisions from the PARTNER Act with the  ASEAN Act and the Pacific Partnership Act, which together elevate U.S.  cooperation with our Indo-Pacific allies.

The Indo-Pacific is home to over one-half of the world's population,  vital trade routes, and rapidly growing economies and markets. It is a  region that I hold as a key priority as chair of the East Asia and the  Pacific Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee due to its  significance to national security and economic prosperity.

Meanwhile, the region also faces significant challenges, including  rising geopolitical tensions, maritime disputes, and growing coercion  from bad actors seeking to undermine a rules-based order.

This bill is long overdue and sends a strong message that the United  States will stand shoulder to shoulder with our friends, including our  Indo-Pacific partners, from the Philippines to Palau, to promote a  free, open, and prosperous region.

This bill is not just about diplomatic immunities; it is about  American leadership on the global stage.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to co-lead this bill with Representative  Castro, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
