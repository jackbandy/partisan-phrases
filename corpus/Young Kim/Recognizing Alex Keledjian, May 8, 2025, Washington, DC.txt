https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690909/recognizing-alex-keledjian


Mrs. KIM. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to recognize and thank my  operations director, Alex Keledjian, for his 4 years of service in the  House of Representatives, and this is Alex's son, Anthony.

Alex's dedicated work ethic and sharp sense of humor have made him an  integral part of our team, keeping me and my office on track, smiling,  and teaching us Armenian history along the way.

While he was working around the clock in my office during the past 4  years, he has also been a part-time law school student and devoted  husband, father, and dear friend.

Madam Speaker, my team will not be the same without him, but we are  excited for him as he embarks on this next chapter in his career as a  lawyer back home in Los Angeles. I know I will continue to see him, so  we will be cheering for him every step of the way.

``Good luck''; ``Shnorhavor.''
