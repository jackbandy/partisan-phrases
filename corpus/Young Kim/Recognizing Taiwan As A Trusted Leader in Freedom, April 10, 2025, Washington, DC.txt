Recognizing Taiwan As A Trusted Leader in Freedom, Democracy, and Trade


Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, today marks 46 years since the Taiwan  Relations Act became law.

This landmark bill has strengthened the partnership with Taiwan and  shaped America's foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific region.

I will recognize that Taiwan is a trusted leader in freedom,  democracy, and trade, and is also a needed partner in security against  shared threats.

As chairwoman of the East Asia and Pacific Subcommittee, I have  worked on bipartisan bills to give Taiwan a rightful seat at the table  in international organizations, such as WHO and IMF. I led the charge  to track and ensure efficient delivery of weapons that Taiwan has  purchased from the United States.

This year, I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill to enhance U.S.- Taiwan economic and trade ties. Our partnership with Taiwan is more  important than ever.
