Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, in just a short time, our Nation will  celebrate America's 250th birthday. This is a moment to reflect on how  far we have come as a nation and the shared ideals that have carried us  through challenge and triumph.

America 250 is not simply a milestone on the calendar. It is a call  to remember the innovation, perseverance, and sacrifice that have  shaped our Nation, and to keep fighting for the American Dream that has  stewarded freedom for generations of Americans.

I rise today to recognize the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and  Museum in Yorba Linda for helping lead this nationwide commemoration.  Its new exhibit, ``America 250: A More Perfect Union,'' invites  visitors to walk through the defining chapters of our shared history,  not as distant events, but as living lessons about who we are and who  we aspire to be.

The Nixon Library has long been a cultural and educational  cornerstone in California's 40th Congressional District, enriching our  community through its commitment to historical stewardship and civic  education. As America prepares for this anniversary, the Nixon Library  is once again stepping up to inspire reflection, unity, and renewed  purpose.

Today, I encourage Americans of all ages to take a moment to engage  with our history, to remember the courage of those who came before us,  and to ensure the spirit of 1776 continues to guide our path forward.              Supporting Individuals Living with Alopecia Areata

Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  millions of Americans, including many in my district, who live with  alopecia areata. It is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss and  often comes with significant emotional and mental health challenges.

Alopecia affects people of every age and background, and for many,  the journey can feel isolating or misunderstood. No one should face  this condition alone. Raising awareness helps ensure that patients and  families receive the understanding, compassion, and support they  deserve.

Today, I recognize the strength of those living with alopecia and the  loved ones who stand beside them. Their resilience reminds us of the  importance of community and the need to continue fostering empathy and  inclusion for all who are navigating visible and invisible health  challenges.
