Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026

Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, history has shown that  government shutdowns accomplish nothing.

The last major shutdown cost our economy $11 billion, delayed wages  for Federal workers, and disrupted businesses that hardworking  Americans rely on.

This isn't a partisan issue. Keeping our government open means  protecting servicemembers, honoring veterans, supporting mothers and  infants, keeping our border secure, and helping small businesses access  the loans they need.

As we approach the government funding deadline, I support this clean,  short-term continuing resolution. It prevents a costly shutdown,  preserves progress on appropriations, and gives Congress time to finish  the job responsibly. We were not sent here to play political games with  people's livelihoods. A shutdown doesn't score points. It only hurts  those we serve.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing, put the  American people first, and support this measure.
