Single, Unique Zip Codes for Certain Communities

Mrs. KIM. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I rise in strong support of H.R. 3095, which directs the U.S. Postal  Service to designate a unique ZIP Code for certain communities,  including North Tustin in my district.

North Tustin has been a pillar of our Orange County community and a  census-designated place. However, its status as an unincorporated area  has caused confusion for the Postal Service and for tax purposes.

For example, North Tustin residents are subject to the city of Santa  Ana's sales tax, despite not being represented or eligible for services  or a vote in the local elections.

Providing North Tustin with a unique ZIP Code will create certainty  for residents who have called North Tustin home for decades and provide  clarity for tax purposes to surrounding areas, and USPS.

I thank Representative Boebert and the House Oversight and Government  Reform Committee for working with me on this commonsense, bipartisan  measure, and I am hopeful that we can get through to the finish line  and help our communities. I ask my colleagues to support this bill.
