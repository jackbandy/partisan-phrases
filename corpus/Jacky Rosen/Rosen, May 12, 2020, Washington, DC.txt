Rosen, Cortez Masto, Colleagues Join Bipartisan Resolution Honoring National Nurses Week


U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) joined Senate colleagues in a bipartisan Senate resolution designating May 6th through 12th, 2020 as National Nurses Week. The resolution honors the important contributions of America's nurses to safe, high-quality health care, and the invaluable role that nurses play in patient care and support. Nurses are currently risking their health to care for others in the fight against COVID-19.

"Nurses represent the largest group of frontline heath care workers in our country," said the Senators. "Every day these brave men and women selflessly put the health of others first in order to care for our communities. During the coronavirus pandemic, the work of these health heroes is more important than ever. We are proud to take part in honoring our nursing workforce and will continue working in Congress to ensure that medical professionals have the resources and means to do their jobs safely and effectively."
