Rosen Unveils Spanish Language COVID-19 Resource Website to Keep Nevadans Informed


Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) unveiled her Spanish language COVID-19 website to inform Nevada's Spanish-speaking communities about resources available to them at the state and federal level. Additional constituent resources can be found directly on the Senator's website.

 

"My top priority throughout the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak is to keep Nevadans safe and ensure they have access to current and accurate information," said Senator Rosen. "Nevada is home to a large and thriving Latino community and sharing information with these communities in Spanish is important to me. My team has put together webpages with health information, small business assistance information, and a regularly-updated list of state and federal resources available to Nevadans. I urge everyone to visit my website often for the most up-to-date and accurate information as news and information about the pandemic is rapidly evolving and changing. I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure Nevada's hardworking families, small businesses, and health care workers have the resources they need to overcome and recover from this pandemic."

 

BACKGROUND: Earlier this month, Senator Rosen launched her new multilingual guides in English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Thai to inform Nevadans about COVID-19 signs, symptoms, and preventative measures to help combat the virus.

 

Last month, Senator Rosen sent a letter to Vice President Pence requesting information on what the Administration is doing to ensure that people with limited English are able to access updated information about the coronavirus.
