Rosen Statement Celebrating Jewish American Heritage Month


Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) released the following statement in celebration of Jewish American Heritage Month.

"Each year, we recognize and celebrate the many accomplishments and contributions of our country's Jewish American community," said Senator Rosen. "This month serves as an opportunity for our nation to reflect upon the many accomplishments that American Jews have made for over three centuries. Across so many fields, the Jewish community has brought to bear values such as justice, equality, and strength in diversity, shaping our country for the better in immeasurable ways. Sadly, this month also serves as a necessary reminder for leaders to publicly stand against the scourge of anti-Semitism. As we celebrate and recognize the many voices of the Jewish American community, we must also take this time to unite in the fight against the rising tide of bigotry and hate."

BACKGROUND: Senator Rosen holds the distinction of being the third female Jewish Senator in U.S. history, as well as the first former synagogue president to serve in the United States Senate. As such, Senator Rosen has been an outspoken advocate of combating anti-Semitism in the United States, the Middle East, Europe, and around the world. 

In April, Rosen announced that the Never Again Education Act, bipartisan legislation she introduced last year with Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), now has 74 co-sponsors, giving the bill both a filibuster-proof and veto-proof majority.

In January, Senators Rosen and Senator James Lankford (R-OK) introduced a resolution commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp by Allied Forces during World War II. The bipartisan resolution unanimously passed the Senate in February.

Last year, Senators Rosen and Lankford launched the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism.
