Rosen, Cortez Masto Co-Sponsor Medical Supply Transparency and Delivery Act


U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) announced their co-sponsorship of the Medical Supply Transparency and Delivery Act, legislation that would lay out a framework for an effective COVID-19 response by federalizing the supply chain for critical supplies and equipment and requiring the use of all authorities necessary, including full use of the Defense Production Act, to mobilize a transparent, effective, and comprehensive federal response to the pandemic through an equitable process.

 

"In order to effectively respond to the coronavirus pandemic we must put into place a coordinated  and effective strategy for the distribution of much-needed medical supplies," said the Senators. "Nevada and states across the country are experiencing shortages of critical medical supplies, putting Americans' health and safety at risk. This bill would allow for the creation of a national supply chain and provide comprehensive and transparent information on how supplies are being distributed and what is still needed. Protecting the health and well-being of Nevadans remains our top priority, and we will continue to push for more resources for the state."

 

BACKGROUND: The Medical Supply Transparency and Delivery Act would:

Require publicly reported national assessments on a weekly basis to determine national critical equipment supply and requirements,Establish an Executive Officer to oversee acquisition and logistics for COVID-19 equipment production and delivery,Increase transparency regarding the distribution of supplies and equipment,Require a comprehensive plan for COVID--19 testing, including viral and antibody testing,Require a GAO report to identify lessons learned and make recommendations on future pandemic response,And establish an Inspector General to oversee implementation of the Act.
