Rosen Announces Bipartisan Never Again Education Act Has 74 Co-Sponsors, Veto-Proof Majority


Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), co-chair of the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism, announced that the Never Again Education Act, bipartisan legislation she introduced last year with Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), now has 74 co-sponsors, giving the bill both a filibuster-proof and veto-proof majority.

"With evidence that anti-Semitism is on the rise in the United States and across the globe, and as we commemorate Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day) this week, we must take action to reverse this course," said Senator Rosen. "An atrocity like the Holocaust must never again be allowed to occur. Unfortunately, as the number of Holocaust survivors alive continues to dwindle, studies show that the Holocaust is fading from memory -- two-thirds of American millennials cannot identify what the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp is. The best antidote is robust Holocaust education. The Never Again Education Act would give schools needed resources to cover one of the most horrific chapters in world history, providing valuable insight into the past, important lessons for how we can overcome anti-Semitism today, and critical tools to prevent future atrocities. I'm glad to see overwhelming bipartisan support for this bill and I will continue working on policy solutions to fight back against hatred in whatever form it takes."

Last year, Senator Rosen introduced the Never Again Education Act (S.2085), bipartisan legislation that would establish a dedicated federal fund to provide teachers with resources and training necessary to teach our students the important lessons of the Holocaust. The legislation is backed by numerous organizations, including Hadassah, Jewish Federations of North America, Christians United for Israel, the Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee, Simon Wiesenthal Center, Union for Reform Judaism, National Council of Jewish Women, World Jewish Congress North America, B'nai B'rith International, Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Agudath Israel of America, HIAS, Jewish Women International, National Coalition Supporting Eurasian Jewry, Republican Jewish Coalition, American Jewish Congress, Jewish War Veterans of the USA, and the National Education Association, among many others.

Last year, Rosen also launched the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism, with co-chair Senator James Lankford (R-OK).

In January, Senators Rosen and Lankford introduced a resolution commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp by Allied Forces during World War II. The bipartisan resolution unanimously passed the Senate in February.

Senator Rosen holds the distinction of being the third female Jewish Senator in U.S. history, as well as the first former synagogue president to serve in the United States Senate. As such, Senator Rosen has been an outspoken advocate of combating anti-Semitism in the United States, the Middle East, Europe, and around the world.
