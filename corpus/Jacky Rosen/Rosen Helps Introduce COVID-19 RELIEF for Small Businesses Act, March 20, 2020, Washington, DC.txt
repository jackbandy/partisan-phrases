Rosen Helps Introduce COVID-19 RELIEF for Small Businesses Act


Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, announced that she's helped to introduce legislation to provide relief to small businesses and improve the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) existing tools to support greater access to capital for small business. "Nevada's small businesses and their employees are  facing an urgent economic threat caused by the coronavirus pandemic," said Senator Rosen. "This bill will provide small businesses with much-needed tools to weather an economic storm. I will continue working with my colleagues on the Small Business Committee to protect and provide assistance to small businesses in Nevada and across our country."
