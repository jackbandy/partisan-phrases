Rosen Statement Recognizing National Human Trafficking Prevention Month


Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen released the following statement recognizing National Human Trafficking Prevention Month, a time to raise awareness of the more than 40 million people who are being trafficked across the globe. "Human trafficking is an issue that transcends communities and borders. It is a global problem that requires a concerted effort and a multi-faceted approach," said Senator Rosen. "In Nevada and across the United States, men, women, and children are taken against their will and forced into a life of exploitation and abuse. We must take action to assess the scale and the scope of human trafficking, aid victims and survivors, and create an environment where they can come forward. We can and must work together to end these human rights violations."
