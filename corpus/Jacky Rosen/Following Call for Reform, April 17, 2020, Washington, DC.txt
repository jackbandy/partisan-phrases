Following Call for Reform, Rosen Applauds Adoption of New Regulatory Relief Measure to Help Cities During COVID-19 Pandemic


Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) released the following statement highlighting the adoption of a regulatory reform to waive the cap on Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds that can be used for public services. This new regulation, which will allow cities and states greater flexibility in their use of CDBG funds, follows a call for regulatory reform to waive the percentage cap on CDBG funds that may go to public service assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

"Right now, we are seeing communities in Nevada and across the country innovate and adapt in order to care for one another during this time of crisis," said Senator Rosen. "We owe it to the people of our state to stop regulatory red tape from preventing our communities from providing much-needed services. I'm glad to see that my regulatory relief measure, which will increase the percentage of CDBG funds that communities can spend on vital services like meal assistance, was included in the most recent coronavirus relief package and is now being implemented. I will continue working toward commonsense solutions that look out for the wellbeing of Nevadans."

 

BACKGROUND: Last month, Senator Rosen sent a letter to Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Chairman Crapo and Ranking Member Brown asking them to support waiving the public services cap for CDBG funds during the pandemic, in the next COVID relief package. The provision was later included in the CARES Act

 

This regulatory change was included in the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which Senator Rosen voted in support of, and was signed into law on last month.
