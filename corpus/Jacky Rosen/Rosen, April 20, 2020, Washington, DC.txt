Rosen, Cortez Masto Co-Sponsor Coronavirus Community Relief Act to Ensure All Communities Receive Direct Relief to Combat COVID-19


Today, U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) announced their co-sponsorship of the Coronavirus Community Relief Act, legislation that would provide $250 billion in new stabilization funds provided directly to cities and counties with populations under 500,000 that are struggling to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

"Small and rural communities across Nevada are increasingly finding themselves without access to much-needed resources to effectively respond to this crisis," said the Senators. "As we work to combat coronavirus, we must ensure that all communities -- large and small --have access to direct emergency relief. This bill will provide smaller towns, counties, and cities in Nevada and across the country with access to critical funding to protect their residents, stabilize fiscally, and recover from the health and economic impact of the crisis. I'm continuing to work with Nevada officials on the federal, state, and local levels to ensure that no community is left behind in our response."

 

BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Community Relief Act would ensure that all communities receive the direct relief they need to continue the COVID-19 pandemic fight and allow additional flexibility on how state and local governments could use funds to mitigate the economic crisis caused by COVID-19.

 

Under the Coronavirus Community Relief Act, state and local governments with a population under 500,000 could use funds for costs including but not limited to lost revenue, reimbursement for expenses already incurred, and increases in costs reasonably believed to have been caused or as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
