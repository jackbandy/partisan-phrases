Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, today I rise to welcome His All-Holiness  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to our Nation's Capital. Visiting from  Greece, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was elected in October 1991 as  the 270th archbishop of the 2000-year-old church founded by the Apostle  Andrew. He has demonstrated extraordinary leadership within the  Orthodox Christian community and across the global religious and  environmental landscapes.

Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was ordained as a deacon in 1961 and  a priest in 1969. Throughout his ministry, he served as an assistant  dean of the Theological School of Halki, personal secretary to  Patriarch Demetrios, Metropolitan of Philadelphia, and later  Metropolitan of Chalcedon, before being elected ecumenical patriarch in  1991. He has steered spiritual unity among Orthodox Christians,  convened the first Synaxis of Orthodox primates in 1992, supported the  restoration of autonomous churches in Eastern Europe, and granted  autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine in 2019.

The Patriarch's role extends far beyond his ecclesial leadership.  Widely known as the ``Green Patriarch,'' he has pioneered the  integration of ecological awareness with theological ethics, declaring  environmental destruction a sin, establishing an annual Orthodox Day of  Prayer for Creation, and convening numerous international symposia  blending faith, science, and environmental stewardship. His efforts  have earned him global recognition, including the U.S. Congressional  Gold Medal and the Templeton Prize.

Patriarch Bartholomew's tireless work ethic and dedication has  bridged religious traditions, championed interfaith dialogue, advanced  environmental justice, and fostered unity among diverse Christian  communities. On behalf of Nevada's Greek Orthodox community, it is an  honor to welcome him to Washington, DC.
