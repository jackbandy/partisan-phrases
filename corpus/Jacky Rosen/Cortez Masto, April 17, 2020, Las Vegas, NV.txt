Cortez Masto, Rosen Support Resolution Condemning Anti-Asian Racism Prompted by Covid-19


U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) announced their plan to support a resolution led by Senators Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.,), and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) condemning discrimination against Asian-Americans and Asian immigrants caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Recent reports show anti-Asian sentiment has increased since the COVID-19 crisis began. According to an FBI intelligence report, hate crimes against Asian American & Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities are likely to surge as COVID-19 continues to spread. Nevada's Senators spoke last week with AAPI representatives in Nevada who are concerned about a recent rise in racial tensions.

"Inflammatory, hateful and racist rhetoric -- especially when spewed from those at the highest levels of government -- has no place in Nevada, and we're proud to support this resolution condemning discrimination and supporting our Asian-American, Pacific Islander and Asian immigrant communities," said the Senators. "Nevadans with Asian heritage are small business owners, teachers, friends and neighbors and they contribute so much the Silver State. We will continue to speak out against any words or actions that add to the burden of fear and anxiety they may be facing during this unprecedented time."

Representative Grace Meng (D-N.Y.-06) introduced the companion resolution in the House last week. The resolution is endorsed by the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), National Council of Asian Pacific Americans (NCAPA), Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO), Muslim Advocates, Oxfam, National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA), Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC), Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum (APIAHF), and National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum (NAPAWF).
