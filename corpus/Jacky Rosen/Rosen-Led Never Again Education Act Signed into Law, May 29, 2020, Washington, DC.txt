Rosen-Led Never Again Education Act Signed into Law


U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) released the following statement announcing that the Never Again Education Act, bipartisan legislation she introduced alongside Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) has been signed into law. The bill, introduced in the House by Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), would establish a dedicated federal fund through the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum to provide teachers with resources and training necessary to teach our students the important lessons of the Holocaust. The legislation garnered the support of 80 bipartisan Senate cosponsors and over 300 House cosponsors, passed the House 395-5 in January, and passed the Senate by voice vote on May 13.

"At a time when anti-Semitism is growing here in the United States and across the globe, the best way we can work to prevent an atrocity like the Holocaust from occurring again is through education," said Senator Rosen. "I could not be prouder to see that this bipartisan legislation I introduced is now law, giving schools needed resources to adequately cover one of the darkest chapters in our history. Through education, we can utilize lessons from the past to prevent anti-Semitism today. I will continue working in Congress to fight back against hate in whatever form it takes."
