Rosen: Trump Administration's Openness to Cutting Medicare, Social Security is Unacceptable


Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), released the following statement condemning recent comments made by the President, suggesting that the Administration is willing to make cuts to Medicare and Social Security. "It is unacceptable for the President go back on his word and discuss cuts to Social Security and Medicare," said Senator Rosen. "Nevadans have worked hard throughout their lives to earn these benefits. We can't allow this Administration to go back on our nation's promise to our seniors. I remain committed to protecting and strengthening Social Security and Medicare for our seniors and future generations."
