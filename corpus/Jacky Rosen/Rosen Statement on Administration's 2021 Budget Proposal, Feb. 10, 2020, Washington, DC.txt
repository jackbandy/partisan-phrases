Rosen Statement on Administration's 2021 Budget Proposal


Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), released the following statement in response to the President's Fiscal Year 2021 budget request: "While I am relieved to hear that the President has heard the voices of Nevadans across the state who have long opposed Yucca Mountain, I'm disappointed to see him take aim again at our nation's health care system," said Senator Rosen. "This Administration is seeking to dismantle our health care system in court, and now they want to block grant Medicaid, which would put the coverage of Nevadans who enrolled in our state's Medicaid expansion in jeopardy. I am also very concerned with large proposed cuts to the Urban Area Security Initiative -- critical to security in Nevada -- along with cuts to affordable housing programs, telemedicine grants, Brand USA, TSA staffing at our nation's airports, support for small businesses, investment in manufacturing jobs, and public health programs through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When it comes to addressing our country's most pressing challenges, such as improving health care and investing in our skilled workforce, the President's budget fails to deliver. I will continue making these issues a priority in the Senate."
