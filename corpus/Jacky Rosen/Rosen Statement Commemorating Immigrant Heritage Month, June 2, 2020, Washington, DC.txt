Rosen Statement Commemorating Immigrant Heritage Month


U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) released the following statement celebrating Immigrant Heritage Month, a month-long celebration of the accomplishments and contributions immigrants and their children have made in shaping and enriching the history and culture of the United States.

"Immigrant Heritage Month is a time to celebrate diversity and our shared immigrant heritage. Immigrants have and continue to make invaluable contributions to our history, culture, and way of life," said Senator Rosen. "Currently, millions of immigrants are on the front lines, risking their lives, battling the coronavirus pandemic as essential workers -- working in hospitals, harvesting food, delivering groceries, and caring for our loved ones. During this month, let us reflect on the important role that immigration has played in building this great nation and remember the American values that our country was founded upon. We must continue to be a beacon of hope for those seeking refuge and for immigrant families in pursuit of the American Dream."
