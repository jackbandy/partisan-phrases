Australian Wildfires


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 527, a  resolution I was proud to cosponsor, recognizing the longstanding  partnership between the United States and Australia to share critical  firefighting resources during times of crisis. 

  I first want to thank my colleagues, Senator Cardin and Barrasso, for  introducing this important legislation recognizing the brave men and  women who have not only risked their lives in the United States as  first responders, but went above and beyond to help combat the recent  bushfires in Australia. 

  In November 2019, Australia began to experience devastating bushfires  that burned over 30,000,000 acres of land. During this time, more than  300 American firefighters mobilized to assist Australian efforts to  suppress and contain the bushfire raging throughout the continent. This  bipartisan resolution recognizes the efforts and bravery of Australian  and American men and women who worked together to help those in danger  and also specifically honors the three American firefighters who lost  their lives fighting Australia's bushfires on January 23, 2020. 

  In my home State of Nevada, several firefighters answered the call to  assist with bushfire mitigation and suppression efforts. I want to take  a moment to recognize them individually: Matthew James Petersen, Justin  Cutler, Brian C. Holmes, Ian McQueary, Jacob Keogh, Juan Islas, Kevin  Kelly, Joseph L. Miller, Dylan Rader, Timothy P. Roide, and Eric T.  Tilden. 

  Thank you to all of these brave Nevadans for your service and  sacrifice.
