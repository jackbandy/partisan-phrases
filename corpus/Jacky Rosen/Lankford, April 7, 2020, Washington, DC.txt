Lankford, Rosen Join 180 Jewish Organizations to Call for Unity, Amidst Coronavirus Pandemic


Today, Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV, co-chairs of the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism, released the following statement calling on Americans to reject anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.  "In times of crisis we often see the best of humanity; people from all faiths and all walks of life coming together to help each other through difficult times. During the coronavirus pandemic we have seen this shared strength and caring for one another in countless acts of selflessness and heroism," said the Senators. "Unfortunately, we have also seen incidents of people giving into fear and engaging in acts of hatred against Jewish, Asian American & Pacific Islander, and immigrant communities here in the United States. During these challenging times, it is all the more important that we reject hate and support one another as we work together while staying apart to overcome this crisis." Last week, over 180 Jewish communal groups joined together in a statement of solidarity amid instances of hatred and divisiveness during the COVID-19 outbreak. Last October, Lankford and Rosen launched the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism.
