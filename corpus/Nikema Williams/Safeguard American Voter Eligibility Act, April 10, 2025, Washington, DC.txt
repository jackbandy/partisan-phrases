Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act

Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the  Congresswoman for Georgia's Fifth District, the cradle of the civil  rights movement and the home of Dr. King, Ambassador Andrew Young, and  my predecessor, the late Congressman John Lewis. I carry their legacy  with me every time I walk onto this floor.

Mr. Speaker, the SAVE Act is everything our civil rights leaders  fought against. Don't think that it won't impact you or folks that you  know. If you got married and changed your name, your ID won't match  your birth certificate. If you don't have a passport and your ID  doesn't match your birth certificate, you can't prove your citizenship.  According to the SAVE Act, you won't be able to vote.

Right now, under Trump and Musk's disastrous economy, families like  so many of those who I represent back home in Georgia are struggling to  keep up with the cost of groceries, let alone adding $130 for a  passport just to register to vote.

In Georgia, over half of the population doesn't have a passport, and  our driver's licenses, even the REAL ID, don't prove citizenship.

This resolution could force Georgians to pay more than $700 million  just to register to vote.

Mr. Speaker, that is a poll tax, plain and simple, and it is blatant  voter suppression.

Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, voter suppression by any other  name is still voter suppression. This resolution violates the 14th  Amendment, 19th Amendment, 24th Amendment, and every tenet of a free  and inclusive democracy.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this disgrace of  a voter suppression resolution.
