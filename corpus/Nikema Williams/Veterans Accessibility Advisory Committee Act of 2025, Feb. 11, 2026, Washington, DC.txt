Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025


Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the SAVE America Act is back  before the House today, and right along with it is yet another attempt  at voter suppression. It is no coincidence that this is happening right  before the midterm elections.

In January, the FBI raided the Fulton County election office, my home  county, where I am a voter. That raid was a bold attempt to intimidate  voters in the Fighting Fifth.

The SAVE America Act is just another part of a scheme by House  Republicans and the Trump administration to take over our elections.

Atlanta's civil rights leaders, like my predecessor, the late  Congressman John Lewis, faced one of the bloodiest battles over our  right to vote.

The SAVE America Act will make it harder for millions of Americans to  get registered to vote by requiring in-person registration at election  offices--government offices with government hours. This is a burden for  caregivers and any hardworking American with a 9-to-5 job.

The SAVE America Act is an unfunded mandate to silence voters. The  goal of this bill is voter suppression, plain and simple.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this terrible  bill.
