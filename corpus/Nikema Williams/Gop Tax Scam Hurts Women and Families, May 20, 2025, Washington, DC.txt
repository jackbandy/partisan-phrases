Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my  constituent Monica.

Monica has lupus, kidney disease, and congestive heart failure.  Constant hospital stays make it tough for her to make ends meet.

Monica told me that her last hospital stay brought dialysis, blood  transfusions, and one complication after another. It also brought a  loss of her job.

Monica was hospitalized, fighting for her life, when she learned that  her $31 a week in SNAP benefits were being cut. Still, with the rising  cost of food, she told me that just those $31 in benefits made it  possible for her to eat the foods that were healthy to keep her  thriving and manage her health.

Monica wrote: ``Any cuts to these programs would be devastating for  people like me. This isn't just about politics. This is about  survival.''

I agree with Monica. This is about survival. This is about the  millions of people who will lose access to food under the GOP tax scam.

Mr. Speaker, we demand better. It is time for House Republicans to  stand up and join us in protecting the basic needs of the people  instead of  prioritizing massive tax breaks for billionaires.

I stand with Monica.
