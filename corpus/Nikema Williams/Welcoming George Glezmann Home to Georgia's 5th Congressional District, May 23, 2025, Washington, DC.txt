Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome my  constituent George Glezmann home from more than 2 years of wrongful  detention by the Taliban in Afghanistan.

George is home with his family in Atlanta in large part because of  the tireless efforts of his wife Aleksandra. A devoted Delta airplane  mechanic, George has an infectious zeal for life, travel, and  experience, and I know he is eager to return to a life of normalcy and  autonomy.

I also want to highlight the challenges that come from extended  wrongful detention: George has numerous medical conditions that arose  from lack of ongoing care, and his assets have been put in  conservatorship. The financial instability that came from George's  detention has resulted in him and Aleksandra losing access to stable  housing, a challenge exacerbated by George's ongoing conservatorship.

I am so pleased that George is back with his family, and words cannot  fully celebrate the work Aleksandra put in to bring her husband home. I  look forward to George's swift return to normalcy and autonomy with his  loved ones, back in Atlanta where he belongs.
