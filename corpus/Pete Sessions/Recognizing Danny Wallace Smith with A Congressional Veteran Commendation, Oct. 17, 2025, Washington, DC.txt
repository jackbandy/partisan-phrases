Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to present Danny Wallace  Smith of Crawford, Texas, with a Congressional Veteran Commendation for  his exceptional armed forces service and unwavering commitment to our  country, state, and local communities. Danny served three years in the  United States Army, including 18 months in Vietnam during the Tet  Offensive of 1968, one of the most significant and challenging periods  in United States military history. His bravery and dedication were  recognized with numerous commendations, including the National Defense  Service Medal, Good Conduct Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with 5 Bronze  Service Stars and one Silver Star, Vietnam Campaign Medal, Vietnam  Cross of Gallantry, Navy Valorous Service Ribbon, and a Presidential  Unit Citation.

Following his military service, Danny pursued higher education at  Hardin Simmons University and earned a B.A. from Wayland Baptist  College. He then dedicated 32 years to the Texas Department of Public  Safety, where he rose to the rank of Regional Commander, overseeing 46  counties. His leadership and commitment to public safety earned him  widespread respect. Notably, he served as the Commander of all DPS  uniformed forces during the Mt. Carmel incident, further underscoring  his critical role in high-stakes situations.

After retiring from DPS, Danny continued to serve by leading in the  field of education. As Director of the Law Enforcement Academy and  Division Chair of the Emergency Services Education Center at McLennan  Community College, he mentored and trained future law enforcement  professionals. His service extended further when he was called upon to  serve as Interim Police Chief in Bellmead (2019) and Robinson (2020),  Texas. In 2023, he was appointed as the full-time Police Chief of  Robinson, where he later retired in August 2025.

Spanning over 54 years, Danny's career reflects a lifetime of  selfless service, from the battlefield to public safety leadership,  education, and community policing. His enduring contributions have had  a lasting impact on the people of Texas and the broader law enforcement  community.

It is with great honor and respect that I present Danny Wallace Smith  with a Congressional Veteran Commendation from the 17th Congressional  District of Texas. His exemplary service to our Nation and continued  contributions to his community stand as a powerful example of public  duty and honor.
