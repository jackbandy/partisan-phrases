Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I stand on a bipartisan basis with one of  my fellow colleagues, Lloyd Doggett, from Travis County, Texas.

Mr. Speaker, today, we became the beneficiaries of seeing the Corps  of Engineers from the Fort Worth District visit us to talk about the  water needs and the infrastructure of our water programs in Texas.

Today, I rise to recognize Kathleen Spillane, chief of the Civil  Works Branch for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth  District.

In this role, Kathy oversees a comprehensive portfolio of critical  water resources development projects in Texas, including flood risks,  management, water supply, and operations.

Kathy manages a civil works program valued at over $1 billion,  supervising a team that takes input from not only Members of Congress  but also communities throughout Texas. Under her direction, the Fort  Worth District's 25 reservoirs, which provide over one-third of Texas'  surface drinking water, are effectively managed.

I am very proud of the years Kathy has spent not only with the Corps  but in service to the people of the United States of America and, in  particular, Texas.

Kathy has done a great job. I am very proud of her. May God be with  her as she travels back home to our home State of Texas.
