Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privilege to rise today  to present Christopher Aaron McGowen of Nacogdoches, Texas, as a  recipient of the 2025 Congressional Veteran Commendation in recognition  of his outstanding service to both his country and his community.

Aaron, a proud son of Nacogdoches, answered his country's call to  service in February 1992, when he entered the United States Army as a  Combat Medic. During his military career, he distinguished himself  through professionalism, courage, and selfless service. His commendable  service was recognized with numerous decorations, including the Bronze  Star Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal,  the National Defense Service Medal, the Combat Medic Badge, the  Parachutist Badge, the Driver and Mechanic Badge, and the Operation  Enduring Freedom Campaign Medal. These honors stand as a testament to  his steadfast commitment and the vital role he played in safeguarding  the lives of his fellow soldiers.

Following his honorable discharge, Aaron continued his life of  service by dedicating himself to veterans and his community. While  living in Washington State, he became an active member of the Combat  Veterans Motorcycle Association, contributing countless hours to  fundraising efforts that provided construction projects for disabled  veterans, ensuring safe homes and greater mobility for those who  sacrificed for our freedoms. He further demonstrated his compassion and  solidarity by volunteering at local VA hospitals and participating in  funeral escorts to honor fallen service members and veterans.

In 2022, Aaron returned to his hometown of Nacogdoches, reuniting  with his high school sweetheart, Melissa Milford McGowen, and resumed  his mission of community service. As a member of the Nacogdoches Lions  Club, he has worked tirelessly in the Vision Screening Program and  collaborated with the Nacogdoches County Veterans Service Officer to  ensure local veterans receive the resources and care they deserve.

His commitment deepened further in May 2023, when he assumed  leadership within the Nacogdoches Hero Foundation as Chair of the  Action Committee. Through this role, Aaron has made significant  contributions to projects that directly support veterans, law  enforcement officers, first responders, and their families, improving  lives and strengthening the bonds of community.

Christopher Aaron McGowen embodies the highest ideals of service,  both in uniform and as a citizen leader. His legacy is one of valor,  compassion, and unwavering devotion to others. It is an honor to  recognize him today with the 2025 Congressional Veteran Commendation.
