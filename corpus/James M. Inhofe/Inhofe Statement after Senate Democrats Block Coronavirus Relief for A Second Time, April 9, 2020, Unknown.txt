Inhofe Statement after Senate Democrats Block Coronavirus Relief for A Second Time


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe made the following statement today after Senate Democrats blocked a motion by Leader McConnell to pass standalone emergency funding for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) by unanimous consent.

"While we face the greatest public health crisis in over 100 years, Senate Democrats have decided to once again play partisan games and block the advancement of legislation that would provide more desperately needed coronavirus relief to our small businesses and their employees.

"Small businesses are the lifeline of Oklahoma's economy and jobs are being saved by the Paycheck Protection Program. No one can argue with that fact. Because of the success of this program, it has become exceptionally clear that Congress must provide more funding before resources are used up. While other programs in the CARES Act are working to distribute desperately needed funding to our health care providers and state and local governments, this is not the time to block additional resources to maintain employment levels at our small businesses."

Senate Democrats also refused to support a procedural vote that would have moved the Senate closer to a vote on the CARES Act, the third coronavirus relief package. That delayed the enactment of the CARES Act by three days.
