SASC Chairman Inhofe Statement on Air Strikes Against Iranian-Backed Kata'ib Hizbollah


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today released the following statement on yesterday's air strikes against Kata'ib Hizbollah facilities across Iraq: 

"President Trump made the right decision ordering yesterday's strike on the Iranian-backed militia Kata'ib Hizbollah's facilities.  It was a defensive, proportionate and necessary response to the attack that killed Air Force Staff Sgt. Marshal D. Roberts of Owasso, Okla., and Army Spc. Juan Miguel Mendez Covarrubias of Hanford, Calif. President Trump has been clear, we will not tolerate attacks on our troops and the United States will act decisively to defend American lives.  The strike should serve as a reminder to Iran's leadership that we have the will and the capability to find and destroy the source of any threat to our forces.  Nobody wants war -- de-escalation and negotiation remain possible, but only if Iran is willing to cease its terrorism.

"The President has and must continue to have all options available to tell Iran there will be a price for its aggression, whether from its armed forces, the IRGC or its proxy terrorist network."
