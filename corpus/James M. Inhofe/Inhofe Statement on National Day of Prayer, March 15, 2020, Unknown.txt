"As Americans, when confronted with fear and challenges, we turn to prayer. The coronavirus is no exception. I encourage all Americans to join Kay and me in praying for our president, public health workers and all the families who have been impacted.

Together, through prayer, we can find courage, comfort and strength to weather the crisis."
