Inhofe Statement on INDOPACOM 'Regain the Advantage' Report


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today released the following statement after the committee received a report from the Commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command on resourcing United States defense requirements for the Indo-Pacific region, as required by Section 1253 of the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act: 

"Under President Trump, we've made a lot of progress rebuilding readiness and investing in the modernization of our force, but we still need to do more to deter our adversaries, especially China. The reality is that the military balance in the Indo-Pacific is getting worse. This assessment provides critical information for understanding how to reverse this trend and to protect American interests in this important region.

"Clearly, many of those requirements are in the areas of posture and logistics. I am pleased that Admiral Davidson focused much of his assessment on these critical requirements. As I've said before, the National Defense Strategy is about more than just how many planes, ships and tanks we buy. It's also about making sure our forces can be in the right place, at the right time, with the right stuff. Posture and logistics may not draw as much attention as F-35s or hypersonic weapons, but they're just as important."  

"Using this assessment, and working with the Pentagon, it's now up to Congress to act. With the Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, we will do our part to ensure the effective implementation of the National Defense Strategy in the Pentagon's priority theater."
