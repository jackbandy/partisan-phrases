Inhofe Speaks to Sec. Ross About Tariff Request


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) spoke with Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross today about his continued push for the Secretary to apply tariffs, including 232 national security tariffs, to oil imports from Saudi Arabia and Russia in response for their continued dumping of oil into the global markets, driving down prices at the same time that COVID-19 has caused demand to reach historic lows.

During the call, Inhofe emphasized the need to do more to punish the two nations. Given the overwhelming evidence of anticompetitive behavior, Inhofe argued it is time to apply tariffs. While Inhofe advocated for robust tariffs, he noted that even symbolic ones would have an impact by sending a signal to the Saudis and Russians to get more serious about providing stability.  

It was a productive, positive call, and Inhofe and Ross plan to speak again soon.
