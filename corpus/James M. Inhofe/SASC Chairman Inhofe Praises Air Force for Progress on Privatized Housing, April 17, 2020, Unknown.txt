SASC Chairman Inhofe Praises Air Force for Progress on Privatized Housing


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today released the following statement praising the U.S. Air Force's new Performance Incentive Fee agreement with Corvias:

"While we wait for the Department of Defense to make updates to the Tenant Bill of Rights, I'm glad to see the Air Force making progress with housing companies to give our military families the quality housing they deserve. Two of the biggest problems we saw in the privatized military housing program were that these companies had almost no accountability to the military families living in their housing, and that the chain of command was unengaged and unable to respond. Congress took steps to address these problems in last year's defense authorization bill, and, now, the Air Force is starting to follow through. This revised Performance Incentive Fee plan is a key step in the right direction, and rightly prioritizes resident satisfaction and empower the chain of command. I urge other military housing partners to follow in Corvias' footsteps."
