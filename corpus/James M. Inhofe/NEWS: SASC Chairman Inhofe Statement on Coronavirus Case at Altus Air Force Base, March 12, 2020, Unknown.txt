NEWS: SASC Chairman Inhofe Statement on Coronavirus Case at Altus Air Force Base


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) issued the following statement after the first coronavirus case on an Oklahoma military base was confirmed today:

"With the first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 on Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma, I commend Altus and all of Oklahoma's military installations for taking every precaution necessary to minimize any risk to the health and safety of our service members and the surrounding communities.

"My prayers are with the service member and his family, who are quarantined at home, and I wish them a swift recovery.

"I also want to thank the Department of Defense for working diligently, around the clock, to limit impact on our missions at home and across the world. Their latest force health protection guidance will help protect all DOD personnel from unnecessary risk of contracting coronavirus.".
