Inhofe Statement on Afghanistan Agreement


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement regarding President Trump's announcement of an agreement with representatives of the Taliban and joint declaration with the government of Afghanistan:

 "I commend President Trump and his administration for this weekend's historic steps towards peace in Afghanistan. These diplomatic efforts have the potential to end America's longest war, in which over 2,400 American service men and women have lost their lives, and reflect progress in realizing the President's South Asia Strategy. I look forward to consulting with the administration on ways to bolster the intra-Afghan negotiations that soon must follow and receiving a full briefing from Secretary Esper. We should never trust the Taliban, who harbored the al Qaeda terrorists that killed nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11. Our continued military presence in Afghanistan will enable us to monitor the Taliban's adherence to its commitments while providing us the opportunity to determine if Taliban actions match their obligations to ensuring a lasting peace. Should the Taliban fail or prove unable to fulfill their responsibilities, a limited military presence will also guarantee we retain the ability to counter the terrorists who would otherwise strike us and our partners again."
