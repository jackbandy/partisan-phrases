Inhofe Votes to Confirm Carranza as Small Business Administrator


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today voted to confirm Jovita Carranza as small business administrator.

 "Oklahoma small businesses have a huge impact on our state's economy and I'm proud to have an administration who makes them a priority," Inhofe said. "We have gotten a lot done for Oklahoma small businesses under the direction of the Trump Administration over the last few years and I know Jovita Carranza will continue to further those efforts. If we place heavy handed government regulations on small businesses, our economy will suffer. I look forward to working with Jovita to cut red tape while improving the small business environment in both Oklahoma and across the country." 

Ms. Carranza currently serves as Treasurer of the United States and as a principal advisor to Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin for community economic development and engagement. Ms. Carranza previously served as Deputy Administrator for the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) after her appointment by President George W. Bush and unanimous confirmation by the United States Senate.

In December, Inhofe outlined his 2020 workforce development priorities in the Stillwater News Press
