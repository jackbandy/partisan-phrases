Inhofe Applauds Nomination of Oklahoman Chase Johnson


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today issued a statement of support for President Trump's nomination of Chase Johnson to serve as the Inspector General at the Federal Communications Commission.

"Chase Johnson, originally from Oklahoma City, is a superb choice for Inspector General of the FCC," Inhofe said. "President Trump continues to make smart choices and Mr. Johnson is no exception. He has made the state of Oklahoma very proud in his past roles, including his service in the United States Marine Corps, and I know he will continue to in this new position."

Chase Johnson is the eldest son of Robert Johnson of Newkirk, Okla., and Cindy Johnson of Ardmore, Okla.
