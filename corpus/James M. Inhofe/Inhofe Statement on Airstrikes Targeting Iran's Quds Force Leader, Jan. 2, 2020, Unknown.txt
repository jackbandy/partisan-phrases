Inhofe Statement on Airstrikes Targeting Iran's Quds Force Leader


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement after he was informed by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the United States military, at the direction of President Trump, executed a successful air strike against Qasem Soleimani, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.

"President Trump has been clear all along -- the United States will not tolerate Iran spilling American blood, and tonight he followed his words with action. The Quds Force, under the direction of Soleimani, is responsible for attacks that have killed hundreds of American and coalition service members. Last week, an Iranian proxy killed an American contractor, and this week, Iran's proxies attacked our embassy and were actively targeting American diplomats and service members. Their actions were unacceptable--as are all actions that threaten Americans and our coalition partners.  

"From al-Baghdadi to Soleimani, America's adversaries should have no doubt that President Trump means what he says. America does not and should not seek war, but it will respond in kind to those who threaten our citizens, soldiers and friends -- as the President has long promised. De-escalation is preferable and possible -- but only if our adversaries choose it."
