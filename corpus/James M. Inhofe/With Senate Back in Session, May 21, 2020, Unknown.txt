With Senate Back in Session, Inhofe, SASC, Continue Critical Tele-Briefings on DOD COVID-19 Response, Impacts on Readiness


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today convened a tele-briefing with the Department of Defense (DOD), during which DOD officials outlined how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting military readiness and what steps the Department is taking to mitigate and reduce readiness deficits. 

DOD briefers included: The Honorable Matthew Donovan, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and Lieutenant General Andrew Poppas, Joint Staff Director for Operations.

Inhofe released the following statement following the briefing:

"Thanks to President Trump, we've been rebuilding military readiness to get back to where we need to be. We can't allow that progress to be squandered. Today, Under Secretary Donovan and Lieutenant General Poppas described how the coronavirus has affected our ability to recruit and to train our warfighters and what actions the Department of Defense is taking to mitigate these impacts. I was glad to hear they expect these steps will ensure we're not seeing readiness deficits for years to come.

"Addressing this issue is absolutely a top priority for me and for the committee as a whole. As we finalize the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, this information will help us ensure our troops have the training and equipment they need to complete their missions -- no matter what."
