Inhofe, Risch Comment on U.S.-Philippine Alliance


U.S. Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statements regarding the U.S.-Philippine alliance:

"Our alliance with the Philippines is our oldest in the Indo-Pacific, and to this day, remains essential for defending U.S. interests in the region and as we implement the National Defense Strategy," said Inhofe. "America is resolved to preserve peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, deter Chinese aggression, and defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of allies like the Philippines. That's why the most recent defense authorization bill reaffirmed our commitment to the Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines. I hope our two nations continue constructive dialogue about how we can work together to protect our common security, mutual interests, and shared values in an increasingly contentious region." 

"Yesterday, I had a constructive discussion with Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin, Jr. about the importance of the U.S.-Philippine alliance," said Risch. "This alliance requires the sustained commitment of both our nations. The United States' commitment to the Philippines is strong. From fighting terrorism, to responding to natural disasters, to enhancing maritime security, the United States and the Philippines are close allies. Our cooperation is crucial to the security of the Philippines, the United States, and the entire Indo-Pacific region."
