Inhofe Rebukes House Democrats' Politically Driven War Powers Vote


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released the following statement today after the U.S. House of Representatives voted to limit President Trump's constitutional authority:

"Today's war powers vote is nothing more than a political effort by Democrats who want to paint a single airstrike as a rush to war. There is no war. An airstrike is not war. Defending American citizens and assets is not war. But, restricting the President's ability to defend Americans only makes us vulnerable and makes war more likely.

"Some Democrats have such contempt for our President -- our Commander-in-Chief -- that they are more concerned about publically rebuking him than they are about defending America. The rush to pass this legislation--legislation that was drafted before the House received a briefing about the airstrike, without any committee hearings and with only two hours of floor debate--shows their focus isn't on the facts; it's on politics.

"The fact is that the Soleimani strike held Iran accountable for killing countless Americans over the last several decades, including the father of two young children last week. The strike has also resulted in a de-escalation in tensions. It was a success. President Trump has repeatedly affirmed America has no desire to go to war, and his strategy has shown restraint in the face of Tehran's provocations. His decision to eliminate Soleimani has put us on our strongest footing with Iran in more than 40 years. President Trump has made it clear to Iran that its aggression cannot and will not continue unchecked, but the only ones claiming that war is imminent are Congressional Democrats, not even the Iranians themselves."
