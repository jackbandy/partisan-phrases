Inhofe Receives A Rating on Susan B. Anthony List National Pro-Life Scorecard


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) received an A Rating on the Susan B. Anthony List National Pro-Life Scorecard, their highest rating, for the 116th Congress.

"I am humbled and thankful to be recognized by the Susan B. Anthony List with an A rating for the 116th Congress for my efforts to protect life, especially during the week of March for Life," Inhofe said. "Since Roe v. Wade, it is estimated that over 60 million babies' lives have been cut short through abortion--a horrendous and saddening fact. I am proud of the Susan B. Anthony List's work on behalf of the pro-life movement and I will continue to do my part in Congress to fight for the precious lives of the most vulnerable among us."

Inhofe has been a leader on legislative efforts to end the practice of abortion, including authoring the Down Syndrome Discrimination by Abortion Prohibition Act, and cosponsoring the Life at Conception Act, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. He has also worked with the Trump Administration to guarantee that federal tax dollars can't go towards abortion by protecting the Hyde Amendment and supporting the Administration's efforts to reinstate and expand the Mexico City policy.
