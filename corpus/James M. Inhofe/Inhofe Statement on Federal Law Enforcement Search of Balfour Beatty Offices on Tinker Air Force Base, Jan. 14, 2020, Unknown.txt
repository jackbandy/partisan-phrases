Inhofe Statement on Federal Law Enforcement Search of Balfour Beatty Offices on Tinker Air Force Base


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released the following statement today after the Air Force and Environmental Protection Agency executed a federal search warrant at the Balfour Beatty Communities office on Tinker Air Force Base:

"Today, I learned from the Air Force that the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the Environmental Protection Agency's Criminal Investigation Division executed a federal search warrant at the Balfour Beatty Communities office on Tinker Air Force Base. The warrant was related to suspected Clean Air Act violations by Balfour Beatty Communities. I thank federal law enforcement for doing their part to investigate any alleged wrongdoing, and I encourage Balfour Beatty Communities to cooperate fully with the investigation. While this matter is still very much under investigation, should these or any of the other ongoing federal investigations be substantiated, Balfour Beatty and those who perpetrated any wrongdoing against our military families must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law."
