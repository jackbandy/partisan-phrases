Inhofe Statement on Navy Leadership


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today released the following statement after Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced senior leadership changes within the Department of the Navy: 

"Secretary Esper has my support for the personnel decisions he determines necessary to provide stability and strong leadership throughout the Department of Defense, especially as we deal with this pandemic.

"However, it's disturbing to me that there's been so much turmoil at the top of the Department of the Navy over the last year. In this difficult time, the Navy needs leaders now more than ever who can provide continuity and steady, insightful leadership.  

"While I'm in Oklahoma, I have been working with the Department and my staff to address the many issues at hand as we deal with COVID-19. Once the Senate is back in session, I will make sure the Armed Services Committee considers the nomination of the next Secretary of the Navy quickly, and I ask my fellow committee members to help me expedite this nomination as well. Our Sailors, Marines and their families deserve to have stable, capable leadership at the helm during these challenging times.

"I also look forward to learning more about the events that led us to where we are today -- from who made the decision to dock the USS Theodore Roosevelt in Vietnam at the height of COVID-19 crisis there, to the support being given to unit commanding officers by Navy leadership, to what led the acting Secretary of the Navy to offer his resignation."
