SASC Chairman Inhofe Congratulates General Brown on Historic Confirmation


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, applauded Senate confirmation of General Charles Q. "C.Q." Brown, nominated to serve as the 22nd Chief of Staff of the Air Force.

"Today, the Senate confirmed General C.Q. Brown as the Chief of Staff of the Air Force -- the first African-American service chief in U.S. history," Inhofe said. "General Brown's experience as Commander of Pacific Air Forces and the Air Component Commander of the Indo-Pacific Command will be an asset as we turn our focus even more to this priority theater. Not only is General Brown accomplished in his military career, but he is an inspiring leader -- brave, authentic, and unifying. I congratulate him on his historic promotion, and look forward to seeing his continued leadership in action."
