Inhofe, SASC Scrutinize DOD COVID-19 Testing Plans


The Senate Armed Services Committee, chaired by U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), today received its fifth weekly briefing on the Department of Defense's (DOD) response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. 

The briefing focused on how DOD is conducting screening, surveillance and diagnostic testing of its personnel, as well as DOD's research efforts on potential vaccines for COVID-19. 

Briefers included: David Norquist, Deputy Secretary of Defense; Gen. John Hyten, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Major General Lee Payne, Assistant Director for Combat Support, Defense Health Agency; Brigadier General Dr. Paul Friedrichs, Joint Staff Surgeon; Mr. Ken Rapuano, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Security Policy, and Dr. Sean Biggerstaff, Acting Director, Research and Development Directorate (DHA).

Inhofe released the following statement on the briefing:

"After last week's call, I wanted to dive in deeper on the issue of testing -- specifically, how the Department of Defense is testing service members and their families, what obstacles they face in doing so and what contingencies exist if they are unable to meet their goals. As this virus continues to spread, consistent testing and contact tracing are going to be all the more important to protecting our force, and I'm glad the Department has implemented a more formal plan at our urging. I thank Deputy Secretary Norquist, General Hyten, and the other briefers for giving us the details we needed to understand their tiered approach to testing, and how they are managing existing cases of COVID-19 across the services. 

"These regular calls have shown me how, even under these difficult circumstances, the Department of Defense has never wavered from "mission first, people always.' Even once we return to regular committee hearings, I look forward to frequent updates so we can stay apprised of their ongoing response."
