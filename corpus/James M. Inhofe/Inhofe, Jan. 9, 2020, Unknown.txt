Inhofe, Reed Announce First Armed Services Committee Hearing of 2020


U.S. Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) released the following statement on the year ahead today with the announcement of the first Senate Armed Services Committee hearing of 2020:

"Recent events are a sober reminder that a strong national defense is integral to protecting our way of life--not just for us, but for future generations. As Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, we will do our part to fulfill our constitutional responsibilities to provide for the common defense, support the Pentagon as it implements the National Defense Strategy and take care of our troops and their families.

"Doing so will include a robust schedule of posture, oversight and nomination hearings. The Armed Services Committee will conduct thorough oversight to keep the Pentagon accountable to the American people and improve the way it does business. In addition, we will also diligently consider nominees for critical civilian leadership positions, beginning next week.

"After a tough but successful year that saw our draft National Defense Authorization Act pass the Senate 86-8, then a final conference report pass the Senate with the same strong, bipartisan vote, we will continue working together to produce a bipartisan defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2021. With a two-year budget deal in place, we hope that we can move quickly and complete this must-pass bill on time."
