Inhofe Applauds Senate Passage of Leader McConnell's Organizing Resolution for Impeachment Trial


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) applauded U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) after his Organizing Resolution, S. Res. 483, passed the Senate early this morning ahead of the official start of President Trump's impeachment trial.

"Now that House Democrats have finally transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, we are getting started on the trial. I am proud of the organizing resolution drafted by Leader McConnell that structures the first phase of the trial," Inhofe said. "With the passage of this resolution--we will have a trial that is fair, provides due process to the president and follows the precedent of the Clinton impeachment trial resolution. I am ready to begin and finish this trial so we can get back to focusing on things that matter to Oklahomans."
