Inhofe Announces Nearly $355 Million in Additional Relief for Oklahoma Hospitals and Health Care Providers


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) announced today that hospitals and medical providers in Oklahoma will receive nearly $355 million in additional funds from the Department of Health and Human Services as authorized by the CARES Act. This funding will go towards hospitals and healthcare providers to combat the crisis, as well as targeted funding for areas that have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and rural providers. 

Because Inhofe urged HHS to prioritize rural hospitals, more than half of the funding, $281 million, is specifically designated to rural hospitals in Oklahoma. This is part of the second installment of funds to support hospitals and medical providers that are both overstretched from the COVID-19 response, as well as providers that are struggling since elective procedures have been cancelled.

"It is incredibly important that we continue to bring funding relief to Oklahoma hospitals and medical providers as they combat this virus from the front lines," Inhofe said. "This money will not only provide relief to hospitals throughout the state, but it also includes additional funding for the areas particularly affected by the coronavirus and rural areas who are in need of more resources. I will continue to work in Washington to equip our Oklahoma doctors, nurses and staff with the tools to combat this crisis at full force."

On April 10, Inhofe announced that hospitals and medical providers in Oklahoma would receive $489 million in funds from the Department of Health and Human Services as authorized by the CARES Act.

On March 25, Sen. Inhofe voted in favor of the CARES Act, legislation that provided a comprehensive response to the coronavirus crisis. President Trump signed the legislation into law on March 27.
