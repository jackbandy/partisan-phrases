Inhofe Praises President's Signing of Trade Deal with China


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) praised President Trump today for signing the first part, also known as "phase one," of a new trade deal with China. 

"President Trump is the first modern president to take China seriously -- he has made this clear yet again with the signing of today's trade deal," Inhofe said. "He understands that for too long, our trade relationship with China has been flawed and that we need real and permanent change in order to have any long-term stability.

"His signing of this phase one deal today will result in a $200 billion increase of U.S. exports to China over the next two years. This is nearly double our 2017 exports to China -- a win not only for our farmers and ranchers, but also for our manufacturing, energy and financial services industries. President Trump's negotiating style brings real results to Oklahoma farmers and industries across the nation--this deal is more proof of this.

"It's important to remember that today is just the first phase -- this provides concrete benefits now while maintaining our leverage going forward. Future parts of any agreement need to address trade concerns presidents of both parties neglected for decades--including theft of intellectual property, forced technology transfer, reciprocal access to markets and subsidies to China's state-owned enterprises. I look forward to working with the president to ensure these issues are addressed."

Inhofe is currently the only U.S. Senator still serving who voted against normalizing trade relations with China in 2000, a vote that allowed China to take advantage of American businesses and markets for years until President Trump stood up to them. He spoke on the floor about that vote in November.
