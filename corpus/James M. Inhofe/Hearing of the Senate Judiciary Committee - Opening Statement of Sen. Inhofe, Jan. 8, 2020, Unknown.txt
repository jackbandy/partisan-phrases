Hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee - Opening Statement of Sen. Inhofe, Hearing on the Nomination of John Heil for U.S. District Court Judge


Remarks as prepared for delivery

Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing me and Sen. Lankford to be here to introduce to the Committee an impressive Oklahoman, John Heil.

I am proud to support John's nomination to serve as a U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern, Eastern and Western districts of Oklahoma.

John is here today with his wife, Melanie; his three sons, Jack, Blake, Barrett; his sister, Julie; his mother, Sharon and his friend, Jana.

A fellow Tulsan, John is a graduate of OSU in Stillwater and University of Tulsa law school, with honors. For over 25 years, John has practiced law in both private practice and as an Assistant District Attorney in Tulsa County. Since 2000, he has been a shareholder attorney at Hall, Estill, Hardwick, Gable, Golden and Nelson in Tulsa. John has extensive experience in both federal and state courts.

There is no question that John has the integrity and discipline needed to serve our nation well. He is exactly the kind of jurist we need on the bench.

I thank the Committee and urge it to move quickly to approve John's nomination as soon as possible. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
