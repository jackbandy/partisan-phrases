Inhofe Announces Nearly $490 Million in Relief for Oklahoma Hospitals and Health Care Providers


U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) announced today that hospitals and medical providers in Oklahoma will receive $489 million in funds from the Department of Health and Human Services as authorized by the CARES Act. These funds, distributed directly to approximately 4,100 providers throughout the state will be delivered today, and do not have to be paid back.

This is part of the first installment of funds to support hospitals and medical providers that are both overstretched from the COVID-19 response, as well as providers that are struggling since elective procedures have been cancelled. Additional funding and resources for hospitals and medical providers is expected to be announced throughout the month.

"Quick distribution of funds to hospitals and medical providers will provide immediate relief to the hospitals and providers that are trying to handle the influx of coronavirus cases. Equally important -- it will also help maintain the resiliency of providers that are struggling because they are unable to perform elective surgeries and procedures during the crisis. This investment in Oklahoma health care will help us weather the crisis, but will also ensure our medical system can operate at full strength once this has passed."

On March 25, Sen. Inhofe voted in favor of the CARES Act, legislation that provided a comprehensive response to the coronavirus crisis. President Trump signed the legislation into law on March 27.
