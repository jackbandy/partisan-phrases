Recognizing Joshua Hobson


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699907/recognizing-joshua-hobson


Mr. MACKENZIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Officer Joshua  Hobson of the Bethlehem Police Department for an act of service that  reflects the very best of our law enforcement.

While working an overtime shift, Officer Hobson responded to a call  that was first reported as a burglary. It turned out to be an 88-year- old resident who was deeply concerned about the lock on her front door,  and she no longer felt safe in her own home.

After inspecting the door, Officer Hobson realized that the lock had  been improperly installed. Instead of just filing a report and moving  along, he took it upon himself to go to a local store, purchase a  proper lock, and install it himself, giving this resident the peace of  mind that she had been missing.

This story is just one example of the many behind-the-scenes ways  that our local law enforcement serves their communities every single  day. Officer Hobson's actions reflect the care, professionalism, and  compassion that define the men and women who protect our communities.

I am grateful for Officer Hobson and for the men and women of the  Bethlehem Police Department who work every day to keep our communities  safe.                          Recognizing Kate Gilchrist

Mr. MACKENZIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kate Gilchrist,  a senior at Parkland High School and a resident of Orefield, for an  extraordinary achievement.

Kate was recently selected as an Emerging Young Artist awardee, 1 of  just 15 nationwide whose work will be displayed prominently here in  Washington, D.C. This program highlights talented artists with  disabilities and supports their growth in the creative economy.

Kate's work reflects creativity, confidence, and resilience, and her  selection is a testament to her talent and determination. It is  inspiring to see a young person from our community be recognized on the  national stage for telling her story through art.

As a fellow Parkland Trojan, I congratulate Kate, her family, and her  teachers, and I wish her continued success as she pursues her passion  and future opportunities.                          Recognizing Mario Landino

Mr. MACKENZIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mario Landino,  a graduate of Emmaus High School, for representing our community on one  of football's biggest stages.

Mario recently played in the College Football National Championship  as a member of the Indiana University Hoosiers, starting on the  defensive line as his team captured the national title.

Back home in Emmaus, where I reside, friends, former teammates,  coaches, and neighbors came together to cheer him on, a testament to  the character and leadership that Mario has shown, both on and off the  field.

Mario's success reflects the hard work, discipline, and values  instilled by his family, coaches, and community. I congratulate him on  this incredible achievement and wish him all of the best and continued  success in the years that lie ahead.                 Honoring the Life and Service of Jim VanWert

Mr. MACKENZIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  service of Jim VanWert, a dedicated member of the Lower Macungie Fire  Department, who recently passed away after 45 years of service to our  community.

Jim devoted his life to protecting others, serving in many roles over  the decades, including nearly 25 years as assistant fire chief.

Jim's leadership, experience, and commitment helped to shape the  department and mentor generations of firefighters. For nearly half a  century, Jim answered the call whenever his neighbors needed help. His  service reflects the dedication and sacrifice that define fire  departments across our region.

I extend my deepest condolences to Jim's family, his fellow  firefighters, and the entire Lower Macungie community. As a Lower  Macungie resident, I thank Jim for his service and the sacrifice that  he gave.

Jim will never be forgotten, and I am grateful for the example that  he has set for all of those who serve.                           Recognizing Kevin Cahill

Mr. MACKENZIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kevin Cahill,  head coach of the Lehigh University football team, for earning the  Eddie Robinson Award, presented to the top head coach in the Football  Championship Subdivision, or FCS.

This national honor reflects Coach Cahill's leadership in building  Lehigh football and restoring a championship culture. Under his  guidance, the Mountain Hawks captured back-to-back Patriot League  titles, earned consecutive FCS playoff appearances, and completed an  undefeated regular season.

Beyond the wins, Coach Cahill has built a program centered on  discipline, teamwork, and student-athlete leadership, values that will  reflect the very best of the Lehigh University community.

I congratulate Coach Cahill, his staff, and all of the student- athletes on this well-deserved recognition, and I thank them for  representing Bethlehem and the Lehigh Valley with excellence, both on  and off the field.
