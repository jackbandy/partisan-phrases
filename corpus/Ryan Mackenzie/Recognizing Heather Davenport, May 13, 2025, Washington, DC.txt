Recognizing Heather Davenport


Mr. MACKENZIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Heather  Davenport, USOA Ms. Pennsylvania, and founder of We Are Strong LLC, a  nonprofit committed to breaking the cycle of domestic abuse and  offering hope to those affected.

Since earning her title in November, she has volunteered at food  banks, supported pediatric cancer families, honored veterans, and  raised awareness about domestic violence throughout the State. She has  used her role as USOA Ms. Pennsylvania to represent our community with  compassion and purpose.

Heather, a proud resident of the Greater Lehigh Valley and a mother  of five, has used her platform to give a voice to those who are often  overlooked and to strengthen the support systems for individuals facing  abuse.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate her and thank her for the incredible work  that she is doing. Her nonprofit, We Are Strong, is a traveling  domestic violence clinic that provides essential resources such as  housing, clothing, and emotional support to individuals in need  throughout the State.

This work is urgently needed. In Pennsylvania alone, more than 100  victims lost their lives to domestic violence last year, and  nationally, one in four women experience severe physical violence from  an intimate partner in their lifetime.

I appreciate the work that Heather has done and want to continue to  extend heartfelt gratitude for all of her work.
