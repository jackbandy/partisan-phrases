Mr. MACKENZIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two exceptional  students from the greater Lehigh Valley, Adam Wyatt and Ria Gandotra,  recipients of the 2025 Congressional Award Gold Medal, the highest  honor Congress can bestow upon a civilian youth.

Adam, a student at Nazareth Area High School and an Eagle Scout, has  used the program to build leadership skills, service, and discipline.  From studying Russian and leading his family on a 19-day European tour  to interviewing local veterans, he has taken on challenges that show  real initiative and follow-through.

Ria, a student at Moravian Academy, volunteered at a camp for  children with special needs, worked to better herself academically,  played on her school's tennis team, and planned a family trip to  Toronto. Her work reflects both compassion and determination and a  clear commitment to personal and civic growth.

Adam and Ria exemplify the values of service, perseverance, and  personal development. I am proud to recognize their achievements and  the positive impact they have had on their local community as young  leaders in the greater Lehigh Valley.
