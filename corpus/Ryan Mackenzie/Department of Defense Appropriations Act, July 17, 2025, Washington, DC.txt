Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2026


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693689/department-of-defense-appropriations-act-2026


Mr. MACKENZIE. Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment by my  colleague from Pennsylvania that increases funding by $30 million for  procurement of the Army's heavy dump trucks and offsets it with a $30  million reduction to future tactical unmanned aircraft system  development. While that development remains important, the Army's heavy  dump trucks are critical to current operational needs.

These trucks are manufactured by companies like Mack Defense in  Allentown, Pennsylvania. I have had the opportunity to tour that  facility and see firsthand how this facility provides well-paying jobs  in our community while at the same time reinforcing the strength of our  Nation's defense industrial base.

This amendment delivers the tactical vehicles our troops rely on that  are built by a critical manufacturer right in the Lehigh Valley.

Madam Chair, I am proud to cosponsor this amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting its passage.
