Facing Down Perpetrators of Destruction


Mr. MACKENZIE. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, the world once again  witnessed a shocking act of terrorism committed against innocent  civilians in Syria.

Those who attended Sunday mass at the Mar Elias Church were not  combatants. They were members of the community who sought to live in  peace and  rebuild from war. They were members of our community who had endured  unimaginable suffering and faced an uncertain future with faith and  hope.

In the shadow of relentless terror and violence, it takes enormous  courage to do many of the things that we take for granted. We can take  inspiration from those who face down the cowardly perpetrators of  destruction with faith and hope as they work to rebuild their nation.

I join the Greater Lehigh Valley Syrian community in praying for the  victims of this attack and for peace to return to Syria. May God bless  all of those who stand up in the face of terror and violence.
