Child Tax Credit

Mr. MACKENZIE. Mr. Speaker, over the last 4 years, every American has  felt the pain of inflation, and this financial strain has hit working  families particularly hard. Large price increases set back millions of  parents, forcing them to dig into their savings and even go into debt  sometimes just to pay their bills.

That is why, as a part of budget reconciliation, Congress passed  legislative language to permanently increase the child tax credit,  index it to inflation, and add a $500 increase, bringing the total tax  credit to $2,500. Changes to the tax code, including expanding the  child tax credit, will help save the average family more than $1,300 a  year. It is time to deliver real tax relief for working families that  they so desperately need.

I call on my colleagues in the Senate to protect these provisions and  make sure that working families are being helped and, after 4 years of  rising costs, finally deliver parents the relief that they deserve.
