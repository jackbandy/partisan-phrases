Breaking the Gridlock Act

Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, every day, more Americans are being hurt by  the Republican healthcare crisis. Tax credits that help working people  afford healthcare are vanishing, and Americans are watching  billionaires get huge tax cuts while the cost of living goes up.

My Republican friends knew that refusing to renew these tax credits  would cause healthcare costs to skyrocket.

Mr. Speaker, they decided to cancel work for 2 months and simply  ignored the affordability problem. President Trump even called it a  hoax.

Democrats put forward this bill to help the American people. Thanks  to a few sensible colleagues on the other side, we were able to force a  vote on it.

While Trump continues his self-dealing corruption and growing  fondness for attacking foreign countries, his administration is  lawlessly killing and lying about the death of an unarmed woman in  Minneapolis.

Republican leadership in Congress had to be forced to even allow a  vote on this bill. Democrats here are focused on a bill to lower costs  for tens of millions of Americans and prevent many from losing  healthcare.

Mr. Speaker, we speak about life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. We can't be free, it is hard to be happy, and lives are cut  short with no healthcare.
