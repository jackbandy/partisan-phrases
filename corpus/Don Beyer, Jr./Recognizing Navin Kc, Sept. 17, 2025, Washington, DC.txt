Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and include in the  Record, three prominent community members in the Nepali American  community who have contributed to cultivating arts, culture, and  business around the country.                                   Navin KC

For more than twenty-five years, Navin KC has been a tireless force  in the world of dance and choreography, introducing Nepali language,  art, and culture to audiences both nationally and internationally. As  the Founder and Director of KC Dance Center in Virginia, he has  provided countless students, particularly second-generation children,  with dance training that emphasizes not only technique but also  cultural heritage and language. His choreography has been featured in  films, theater productions, and music videos, while his students have  performed across the United States in places such as Hollywood, New  York, Texas, and Colorado. Since 2017, through his annual production,  ``Kollywood Night,'' Navin has created a powerful platform where  emerging talent and celebrated artists come together to celebrate the  richness of Nepali culture on stage.                                Luna Shrestha

With more than two decades of dedication to art, culture, and  language, Luna Shrestha has made a profound impact as a performer,  choreographer, and instructor. As Co-Founder and Director of KC Dance  Center, she has trained students across Virginia, Maryland, and  Washington, D.C. in dance, yoga, aerobics, and Nepali-inspired fitness  programs. Luna's work is driven by her passion for preserving and  sharing Nepali traditions in America and giving young performers the  opportunity to showcase their skills on stages nationwide. She plays a  key role in the production of the annual ``Kollywood Night'' show for  new trainees and established artists.                                  Nabaraj KC

A community leader, humanitarian, and advocate, Nabaraj KC has earned  recognition on local and national levels. As President of the College  Point Civic and Taxpayers Association and the Dil Kumari KC Memorial  Foundation, he has led initiatives that raised more than $3 million  worth of food, personal protective equipment, and other important  resources to communities in need during the COVID-19 pandemic. His  service has earned him several honors, including the REALTOR Spirit  Award in 2022, Community Service Award in 2023, and COVID-19 Hero  Award. He has also been named among Schneps Media's Queens Power List  and Kings of New York. A proud New Yorker and son of Nepali immigrants,  Nabaraj KC combines his professional and educational background with a  dedication to community service.
