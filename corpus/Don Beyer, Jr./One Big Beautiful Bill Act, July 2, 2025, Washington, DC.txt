One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, from the Gospel of Matthew:

``For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave  me drink; I was a stranger and you took me in; I was naked and you  clothed me; I was sick and you visited me; I was in prison and you came  unto me.''

``Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of my brothers,  you have done it unto me.''

Mr. Speaker, the bill before us takes food and drink from the mouths  of the poor. It takes healthcare from the sick. A vote for this bill  betrays these Gospel teachings. In our hearts, all of us know it.
