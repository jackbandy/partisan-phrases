Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, House Republicans passed a  bill that strips healthcare from millions of Americans and raises costs  for millions more.

That was a monstrous bill, but this is a cowardly bill. It does  nothing to stop the skyrocketing costs that we have been warning about  for months. Nothing in this bill will extend the tax credits that help  20 million Americans afford health insurance.

This bill won't stop the Republican cuts that will raise my  constituents' costs by $900 a month or restore coverage to millions  whose coverage was sacrificed to give billionaires tax cuts.

The developed countries around the world have figured out how to give  affordable healthcare to their citizens.

A vote for this bill is a vote for the Republican healthcare crisis.
