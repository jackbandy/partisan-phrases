Recognizing 30 Years of Art on the Avenue


Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 30th  anniversary of Art on the Avenue, an annual celebration held each fall  in the Del Ray neighborhood of Alexandria, Virginia. For three decades,  this esteemed event has served as a cultural touchstone, welcoming  visitors from throughout the greater Washington, D.C., area and  exemplifying the spirit of artistic expression and community  engagement.

Since its founding, Art on the Avenue has attracted tens of thousands  of attendees each year. The festival features the work of more than 300  artist vendors, musical performances across four stages, family- friendly activities, and an array of cuisine from local restaurants and  eateries. These offerings have enriched the community, fostered  creativity, and supported local businesses.

Art on the Avenue is consistently recognized as one of Virginia's  premier festivals, earning repeated distinction as ``Best of Virginia  Festivals'' by Virginia Living Magazine. Its enduring popularity and  acclaim reflect the dedication of the organizers and the appreciation  of the participants.

I wish to recognize and extend my deep appreciation to Pat Miller,  the founder of Art on the Avenue, for her exemplary leadership and  unwavering dedication to this event. The longstanding success of Art on  the Avenue has been made possible by Pat's vision and commitment.

I also want to offer special recognition to the local businesses that  sponsor the festival each year, and to the hundreds of volunteers whose  steadfast efforts ensure its continued excellence and vitality.

In commemorating this milestone anniversary, I encourage my  colleagues to join me in celebrating Art on the Avenue and the profound  contributions it has made to the cultural life and community spirit of  Northern Virginia and the entire Commonwealth.
