Fired By President Trump


Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the story of a Federal  scientist, and a constituent of mine, who has witnessed the impacts of  President Trump and Elon Musk's recent firings. He wrote:

This week, 168 of my colleagues at the National Science       Foundation were fired in a mass meeting and then waited for       hours for an email with instructions before they were removed       from NSF systems.

Two in my division were program assistants who provided       crucial support for the review process--both early in their       career and with tremendous promise as civil servants.

Another in my division was an intermittent expert.

National Science Foundation's work depends on bringing in       knowledgeable experts from many fields, and intermittent       experts are critical for this.

To lose them is an incredible loss for STEM education.

The cost of employing them to the government is small and       far outweighed by the benefits of their service to NSF and       the Nation.

Letting them go makes no sense that I can see.

Mr. Speaker, I agree with my constituent that this makes absolutely  no sense. This will be a severe loss for American scientific leadership  and scientific advancement at large.

We stand with our scientific community and condemn these firings.
