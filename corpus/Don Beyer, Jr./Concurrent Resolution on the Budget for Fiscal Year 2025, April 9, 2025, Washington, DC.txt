Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  budget resolution, which is a recipe for economic disaster for our  country.

Americans have been clear. They want lower prices and an economy that  works for them. Yet, at every turn, this administration and my  Republican colleagues are doubling down on policies that raise prices,  undermine our economy, and make our wealth inequality even worse.

Mr. Speaker, I spent much of today with U.S. Trade Ambassador Greer,  and it is clear that the administration's myth that tariffs will  reshape the economy by bullying our closest allies is nothing more than  a fantasy.

The Trump tariffs represent the largest tax hike in American history.  They have caused chaos in the markets and stripped millions from  Americans' retirement plans. Consumer confidence is plummeting,  reaching its lowest level in 12 years, and economists are increasingly  convinced that we are heading for a recession.

This budget will balloon our deficit, leading to higher interest  rates. It will slash critical investments and will decimate essential  programs that support the people who we represent, all of this to help  billionaires and corporations get tax cuts that they do not need and  that our country cannot afford.
