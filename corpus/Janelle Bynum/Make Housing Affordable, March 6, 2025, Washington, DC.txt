Make Housing Affordable


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688671/make-housing-affordable


Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because Oregonians can't afford  to buy a home.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the rent is too damned high.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the game is rigged.

Mr. Speaker, I hear from everyone I talk to, from my constituents to  my kids, about how hard it is to find affordable housing.

Oregon ranks 45th in the Nation in housing affordability, and it is  getting worse. Our population has grown faster than our housing supply,  driving costs up for buyers and renters.

I refuse to leave Oregonian families hanging. That is why I am  fighting on the Financial Services Committee to make a difference. I am  fighting to make it easier to buy or rent a home, and I am fighting to  build more houses and increase our supply.

Mr. Speaker, I will always fight to lower costs and make life just a  little bit easier for Oregonians.
