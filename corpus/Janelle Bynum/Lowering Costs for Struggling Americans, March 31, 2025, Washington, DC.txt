Lowering Costs for Struggling Americans


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689333/lowering-costs-for-struggling-americans


Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, every day I hear from my constituents that  they  are struggling to afford groceries, rent, healthcare, and other  necessities. That is why lowering costs has always been priority one  for me. However, it doesn't seem to be a priority for this  administration and some of my colleagues, and they know who they are.

Despite President Trump's pledging to end inflation on day one, costs  have continued to increase, and his tariffs policy is making things  worse. It is crashing the stock market in the process. His policy is  essentially adding a massive tax to everyday items for families.

I find it unconscionable and, frankly, unacceptable that anyone would  make things more expensive right now, and I won't stand by, and I won't  let it happen. That is why I am fighting back. I am fighting back with  the Protecting Families From Inflation Act. It is my very first bill.  It makes progress on my top priority, lowering costs for my  constituents.

I am calling right now for the House to show they are serious about  lowering costs and taking up and passing this legislation.

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, what decorum did I break? I apologize.

Ms. BYNUM. My apologies. I am really proud of my daughter.
