Federal Employees

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I got this message from  an Oregonian named Donna. She says: ``Please fight to protect Federal  employee retirement benefits. They should not be slashed. Federal  employees are currently putting up with so much to keep this country  running.

``Immediately reducing our pay and benefits on top of everything else  is a kick in the teeth. It is also a bait and switch. It should not be  legal. I was promised certain benefits when I started, and they should  not be taken away from me when I am less than 2 years from retirement.

``Who is going to run the government? You know, provide services that  keep the planes in the sky, the power flowing, the food safe, and warn  of pending major life-threatening events, events like hurricanes and  infectious diseases? Who will want to work for the American people  after this latest attack? Stop abusing us.''

Mr. Speaker, I challenge you to explain these cuts to Donna.
