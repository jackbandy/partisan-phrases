Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the impressive  efforts of Clackamas Community College President Tim Cook, who ran more  than 1,400 miles over 52 days to raise money and awareness for Oregon  students. His journey, which started on the Oregon-Idaho border,  visited each of the state's 17 community colleges. Averaging roughly a  marathon a day. Tim worked to bring attention to the many challenges  students face, including food insecurity, homelessness, and lack of  childcare.

I am truly impressed by Tim's work, dedication, and drive. I could  not be prouder to represent the school he leads. I look forward to  continuing to fight for strong education policies together. Way to go.
