Speaking Out for Oregonians

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, it has been 6 months since I was sworn in to  serve Oregon's Fifth Congressional District. Since then, we have seen  the programs we rely on cut, costs rise, and the needs of the American  people ignored.

That is why I always encourage Oregonians to call my office and make  their voices heard. I have heard from over 50,000 Oregonians, taken  over 120 constituent meetings, and held 10 townhalls, including 6 as  part of my ``Give `em Hell'' tour.

The stories I hear help me elevate the issues in our district and  fight back, including with these floor speeches, or as I call them,  protest speeches. Today is my 22nd one where I have shared constituent  stories to help defend SNAP, Social Security, Medicare, and more, and  call out my Republican colleagues.

I hope Oregonians will keep sharing their stories with me, and I will  keep amplifying them. We have to keep the pressure on my Republican  colleagues and President Trump by winning in the court of public  opinion.
