Time to End the Damage of the Dobbs Decision

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks 3 years since the Supreme  Court voted to strip women of their reproductive healthcare rights,  overturning 50 years of legal precedent. I am talking about the Dobbs  decision.

I rise today because that devastating decision has put the health of  women nationwide at risk. Since then, States have issued extreme  restrictions on abortion, forcing thousands of women to travel or risk  prosecution to access basic healthcare.

Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable. As a mother to two daughters, hear  me when I say it: Decisions regarding reproductive healthcare should  not be in the hands of politicians and lawmakers. We must protect and  expand reproductive freedom for women everywhere.

Mr. Speaker, it is time to end the damage of the Dobbs decision and  restore a woman's right to choose.
