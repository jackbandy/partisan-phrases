Junk Fees

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I am here today not just as the  Representative for Oregon's Fifth Congressional District, but as a mom  getting ready for the holidays.

Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, costs are out of control.

Every time I go to make a purchase, these companies keep charging me  fee after fee after fee. So whether it is booking travel for my son to  come home for the holidays or buying tickets for my daughter as a  Christmas gift, these fees are driving up the cost of everything.

You get to the checkout page, and suddenly the price feels like it is  40 percent higher. There are payment processing fees for a flight,  venue fees for a concert, airport concession fees for a rental car, or  service charges on just about everything.

I have had it with these junk fees, and I have heard from so many  others that they have too.

Americans deserve transparency, not bait-and-switch pricing models.

That is why I introduced the Junk Fee Prevention Act. It is past time  that we get corporate greed under control and protect American  families.

I am calling on the House to get it done for the holidays.
