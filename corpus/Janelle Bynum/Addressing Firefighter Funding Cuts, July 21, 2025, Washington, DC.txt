Addressing Firefighter Funding Cuts

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I only have 1 minute today, but I wish I had  6 or 7 minutes.

Wildfire season is upon us. Over the weekend, we saw the Cram fire in  central Oregon grow to more than 95,000 acres, making it the largest  wildfire of the year so far in the United States.

I am grateful for the firefighters and local authorities who bravely  responded and who are continuing to fight the flames. Thanks to them,  the fire is now over 70 percent contained.

Mr. Speaker, while Oregon firefighters are out, saving lives and  homes, President Trump is freezing the funding they rely on. That is  unacceptable.

Whether it is for pushing out evacuation alerts or maintaining  shelters, this funding is key to keeping our neighbors safe and  prepared. That is why I can't stop, and I won't stop fighting to ensure  our communities have the resources they need.

I ask my constituents to please continue to follow the direction of  local authorities. Have an evacuation plan. Prepare a go bag.
