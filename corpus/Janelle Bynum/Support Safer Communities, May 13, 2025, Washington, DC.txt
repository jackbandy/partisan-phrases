Support Safer Communities

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the President is out  here in these streets cutting funding for programs that support a lot  of things Americans care about: Survivors of sexual assault, programs  that offer mental health care for police officers and keep hotlines to  victims of crime open, programs that assist law enforcement in rural  communities, provide guidance on finding safe housing, and offer care  and counseling for children facing abuse.

Mr. Speaker, local organizations have been sounding the alarm of what  these cuts would mean for our communities, and today I am joining them.  In some situations, these services are make or break, and we just can't  let our communities and our neighbors down.

Mr. Speaker, this week is Police Week, and if the President is truly  supportive of safer communities, he should quit cutting funding for  programs that work to keep them that way.
