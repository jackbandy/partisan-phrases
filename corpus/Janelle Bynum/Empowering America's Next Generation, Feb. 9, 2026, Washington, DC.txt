Empowering America's Next Generation

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I first ran for public office to make all of  our  kids' futures brighter, and our government hasn't done the same.  Millions of young Americans have done exactly what has been asked of  them, but our country isn't returning the favor.

Fewer children than ever outearn their parents. The average age of a  first-time home buyer is 40 years old, which is at an all-time high,  and things feel too costly. Opportunity feels too scarce.

I think Americans need to start believing in young people, and that  is exactly why I introduced my K-30 agenda. The legislation takes key  commonsense steps to make a difference, from investing in rural schools  and supporting our teachers to cutting red tape for small businesses  and revitalizing rural economies.

Mr. Speaker, this isn't about politics. It is about building a  foundation to empower America's next generation and showing them that  we have their backs.
