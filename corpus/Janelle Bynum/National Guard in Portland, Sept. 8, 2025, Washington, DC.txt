National Guard in Portland


Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, today I am here to stand up for Oregon. Just  before the weekend, the President spouted off some nonsense about  deploying the National Guard to Portland. As we have seen in D.C.,  L.A., and now Boston, it is an unwelcome occupation.

The President is wasting our troops' time and the country's money to  play cops and robbers for his ego.

Now, if he wants to send Federal resources to help our State, then  how about he invests in our schools instead of cutting the Department  of Education?

How about he sends funding that we can use to provide high-quality  childcare to every child and family, to build more affordable housing,  and to clean up the Superfund site on the Willamette River?

Mr. Speaker, if the President actually wants to help Oregonians, then  he should focus on his failing economic policies that are hurting  Americans and raising our costs.

We got us.
