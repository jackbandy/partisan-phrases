Ensuring Access to Education for Our Children with Disabilities

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, this weekend marks the 50th anniversary of  the passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. At the  time, that was a landmark piece of legislation that made sure our  children with disabilities had what they needed to succeed in the  classroom.

The IDEA hasn't been fully funded for decades, meaning these kids  aren't receiving all the support that they need. On top of that,  President Trump is dismantling the Department of Education and  threatening programs that protect civil rights and expand access to  opportunity for our kids. I will not stand for that.

Mr. Speaker, my North Star is America's children. That is why,  earlier this Congress, I introduced the IDEA Full Funding Act to help  our students with disabilities. I will continue fighting in Congress to  ensure that our children and our children's children and our children's  children's children have access to the education they deserve.
