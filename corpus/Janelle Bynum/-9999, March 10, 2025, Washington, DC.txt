Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend marked the 60th anniversary  of Bloody Sunday where a triumphant march in pursuit of equality and  justice for all was met with brutality and violence.

As I rise today, I rise thinking about the late John Lewis who  crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, arm-in-arm with 600, 700  activists and driven by a conviction to secure the right to vote. I  rise thinking about how 60 years later, we are seeing attempts to pull  our country back in time, to bring us back to an era of barriers at the  ballot box and restrictions on registration.

Mr. Speaker, as I rise today, I rise as a proud supporter of the John  Lewis Voting Rights Act. It is a bill that honors the struggle and  sacrifices of the civil rights activists who came before us, so that  all Oregonians and all Americans will have our voices heard.
