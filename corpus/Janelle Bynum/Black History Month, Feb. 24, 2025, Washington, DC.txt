Black History Month

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the first, but not the last,  Black Member of Congress in Oregon's history to celebrate Black History  Month in these hallowed Halls of Congress. Listening to Brother  Figures' speech has me a bit choked up. We are the next generation.

It is not lost on me that I am just one generation removed from  segregation. My mother graduated from Whittemore High School in Conway,  South Carolina, in the class of 1970, a segregated class, and graduated  valedictorian without a future. That wasn't that long ago.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a groundbreaker because of what that  means not just for my children but for young people all across my  State, for them to see that change is possible, and when something big  has never been done before, it just might be because they haven't  accomplished it yet.

As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, I am reminded that I  am not in this fight alone. They were always there with me, 3,000 miles  away, never leaving me alone. We are a community of leaders, Mr.  Speaker, united in our goal to shape a more equitable, prosperous, and  just society.

Mr. Speaker, this Black History Month, we recommit ourselves to  continuing to make progress together. We are here not just for our  children but for our children's children.

Mr. Speaker, happy Black History Month.
