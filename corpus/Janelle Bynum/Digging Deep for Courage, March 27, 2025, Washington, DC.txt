Digging Deep for Courage

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I am a woman of faith. I know I am joined in  this Chamber by fellow believers of all kinds. Today, I am reminded of  Ezekiel 34:3, a story about the selfishness and greed of shepherds who  used their sheep for their own gain, while neglecting their primary  duty which was to care for the flock.

All of us were sent here to lead, to care for, and to protect our  people. I ask my colleagues: How do they justify making an agreement  with farmers and not paying them money? How do they justify snatching  the benefits from veterans who put their lives on the line for our  country? How do they justify the erasure of the underpaid and unpaid  laborers who helped build this country? How do they take from our  seniors on Social Security? They don't and they can't.

Believers know that, especially in times that require courage, God  always has their back. Don't just sit back and watch. Dig deep for some  courage and stand up for those who are in need the most.
