Delayed Wildfire Response Efforts

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, early last year, the Flat fire burned over  23,000 acres of land in central Oregon, destroying homes and forcing  thousands of people to evacuate.

Our historic fire crews were eventually able to contain the fire, but  they were unnecessarily delayed because someone was flying a drone in  the area, and it punctured a hole in the plane.

Our historic fire crews cannot afford this delay. It is not just  happening in Oregon. There has been an increase in drones interfering  with fire responses across the country. We know that a quick response  is critical to containing wildfire and saving homes and lives. That is  why I introduced the Wildfire Aerial Response Safety Act along with  Congressmen Neguse, Crane, and Ciscomani.

As Representatives from States with dangerous wildfire seasons, we  understand how important it is to address this issue and that it should  not be partisan. I am calling on the House to take up our bill to  prevent unnecessary delays to wildfire response efforts.
