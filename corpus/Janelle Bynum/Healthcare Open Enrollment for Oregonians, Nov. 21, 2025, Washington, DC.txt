Healthcare Open Enrollment for Oregonians


Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, the beginning of this month marked the start  of open enrollment for healthcare. As Oregonians have started to select  their plans, constituents of mine have been writing in. They are seeing  plans that are hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars more.

Without subsidies, David from Bend's monthly health insurance costs  will go from $50 to $600 or $700 a month, which would put healthcare  out of reach for him. Annie, also from Bend, shared with me her costs  could jump to almost $1,700 per month.

There are countless more stories like these, Mr. Speaker, and that is  unacceptable. No family should have to choose between getting the care  they need and putting food on the table.

Mr. Speaker, I will keep fighting to protect healthcare, lower costs,  and make life easier for my constituents.
