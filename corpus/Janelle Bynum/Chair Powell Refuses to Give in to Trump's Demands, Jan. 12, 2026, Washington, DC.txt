Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I am here today because this administration  is playing games with costs, retirement accounts, and the entire  financial system. He is attacking the Federal Reserve, which keeps our  economy stable by threatening criminal investigations into Jerome  Powell, the Fed's chair. He is doing it because Chair Powell refuses to  give in to Trump's demands.

Mr. Speaker, the independence of the Fed makes it so politicians  can't use it like a weapon. If the President can bully or threaten the  Fed Chair, interest rates become a political tool, inflation becomes a  campaign strategy; and your mortgage, your job, and your savings become  collateral damage.

Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, this attempt to intimidate the Fed  isn't about justice or the American people. It is about the President's  ego, in my opinion.

I can't, and won't, stand by and let that happen. I will continue  fighting to make sure that the Fed works for Oregonians and for  Americans.
