Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, my constituents are struggling with high  costs and inflation, and more and more families are living paycheck to  paycheck, and still the supporters of this bill are trying to increase  their fees? I can't and I won't get behind that. It is out of touch.

Not only is that hurting our families, but it is also unfairly  penalizing our kids, who are trying to learn financial responsibility.

My son recently got a debit card. He is 14, and he uses it for small  stuff and things like buying PlayStation skins, Fortnite skins,  whatever kids buy. If he accidentally spends more than he has, $35, in  my opinion, is too high of a penalty. The average American kid would  have to work 5 hours at the Federal minimum wage to get that back. I  think that is crazy.

Every American should have the opportunity to participate in our  economy and not be on their knees when they do. I strongly oppose this  resolution, and I support the rule to cap overdraft fees at $5.
