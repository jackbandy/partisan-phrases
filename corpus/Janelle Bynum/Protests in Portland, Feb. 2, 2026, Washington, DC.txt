Protests in Portland


Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, it is Black History Month, and I came to give  you hell all month.

This weekend, ICE agents tear-gassed kids. Let me repeat that. ICE  agents tear-gassed kids. Protestors from union families in Portland,  Oregon, came together to exercise their First Amendment rights. Among  the protestors were children, the elderly, even pets, and ICE saw that  as enough of a threat to fire rubber bullets, pepper balls, and clouds  of tear gas.

I have said it before, and I will say it again: What we are seeing is  not law enforcement. It is State-sponsored terror, and this has to stop  now.

Mr. Speaker, I am calling on this administration to get out of our  city, follow the law, and hold those responsible for this accountable.  Enough is enough.
