Snap Cuts


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692160/snap-cuts


Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the President's trash  bill is out here cutting funding for a program that supports low-income  kids and families, supports our seniors, and supports those without  housing. I rise today because those cuts will leave people in my  district hungry. I rise today because that is unacceptable.

I am talking about SNAP. SNAP provides children and families in my  district and across this country with the help they need to put food on  the table. It reduces food insecurity, and it boosts our local  economies. Our communities can't afford cuts to these benefits.

It is a vital lifeline for my constituents. Over 733,000 Oregonians  used SNAP benefits last year, and that is over one in six residents in  the State.

It is unconscionable to give $2 trillion in tax breaks to the ultra- wealthy by defunding this food assistance American families depend on.

Mr. Speaker, we can do better.
