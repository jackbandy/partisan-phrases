Standing Up for Social Security Recipients


Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand up for my constituents  who rely on Social Security and Medicare.

Nearly 1 million Oregonians collect Social Security, and almost 20  percent of the State's population receives Medicare. These critical  programs are under attack, and Americans are scared.

I spent the last 2 weeks talking with people in my district, and I  have heard their concerns. Seniors are facing unprecedented delays in  getting benefits they rely on, and it makes it hard for them to pay  their expenses. They don't know if this administration is going to pull  the rug out from underneath them and leave them without the benefits  they have earned.

These benefits are not a Ponzi scheme. These benefits are not  government handouts. They are earned benefits for American citizens.

Mr. Speaker, it is time to stand up for Americans and protect these  programs with our lives and our votes.
