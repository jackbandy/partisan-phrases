It is Time to Lower Costs

Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask: When are prices going  down?

I was told that this would be priority number one for this  administration and Speaker   Mike Johnson, but I have yet to have a  chance to vote on a single piece of legislation that actually lowers  costs.

I am hearing from my constituents over and over and over and over and  over again that their grocery bills are too high, that they can't  afford to buy a home, and that their paycheck just doesn't go as far as  it used to.

We need to be doing more to help families get by instead of focusing  on petty partisan politics. I have said over and over again my focus is  lower costs, more jobs, and a better quality of life for Oregonians and  that I will work with anyone to get that done. I am pursuing all of  that by co-leading bipartisan legislation to help rural small  businesses, by advocating for funding for my district, and by actually  listening to my constituents. It is time for others to do the same.
