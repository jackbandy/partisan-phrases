Mr. RULLI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew of Constantinople to Washington, D.C. A true beacon of  peace, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew leads 250 million Orthodox  Christians.

Elected in October 1991, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has  continuously shown his desire for peace, even in the face of attacks  and persecution. He has championed international peace conferences,  bringing together Christians, Muslims, and Jews for the purpose of  alliance and understanding.

His efforts across multiple realms have been recognized by the United  States Congress, the United Nations, and the European Union. His  influence extends beyond the Orthodox Christian community and has been  instrumental in promoting global unity and harmony.

Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew continues to stand as a symbol of  hope. I am very pleased to welcome the Ecumenical Patriarch to  Washington, D.C. as he meets with President Trump.

Invite my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to  join me in welcoming Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington,  D.C.
