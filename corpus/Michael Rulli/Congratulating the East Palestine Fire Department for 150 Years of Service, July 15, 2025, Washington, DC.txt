Congratulating the East Palestine Fire Department for 150 Years of Service


Mr. RULLI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 150th  anniversary of the East Palestine Fire Department, a pillar of our  beloved Ohio community since 1875. It is a privilege to honor these  firefighters who have dedicated themselves to keeping our village safe.

For 150 years, these brave men and women have put their lives on the  line, responding to countless emergencies with unwavering courage.  Beyond their role as first responders, they connect with our community  daily and strengthen the bonds that make East Palestine a special place  in which to live.

I also want to recognize their heroism during the 2023 train  derailment. When disaster struck, with flames and toxic hazards  threatening our village, they stepped up with incredible bravery. Their  actions that night, and in the days that followed, will be remembered  for generations to come.

The East Palestine Fire Department stands as a symbol of hope and  resilience, meeting new challenges and staying true to their mission.  Their work embodies the spirit of East Palestine, and I am proud to  represent them.

I invite my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives  to join me in honoring the East Palestine Fire Department for  150 years of exemplary service and to wish them continued strength and  success for many years to come.
