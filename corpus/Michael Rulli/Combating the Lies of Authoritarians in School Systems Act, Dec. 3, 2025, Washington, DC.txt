Combating the Lies of Authoritarians in School Systems Act

Mr. RULLI. Mr. Speaker, especially after last weekend, I take a  second to thank the chairman for his comments.

Mr. Speaker, the CLASS Act prohibits K-12 schools from accepting  funds or contracting with the People's Republic of China or the CCP.  Let's just let that sink in for a second. My  honorable friend on the other side of the aisle is literally defending  the Chinese to invade our schools. That is what this is about.

It will also prohibit any person or entity acting on behalf of other  such governments or parties. It also requires K-12 schools to submit a  report to the Secretary of Education with the name and country of  origin, the amount of funds that are being put into our public schools,  and any terms of that contract.

The CCP is anti-American to its core. We stand for freedom of speech,  expression, and religion. They stand for none of our values. Confucius  classrooms are propaganda, and they are often set up near our military  bases, just to give it another layer.

There are CCP and Chinese affiliations in 143 schools throughout this  country. Honorable Speaker, I was shocked myself to realize that one of  them sits right outside our capital city of Columbus, Ohio. This is  unacceptable.

They could be coming to a school near you very soon. That is why I  urge a ``yes'' vote from all my colleagues, especially from the other  side of the aisle. We do not want them to be labeled as pro-Chinese,  but as pro-American.

This is not going to have a lot of cost that will be put onto a  school district. I was a school board member. This bill contains very,  very few requirements to actually log in and say where this money is  coming from.

I urge a ``yes'' vote today on H.R. 1005, otherwise known as the  CLASS Act.
