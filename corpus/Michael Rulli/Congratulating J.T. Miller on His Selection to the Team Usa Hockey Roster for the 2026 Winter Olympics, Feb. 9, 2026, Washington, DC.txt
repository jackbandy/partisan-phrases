Mr. RULLI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate J.T. Miller on  his selection to the Team USA hockey roster for the 2026 Winter  Olympics. From East Palestine, J.T. Miller showcases the grit and  toughness of a community that is built on pride.

J.T. has represented his country at multiple hockey events, including  the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. J.T. was drafted in 2011 by  the New York Rangers with the 15th overall selection. Following his  tenure with the Rangers, J.T. was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning.  After Tampa Bay, he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks, where he  scored over 150 goals in six seasons with the team, and his stellar  play earned him an alternate captainship. In 2024, J.T. was selected to  play in the NHL All-Star Game and went on to net 37 goals and record  over 100 points. Currently, J.T. is back in New York City, playing for  the Rangers, where he serves as the team's captain.

Having played in over 900 games, J.T. has scored more than 250 goals  and has assisted on more than 450 goals. J.T. has 17 overtime goals,  which rank eighth all time, showcasing his ability to perform in high- pressure situations. His coast-to-coast goal against the Arizona  Coyotes in February 2022 demonstrates his exceptional skating skills,  his ability to deke defenders, and his knack for burying the puck in  the back of the net. There is no doubt in my mind that J.T. will do  everything in his power to ensure that the United States men's hockey  team brings home gold at the Olympics in Milan.

I invite my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives  to join me in congratulating J.T. Miller on his selection to the Team  USA hockey roster for the 2026 Winter Olympics.
