Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  celebrate Bethel Temple Church in Hampton, Virginia, on the occasion of  its 70th anniversary. For seven decades, Bethel Temple has been a  steadfast pillar of faith, service, and fellowship in the Hampton  community.

In the early 1950s, Reverend Beverly W. Fox, then pastor of Phoebus  Assembly of God, led efforts to build a new house of worship. With the  support of the community, a modest sanctuary was completed and  dedicated as Bethel Assembly of God. In the summer of 1955, Reverend  Fox and thirty congregants held the church's first service, laying the  foundation for a ministry that would thrive for generations.

Under the leadership of pastors, including Reverends Howard S. Ryan,  G.P. Hertweck, Gerald Ogg, Sammy Hayes, and Arnold Brown, the church  grew in both membership and outreach. Expanding facilities,  establishing new ministries, and adopting the name Bethel Temple  Assembly of God reflected its evolving mission and growing  congregation.

In the decades that followed, Reverends Ron Johnson and Glenn  Reynolds deepened the church's community engagement through programs  such as the Great Turkey Giveaway, Christmas Toy Giveaway, and weekly  Community Dinner. These initiatives have benefitted countless families  across Hampton Roads.

Today, under the leadership of Senior Pastor Reverend Charles Ricks,  Jr., and Pastor Lori Ricks, Bethel Temple continues to embody faith in  action. Through partnerships with local organizations and tireless  service for the Hampton community during the COVID-19 pandemic, they  have strengthened the church's legacy of compassion and service.

Mr. Speaker, as they mark this milestone, I extend my sincere  gratitude to Bethel Temple Church for seventy years of faithful service  and enduring impact on the people of Hampton.
