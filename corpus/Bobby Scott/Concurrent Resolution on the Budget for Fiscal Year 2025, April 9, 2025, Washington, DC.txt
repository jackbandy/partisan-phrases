Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  resolution, yet again.

I hear speech after speech from the other side about the deficit and  debt, and here I see this resolution, which increases the deficit.

Let's start with some facts. Every single Democratic Presidential  administration since Kennedy has left for their Republican successor a  better deficit situation than they inherited, and every Republican  President since Nixon has left for the Democrats a worse deficit  situation than they inherited, all without exception.

Here we are again. A Republican President following a Democratic  President and, once again, a budget that would explode the deficit and  national debt, just like clockwork, with their tax cuts for  corporations and the top 1 percent.

Trump's first term added over $7 trillion to the national debt, and  he wants to double down and do it all over again.

As the ranking member of the Committee on Education and Workforce, I  am particularly outraged that Republicans want to partially fund these  tax cuts for corporations and billionaires by making cuts to education  programs and child nutrition programs. This resolution will direct them  to cut Medicaid, ripping healthcare away from millions of Americans.

There is nothing fiscally responsible about this budget. It will add  to the deficit, and the resolution wants to further inflict pain on  working families and the middle class.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution for the  damage it will do to the economy and to the deficit.
