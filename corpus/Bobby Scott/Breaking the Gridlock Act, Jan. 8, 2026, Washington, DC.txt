Breaking the Gridlock Act

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill to  extend the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits through a  clean, 3-year extension.

Last year, the Republicans blocked the extension of these credits in  the big, ugly bill. With the expiration of the tax credits last month,  the health premium costs have skyrocketed, causing millions to lose  their coverage.

When more people lose coverage, costs go up for everyone. Uninsured  patients often delay seeing a doctor and end up needing more costly  care at the emergency room. When there are more uninsured, hospitals,  especially in rural areas, face financial hardships and may be forced  to close. In other words, those unpaid bills do not disappear. They are  shifted onto everybody else, and everyone suffers.

Today, Congress can step in to address the sharp premium increases  and provide stability for working families across the country. I urge  my colleagues to support this bill and to support affordable  healthcare.
