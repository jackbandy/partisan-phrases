Black History Month and the Alliance Between the Black and Asian Community


Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in honoring  Black History Month and uplifting the connection between the Black and  Asian community.

As a Member of Congress who is part of both the Black and Asian  community and the Civil Rights Task Force chair of CAPAC, I want to  acknowledge the long history of solidarity between our two communities.  For example, American abolitionist Frederick Douglass spoke out against  the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1869 in his Our Composite Nation speech.  Our communities have shared struggles against systemic racism during  the civil rights movement.

In the 1960s, for example, Japanese-American civil rights activist,  Yuri Kochiyama, worked alongside Malcolm X during the civil rights  movement.

During Black History Month, we are reminded that the civil rights and  Asian-American movements have always gone hand in hand in seeking  justice against systemic racism.

As we celebrate our progress this Black History Month and fight back  against the Trump administration, we must remember that we cannot  abandon our commitment to achieving racial equity for all people.
