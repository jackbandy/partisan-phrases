Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, the Kennesaw State  University football team brought home the Conference USA title in just  their second year competing at the Football Bowl Subdivision level.

The Owls achieved this feat just 1 year after only a two-win season,  displaying a remarkable turnaround. Kennesaw State University has made  the 11th District and the State of Georgia immensely proud, and we are  excited to have the Conference USA Football Championship trophy in Cobb  County for the first time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the university leadership,  players, staff, and head coach Jerry Mack on an incredible season and a  hard-fought win. We wish them the best of luck in their upcoming bowl  game.
