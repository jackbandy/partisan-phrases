Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an incredible  individual who is a true pillar of the community, Mrs. Pam Younker, and  congratulate her on her retirement from Children's Healthcare of  Atlanta.

The daughter of a United States Marine, Pam is a longtime advocate  for our military, as well as our local community, and our children. Pam  has spent more than a decade with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta,  caring for families in their time of greatest need.

A rock of her community, Pam was recognized in 2018 with the Marietta  Citizen of the Year Award, and again in 2024 with the Len Gilbert Award  for her advocacy for Dobbins Air Reserve Base and Clay National Guard  Center.

Pam served as Chair of the Honorary Commanders Association, a Cobb  County Chamber of Commerce program connecting community leaders with  military commanders. She remains committed to our nation's military,  serving on the Military Appreciation Luncheon Committee, chairing Armed  Forces Day for Leadership Cobb, co-chairing the Team Dobbins Committee,  and is a Civic Leader for Air Force Reserve Command.

Pam regularly organizes deployment send-offs, welcome-home events,  and Veterans Day parades, among other events, and has been crucial in  preventing the historic Dobbins Chapel's demolition, securing its  relocation to the Clay National Guard Center.

It is my honor to have worked closely with Pam Younker through the  years, and an even greater privilege to call her a friend. I  congratulate Pam on her well-deserved retirement and know she will  continue serving her Cobb County community in the years to come.
