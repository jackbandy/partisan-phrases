Removal of the Use of United States Forces for Hostilities Within or Against Venezuela

Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I am in strong opposition to this  resolution because the issue before us is not one of Presidential  authority. It is whether Congress should undermine the President's  ability to deter threats and protect the United States' interests in  our own hemisphere.

History shows that time after time, Mr. Speaker, if you signal  weakness, it emboldens your adversaries. A resolution that publicly  constrains the Commander in Chief does not promote peace. What it does  is it telegraphs weakness to a hostile regime like Venezuela and  encourages them to test U.S. resolve.

This is not a distant theater. This is our hemisphere. Supporting the  President's authority is not a blank check for war. It is a  recommendation that timely, flexible military posturing is what  prevents war, and in this case protects Americans against the most  lethal attack ever on the American people and the population where we  have lost over 250 people per day for the last 3 years.

This is not the time to act in opposition to the Commander in Chief  and to oppose him from the most important obligation he has: protect  the American public. That is why I oppose this.
