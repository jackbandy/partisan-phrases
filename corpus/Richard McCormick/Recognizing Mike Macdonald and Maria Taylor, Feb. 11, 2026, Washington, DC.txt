Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the Seattle  Seahawks Head Coach Mike Macdonald and NBC sportscaster Maria Taylor.

On Sunday, these two graduates from Centennial High School in  Roswell, Georgia, which just happens to be in my district, became Super  Bowl stars. Mike and Maria also attended the University of Georgia  together where they began their respective careers as a football coach  and a sports broadcaster.

On Sunday, Mike coached his team to a convincing 29-13 victory, and  Maria made history as the first Black woman to ever host the Super Bowl  postgame ceremony. These achievements are a testament to their hard  work, character, and outstanding education they received at Centennial.

Congratulations to Mike and Maria, and I thank them for making  Roswell proud. Go Knights and go Dawgs.
