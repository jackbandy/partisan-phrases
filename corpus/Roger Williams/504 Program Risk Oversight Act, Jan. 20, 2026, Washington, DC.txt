Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5788) to amend title V of the Small Business  Investment Act of 1958 to require an annual portfolio risk analysis of  loans guaranteed under such title, and for other purposes.

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5788, the 504  Program Risk Oversight Act introduced by Representatives Tran and  Patronis.

This bipartisan piece of legislation would give Congress greater  accountability and oversight of the SBA's 504 Loan Program by requiring  the SBA to provide Congress and the public with annual, data-driven  risk assessments of the 504 loan portfolio.

The 504 program is an incredibly important tool that helps small  businesses obtain long-term, fixed-rate financing like the acquisition  of fixed assets such as land, buildings, and heavy machinery.

In fiscal year 2025, the program supported $7.8 billion in loans to  small businesses nationwide. Specifically, H.R. 5788 would require the  SBA to provide Congress with annual reports on the health of the 504  loan portfolio.

This would include an analysis of any risk to the program broken down  by multiple data points, including industry concentration, loan age,  and gross dollar amount.

These reports would be made available to the public within 7 days of  being provided to Congress. The transparency measures in this bill are  particularly important in light of the House passage of my bill, H.R.  3174, the Made in America Manufacturing Finance Act, which raised the  loan limit for American manufacturers under the SBA's 7(a) and 504 loan  programs to $10 million. I hope it will quickly move through the Senate  and to President Trump's desk.

Madam Speaker, H.R. 5788 marks a critical step toward identifying and  mitigating risks early, strengthening the long-term viability and  affordability of the 504 loan program and ensuring continued support  for American entrepreneurs.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R.

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Patronis).

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and  I am prepared to close.

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, H.R. 5788 provides transparency  to the SBA's 504 loan program, a key program that promotes job creation  and small business growth.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
