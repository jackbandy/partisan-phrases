Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Stephenville High School, which I am honored to represent in the United  States Congress.

On February 9, the National Football Foundation named Stephenville  High School the national winner of the Hatchell Cup award. This is the  highest academic team honor in high school football, and the Yellow  Jackets were awarded this distinction with an outstanding 4.0 team GPA.

Our community is proud to see Stephenville High School complete the  football season undefeated and bring home another State title. The  young men and coaches on this team have spent countless hours preparing  both on and off the field. The Hatchell Cup recognition is a testament  to their hard work and success.

I congratulate the players, Head Coach Sterling Doty, and the  Stephenville community. Go Yellow Jackets.

In God we trust.
