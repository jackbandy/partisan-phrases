Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 3174, the Made  in America Manufacturing Finance Act.

The ability to manufacture in the United States is vital to our  country's economic and national security. However, for decades,  America's policies have shipped good-paying manufacturing jobs overseas  and opened the door for foreign adversaries to fill the void. We must  reverse this trend which would require more than just luck.

That is why the Trump administration has been championing progrowth  and pro-American policies that are fueling a domestic manufacturing  comeback. Now, Congress can do its job to reverse the trend and support  the revitalization of American manufacturing.

Small American manufacturers account for 98 percent of U.S.  manufacturing companies. Like all small businesses, access to capital,  or the appropriate amount of capital, is challenging. H.R. 3174 gives  small American manufacturers access to capital at a level they need to  start or grow their operations.

This legislation increases the loan limit for small American  manufacturers under the SBA's 7(a) and 504 lending programs from $5  million to $10 million.

This will provide American manufacturing the capital they need to  invest in new technology, hire, grow, and create onshore jobs that we  have carelessly lost overseas.

H.R. 3174 is essential to keep pace with demand for capital and bring  jobs back to the U.S. Two weeks ago, the Committee on Small Business  heard testimony from the industry and other manufacturing stakeholders  about the importance of this bill for small manufacturers across the  country looking to grow and reshore their businesses.

It is often the case that when Congress passes a bill to support an  industry, it will come at a cost to taxpayers. This is not the case  with H.R. 3174 because the SBA's 7(a) and 504 loan programs operate  under zero subsidy, meaning zero cost to the taxpayer. The  Congressional Budget Office's review found that any costs would be  insignificant in this area.

H.R. 3174 presents Congress with the critical opportunity to usher in  the golden age of American manufacturing.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3174, to support  made in America, small businesses, and the revitalization of the  American manufacturing base.

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 3174 that supports American manufacturing, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this commonsense legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
