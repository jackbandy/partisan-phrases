Sba Fraud Enforcement Extension Act


Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4495) to extend the statute of limitations for  fraud under certain pandemic programs, and for other purposes.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4495

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``SBA Fraud Enforcement       Extension Act''.       SEC. 2. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS.

(a) Shuttered Venue Operators.--Section 324 of division N       of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (15 U.S.C.       9009a) is amended by adding at the end the following:

``(g) Statute of Limitations.--Notwithstanding any other       provision of law, any criminal prosecution or civil       enforcement action for a violation of, or conspiracy to       violate, section 371, 641, 1001, 1028A, 1029, 1341, 1343,       1349, 1956, or 1957 of title 18, United States Code, or       section 3729 or 3802 of title 31, United States Code, with       respect to any grant for shuttered venue operators under this       section shall be filed not later than 10 years after the date       of the violation or conspiracy.''.

(b) Restaurant Revitalization.--Section 5003 of the       American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (15 U.S.C. 9009c) is amended       by adding at the end the following:

``(d) Statute of Limitations.--Notwithstanding any other       provision of law, any criminal prosecution or civil       enforcement action for a violation of, or conspiracy to       violate, section 371, 641, 1001, 1028A, 1029, 1341, 1343,       1349, 1956, or 1957 of title 18, United States Code, or       section 3729 or 3802 of title 31, United States Code, with       respect to any restaurant revitalization grant under this       section shall be filed not later than 10 years after the date       of the violation or conspiracy.''.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4495, the SBA Fraud  Enforcement Extension Act, a companion piece of legislation to S. 1199,  introduced by Senator Ernst.

H.R. 4495 is bipartisan legislation introduced by the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Downing) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Conaway).

For 4 years, the Biden administration's SBA failed to address over  $200 billion in COVID-19 era fraud. H.R. 4495 extends the soon-to- expire statute of limitations for two pandemic-era relief programs: The  Shuttered Venue Operators Grant and the Restaurant Revitalization Fund.  The statute of limitations for these programs is set to expire this  December.

These two programs combined provided over $44 billion in grants and  funding for small businesses during the pandemic. Unfortunately,  fraudsters stole COVID relief funds from small businesses across the  country. These fraudsters hope that the statute of limitations for  their crimes will pass, allowing them to skirt justice.

As Congress, we cannot let this happen. American taxpayer dollars  should be protected at all costs.

In the 117th Congress, we took similar action to extend the statute  of limitations under the Paycheck Protection Program and the COVID EIDL  program. Today, we have the chance to close this final loophole so that  fraudsters do not get away with defrauding American taxpayers and  entrepreneurs.

This legislation sends a clear message that the era of taking  advantage of the American taxpayer is simply over.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4495, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this commonsense legislation. We cannot let fraudsters get away with  American taxpayer dollars.
