Congratulating Aledo Bearcats


Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Aledo Bearcats on their decisive 8-1 victory in the 2025 UIL 5A  Division I State baseball championship.

The Bearcats concluded a historic season with their second State  title, securing the win for the first time in 11 years. This team began  the season with a unified goal and put in the work to bring their  vision to life. After a hard-fought season of long practices and  staying focused in school, these athletes, trainers, managers, and  coaches showed dedication, strength, and an unwavering commitment to  victory.

I am proud that their hard work has paid off. As these talented  students prepare for their next endeavors, I wish them the best of luck  and blessings for an even brighter and more victorious future.

Go Bearcats.

In God We Trust.                  RECOGNIZING GORDON LONGHORNS BASEBALL TEAM

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Gordon Longhorns baseball team on a hard-fought season.

This year, the Longhorns made school history with their first-ever  appearance in the UIL Class 1A State championship game. Their road to  the championship was made even more remarkable by the challenges they  overcame this season.

On May 18, 2025, a tornado struck Gordon, leaving the school's  athletic facilities, baseball field, and other resources unusable  during the most crucial part of their season. The community rallied  around these young men as the team practiced at neighboring schools to  continue their playoff preparations.

The Longhorns are a testament to determination, teamwork, and the  strength of a small Texas town recovering from a natural disaster.

As these students prepare for their next endeavors, I wish them the  best of luck and blessings for a brighter future.

Go Longhorns.

In God We Trust.            COMMENDING BURLESON'S VICTIM ASSISTANCE POSTER PROJECT

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  City of Burleson Police Department for their remarkable work supporting  victims of domestic violence.

The lifesaving Burleson victim assistance poster project began with  one powerful phrase: If I had known someone like you existed, I would  have gotten help sooner.

Far too many women live in silence, unsure of where to turn,  especially while still under the control or surveillance of an abuser.  There is a critical gap, not in services, but in awareness and safe  access to those services.

Recognizing this urgent need, the leaders of Burleson, Texas, came  together to create a simple yet profoundly effective solution: posters.  These discreet posters are strategically placed in safe, private, and  secure locations where a victim can view them without fear. Each one  includes a QR code that links directly to support resources, as well as  a hotline for those without internet access. In under 30 seconds, a  victim can quickly connect to confidential help, shelter options, and  emergency services.

With the support from the Burleson Police Officers Association and  dedicated community stakeholders, this initiative has expanded,  reaching neighboring cities, rural areas, and locations across this  great country.

I thank the City of Burleson Police Department. Their leadership and  innovation have created a vital lifeline, bringing safety and hope to  victims of domestic abuse.

In God We Trust.                     RECOGNIZING COMANCHE CHIEF NEWSPAPER

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  celebrate a remarkable milestone for The Comanche Chief newspaper  located in my district.

For over 150 years, The Comanche Chief paper has provided trustworthy  news, thoughtful commentary, entertainment, and vital resources for the  people of Comanche County. It has served as a reliable voice for our  community and a living record of our shared history.

James Claude Wilkerson first bought the newspaper in June 1925,  beginning a proud family tradition of civic service through journalism.  This year, the Wilkerson family is celebrating an extraordinary  milestone of 100 years in print.

Today, James Bradley Wilkerson is a fourth-generation owner, carrying  on his family's legacy by serving as the paper's publisher, ensuring  that The Comanche Chief continues to inform, engage, and uplift its  readers.

As the oldest continuous business institution in Comanche County, The  Comanche Chief is more than just a newspaper. It is a pillar of our  community for past and future generations.

I commend the Wilkerson family for their century of stewardship, and  I thank them for their continued commitment to delivering trustworthy  news to the people of Texas.

In God We Trust.
