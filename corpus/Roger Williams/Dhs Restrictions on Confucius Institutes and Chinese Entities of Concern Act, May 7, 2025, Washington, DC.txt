Dhs Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act


Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, due to a personal family matter,  I was unable to vote on H.R. 881--the DHS Restrictions on Confucius  Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act. Had I been present, I  would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 120.
