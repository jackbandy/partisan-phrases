Combating the Lies of Authoritarians in School Systems Act


Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, due to an official engagement, I  was unable to vote on H.R. 2965, H.R. 4305, and H.R. 1005. Had I been  present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 310, YEA on Roll Call  No. 311, and YEA on Roll Call No. 312.
