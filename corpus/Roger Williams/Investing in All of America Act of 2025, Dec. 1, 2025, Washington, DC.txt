Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2066, the Investing in  All of America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Meuser from  the great State of Pennsylvania and Representative Scholten from the  great State of Michigan.

One of the most significant barriers to economic growth across  America is the lack of access to capital for small businesses,  including investment opportunities. While some regions and industries  are flush with investment, too many small businesses struggle to  attract investment capital that they would need to help them to grow.

The Investing in All of America Act strengthens one of the most  effective public-private partnerships the SBA has to offer: the Small  Business Investment Company, or SBIC, program. This program has a  proven track record of turning promising small businesses into  household names, all without spending any taxpayer dollars.

By unleashing nearly $20 billion in private capital, this bipartisan  bill would expand opportunities for small manufacturers, rural  communities, and businesses critical to our national security. It means  more jobs, greater innovation, and a stronger economy.

This commonsense solution rewards hard work and fuels private  investment into small businesses across America without new spending or  more red tape.

I ask my colleagues to support this bill for Main Street America,  driving capital back into the hands of small business owners where it  belongs.

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this commonsense legislation to increase access to capital for  America's small businesses. I yield back the balance of my time.
