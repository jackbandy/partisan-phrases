Cortez Masto Honors Asian Pacific American Heritage Month


U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) released the following statement celebrating Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, which begins May 1st:

"Asian Pacific American Heritage Month is a time for us all to recognize and celebrate the many ways Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and immigrants, have enriched Nevada and our country. From the historic contributions of Asian and Pacific Islander immigrant workers constructing the transcontinental railroad over a century ago, to the thriving community of small business owners, teachers, community leaders and health care professionals who are our friends and neighbors today, the AAPI community is a bedrock of cultural diversity and innovation for the Silver State. As we mark Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, I celebrate the deep roots and innumerable contributions the AAPI community is making in helping Nevadans on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic and I'll continue to fight to ensure that our AAPI communities are protected from discrimination and have access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive."
