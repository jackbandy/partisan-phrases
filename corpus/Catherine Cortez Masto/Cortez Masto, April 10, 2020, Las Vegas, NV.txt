Cortez Masto, Rosen Cosponsor Bill to Protect Immigrants During Covid-19 Pandemic


U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) joined U.S. Senators Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) to cosponsor the Coronavirus Immigrant Families Protection Act to ensure that all communities have access to urgently needed COVID-19 testing, public health information, and relief benefits regardless of immigration status or limited English proficiency.

"We're in the middle of a public health crisis, and protecting Nevadans from the spread of COVID-19 means protecting everyone in our state," said the Senators. "Nevada is a beautifully diverse state, with families who have members from every corner of the globe, and we need to make sure those families can get critical support. We're proud to cosponsor this legislation that will ensure everyone in Nevada has access to the testing, treatment, and information that will keep them, their families, and our communities as safe and healthy as possible."
