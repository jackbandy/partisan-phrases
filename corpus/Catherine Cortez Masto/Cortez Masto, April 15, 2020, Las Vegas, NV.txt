Cortez Masto, Rosen Welcome Social Security Administration Announcement for Ssi Recipients, More Must Be Done


U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) released a statement today after the Social Security Administration announced it will allow Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients without dependents to receive automatic Economic Impact Payments directly from the Treasury Department. Treasury anticipates these automatic payments no later than early May. This new guidance has been issued in the wake of their call -- along with their Senate colleagues -- for the administration to issue stimulus checks automatically to recipients of benefits through the Supplemental Security Income program.

"Today's news is a welcome relief to the many Nevadans waiting for help to arrive," said the Senators. "However, there is far more that needs to be done by this Administration to provide a hand up to hardworking families in the Silver State that are Staying Home for Nevada. We'll continue to fight in the Senate to ensure that Nevadans are able to quickly receive their economic impact payments, work so families are able to access critical pandemic unemployment supports and keep a roof over their heads, and demand that all of our businesses in Nevada are able to access the resources they need to protect workers and reopen."

BACKGROUND:

SSI recipients who have qualifying children under age 17 should not wait for their automatic $1,200 individual payment. They should now go to the IRS's webpage at www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here and visit the Non-Filers: Enter Your Payment Info section to provide their information.
