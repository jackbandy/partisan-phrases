Cortez Masto: Today's Supreme Court Hearing Marks a Critical Moment for Reproductive Rights


U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) released the following statement as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in June Medical Services v. Russo:

"In Nevada, with the only majority-women legislature in the nation, we're working hard to remove burdens on women's reproductive rights. But that's not true everywhere in America. The Supreme Court today is considering whether Louisiana can require doctors in the state who terminate pregnancies to have specific agreements with local hospitals--an unnecessary hurdle for these physicians to meet in order to provide important women's health services. Let's be clear: the Court already heard a virtually identical case just four years ago. It already decided that these kinds of laws are unconstitutional, because they are medically unnecessary and serve only to put a heavy burden on a woman's right to choose. The only thing that has changed since 2016 is the occupants of the bench. I hope that the current justices follow precedent and respect the principles established by Roe v. Wade. "
