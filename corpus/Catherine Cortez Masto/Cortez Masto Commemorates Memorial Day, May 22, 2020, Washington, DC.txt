Cortez Masto Commemorates Memorial Day


U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) released the following statement honoring Memorial Day, which is observed on Monday, May 25th.

"Members of our Armed Forces selflessly serve our nation both abroad and at home, and today we pay our respects to those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country and reflect on the significance of their service. As our nation navigates unprecedented times, the heroism of our brave men and women in uniform and the sacrifice of our Gold Star families inspires all of us to better honor America's values and serve those in need. On Memorial Day, I offer my sincerest condolences to all those missing loved ones and pledge to continue to do all I can to support our veterans, service members and their families."
