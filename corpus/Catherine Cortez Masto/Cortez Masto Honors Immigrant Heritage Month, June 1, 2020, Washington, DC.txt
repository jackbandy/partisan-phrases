Cortez Masto Honors Immigrant Heritage Month


U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) recognized Immigrant Heritage Month, which is observed in June.

"Nevada is home to immigrants from all over the globe, and this beautiful diversity is one of our state's strengths. During this Immigrant Heritage Month, I'm proud to celebrate the many American families--like my own--with immigrant histories. In the face of attempts to divide Americans from one another based on their heritage, we must work even harder to demonstrate by our actions that prejudice has no place in our communities, and that immigrants to our nation help build the American Dream for all."
