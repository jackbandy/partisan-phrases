Cortez Masto Statement on Senate Iran Briefing


U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) issued the following statement after national security officials from the Trump Administration briefed senators on the unfolding situation with Iran.

"Administration officials abruptly ended today's classified briefing to Congress about Iran, leaving many questions unanswered -- including critical questions about President Trump's long-term strategy and objectives for Iran, how he plans to deter Iran from future attacks, and what actions he'll take to keep U.S. service members and personnel in the region safe. With America's national security on the line, Congress and the American people need answers. I expect officials to return to give Senators a full account of their plans."
