Cortez Masto Honors Lgbtq Pride Month


U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) released the following statement in recognition of LGBTQ Pride Month:

"Born out of the Stonewall riots of 1969, Pride Month offers us a unique and important opportunity to honor the courage of all those fighting to end discrimination. While our country has made great strides towards equality over the past 50 years, from legalizing same-sex marriage to repealing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell', homophobia, transphobia and bigotry still threaten far too many LGBTQ Americans. Nevada is stronger because of our LGBTQ communities and we must recommit ourselves to fighting to protect their rights in the workplace, to serve our country in the military and to love who they love without fear."

Pride Month is a reminder of the power of mobilization and that we still have so much work to do to ensure all Americans receive the respect and justice they deserve. I'll continue to fight for the inclusive, thoughtful and concrete structural changes that true progress requires."
