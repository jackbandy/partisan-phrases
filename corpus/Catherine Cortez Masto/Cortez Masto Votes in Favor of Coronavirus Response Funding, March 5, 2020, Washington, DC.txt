Cortez Masto Votes in Favor of Coronavirus Response Funding


U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) issued the following statement after voting in favor of an $8.3 billion funding package to combat coronavirus.

"America must act quickly to address the spread of coronavirus and protect those most vulnerable to the disease. I'm pleased that Congress was able to pass this emergency response package with bipartisan support and far above the funding levels requested by the Trump Administration. This package ensures all Americans' access to treatment and vaccines, supports state and local government efforts to keep communities safe, and protects small businesses from the economic impact of this outbreak. As Nevada health authorities respond to the state's first presumptive case of coronavirus, I'll continue exercising strong oversight over this Administration's response and fighting to prioritize public health funding in the Senate."
