Cortez Masto Unveils 2019 Annual Report, Touts Year's Accomplishments for Nevada Families


U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) today released her 2019 Annual Report, which highlights some of the senator's work on behalf of Nevadans over the past year. In 2019, Senator Cortez Masto helped secure over $300 million in grant funding, introduced 61 bills and amendments on issues that affect Nevada families, and helped hundreds of Nevadans with cases pending with federal agencies. In addition, the senator has helped draft and pass numerous policy priorities into law, including legislation to improve privatized military housing, strengthen mental health resources for law enforcement, expand public lands protections and economic development opportunities in rural counties, and repeal the Cadillac tax that punished high benefit, employer-provided health care plans for hardworking families.

"I'm incredibly privileged to serve Nevadans and fight for their priorities in the United States Senate. Last year, I worked on issues from housing to health care, to creating good-paying jobs and investing in renewable energy and economic development projects. Together, we've made incredible progress supporting Nevada's military families, developing solutions to address our state's affordable housing crisis, and fighting to protect preexisting conditions protections and health care for every Nevadan. I'll continue to fight in the Senate for commonsense, bipartisan solutions that put Nevadans and their families first."

Senator Cortez Masto's 2019 Annual Report is available online and available upon request in her D.C., Las Vegas, and Reno offices.
