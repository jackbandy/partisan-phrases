Sasse Statement on FBI Case Against Harvard Professor Working for China


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a China hawk, issued the following statement regarding the FBI's case against Charles Lieber, the chair of Harvard's department of chemistry and chemical biology who failed to disclose his work with the Chinese Communist Party's Thousand Talents Program. 

"Beijing's money always has strings attached. The Chinese Communist Party is working hard to make itself the world's preeminent super power, and the Thousand Talents Program is designed to give China an economic and military edge by contracting with scientists in the free world and stealing their research. The FBI is doing vital work, and it's important that Americans steer clear of helping human rights abusers in the Chinese Communist Party."
