Sasse Praises Cutting Bureaucratic Red Tape


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, issued the following statement after the Trump Administration announced an executive order aiming to make hundreds of coronavirus deregulations permanent. 

"Our federal government has been allowed to swell too much and reach too far into the lives of everyday folks. With the cutting of bureaucratic red tape, hospitals and businesses alike have been able to work efficiently, innovate, and save lives. After all the hard work these folks have done during this pandemic, we cannot put strangling regulations back on them.
