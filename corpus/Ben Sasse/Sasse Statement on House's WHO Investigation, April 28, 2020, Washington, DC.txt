Sasse Statement on House's WHO Investigation


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement regarding House Democrats' probe into the President's decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization pending an investigation into its handling of coronavirus. 

"This blind partisan rage is stupid and unproductive. The World Health Organization parroted the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda during the middle of a deadly pandemic. Republicans and Democrats should be able to jointly condemn communist lies, and to demand real science from an organization that depends on our tax dollars. The legitimate investigatory topic for people who are interested in the long-term health of Americans -- and the long-term global leadership of the United States -- is into the WHO and its systematic lying. That is a very different investigation than the one the House is talking about here."
