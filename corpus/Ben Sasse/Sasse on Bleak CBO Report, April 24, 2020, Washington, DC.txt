Sasse on Bleak CBO Report


Today, U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement after the Congressional Budget Office forecasted a nearly $4 trillion budget deficit this year. 

"It's one thing to run a deficit during a pandemic, but Washington's long-term debt habit is suicidal. For decades, Republicans and Democrats spent money we don't have at a rate our kids can't afford. Republicans and Democrats maxed out the credit cards during good times and now, when we're in the middle of the coronavirus' health and economic crises, we're facing a bleak future. None of this is sustainable. If politicians continue to ignore the problem, this debt will crush our kids."
