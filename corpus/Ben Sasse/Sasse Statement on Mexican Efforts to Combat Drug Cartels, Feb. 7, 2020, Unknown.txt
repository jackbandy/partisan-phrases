Sasse Statement on Mexican Efforts to Combat Drug Cartels


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement after the Wall Street Journal reported that Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has deployed Mexico's marines in the fight against drug cartels. 

"Good. The 'hugs, not bullets' strategy was naive and dangerous. President Lopez Obrador was never going to win a tickle fight with narcoterrorists who were murdering Americans along the border. We need a smart, full-scale offensive against these cartels and this would be a long-overdue shift in Mexican security policy."
