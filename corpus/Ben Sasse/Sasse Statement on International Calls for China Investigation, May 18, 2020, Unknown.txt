Sasse Statement on International Calls for China Investigation


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement regarding the fact that 100 countries are now calling for an independent investigation, aimed at China, into the handling of the coronavirus outbreak. 

"Innocent people are dead and millions are out of work because the Chinese Communist Party lied about this virus. No communist propaganda campaign is going to change that. The whole world knows that Chairman Xi hasn't been truthful, and the sick people and the sick economies of the world deserve the full account."
