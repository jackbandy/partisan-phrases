Sasse Calls on Senate to Cancel Recess


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement regarding the need for the Senate to stay in session.

"Nursing home operators in Nebraska are telling me they're worried because they have patients who might have coronavirus, but they don't have enough testing kits to find out. Instead of going into recess next week, the Senate ought to keep working on the people's business -- both addressing the obvious deficiencies in our diagnostic testing pipeline, and debating the President's call last night for economic legislation. The Senate has work to do, let's get to it."
