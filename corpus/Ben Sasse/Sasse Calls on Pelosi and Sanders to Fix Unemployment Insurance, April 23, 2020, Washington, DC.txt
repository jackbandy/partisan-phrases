Sasse Calls on Pelosi and Sanders to Fix Unemployment Insurance


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement:

"Last month, Congress didn't fix a crummy formula for emergency benefits, and now bad policy is hurting America's workers. It's hard for small businesses to serve their communities when Washington pits them against a system that pays more for unemployment than work. Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham, Rick Scott, and I warned about this in March, but Speaker Pelosi and Senator Sanders decided to ignore reality. They said that this wouldn't happen. They were wrong. They ought to admit it, apologize to the small businesses they hurt, and join us in fixing this."

Background: 

Last Month, Senators Sasse (NE), Scott (SC), Graham (SC), and Scott (FL) introduced a pro-worker, pro-recovery amendment that would have fixed the coronavirus emergency relief law'sperverse incentive to increase unemployment by capping unemployment benefits at full pay.
