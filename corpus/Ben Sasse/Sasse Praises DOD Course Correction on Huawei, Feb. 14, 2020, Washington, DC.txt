Sasse Praises DOD Course Correction on Huawei


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who led opposition against the Department of Defense's soft-stance on Huawei, issued the following statement regarding reports that the Department of Defense has dropped its objections to Commerce Department regulations that make it difficult for U.S. companies to sell to Huawei. 

"The Administration is right to go after Huawei, and I hope the Department of Defense continues to take this threat seriously. Huawei is a weapon of the Chinese Communist Party and it's aimed squarely at the free world. Chairman Xi wants China to displace the United States as the world's dominant superpower and he's using commie discounts to weasel Huawei into critical systems. We've got to nail Huawei to the wall before it's too late."

Background: 

On January 24, 2020, Sasse led members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in writing to the Secretary of Defense, demanding answers regarding reports that the Department of Defense objected to Commerce Department regulations that would have made it more difficult for U.S. companies to sell to Huawei.
