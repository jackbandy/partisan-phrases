Sasse Statement on Huawei


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, an outspoken China hawk, issued the following statement regarding Huawei, after the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. officials have said that Huawei can covertly access mobile-phone networks. 

"The freedom-loving world can't sit back and let surveillance state communists infect our infrastructure. Trusted tech comes from trusted suppliers, and Huawei is the Chinese Communist Party's puppet. Our current and future allies need to think very carefully before they get into bed with the CCP."
