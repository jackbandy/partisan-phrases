Sasse Slams Pelosi's Wish List


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, issued the following statement regarding Speaker Pelosi's mega $3 trillion coronavirus spending bill, which would extend perverse unemployment incentives into next year.

"Tens of thousands of Americans are dead, millions of Americans are out of work, and Speaker Pelosi is writing another wish list to Liberal Santa. Give me a break. These progressive shopping lists might be good political documents, but they don't solve problems and they're going to make our long-term unemployment problem worse by having unemployment pay more than employment. We need real, long-term solutions. The Senate ought to ignore Speaker Pelosi's pie-in-the-sky nonsense and work on real legislation, starting with practical unemployment benefits and common-sense liability shields."
