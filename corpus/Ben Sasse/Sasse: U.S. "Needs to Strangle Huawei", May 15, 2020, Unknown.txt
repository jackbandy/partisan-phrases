Sasse: U.S. "Needs to Strangle Huawei"


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and an outspoken China hawk who has repeatedly called on the Commerce Department to disrupt Huawei's supply chain, issued the following statement regarding the administration's new effort to prevent the Chinese Communist Party's tech puppet from obtaining U.S. semiconductor technology.

"The United States needs to strangle Huawei. Modern wars are fought with semiconductors, and we were letting Huawei use our American designs. This is pretty simple: chip companies that depend on American technology can't jump into bed with the Chinese Communist Party. This rule is long overdue."
