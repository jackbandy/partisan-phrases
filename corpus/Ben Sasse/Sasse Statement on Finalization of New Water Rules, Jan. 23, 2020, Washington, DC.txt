Sasse Statement on Finalization of New Water Rules


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, an outspoken advocate for Nebraska agriculture, issued the following statement after the finalization of a new water rule.

"Nebraska farmers and ranchers are winning with the finalization of new water rules. Bureaucrats have no place regulating puddles in Nebraska, and the Obama administration was wrong for trying this nonsense. No one cares more about land and water resources than our farmers and ranchers. Nebraskans feed the world and are on the leading edge of conservation. I am glad to hear that the new water rules are finalized."
