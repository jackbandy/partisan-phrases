Sasse Statement on China Expelling Journalists


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement after the Chinese Communist Party announced that it would expel American journalists at The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post.

"Chairman Xi is terrified of a free and independent press because he doesn't want to be challenged when his government regularly spews insane propaganda -- like the recent conspiracy theory that the United States created the coronavirus. These thin-skinned communist hacks hate the truth and are committed to covering-up their failures. The Chinese Communist Party only cares about establishing Xi Jinping's voice as the one source of "objective news' in and out of China -- that's why "journalists' from state-run outlets are employees of the Chinese Communist Party. Chairman Xi can expel all the real journalists he wants, but he can't change the fact that his coronavirus cover-up killed thousands of his own people and put the world at risk."
