Sasse Introduces Health Care Provider Liability Shield


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care, introduced an amendment to coronavirus emergency relief legislation that would temporarily shield licensed health care providers if they practice across state lines during the crisis. 

"Congress can't let ambulance-chasing trial attorneys turn a public health crisis into a gold mine," said Sasse. "Doctors and nurses are working around the clock to beat this virus and the last thing they need to worry about is a lawsuit. My bill gives licensed health care providers who are practicing across state lines a liability shield as long as they're volunteering to fight the pandemic and are practicing in the scope of their license."

Background: 

Sasse's emergency liability shield would protect licensed health care providers from legal liability for practicing across state lines so long as: 

(1) they are assisting with COVID-19 patients during the emergency;(2) they are practicing within the scope of their license; (3) they are working in a volunteer capacity. 

Sasse was joined by Senator Shelley Moore Capito (WV).
