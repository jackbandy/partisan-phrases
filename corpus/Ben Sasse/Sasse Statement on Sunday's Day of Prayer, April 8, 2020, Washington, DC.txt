Sasse Statement on Sunday's Day of Prayer


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following Statement after Governor Pete Ricketts proclaimed this Sunday as a Statewide Day of Prayer in Nebraska.

"On Easter Sunday -- the day Christians celebrate Christ's victory over death -- our family, like so many across Nebraska, will again ask our Lord for His love and mercy during this crisis. For the doctors and nurses fighting this virus, we ask for wisdom. For the families stretching to make ends meet, we ask for strength. For the workers keeping our communities running, we ask for protection. We know that pain and sickness will always exist east of Eden, but we press forward during this uncertain time with hope, confidence, and gratitude for His grace."
