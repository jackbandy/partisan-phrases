Sasse Receives Perfect Pro-Life Rating from Susan B. Anthony List


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a proud pro-life Nebraskan and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released the following statement after receiving a perfect "A" rating on the Susan B. Anthony List National Pro-Life Scorecard.

"Melissa and I are proudly pro-life -- and I'm honored to stand up and work for pro-life Nebraskans in Washington. We're a part of a movement of hope that is growing, but we have a lot more work to doÂ… through praying, loving our neighbors, passing legislation, and confirming good constitutionalists to the courts we'll keep making progress. I'm honored to receive an A rating from one of the most respected pro-life organizations in our nation." - Senator Ben Sasse

"Senator Sasse has voted consistently to protect the lives of unborn babies and infants as well as the consciences of taxpayers who don't want their hard-earned tax dollars paying for abortion domestically or internationally. While the pro-abortion majority in the U.S. House of Representatives continually sends the Senate bills that roll back pro-life protections, the Senate has made it their priority to confirm judges and justices who will respect the constitution and leave legislating to the legislative branch. Senator Sasse introduced S. 311, the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and led efforts to bring this bill to a vote." - Susan B. Anthony List National Pro-Life Scorecard.
