Sasse Statement on Scumbag Attorney


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued the following statement after Michael Avenatti, the noted scumbag and left-wing-media darling who orchestrated attacks on Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was found guilty on all counts in his Nike extortion trial. 

"Michael Avenatti is a D-list attorney but a Grade-A scumbag. It's hard to get airtime from the slammer, so Nike's win is cable television's loss. In the end, Michael Avenatti wasn't a real attorney, he just played one on TV."

Background:

Michael Avenatti, who once called Senator Sasse a "moron who knows nothing about the law," faces up to 42 years in prison for his genius legal theories.
