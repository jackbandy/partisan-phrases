Sasse Statement on Missing Epstein Surveillance Footage


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement regarding the news that surveillance footage from Jeffrey Epstein's jail cell on the day of his first apparent suicide attempt was deleted.

"These clowns are making Barney Fife look like Sherlock Holmes. This entire saga has been one failure after another. The video is gone, the Bureau of Prisons won't breathe a word, there's no final investigative report, and the American people deserve some pretty basic answers. The whole thing is a flagrant miscarriage of justice from start to finish."
