Sasse Statement on Coburn


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse released the following statement after the death of Dr. Tom Coburn. Dr. Coburn served Oklahoma as a conservative leader in the U.S. Senate from 2005-2015.

"Tom Coburn was a special, special man. He was a Christian and a father and a husband, and all of those identities were much more important to him than where he got his paycheck. And even among his day jobs, everyone who knew him knew that politics was, at best, second for "Doctor Coburn' -- a guy from Oklahoma who helped women deliver babies. He will be sorely missed in lots of different communities, but he is home."
