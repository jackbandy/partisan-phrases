Sasse Statement on Supreme Court"s "Remain in Mexico" Decision


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued the following statement regarding the Supreme Court's decision to allow the Administration to continue its "Remain in Mexico" policy for asylum seekers while the case makes its way through the courts. The Supreme Court's decision today overturns a lower court injunction. 

"The Supreme Court got this right. Too many lower-court judges with itchy trigger fingers use injunctions to issue sweeping national policy, but that's not their job. The Trump Administration will continue to enforce its policy while the courts hear the argument. That's good for national security and for the rule of law."
