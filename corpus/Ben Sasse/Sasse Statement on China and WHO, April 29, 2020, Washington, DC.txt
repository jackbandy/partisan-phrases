Sasse Statement on China and WHO


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, an outspoken China hawk, released the following statement after President Trump said that his Administration is in the process of developing plans to hold China and the World Health Organization accountable for failing to stop the initial spread of coronavirus.

"The Chinese Communist Party said "jump!' and the World Health Organization asked "how high?' The Chinese Communist Party has constantly lied and the World Health Organization gave those lies cover. People around the world are dying and our economies are on lockdown. President Trump is right to look for ways to hold both China and the WHO accountable for their failure to stop the spread."
