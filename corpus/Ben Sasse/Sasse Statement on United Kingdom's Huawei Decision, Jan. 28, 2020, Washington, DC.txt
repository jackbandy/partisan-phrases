Sasse Statement on United Kingdom's Huawei Decision


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a China hawk, issued the following statement regarding the United Kingdom's decision to let Huawei build part of its 5G network.

"Here's the sad truth: our special relationship is less special now that the U.K. has embraced the surveillance state commies at Huawei. During the Cold War, Margaret Thatcher never contracted with the KGB to save a few pennies. The Chinese Communist Party has infected Five Eyes with Huawei, right at a time when the U.S. and U.K. must be unified in order to meet the global security challenges of China's resurgence."
