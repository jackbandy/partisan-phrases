Sasse: WHO Can't Give Communists Cover


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued the following statement after President Trump announced the United States will halt funding to the World Health Organization pending an investigation into its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

"The World Health Organization has been giving the Chinese Communist Party cover. Their decision to parrot communist propaganda has caused innocent people to die. When the Chinese Communist Party was intimidating doctors and journalists, the WHO bent over backwards to flatter Chairman Xi. Americans know better - we're going to beat this virus and hold China accountable."
