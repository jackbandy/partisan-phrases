Sasse Statement on Ethnic Cleansing in China


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement after newly released documents show the extent of the Chinese Communist Party's attempts to persecute Uyghurs in torture camps for their religious beliefs. 

"The Chinese Communist Party runs China with violence and fear. Chairman Xi is terrified of the truth these documents show: the communist government is torturing men, women, and children because of their religion. Beijing's Great Firewall is beginning to leak and the world will soon realize what the Chinese people already know: Chairman Xi and his henchmen are evil despots who are waging a savage ethnic cleansing campaign against the Uyghurs."
