Sasse Statement on Iran


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement regarding President Trump's response to Iranian aggression last night.

"Here's the good news: Americans put General Soleimani in a body bag and sustained no casualties when Iran's mullahs responded with a missile attack that failed. Here's where things stand: The architect of Iran's proxy war strategy is dead and the United States has the strong upper hand to deter further Iranian aggression. We stand with our troops stationed overseas now and will continue to stand steadfast by their side. Here's what we should be doing to prepare for what may come next: First, Washington should make sure we have a strategy if Iran opts for a terrorist, cyber, or covert response after a cooling-off period; second, we need to continue our maximum pressure campaign with our allies who understand that Iran is a threat to peace."
