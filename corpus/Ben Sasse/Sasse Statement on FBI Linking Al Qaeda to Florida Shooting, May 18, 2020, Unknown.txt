Sasse Statement on FBI Linking Al Qaeda to Florida Shooting


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement after the FBI today linked Al Qaeda to last year's shooting at a U.S. military base in Pensacola, Florida. 

"The United States is still a target for violent jihadis. We stand for freedom and universal dignity, and these butchers believe in fear and violence. While terror organizations use technology to inspire and conduct attacks, our intelligence community is looking for smaller needles in bigger haystacks. Congress needs to prioritize that important national security work."
