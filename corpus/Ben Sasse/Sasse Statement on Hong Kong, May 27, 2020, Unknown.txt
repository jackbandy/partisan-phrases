Sasse Statement on Hong Kong


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement regarding the State Department's determination today that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous.

"This decision recognizes the sad reality that Beijing has tried to kill self-government in Hong Kong in pursuit of a One Country, One System arrangement. The Chinese Communist Party broke promises to the people of Hong Kong and broke treaties with the United Kingdom. In the days and weeks ahead, it will be critical for America to stand with the freedom loving people of Hong Kong, and for America to be judicious in how we lead the free world in imposing costs on Beijing. We should not waiver in punishing Xi and his thugs who invited today's decision."
