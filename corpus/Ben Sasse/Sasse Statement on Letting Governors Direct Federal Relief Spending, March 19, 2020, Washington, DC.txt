Sasse Statement on Letting Governors Direct Federal Relief Spending


Today, U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Finance Committee who has called for the 50 Governors to administer at least half of the money Congress will spend on coronavirus economic relief, issued the following statement after the President told Governors he is considering block grants for states.

"Letting Governors direct relief money is smart. Americans are hurting and they don't need a K Street bailout that shovels money to corporations with slick lobbyists. The federal government isn't the only government. Governors know the needs of their states better than D.C. does and we ought to make sure that they distribute more than half of all the money."
