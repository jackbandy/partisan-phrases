Sasse Statement on Lawsuit Against Chinese Communist Party


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and an outspoken China hawk, issued the following statement after the state of Missouri filed a lawsuit against the Chinese Communist Party for "the enormous loss of life, human suffering, and economic turmoil" resulting from Beijing's coronavirus coverup. 

"The Chinese Communist Party did what authoritarians always do: they hid the truth to save their hides. Chairman Xi's lies have killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people and wreaked untold economic damage. Chairman Xi has silenced doctors, hid critical scientific data, refused access to health officials until mid-February, sent worthless equipment to Europe, and blamed the United States. After Americans beat this nasty virus, we're going to hold China's corrupt government accountable."
