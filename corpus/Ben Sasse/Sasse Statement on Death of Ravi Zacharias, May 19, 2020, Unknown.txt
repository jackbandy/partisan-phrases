Sasse Statement on Death of Ravi Zacharias


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement regarding the news that Ravi Zacharias died today at the age of 74.

"Ravi Zacharias lived his life answering the question "what has Athens to do with Jerusalem?' He was a brilliant thinker who took the Gospel to the public square and tackled the hardest questions with humility and wisdom. His work was very meaningful in Melissa and my lives. We are saddened by his death but are comforted by the fact that he is with his Savior. Our family is praying for his family and our friends at Ravi Zacharias International Ministries."
