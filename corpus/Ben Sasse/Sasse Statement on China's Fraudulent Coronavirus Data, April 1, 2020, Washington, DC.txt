Sasse Statement on China's Fraudulent Coronavirus Data


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement regarding the Chinese Communist Party's fraudulent coronavirus data.  

"The claim that the United States has more coronavirus deaths than China is false. Without commenting on any classified information, this much is painfully obvious: The Chinese Communist Party has lied, is lying, and will continue to lie about coronavirus to protect the regime. Beijing's garbage propaganda shouldn't be taken seriously by the World Health Organization, by independent journalists, or by the American epidemiologists who are going to beat this terrible virus."
