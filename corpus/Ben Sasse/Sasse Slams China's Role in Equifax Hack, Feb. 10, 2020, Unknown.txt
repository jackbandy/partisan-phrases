Sasse Slams China's Role in Equifax Hack


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement after the Department of Justice indicted four members of China's military for their role in the Equifax breach. 

"Warning lights are still flashing red. First the Chinese Government hacked OPM and built a massive spy-database in 2014, and now four Chinese military members have been indicted in the 2017 Equifax breach that put millions of families at risk. The Chinese Communist Party will leave no stone unturned in its effort to steal and exploit American data. These indictments are good news, but we've got to do more to protect Americans' data from Chinese Communist Party influence operations."
