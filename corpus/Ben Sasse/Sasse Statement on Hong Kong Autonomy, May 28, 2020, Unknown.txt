Sasse Statement on Hong Kong Autonomy


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement after China passed legislation stripping Hong Kong of any autonomy in the name of "national security.'

"This so-called "national security' law is a naked attempt to exterminate free expression because these surveillance state communists hate freedom. The Chinese Communist Party is trying to crush freedom in Hong Kong and they're looking at Taiwan next. Americans must stand with Hong Kong's freedom-seekers and make sure that Chairman Xi's cronies pay a price."
