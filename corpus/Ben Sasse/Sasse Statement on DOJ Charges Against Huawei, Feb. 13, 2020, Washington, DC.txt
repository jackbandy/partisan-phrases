Sasse Statement on DOJ Charges Against Huawei


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement regarding federal charges against Huawei Technologies Co., LTD and several of its subsidiaries. 

"This is excellent news, because it tells the truth. Huawei is an arm of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Department of Justice ought to nail Chairman Xi's tech puppet to the wall. These crimes -- racketeering, conspiracy to steal trade secrets, and sanctions evasion -- are part of Chairman Xi's strategy to make China the world's preeminent superpower. The United States and our allies have an obligation to stop them."
