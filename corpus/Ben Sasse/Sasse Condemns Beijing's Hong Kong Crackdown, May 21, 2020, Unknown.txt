Sasse Condemns Beijing's Hong Kong Crackdown


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement regarding reports that the Chinese Communist Party"s National People's Congress will soon consider a resolution cracking down on protesters in Hong Kong. 

"The Chinese Communist Party is still trying to kill Hong Kong's autonomy. Beijing's current proposal will effectively destroy the rule of law in Hong Kong and will give Chairman Xi's thugs legal cover to treat freedom-loving protesters as terrorists. We've seen what this means for innocent people who suffer human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet. America has not forgotten the Hong Kong protest movement during the pandemic, and the free world must be ready to act if Xi destroys Hong Kong's internationally recognized autonomy."
