Sasse Statement on Efforts to Increase Coronavirus Testing and Telehealth


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement after the Trump Administration announced that health insurance companies would be waiving copays for coronavirus testing and expanding telehealth. 

"We need to be dramatically ramping up our diagnostic testing. Vice President Pence and the task force are doing important work to make sure the response is coordinated and comprehensive. It's good that insurers are waiving copays for testing and expanding coverage of telehealth treatment. These actions will be critical in boosting diagnostic testing and treatment process here in the United States. Nebraskans should listen to the CDC and remember mom's advice to wash your hands, cover your mouth, and stay home if you're sick."
