Sasse Statement on Death of Chinese Doctor


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement regarding the death of Dr. Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who warned about the scope of the coronavirus outbreak.

"Dr. Li Wenliang's courage and professionalism make him a champion of the Chinese people and an enemy of the Chinese Communist Party. Let's be very clear about this: communism has been the perfect incubator for the coronavirus, because the Chinese Communist Party fears transparency. Unlike Dr. Li, Chairman Xi doesn't care about human life -- that's why the Chinese Communist Party harvests the organs of its political prisoners, throws Uyghurs into torture camps, and tries to cover up coronavirus numbers."
