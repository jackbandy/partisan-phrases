Sasse Statement on China Expelling Reporters


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement after the Chinese Communist Party expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters as retribution for a critical opinion piece written earlier this month.

"Here's the proof that Beijing is sick: the same Chinese Communist Party that sat on the sidelines for weeks while coronavirus plagued Wuhan sprang to action when Chairman Xi's feelings were hurt by a headline that nobody in China had the freedom to read. The Wall Street Journal owes the Chinese Communist Party nothing. Chairman Xi owes the Chinese people an apology for his coronavirus cover-up."
