Sasse to Schumer: "Cut the Crap and Vote for This Tonight."


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement after Senate Democrats filibustered the coronavirus relief bill.

"Some parts of this relief package stink, but other parts do necessary work: It turbo-charges vaccine development, helps small businesses stay alive with well-structured loans, and works to delegate to governors half of the spending decisions in the bill's appropriations section. I dislike both the firm-specific money in the airlines section, and the direct payments that Washington will try to renew even after we beat this nasty virus -- but it's a good faith compromise bill. Tonight, Democrats are stalling so Speaker Pelosi can seek specific pork for California and Illinois -- states on the brink of bankruptcy for reasons having nothing to do with coronavirus. It's reprehensible. Schumer should cut the crap and vote for this tonight."
