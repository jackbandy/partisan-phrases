Sasse Introducing Hong Kong Asylum Bill


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a China hawk and member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement regarding his legislation to automatically grant Hong Kongers asylum in the wake of Beijing's latest crackdowns. 

"Victims of communism will always find refuge in the United States. Next week, when the Senate reconvenes, I am introducing legislation to automatically grant Hong Kong residents asylum in the United States. Chairman Xi must understand this: the American people hate tyranny and stand in solidarity with Hong Kong. The brave Hong Kongers who have stared down the threat of communist oppression will find safety here until their home is free. We stand with our U.K. allies in extending lifelines of liberty to the people of Hong Kong. The Chinese Communist Party's willingness to break its treaty obligations on Hong Kong shows the world that Beijing cannot be trusted to honor any agreements."
