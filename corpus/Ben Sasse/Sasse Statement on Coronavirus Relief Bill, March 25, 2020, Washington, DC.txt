Sasse Statement on Coronavirus Relief Bill


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement after voting in favor of the Senate's coronavirus relief legislation. 

"This bill isn't great, and I've been fighting like crazy to make it better. It's got some really good stuff that's going to turbocharge vaccine development and help small businesses, and fortunately it doesn't include a bunch of the destructive nonsense that Speaker Pelosi tried to add."

Background: 

Sasse led the effort to improve the bill with amendments on pro-worker, pro-recovery unemployment insurance, rural hospitals, and liability shields for health care workers.  

Sasse fought to prevent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from packing the bill with partisan demands that have nothing to do with the current crisis.
