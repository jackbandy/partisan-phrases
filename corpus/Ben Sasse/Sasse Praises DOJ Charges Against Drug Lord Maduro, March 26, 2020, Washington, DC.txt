Sasse Praises DOJ Charges Against Drug Lord Maduro


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement after the Department of Justice announced federal drug trafficking charges against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in Washington, New York, and Florida.  

"Nicolás Maduro's sentencing is long overdue. Today's indictment of the Communist thug and his cronies for turning the Venezuelan state into a narco-terrorist playground demonstrates the U.S. resolve to stand with the Venezuelan people. Let's be clear: Drug money and political cover from Russia and China kept Maduro in power long after the Venezuelan people declared him illegitimate. The Venezuelan people deserve better."
