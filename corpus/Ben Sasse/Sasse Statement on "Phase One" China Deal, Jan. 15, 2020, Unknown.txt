Sasse Statement on "Phase One" China Deal


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, an outspoken advocate for Nebraska agriculture and trade, issued the following statement as President Trump signed a "Phase One" trade deal with China. "Trade is always good news. Every Nebraskan is rooting for the President to get good deals done. More trade is a win-win for Nebraska's farmers and ranchers. The Chinese aren't our foes, but the tyrants running the Chinese Communist Party are. Nebraskans want to keep the pressure on the commies in Beijing and make sure Chinese families can enjoy the best ag products in the world."
