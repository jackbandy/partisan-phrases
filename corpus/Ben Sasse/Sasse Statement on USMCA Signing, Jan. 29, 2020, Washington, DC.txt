Sasse Statement on USMCA Signing


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, an outspoken advocate for Nebraska agriculture and trade, released the following statement after President Trump signed the USMCA trade agreement into law.

"The USMCA is now law -- and that's great news for Nebraska. Our farmers and ranchers deserve the certainty that this trade deal provides, and our neighbors, Canada and Mexico, are going to have it good knowing that they can buy from the very best America has to offer: Nebraska ag producers. We worked hard to get this deal across the finish line and the President and his team deserve a bunch of credit for getting this done."
