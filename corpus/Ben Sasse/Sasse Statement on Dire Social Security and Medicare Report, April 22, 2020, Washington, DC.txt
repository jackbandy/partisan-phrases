Sasse Statement on Dire Social Security and Medicare Report


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement regarding today's Social Security and Medicare Trustees report forecasting that Medicare will deplete its reserves in 2026 and Social Security will deplete its reserves in 2035. 

"Conventional wisdom says that bipartisanship is dead, but actually both Washington Republicans and Washington Democrats pretend that math is make-believe. Politicians will stick their heads in the sand but Social Security and Medicare are going bankrupt. This ought to be a five-alarm fire, but you're not gonna hear about this in the general election because President Trump and Joe Biden aren't going to talk about this in the campaign. We have to make serious changes for future beneficiaries right now or everyone -- including seniors -- will face the consequences in a few short years."
