Sasse Statement on Nebraska Walk for Life


U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, the author of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Act, released the following statement after speaking at the Nebraska Walk for Life, one of Nebraska's largest pro-life gatherings. The Nebraska Walk for Life is sponsored by the Nebraska Right to Life. 

"Pro-life Nebraskans prayerfully gathered today to remember the countless innocent lives lost to abortion. Our message is one of hope: we stand up for babies and moms, science and compassion. The pro-life movement is alive and growing in our state -- and that's great news for Nebraska's pro-life community."
