Breaking the Gridlock Act

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, House Democrats have fought  for months to save Americans' healthcare. That led to four Republicans  working with us to bring this bill to the floor today. Yesterday, nine  Republicans voted with us to bring this tax credit extension up. Today,  it is 11. They know that letting these tax credits expire will hurt the  people that they represent as well.

Congressional Republicans set the stage to price 4 million Americans  out of healthcare plans that they need. Democrats are fighting to bring  your costs down. If you take away the credits that millions of  Americans depend on to afford coverage, families will be forced into  junk plans that don't cover their needs or will have no coverage at  all. When they get sick or hurt, it will cost even more.

This is a good day for Americans. It is a great day for Americans.  Vote ``yes'' on this bill to protect healthcare for the people that we  represent.
