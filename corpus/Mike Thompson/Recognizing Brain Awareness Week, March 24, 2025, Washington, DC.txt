Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to announce that  March 10th through March 16th marked Brain Awareness Week. The Brain  Awareness Campaign is a worldwide celebration of the brain that brings  together scientists, families, schools, and communities. Brain  Awareness Week is the culmination of these efforts and is celebrated  throughout the United States and in many parts of the world.

This global celebration, launched by The Dana Alliance for Brain  Initiatives in 1996, and supported by partners like the Society for  Neuroscience, presents an opportunity to bring attention to the  significant advances in brain science and advocate for science funding.  Brain Awareness Week provides opportunities to learn more about the  brain and educate the public on the importance of continued research.

As co-chair of the Congressional Neuroscience Caucus, I am proud of  the crucial neuroscience work being conducted in the United States,  including in my district at the University of California, Davis and the  California National Primate Research Center where I visited the lab of  Dr. John Morrison, current President of the Society for Neuroscience,  and learned more about his research into Alzheimer's disease.

It is essential that we keep supporting neuroscience research to  enable world-class researchers to continue their vital work on a wide  range of conditions, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases,  autism spectrum  disorders, depression, and addiction. Events like Brain Awareness Week  helps every American understand how important this research is.
