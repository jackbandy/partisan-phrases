Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to call for a vote immediately to save America's  healthcare.

Across our country, American families are being squeezed by high  grocery prices, high utility bills, and soaring costs for holiday  gifts. Families can't afford to pay double for their healthcare.  Republicans cut $1 trillion from healthcare to give a tax break to  their billionaire donors. Americans of every party stripe are being  hurt, and they have had enough.

This morning, four Republicans joined every Democrat to sign a  petition forcing you to hold a vote on our bill that will save  healthcare for 4 million people. Mr. Speaker, it is your turn to act.  Hold the vote to save healthcare now.

It is important to point out that the CBO analysis that my Republican  friends keep talking about says that it is going to cost 100,000 people  more every year for healthcare.

Hold the vote on the bill that will save healthcare.
