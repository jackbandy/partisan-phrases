Mr. HURD of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3857) to amend the Snow Water Supply Forecasting  Program Authorization Act, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                      H.R. 3857

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Snow Water Supply       Forecasting Reauthorization Act of 2025''.       SEC. 2. SNOW WATER SUPPLY FORECASTING PROGRAM.

The Snow Water Supply Forecasting Program Authorization Act       (43 U.S.C. 1477) is amended--

(1) in subsection (c)(2)--

(A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``culminating in the       report required under subsection (d)(3)'' and inserting       ``with an emphasis on deployment of technologies that provide       integration of snowpack measuring and modeling''; and

(B) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``after submitting the       report required by subsection (d)(3),'';

(2) in subsection (d)--

(A) in paragraph (1)--

(i) in the heading, by adding ``with integrated modeling''       after ``data'';

(ii) by striking ``emerging technologies for snowpack       measurement, such as'' and inserting ``technologies that       provide complete integration of accurate, timely, and       spatially complete snowpack measurements and models,       including the integration of''; and

(iii) by striking subparagraphs (A) through (C) and       inserting the following:

``(A) airborne laser altimetry;

``(B) imaging spectroscopy;

``(C) integrated physics-based snowpack and hydrologic       modeling; and

``(D) other technologies that the Secretary determines are       likely to provide more accurate or timely snowpack       measurement data commensurate with operational water       management needs.'';

(B) in paragraph (2) by inserting ``, including the       National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the       Natural Resources Conservation Service,'' after ``other       Federal agencies''; and

(C) by striking paragraph (3);

(3) in subsection (e)--

(A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``After submitting the       report required under subsection (d)(3), the'' and inserting       ``The''; and

(B) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:

``(2) Focus.--The program shall focus on activities that       will maintain, establish, expand, or advance snowpack       measurement and integrated modeling, with an emphasis on--

``(A) enhancing activities to achieve improved snow and       water supply forecasting results that are more responsive to       changing weather and watershed conditions;

``(B) real-time integration of activities described in this       section with water supply forecasts;

``(C) activities in river basins where activities described       in this section can produce snow and water supply data to       inform water management decisions, including interstate water       management decisions; and

``(D) building program partners' capacity to implement and       adapt to the new measurement and forecast capabilities       enabled under this program.'';

(4) in subsection (f)--

(A) by striking ``of this Act'' and inserting ``of the Snow       Water Supply Forecasting Reauthorization Act of 2025'';

(B) in paragraph (1)--

(i) by striking ``and sub-basins'';

(ii) by striking ``technologies'' and inserting ``and       integrated modeling technologies''; and

(iii) by striking ``technology used'' and inserting       ``application, outcome, and data resources used''; and

(C) in paragraph (2), by striking ``or sub-basin''; and

(5) in subsection (g), by striking ``$15,000,000, in the       aggregate, for fiscal years 2022 through 2026'' and inserting       ``$3,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027 through 2031''.

Mr. HURD of Colorado.  3857, the bill now  under consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3857, the Snow Water Supply  Forecasting Reauthorization Act.

In Colorado and in the West, we don't measure water by what comes out  of a faucet. We measure it by what falls on our mountains. Snowpack is  our reservoir, our lifeline, and our future, but water managers are  still forced to make major decisions with incomplete data and outdated  tools.

This bill reauthorizes the Snow Water Supply Forecasting Program so  that we can use modern technology, lidar, satellite imagery, and other  remote-sensing tools to build accurate 3D models of snowpack across  entire watersheds. Better data means better reservoir planning, better  support for agriculture, better protection for our cities and towns,  and better management across every industry that depends upon water in  the West.

We cannot manage what we can't measure. H.R. 3857 gives Western  communities what they need to plan ahead and protect the water  resources that sustain our way of life.

Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. HURD of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, this bill reauthorizes a vital  program that helps water managers promptly and effectively plan for and  respond to drought.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
