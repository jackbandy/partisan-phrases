Welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, D.C.


Mr. HURD of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome His All- Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, D.C.--the  spiritual leader and Primus inter Pares (First among Equals) of more  than 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. For decades. he has  been a tireless voice for religious freedom, and as the longest serving  Archbishop of Constantinople in two millennia of Christian history, he  stands as a symbol of faith and resolve. His visit comes as he receives  the distinguished Templeton Prize in New York, an honor once bestowed  on Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and Nelson  Mandela--leaders whose lives have testified to the power of faith to  transcend borders.

As a Catholic, I am deeply moved by the ties between our churches.  His All-Holiness has met with Popes across generations, working to  strengthen bonds of unity and to advance the cause of peace. Together,  they have spoken with one voice: to defend the weak, serve those in  need, and pursue reconciliation among nations. Patriarch Bartholomew is  also a leading figure in interfaith dialogue among Judaism,  Christianity, and Islam. His presence here reminds us that faith has a  vital role to play in protecting liberty and human dignity.

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to welcome him to Washington and to thank  him for his steadfast leadership in advancing religious freedom around  the world.
