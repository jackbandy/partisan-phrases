Accessing Satellite Capabilities to Enable New Discoveries Act

Mr. HURD of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my  legislation, H.R. 2600, the Accessing Satellite Capabilities to Enable  New Discoveries Act, the ASCEND Act.

This bill builds on a model that already works. In 2017, NASA  launched the Commercial Small Satellite Data Acquisition Pilot Program  to test whether commercially available Earth observation data could  support NASA's scientific missions. The results were clear:  Participating scientists found the data reliable, valuable, and highly  effective across a broad range of research applications.

The ASCEND Act takes that successful pilot and makes it permanent. It  directs NASA to formally establish a commercial satellite acquisition  program within the Science Mission Directorate so that the agency can  routinely access cost-effective commercial data to complement its own  Earth observation missions.

This is a practical approach. Instead of duplicating capabilities,  NASA can leverage private-sector innovation. Through commercial  licensing, researchers gain access to high-quality satellite data that  supports wildfire response, agricultural monitoring, disaster  preparedness, reforestation, and environmental tracking. That data  translates directly into better decisionmaking on the ground.

This is a model where private investment strengthens public missions,  and it supports American jobs, including in Colorado's growing  commercial space sector.

The bill also includes appropriate oversight. It requires an annual  report to Congress detailing the data acquired, its sources, how it is  used within NASA, as well as its measurable impact. That transparency  ensures accountability while allowing the program to grow.

At a time when commercial space innovation is accelerating rapidly,  Congress should ensure NASA has the flexibility to use the best tools  available. The ASCEND Act strengthens America's scientific leadership,  supports our domestic space industry, and ensures taxpayer dollars are  used efficiently.

I thank Chairman Babin for advancing my bill to the floor. I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 2600.
