Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act


Mr. HURD of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to cosponsor the  PERMIT Act, commonsense legislation to help America build the  infrastructure we need faster and more responsibly.

I am especially grateful that my bill, the Jurisdictional  Determination Backlog Reduction Act, is included as a part of this  package. Across the country, Americans depend on timely answers from  the Army Corps so they know whether their projects require Clean Water  Act permits, but the Corps is not keeping up. Right now, thousands of  determinations and wetland delineations are stuck in a backlog, leaving  projects in limbo.

My proposal directs the Corps to clear this backlog so that  landowners and builders get the determinations and clarity they need to  move forward in a timely and responsible way.

I thank Chairman Graves, Chairman Collins, and the Water Resources  and Environment Subcommittee staff for their work putting together a  bill that cuts red tape, reduces duplicative reviews, and gives  farmers, ranchers, utilities, and communities in Colorado and across  the country the regulatory certainty that they need to build.

I look forward to advancing this important legislation.
