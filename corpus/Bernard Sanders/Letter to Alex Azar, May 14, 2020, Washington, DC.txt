Letter to Alex Azar, Secretary of the Dept. of Health and Human Services - In Response to Trump Administration Evasiveness, Sanders Demands Answers on Ensuring Free, Universal Access to COVID-19 Vaccine


Dear Secretary Azar:At Tuesday's HELP Committee hearing, I asked FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn and Healthand Human Services Assistant Secretary Brett Giroir a question: When a COVID-19 vaccine isapproved will it be made available to everyone in America without cost?Unfortunately, they were unable to respond with a simple yes or no answer. I believe that theAmerican people know what the answer to that question should be, and that is YES.Making sure that a future COVID-19 vaccine will be provided to all without cost is not only theright thing to do from a moral perspective, it is also good public policy. Public health officialsall agree that we will not truly overcome this horrific pandemic until a vaccine is made availableto everyone.With over 80,000 COVID-19 deaths already, and more to come in the future, the vaccine mustbe made available to every man, woman and child without cost. Nobody in America shouldunnecessarily die from the virus because they cannot afford a vaccine.Today, I am writing to ask you the same question that I asked at the HELP hearing: Will theAdministration guarantee that once a vaccine is approved by the FDA it will be made availableto everyone in this country free of charge?In my view, it would be morally unacceptable to allow the pharmaceutical industry to use thispandemic as another opportunity to make huge profits on the backs of people who can leastafford it. The American people should not be forced to pay obscene prices for a vaccine that isneeded to keep them alive.I look forward to hearing from you on this vitally important issue as soon as possible. Sincerely,
