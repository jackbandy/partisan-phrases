Leahy, Sanders, Welch Announce More Than $9 Million In Grants To Support Vermont's Airports


Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Senator Bernie Sanders, (I-Vt.), and Representative Peter Welch (D-Vt.) Wednesday announced $9,020,115 in grants to support 10 Vermont airports during the COVID-19 crisis.  The funds are part of $10 billion in federal assistance for airports included in the CARES Act that was passed by Congress and signed into law last month.  As Vice Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Leahy played a leading role in securing the funding for Vermont.

In a joint statement, Leahy, Sanders and Welch said:  "This public health crisis will continue to interrupt Vermonters' lives for the coming weeks and months.  One of those necessary disruptions includes canceled air travel for business meetings, vacations and family celebrations.  These cancelations are having a severe impact on the finances of Vermont's airports.  These funds will help ensure that when we emerge from this pandemic our airports will be in a position to welcome people and business to Vermont."

Burlington International Airport Director Of Aviation Gene Richards said:  "The Burlington International Airport is grateful for the dedicated funding needed during these challenging times, which will be used for debt obligations as well as operating expenses to maintain this great airport.  We have had extraordinary years and are looking forward to recovering in the months ahead."

These funds will help the airports meet their operating expenses, continue current construction and fulfill ongoing needs.  When the CARES Act was passed last month, the aviation industry nationally was experiencing an 80 percent decline in passenger traffic and is expected to face even more severe financial and operational impacts in the weeks and months ahead.
