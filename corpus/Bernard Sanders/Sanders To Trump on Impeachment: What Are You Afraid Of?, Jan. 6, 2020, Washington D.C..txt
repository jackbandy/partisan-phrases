Sanders To Trump on Impeachment: What Are You Afraid Of?


In response to John Bolton stating his willingness to testify in the Senate's impeachment trial, Senator Sanders (I-Vt.) issued the following statement:

"With today's announcement that former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton is willing to testify, it makes it even more clear that Sen. Mitch McConnell must put forth a process for a full impeachment trial, including witnesses. President Trump claims he is innocent of all charges, that he did nothing wrong, and that he never withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for political favors. 

So when it comes to a full impeachment trial, here is my question for Donald Trump: what are you afraid of? If you are not guilty of corruption and abuse of power, you should welcome the testimony of your former national security advisor and other witnesses. And if you did nothing wrong, you should join me in calling for a full and fair impeachment trial in the Senate."
