Laws Have Loopholes

Mr. HARRIS of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, the average American already  thinks that you actually have to be a U.S. citizen to vote in a Federal  election. The fact of the matter is that our laws have loopholes. You  don't actually have to be a U.S. citizen in some States or don't have  to prove that you are a U.S. citizen to vote.

Now, the straw man is presented that if you get married, you change  your name. I suggest that anyone who feels that just read the bill. It  says an accommodation has to be made in every State for people whose  name changed from an otherwise valid proof of citizenship such as a  birth certificate.

The bottom line is that Americans expect that only American citizens,  and not the 12 million illegal aliens who entered under the last  administration, are going to be voting in Federal elections.

Americans expect it, and they expect Congress to do something about  it. Mr. Speaker, I urge Congress to take action and pass the SAVE Act.
