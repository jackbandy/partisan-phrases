Eliminating Fraud, Waste, and Abuse in Medicaid

Mr. HARRIS of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, this week, the Energy and  Commerce Committee finally attacked fraud, waste, and abuse in the  Medicaid system.

I think every American knows that when government runs a program,  there is fraud, waste, and abuse, and that is exactly what the  Committee dealt with.

For instance, 1 million people have committed fraud against the  Medicaid system by being enrolled in two States. My colleagues across  the aisle think it is a bad idea to eliminate that fraud, waste, and  abuse because they all voted against it.

This chart shows what actually happens when you eliminate fraud,  waste, and abuse, and the Republicans increase spending in Medicaid by  25 percent over the next 10 years for the people who really need it:  the pregnant women, the children, the disabled, the blind, the elderly,  and we did it eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse.
