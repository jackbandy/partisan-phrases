Republicans Are Protecting and Preserving Medicaid for the Truly Needy

Mr. HARRIS of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, you just heard right here on the  floor that those mean Republicans are cutting Medicaid.

Let's set the record straight. As this graph shows, the Republican  instructions don't cut Medicaid, they increase Medicaid by 25 percent  over the next 10 years.

Even with common core math--I know it is popular on that side of the  aisle--you can see that Medicaid expenditures of the Federal Government  go up over the next 10 years with the Republican plan, even after  eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse, which a clear majority of  Americans agree we should eliminate across the Federal Government. We  spend $656 billion in fiscal year 2025 and, again, it goes up by 25  percent over the next 10 years. It is not only that, but Medicaid  payments in some States' providers could  be two to three times the payment for Medicare to healthy, able-bodied  young adults. That should scare each and every senior that we are  spending more for medical care for healthy, able-bodied young adults  than for our seniors. If you repeat a lie long enough, it becomes a  truth, but this is a fact.

Mr. Speaker, Republicans are protecting and preserving Medicaid for  the truly needy.
