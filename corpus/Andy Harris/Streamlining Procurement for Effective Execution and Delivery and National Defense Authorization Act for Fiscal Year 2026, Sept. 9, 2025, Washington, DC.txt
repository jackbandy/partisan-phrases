Mr. HARRIS of Maryland. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from New  Jersey for bringing up this topic.

The fact of the matter is that the permitting process was abbreviated  for offshore wind because we have this fascination that we have to  bring this very expensive type of energy production somehow to the  United States, and the gentleman from New Jersey brings up the point.

The fact of the matter is, Mr. Chair, these new windmills that they  propose off my district are twice as high as the ones that they have  initially proposed. They have never been placed in the maritime  environment, so we have no idea what the undersea effect will be. In my  district, this is the closest point to Washington, D.C., off the coast.

Time is not our enemy. Russia and China are our enemies. They have  submarines. Russia has submarines that could come close to our coast,  launch a weapon, and not be detected because we don't know what the  effect is of these windmills.

As the gentleman brings up, Sweden canceled 12 of 13 offshore  projects on their side toward Russia because it would delay detection  by 1 minute. The time needed to detect a missile would go from 1 minute  to 2 minutes because of that interference.

Now, we stand here, closest to the shore. We absolutely should make  certain that these windmills are not going to affect our safety  standing right here in the Capitol.
