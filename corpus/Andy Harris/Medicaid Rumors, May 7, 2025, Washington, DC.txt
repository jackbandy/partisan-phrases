Medicaid Rumors

Mr. HARRIS of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I am sure what you are going to  hear on the floor today is what you have heard in the past, these  rumors that somehow those mean, nasty Republicans are going to cut  Medicaid.

It reminds me of what Groucho Marx once said: Who you going to  believe, these claims or your lying eyes?

This is the graph of what the Republican plan is for Medicaid  spending over the next 10 years. This assumes that we actually get all  the able-bodied, single people without children on Medicaid to agree to  work 20 hours a week or volunteer at a church or train. It doesn't seem  like too much. The average American thinks that is pretty reasonable.

If we eliminate all the fraud, waste, and abuse--and there is plenty  of it--we are left with at least a 25 percent increase in Medicaid over  the next 10 years from the current spending level. Only in Washington  could anyone claim that is a cut.

Mr. Speaker, who are you going to believe, the claims or your lying  eyes?
