Mr. HARRIGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Hickory Police  Chief Reed Baer of North Carolina's 10th District, who is retiring this  summer after more than 30 years of dedicated service.

Chief Baer spent his entire career serving the entire community that  he grew up in. He started with the department in 1997 as a patrol  officer and worked his way all the way up, from sergeant, to captain,  to deputy chief, and eventually to chief in 2023.

Under his leadership, the department focused on officer wellness,  training, and building stronger ties with his community. He also helped  create new pathways into the profession for young people in the area.

He has been a steady presence in Hickory for a long time, and his  impact will be felt well beyond his time in uniform. I thank him for  his service and wish him all the best in his retirement.                            Honoring Jake Bridges

Mr. HARRIGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a young man from  North Carolina's 10th District, firefighter Jake Bridges of Hickory,  who died while serving his community.

Jake was just 20 years old. He was born in Cleveland County, raised  in Shelby, and graduated from Burns High School in 2023. Not long after  that, he joined the Hickory Fire Department as a certified firefighter  and EMT.

He hadn't been on the job long, but you wouldn't have known it. He  showed up ready to work, ready to serve, and ready to make a  difference.

Jake was a man of faith. He loved the Atlanta Braves, loved playing  golf, and more than anything, he loved being a firefighter.

His loss is a tough one for Hickory, for the department, and for  everyone who knew him. My heart goes out to his mom, his family, and  his brothers and sisters in uniform.

He was proud to serve, and we will be proud to remember him.
