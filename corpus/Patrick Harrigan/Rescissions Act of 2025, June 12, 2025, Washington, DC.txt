Rescissions Act of 2025

Mr. HARRIGAN. Mr. Speaker, the American people are sick and tired of  watching Washington burn through their paychecks on wasteful,  ridiculous, and downright offensive projects. This rescissions package  is our chance to prove that we still remember who we work for here in  Washington.

We are cutting $2.5 million for electric vehicles in Vietnam, $47,000  for transgender surgeries in Colombia, and nearly $10 billion for NPR,  PBS, and other bloated liberal pet projects that have no place in a  responsible budget.

Washington acts like taxpayer dollars are theirs to waste, but they  are not. Every cent belongs to the men and women who work long hours,  pay their bills, and expect their government to act with a shred of  discipline. This is about more than numbers. It is about trust. It is  about respect. And it is about time.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and prove that  Congress can still do the right thing.
