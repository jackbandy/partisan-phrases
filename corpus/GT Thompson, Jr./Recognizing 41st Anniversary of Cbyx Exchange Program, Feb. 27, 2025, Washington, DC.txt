Recognizing 41st Anniversary of Cbyx Exchange Program


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the 41st anniversary of the CBYX exchange program and to thank David  Byrne, a current participant and intern in my office.

The CBYX program is jointly funded by the U.S. Congress and the  German Bundestag.

Every year, this unique program offers 75 young Germans and 75 young  Americans the opportunity to study, work, and volunteer in Germany and  the United States. The participants fully immerse themselves in the  other culture, attending university, interning, and living with host  families all over both countries.

CBYX is an excellent example of how cultural and political exchange  amongst citizens can positively impact international relations in a  different, more grassroots, and hands-on way.

As the co-chair of the bipartisan German-American Caucus and  representing Pennsylvania, a State with a long history of German  heritage, I am proud to support this program.

I thank David for his work and time in my office, and I wish him the  best in his future endeavors.
