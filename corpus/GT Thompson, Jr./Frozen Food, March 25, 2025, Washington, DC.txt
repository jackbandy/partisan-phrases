Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  Frozen Food Month and recognize the vital role that frozen foods play  in American households. Frozen food is more than just a convenient  option. It is a solution to food waste and a way to save families  hundreds of dollars.

Studies show that frozen produce is less likely to be wasted compared  to fresh produce that spoils over time, giving consumers access to  affordable, nutritious food year-around.

By freezing food at its peak, we preserve both the flavor and  nutrients, making it a smart choice for families looking to eat well  while managing their budgets.

For millions of Americans, especially those facing time constraints,  frozen food offers an affordable, easy way to enjoy balanced meals.  Nearly every American household relies on frozen foods, whether it is  vegetables, fruits, breakfast items, or even complete meals.

This March, let's take a moment to recognize the hard work of our  Nation's frozen food producers and the critical role that frozen foods  play in keeping America nourished.
