Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Program and our current CBYX  intern, Max Groene.

For more than 40 years, thousands of young Germans and Americans have  had the opportunity to live, learn, and work in the program's  respective countries.

As co-chair of the German-American Caucus, I am proud to support the  CBYX program and will continue working to strengthen the relationship  between our two great nations.

The CBYX program is a great opportunity for participants to gain a  new perspective on global affairs and politics and immerse themselves  in new cultures.

Max, a native of Berlin, Germany, began interning on Capitol Hill  earlier this year. Before moving to Washington, D.C., he spent a  semester at Snow College in Utah.

Max has spent this month helping our office with everyday operations.  Following his time in D.C., he will complete an internship in Oregon  with an energy company.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Max for joining our office this month. He has  represented Germany well, and I wish him the best in his future  endeavors.
