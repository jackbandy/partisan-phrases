Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize April  as National Volunteer Month.

Volunteering is more than an act of service. It is a testament to the  power of community, kindness, and shared responsibility. Across our  Nation, volunteers serve in countless ways: mentoring young people,  supporting food banks, rebuilding homes after natural disasters, and  lending a hand to those in need.

Their work is not just about addressing immediate challenges but  about creating lasting change and hope.

As co-chair of the Congressional Service Organization Caucus, it is a  privilege to celebrate National Volunteer Month, recognizing and  honoring the millions of individuals who dedicate their time and  talents to making our communities stronger, more resilient, and more  compassionate.

When we give our time and our efforts to others, we foster a sense of  unity and purpose. We bridge divides, strengthen neighborhoods, and  inspire future generations to embrace the spirit of service.

From local charities to national organizations, volunteers are the  heartbeat of our communities, demonstrating that even small acts of  kindness can have a profound impact, making a lasting difference in the  world. Throughout my district, there are many great volunteers.

From Penn State THON raising a record-breaking $17 million this year  alone to aid families affected by childhood cancer to the Wellsboro  Rotary Club, which just celebrated its centennial year of service, our  communities are filled with neighbors helping neighbors.

These few examples remind us that acts of service have a profound  impact, strengthening the fabric of our society and inspiring others to  step forward.

Volunteering doesn't just help those whom we serve, it enriches our  own lives. Studies show that service fosters personal growth, reduces  stress, and even enhances our overall well-being. Beyond the data, we  know firsthand that giving back fills our hearts with meaning and our  communities with hope.

Mr. Speaker, as we observe National Volunteer Month, I encourage each  of us to find new ways to give back.

Whether through a local nonprofit, a school, a faith-based group, or  a simple act of kindness in our daily lives, we all have something  valuable to contribute. Let us celebrate those who give their time and  let us recommit to the values of service and generosity.

Together, through volunteering, we can build a better, stronger, and  more connected world.
