Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of National Military Appreciation Month.

This month, we pause to honor the brave men and women of our Armed  Forces, past and present, who have worn the uniform of the United  States of America.

Our military has stood for freedom throughout our history in times of  peace and peril. They do not ask for recognition. They do not serve for  applause. They serve because they believe in something bigger than  themselves. They serve out of duty, honor, and love of country.

This month is to remember our POWs and MIAs, to support our Gold Star  families, to stand with our veterans, and to thank those currently  serving.

Mr. Speaker, we stand by our veterans, and we reaffirm our duty to  provide our servicemembers with the support they have earned, both in  uniform and after.

May God protect our servicemembers and their families this month and  every month. We honor and thank them. We will never forget their  service and their sacrifice.
