Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the 75th anniversary of St. Mary's Rotary Club, a cornerstone of  service in our community since 1950.

For 75 years, the St. Mary's Rotary Club has exemplified the Rotary  motto  of Service Above Self through countless projects supporting local  schools, awarding scholarships, and promoting youth leadership.

Their commitment to bettering our community is unwavering, and to  mark this milestone, the club has launched a project to construct new,  modern facilities at Shawmut Park.

With the growing popularity of Fall Fest and other local events, the  current facilities can no longer meet community needs. This upgrade  will improve accessibility and enhance the park experience for all  residents. Earlier this year, construction was completed, and new  facilities were officially opened to the public.

Volunteer service is the cornerstone of a successful, strong, and  healthy community, and the St. Mary's Rotary Club fills this vital need  by supporting our neighbors and friends.

Mr. Speaker, I commend the St. Mary's Rotary Club for 75 years of  service, and I thank its members for their continued leadership in  strengthening our community.
