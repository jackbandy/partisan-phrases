Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, we  marked a solemn day: Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.

On December 7, 1941, our great Nation was suddenly attacked by the  Imperial Japanese Navy, killing more than 2,400 American servicemembers  and civilians and propelling us into World War II.

On the 84th anniversary of the attack, we remember those brave souls  who lost their lives that day, and we honor those who survived. There  are only 12 remaining survivors, and they are all over 100 years old.

Unfortunately, none were able to make the trip to Hawaii this year  for the remembrance ceremony, but we are forever indebted to their  sacrifices. We will forever honor all of the Americans who were at the  naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, that day.

Mr. Speaker, President Franklin D. Roosevelt said:

``No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated  invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through  to absolute victory.''

And we did.

God bless those who lost their lives that day, and God bless America.
