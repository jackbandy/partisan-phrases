Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Public  Schools Week.

Approximately 9 out of 10 American students receive their education  from a public school. Our public school system, envisioned by our  Founding Fathers, is meant to give every child, regardless of ZIP Code,  background, or ability, access to a quality education.

These schools provide knowledge and skills that allow our young  people to thrive and contribute to our communities.

As a senior member of the Education and Workforce Committee, a former  school board member, and having attended public schools growing up, I  understand the vital role our school system plays in the success of not  only the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania but also our Nation.

Mr. Speaker, as part of Public Schools Week, I also want to  acknowledge and recognize the tireless efforts of educators and staff  who work each day to inspire and to support our students.

Every child deserves access to a high-quality education which helps  foster growth and encourages students to achieve their great potential.
