Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  the student-run cafe at Clearfield County Career & Technology Center.  The cafe opened last week and gives students the opportunity to serve  food to their peers.

The program allows 18 students to participate in morning class and an  additional 15 students to participate in the afternoon. High school  students from Clearfield, Curwensville, West Branch, Philipsburg- Osceola, and Moshannon Valley are eligible to enroll in the program.

The cafe operates as a training lab, giving students the opportunity  to apply skills they have learned in the classroom to real-life  scenarios.

Students help prepare ingredients, set up workstations, and create  menus. Those who work the afternoon shift are responsible for making  and serving food.

The students develop leadership skills and professionalism, assets  that  are needed for a successful career in the hospitality and culinary  industries.

Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Career and Technical  Education Caucus, programs like this one at Clearfield County Technical  School are vital for helping students be prepared for the workforce.
