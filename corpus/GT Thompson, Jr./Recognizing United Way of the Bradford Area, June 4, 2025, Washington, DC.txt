Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  United Way of the Bradford Area as they celebrate 100 years of  dedicated service to our community.

Since 1925, the United Way chapter has been a driving force in  improving lives across McKean and Potter Counties.

From supporting food pantries and emergency shelters to investing in  youth mentorship, mental health resources, and financial literacy  programs, they have touched every corner of our community. Their  commitment to education, health, and financial stability ensures that  families in need are never alone.

The United Way brings people together, nonprofits, businesses,  volunteers, and donors, with the common goal to improve lives by  mobilizing the caring power of communities worldwide to advance a  common good.

They have proven time and time again that when a community unites,  anything is possible.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the staff; the board members; the partner  agencies; and countless volunteers for their compassion, leadership,  and hard work  which have made our region a better place to live, work, and raise a  family.

Congratulations to the United Way of the Bradford Area on a century  of service.
