Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, September is National  Suicide Prevention Month, and I rise today during National Suicide  Prevention Week to raise awareness and promote hope.

Suicide affects millions of people every year, yet too many struggle  in silence. Suicidal thoughts can affect anyone, regardless of age. It  is among the leading causes of death in the United States.

Mental health professionals, advocacy organizations, survivors, and  allies take this month to combat the stigma of discussing mental health  and connect those with suicidal thoughts to a network of professional  resources.

There is no single cause of suicide, but suicide risk increases when  several health factors and life stressors converge to create an  experience of hopelessness and despair.

Mr. Speaker, suicide is preventable. Increasing access to crisis  resources saves lives. Mental and behavioral health research saves  lives. Ending the stigma surrounding suicide saves lives.

Prioritizing self-care is a vital way to support mental well-being  and reduce the risk of suicide. National Suicide Prevention Month  reminds us that silence can cost lives, and conversation can save them.  Start a conversation today.
