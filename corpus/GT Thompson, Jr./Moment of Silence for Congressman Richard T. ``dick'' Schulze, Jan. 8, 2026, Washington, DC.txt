Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, we rise today in memory of  Congressman Richard T. ``Dick'' Schulze, who died on December 23 at the  age of 96.

Congressman Schulze represented the Philadelphia suburbs from 1975 to  1993 in the people's House. He was the driving force behind designating  historic Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, a national park.

Dick was the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee and  twice chaired the Republican Study Committee. He also served as  chairman of the National Prayer Breakfast. President Ronald Reagan  appointed Congressman Schulze to the Presidential Advisory Committee on  Federalism, an honor that Dick deeply valued.

Dick's lifelong interest in conservation and wildlife issues led him  to found the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus and Foundation in 1989.  President George H.W. Bush would later appoint him to serve on the  National Fish and Wildlife Board.

Mr. Speaker, for 18 distinguished years, Congressman Schulze served  in the House of Representatives. He was known for being a fair-minded,  commonsense legislator who worked with Members on both sides of the  aisle.

Funeral services will take place on Saturday in Malvern,  Pennsylvania. Our thoughts are with his wife of 33 years, Nancy, his  four children, and all of his family.

May God bless Congressman Dick Schulze.
