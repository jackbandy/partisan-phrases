American Red Cross Founding Day


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of  American Red Cross Founder's Day. Today, we recognize an institution  that has been a pillar of compassion and service for over 140 years.

Founded by Clara Barton in 1881, the American Red Cross has answered  the call to serve on battlefields, after natural disasters, and in our  local communities. From its earliest days, it has brought comfort and  relief to those facing life's most difficult moments.

Today, the Red Cross continues that legacy by delivering disaster  relief, supporting military families, and offering health and safety  training. They run one of the world's largest blood donation networks,  supplying more than 40 percent of our Nation's blood products.

Every 2 seconds, someone in the U.S. needs blood. Yet only a small  percentage of eligible donors give. That is why on this founder's day,  I encourage every eligible American to consider donating blood or  plasma. That generosity could mean a second chance at life for someone.

Mr. Speaker, we honor the Red Cross' enduring mission today and every  day.
