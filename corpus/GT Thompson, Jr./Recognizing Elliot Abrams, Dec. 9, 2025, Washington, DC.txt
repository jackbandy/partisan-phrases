Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Elliot Abrams for 42 years of dedicated service to the residents of  Patton Township, Pennsylvania.

Elliot was first elected township supervisor in 1980, after service  on both the Patton Township Sign and Review Board and the Planning  Commission. Elliot has a long history of service to Patton Township and  to the entire Centre region

For more than 50 years, Elliot delivered the weather report as chief  forecaster and senior vice president of AccuWeather. He was first hired  at AccuWeather in 1967. In 1971, Elliot graduated from Penn State  University with both a bachelor's and a master's degree in meteorology.

Elliot holds the title of certified consulting meteorologist and the  AMS Seal of Approval for both radio and television from the American  Meteorological Society. He is one of only a few living individuals to  earn this distinction.

Mr. Speaker, Elliot has dedicated his life in service to the Centre  region both on and off air, and he will formally retire from the Patton  Township Board of Supervisors at the end of this year.

Mr. Speaker, I wish him all the best.
