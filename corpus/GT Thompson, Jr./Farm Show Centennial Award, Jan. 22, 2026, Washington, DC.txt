Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  two families that were awarded Century Farm status at the Pennsylvania  Farm Show last week.

Agriculture has a long history in the Commonwealth and has been one  of the State's first industries. For the prosperity of the State, it is  important to preserve these farms and pass them to the next generation.

Pennsylvania leads the Nation in the number of preserved farms, and  the Century and Bicentennial Farm programs recognize the commitment and  hard work that these families have endured to keep their farms in  production.

This year, two families from Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District were presented with the Century Farm status.

Jeremiah Keck is a resident of DuBois, and the Keck Family Farm dates  back to 1860. Their farm and barn were built in 1931 and are still  used. Some historical photos of their farm are preserved in the Library  of Congress. Their farm is one of the 40 Century Farms in Clearfield  County.

Scott and Cheryl Kinter, from Smicksburg, have farmed almost 100  acres of land since 1867. Indiana County has 56 Century Farms.

Mr. Speaker, I thank these families for their hard work and their  dedication to the agriculture industry.
