Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  March as national Red Cross Month.

Since its founding in 1881, the Red Cross has played a vital role in  supporting our communities by providing disaster relief, emergency  assistance, and critical health services.

One of the Red Cross' most essential initiatives is its nationwide  blood donation program. Today, this program remains a cornerstone of  public health, supplying more than 40 percent of the Nation's blood  products, yet the need for donation remains urgent.

Every 2 seconds, someone in the United States requires a blood  transfusion. However, less than 38 percent of the population is  eligible to donate, and only 3 percent of those eligible give blood  annually. The critical need for blood and the lifesaving potential that  comes with a donation cannot be overstated.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage all healthy Americans to consider giving  blood or plasma. A single act of generosity can make all the difference  for someone in need.
