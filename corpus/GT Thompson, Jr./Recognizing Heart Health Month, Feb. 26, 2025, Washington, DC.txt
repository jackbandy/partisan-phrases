Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Heart  Health Month.

Heart Health Month is a time to raise awareness about the importance  of cardiovascular health and the steps that we can take to protect our  hearts. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United  States, affecting millions of Americans each year.

The good news is that many heart conditions are preventable through  small everyday choices. Taking care of our hearts doesn't require  drastic changes. It is about simple, constant, consistent habits:  staying active, eating a balanced diet, managing stress, and keeping up  with regular checkups.

Beyond personal choices, Heart Health Month is also a reminder to  check in on our loved ones. Encourage family and friends to prioritize  their heart health by scheduling a doctor's visit or finding ways to  stay active together.

Mr. Speaker, I recognize this month as a chance to educate, motivate,  and take actions because a healthy heart means a healthier, longer life  for all of us.
