Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize  National Vietnam War Veterans Day, a time to honor the brave men and  women who served. This past Saturday, we marked the National Vietnam  War Veterans Day.

Mr. Speaker, 52 years ago, on March 29, 1973, the last U.S. combat  troops departed Vietnam, marking the end of direct U.S. involvement.  Yet, for too many of those who returned home, there were no parades, no  celebrations, only silence where gratitude should have been. Despite  this, they carried the burden of their service with dignity.

Many were drafted, but all answered the call with honor and  distinction. They not only served with valor but also took it upon  themselves to ensure their sacrifice would never be forgotten.

The Vietnam Veterans War Memorial in Washington, D.C., was built  entirely through private donations, a testament to their dedication to  one another and to the 2.7 million servicemembers who served in  Vietnam.

Mr. Speaker, we all know someone who served in Vietnam. They are our  friends, our family, our neighbors. It is long overdue that we salute  them, but it is never too late to show our gratitude. May God bless our  Vietnam war veterans today and always, and welcome home.
