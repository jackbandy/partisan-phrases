Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Kendra Aucker, president and CEO of the WellSpan Evangelical Community  Hospital in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Kendra retired earlier this month  after 30 years of dedicated service.

Kendra began her career at Evangelical Community Hospital in the  early 1990s. Kendra left the hospital for a position at Capital Blue  Cross, but returned in 1999, and stayed there ever since. She was  appointed president and CEO of the hospital in 2015.

Throughout her career, Kendra has worked to grow Evangelical  Community Hospital. Some of her achievements include the opening of the  ambulatory surgical center and urgent care, the expansion of specialty  care units, and a cardiovascular expansion project.

Kendra is the fourth president and CEO in the hospital's 100 years.  Throughout her career, she has seen many changes and was pivotal in  helping the hospital successfully navigate the COVID-19 virus.

Mr. Speaker, Kendra has dedicated her career to growing the WellSpan  Evangelical Community Hospital and helping others. I wish Kendra the  best and thank her for her years of service.
