Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Cameron Elk Suicide Prevention Task Force for  receiving the Program of the Year award from the Pennsylvania Office of  Rural Health.

The award recognizes an outstanding health program in a rural  community that uses unique, creative, and innovative approaches to  increase access to healthcare services and improve community health  outcomes.

The task force addressed this need by designing 30,000 locally  manufactured 988 Lifeline challenge coins; distributing 500 copies of  the book ``988/End the Stigmas,'' designed by local artist and mental  health advocate John Schlimm; and installing a digital billboard on the  Elk County highway route that reaches thousands of vehicles daily.

Mr. Speaker, by bringing attention to mental health, we can help  those affected seek and receive the care they need. I applaud the  Cameron Elk Suicide Prevention Task Force for its innovative approach  to educating high-risk communities and saving lives.
