Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the 60th anniversary of the Armstrong County Community Action  Partnership.

For six decades, ACCAP has been a cornerstone of our community,  dedicated to empowering individuals and families, promoting self- sufficiency, and improving the quality of life for so many.

Since its founding, ACCAP has provided essential services, ranging  from housing assistance and food programs to transportation and early  childhood literacy initiatives, such as Dolly Parton's Imagination  Library. These programs create pathways to brighter, more stable  futures.

This anniversary is not just a reflection on the past but a  celebration of what is to come.

As part of this milestone, ACCAP is launching a monthlong  celebration, including the placement of donation boxes throughout  Armstrong County. This is a wonderful opportunity for all of us to give  back and to ensure that ACCAP's vital work continues for generations to  come.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the Armstrong County Community Action  Partnership for their unwavering commitment to our community and wish  them many more years of service, support, and success.
