Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Read  Across America Week. On Sunday, we kicked off Read Across America Day,  marking the start of National Reading Month.

Each March, teachers, students, parents, librarians, and more all  acknowledge the importance of literacy and reading for all Americans.

For more than 20 years, Read Across America has been a nationwide  tradition, held annually on March 2 in honor of Dr. Seuss' birthday.  Across the country, thousands of schools, libraries, and community  centers bring young people together to experience the magic of books.  This celebration fosters a lifelong love of reading and reminds  students that, with every page turned, they can explore new worlds and  expand their horizons.

The message is clear, though: Through books, you can do anything and  go anywhere.

Mr. Speaker, I join President Trump in committing to instilling a  love for reading among all of our Nation's youth and recognizing this  special occasion.

As Dr. Seuss wisely said: ``The more that you read, the more things  you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.''
