Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Susquehanna Regional Emergency Medical Service, which recently  received the 2025 Dick Ferneau Career EMS Service of the Year Award.

This is one of the top national awards in emergency medical services  and highlights organizations that exemplify outstanding care,  innovation, and commitment to the people who they serve.

The Susquehanna Regional EMS covers a 3,000-square-mile region  covering townships across four counties. Their EMS has a team of over  170 EMTs and responds to over 20,000 calls annually.

Susquehanna Regional EMS is dedicated to serving the community and  has worked to ensure that patients beyond the hospital are protected.  The service has donated over 100 AEDs to various counties and has  helped to train residents in critical lifesaving skills.

Representatives from Susquehanna Regional EMS will accept the award  on stage at the EMS World Exposition in Indianapolis, Indiana, later  this year.

Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the care that the Susquehanna Regional  EMS provides for the community and for all of the workers who are  committed to serving others.
