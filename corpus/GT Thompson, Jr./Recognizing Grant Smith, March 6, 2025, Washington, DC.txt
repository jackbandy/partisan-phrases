Recognizing Grant Smith


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688646/recognizing-grant-smith


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  an instrumental partner in bringing about change to the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program.

Grant Smith, deputy director of the Office of Federal Affairs at the  Drug Policy Alliance, works tirelessly to promote policies that reduce  instances of recidivism among those formerly incarcerated.

However, today my words are less about the policies and more about  the man who spent the last many years fighting for them.

Before joining the Drug Policy Alliance, Grant served as a victim  services advocate with the Federal Court Services and Offender  Supervision Agency right here in the District of Columbia.

Grant has spent his young life thinking about others and finding ways  to help elevate their issues.

Now, Mr. Speaker, I ask that we lift Grant up in our hearts, our  minds, and our prayers. We recently learned that Grant is receiving  hospice care, and I want him, his family, and all who know him to  understood his impact. He roamed the Halls of Congress, indifferent to  politics, to make sure the  voiceless were heard and reflected in our policymaking.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Grant for his work, which has inspired so many,  including myself.

God bless.
