Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and congratulate the Leechburg Rotary Club on an incredible milestone,  100 years of dedicated service to their community.

Since receiving their charter in 1925, the Leechburg Rotary has been  a pillar of civic engagement, compassion, and leadership in Armstrong  County.

From their very first project of placing Bibles in hotel rooms to  helping pave Canal Street, building a new bridge over the Kiskiminetas  River, and championing the creation of a high school band in the 1930s,  the Leechburg Rotary has always stepped up to improve life for their  neighbors.

Whether it is supporting veterans or assisting children with  disabilities or flipping pancakes for a good cause, generations after  generations of Rotarians have kept the spirit of service alive.

The Leechburg Rotary Club has helped build more than infrastructure.  They built a sense of community, and for that we are grateful.

Mr. Speaker, I again congratulate Leechburg Rotary on a century of  service.
