Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of National Homeownership Month, a time to celebrate the  cornerstone of the American Dream.

For generations, owning a home has symbolized stability,  independence, and opportunity. It strengthens families, builds  communities, and lays the foundation for long-term financial security.

Yet, today, that dream feels out of reach for too many, especially  first-time buyers, young families, and those in rural and working-class  communities. Rising interest rates, limited housing supplies, and  increasing costs are making it harder for Americans to put down roots.

That is why we must work together across the aisle to support  policies to expand access to affordable housing, invest in  infrastructure, and reduce regulatory barriers that drive up costs.

Homeownership shouldn't be a luxury. It should be an achievable goal  for every hardworking American.
