Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  a major milestone in Centre County: the graduation of the 500th first  responder from the Centre County Crisis Intervention Team Training  Program.

Since 2011, this initiative has brought together law enforcement,  EMS, corrections officers, and mental health professionals for 40 hours  of specialized training.

These first responders are now better equipped to recognize mental  health crises, use deescalation techniques, and connect individuals  with appropriate care.

Prior to my time serving in Congress, I spent decades as a volunteer  firefighter and cross-trained as an EMT. I recognize and value the  commitment these individuals have to their communities and understand  firsthand the vital role that they play in ensuring public health and  safety.

These graduates are more than professionals. They are pillars in our  community, working each day to ensure public safety with compassion and  understanding.

Mr. Speaker, I commend the Centre County CIT team for their  dedication and congratulate all 500 graduates for their service to our  community.
