Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Teach Ag Day.

National Teach Ag Day celebrates school-based agricultural education.  Today we share the importance and effectiveness of ag education in the  United States and encourage students to consider careers as  agricultural educators.

Mr. Speaker, our ag educators are responsible for cultivating and  inspiring the next generation of agricultural leaders. They prepare  students to be problem solvers, leaders, entrepreneurs, and more. This  happens in  the classroom with extension programs or with groups like FFA or 4-H.

By recognizing our agricultural educators, we can ensure our students  have knowledge and exposure to all the opportunities the agriculture  sector has to offer.

Mr. Speaker, I thank all the ag teachers and volunteers across the  country who help propel students into meaningful careers that support  our Nation's farmers, ranchers, foresters, and producers.
