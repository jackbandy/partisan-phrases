Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Central Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce as it celebrates its 120th  anniversary.

In 1905, the chamber was founded as the Milton Board of Trade. Over  the last 120 years, the chamber has grown and expanded its reach and  membership into Columbia, Montour, Northumberland, Snyder, and Union  Counties, and 120 years later, the mission of  the chamber remains the same as when it was founded: ``To be the  partner of choice to enable economic and business development by  partnering with businesses, schools, communities, and individuals in  Central Pennsylvania.''

As a proud member of the chamber, I recognize its vital role in  driving regional economic growth, fostering job creation, and  supporting businesses of all sizes as they innovate and invest in  America's future.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the board members, staff, membership, and  partners who have worked together to promote and improve our region.  They have fostered a commitment to free enterprise that enables our  local communities to unlock their true economic potential.

I congratulate the chamber on this milestone occasion.
