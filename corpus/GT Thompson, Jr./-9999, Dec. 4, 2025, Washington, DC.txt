Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the 50th anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education  Act, IDEA, which mandated that every child with a disability in America  should have access to a high-quality public education.

When Congress passed IDEA in 1975, it was a landmark step toward  educational equity. It opened classroom doors to ensure that every  child with a disability could grow, learn, and succeed at school. The  legislation expanded opportunities for millions of students with  disabilities, helping them reach their full potential.

Unfortunately, before 1975, students with disabilities had long been  denied access to public education, but IDEA transformed the public  school experience for students with disabilities and their families.

Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation to our students in this country.  Thanks to IDEA, our education system is working to serve the needs of  every student in America.

This important milestone shows how far we have come in educating  students with disabilities, and the legacy of this landmark legislation  means a brighter future for all.
