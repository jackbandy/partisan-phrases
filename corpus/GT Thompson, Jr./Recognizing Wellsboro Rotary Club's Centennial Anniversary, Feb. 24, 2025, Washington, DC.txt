Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the  Wellsboro Rotary Club's centennial anniversary.

For a century, the Wellsboro Rotary Club provided unwavering,  dedicated service to the community.

The men and women of the Wellsboro Rotary are guided by The Four-Way  Test, which is as follows: Of the things we think, say, or do:

Is it the truth?

Is it fair to all concerned?

Will it build goodwill and better friendships?

Will it be beneficial to all concerned?

These guiding principles are the foundation of the Wellsboro Rotary  Club's work, shaping a century of service that has left a mark on  Wellsboro and the surrounding communities.

Their impact is evident, from recognizing outstanding students and  supporting local charities to installing bicycle service stations and  funding scholarships.

At its core, Rotary is about service above self. It is about bringing  people together, regardless of background, to make the world a better  place.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Wellsboro Rotary Club for its  contributions to the community and congratulate these volunteers on 100  years of making a difference.
