Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy  heart to share a few words about my dear friend, Congressman Doug  LaMalfa.

Doug was a husband, a father, and a fourth-generation rice farmer. He  dedicated more than 20 years to public service, both in this House and  in the California State Legislature.

Doug was a giant in both stature and character. After meeting Doug,  you couldn't help being struck by his kindness and gentle manner. He  had a reputation as an affable colleague, a principled legislator, a  fierce advocate for  rural America, and one heck of a muscle car driver, which I experienced  firsthand. All of them rang true.

Doug was an expert on farming, forestry, and water issues. He chaired  the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Forestry and Horticulture, and he  was chairman of the Western Caucus.

We traveled the country together, coast to coast, north to south,  meeting with men and women who feed this great country. They are  memories I will always treasure. He was supposed to be with me in  Pennsylvania this weekend. His presence will be sorely missed.

In a town full of self-important figures, Doug was authentically  normal. I will certainly miss his wisdom, his sense of humor, and  incredible friendship. I turned the tables on Doug when it came to  nicknames. I affectionately named him the ``Governor of Jefferson,''  and he eagerly accepted that.

Doug was a man of great faith, and I find comfort in knowing he was  welcomed into the arms of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Rest easy,  Brother. We will take it from here.
