Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Lycoming County Sheriff Mark Lusk, who retired Monday after 50 years of  outstanding community service.

Mark was elected as Lycoming County sheriff in 2009 and served in  this role for four consecutive terms. Over his 50-year career, Mark has  held a variety of positions, including patrolman, criminal  investigator, corporal, chief of police, and deputy coroner.

Mark's leadership has been pivotal, and he was responsible for many  rescue operations when the county experienced major floods.

Beyond his role as sheriff, Mark has volunteered for the Old Lycoming  Township Volunteer Fire Company for 45 years. He has also worked  alongside the local VFW and American Legion.

Mark has received various awards for his leadership over his career.  In 2007, he was recognized by the Lycoming County Department of Public  Safety and the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives.

Mr. Speaker, Mark has dedicated his career to serving the community  and answering the call of those in need. I thank him for his service,  and I wish him the very best.
