Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  eight students from the Central Middle School and High School who  performed in December at the ReliaQuest Bowl in Tampa Bay, Florida.

The Central Mountain Middle School and High School twirlers were  among the 481 performers present during the pregame show and joined  other high school bands during the halftime performance. The students  performed in front of an estimated 35,000 fans in Raymond James  Stadium, the home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The twirlers were invited to participate in the game day programming  through the National Youth Dance and Twirling Program. Stephanie Ford,  the Central Mountain High School twirling coach, provided choreography  for the twirlers. Stephanie has been the high school and middle school  coach for 11 years and was pivotal in making and helping the students  learn the choreography ahead of the performance.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Central Mountain Middle School and  High School twirlers on this fantastic achievement. I thank them for  representing Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District on a national  stage.
