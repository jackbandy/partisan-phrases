Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the UPMC Hillman Cancer Centers in north central Pennsylvania. The UPMC  Hillman Cancer Centers in Coudersport, Wellsboro, and Williamsport  earned national recognition for their high-quality patient care.

The Quality Oncology Practice Initiative, also known as the QOPI  Certification, is a 3-year certificate program that recognizes  hospitals for their quality care and patient safety. This prestigious  certificate is awarded to less than 300 outpatient oncology practices  across the Nation.

To meet the high standards of the certificate, the hospital's patient  care process and chemotherapy standards are evaluated.

The certification program was launched in 2010 and reinforces  hospitals' dedication to quality cancer care, including treatment  planning and patient monitoring.

UPMC Hillman is the only nationally recognized cancer center in  western Pennsylvania. The three north central Pennsylvania cancer  centers see almost 40,000 patients a year and serve communities in  Potter, Lycoming, and Tioga Counties.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the doctors, nurses, and staff who work  tirelessly to ensure that every patient receives the best care  possible.
