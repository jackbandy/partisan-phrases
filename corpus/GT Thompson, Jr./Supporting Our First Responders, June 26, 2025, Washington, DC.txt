Supporting Our First Responders


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of the EMS Counts Act, a bipartisan, commonsense solution to a  critical and longstanding oversight in how we value our first  responders.

Prior to serving in Congress, I spent decades as a volunteer  firefighter and EMT. I recognize and value the commitment these  individuals have to their communities.

Currently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics fails to count firefighter  EMTs and firefighter paramedics as part of the EMS workforce, which  skews the data, masks staffing shortages, complicates funding  decisions, and hinders emergency preparedness.

Correcting outdated classifications is important because without an  accurate count of the number of EMTs, paramedics, and other emergency  service providers, it creates a challenge to adequately meet the health  and safety needs of our communities.

Accurate workforce data is not just numbers. It is the foundation for  equitable funding, targeted training, disaster responsiveness, and  enhanced workplace safety. It empowers us to stand behind the men and  women who respond to more than 22 million emergencies each year.

Mr. Speaker, passing the EMS Counts Act is a decisive step toward  recognizing and strengthening this indispensable part of our public  safety infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to join me in support.
