Recognizing Centre Safe


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693919/recognizing-centre-safe


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Centre Safe which celebrates 50 years of providing confidential and  professional services for victims and survivors of domestic, dating,  and sexual violence.

Centre Safe began as a grassroots effort in 1975 as the Centre County  Women's Resource Center. Since then, it has grown from a one-room  operation in State College to three locations which are the  administrative offices and Sylvia Stein Shelter in State College, the  counseling and legal advocacy satellite office in Bellefonte, and the  Child Access Center in Bellefonte.

While Centre Safe began as an agency by women, for women, it works to  support all survivors and victims. It offers a 24-hour crisis hotline,  emergency shelter, crisis counseling, legal advocacy, legal  representation, and transitional housing.

Centre Safe also works to address violence before it begins by  educating children and youth about healthy relationships.

Mr. Speaker, domestic violence has no place in American society.  Victims often feel that they have nowhere to turn. For the last 50  years, Centre Safe has been a safe place for those who need support in  times of crisis. For that, we are grateful.
