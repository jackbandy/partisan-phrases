Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of  National Teacher Appreciation Week.

This week, we thank extraordinary educators who shape the next  generation. Across America, communities are celebrating teachers not  just as instructors but as mentors, leaders, and role models.

Every one of us can recall a teacher who made a lasting impact. For  many, it was someone who believed in us before we believed in  ourselves. Teachers inspire curiosity, nurture dreams, and help  students persevere through challenges, both academic and personal.  Their work is vital, and their influence extends beyond the classroom.

This year, Pennsylvania has special reason to celebrate. Ashlie  Crosson, an English teacher of Mifflin County High School, has been  named the 2025 National Teacher of the Year. A first-generation college  student, Ms. Crosson earned degrees from Susquehanna University and  Penn State and previously taught in Bellefonte, near my hometown.

Her dedication, especially through her journalism program, has shaped  students into future writers, editors, and leaders.

Madam Speaker, I congratulate Ms. Crosson and thank all educators for  their dedication to helping our students succeed.
