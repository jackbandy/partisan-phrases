Welcoming Penn State Lion Caucus to Capitol Hill


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome  the Penn State Lion Caucus to Capitol Hill.

Lion Caucus is a university-affiliated student organization connected  to the Office of Government and Community Relations. Lion Caucus  promotes the official message and positive impact of Penn State  University to local, State, and Federal elected officials. It also  educates students about legislation and policies that impact the  university and students. Each year, Lion Caucus organizes and executes  Capital Day, Penn State's annual State advocacy event.

The organization also hosts seminars for students across campus,  holds meetings in Harrisburg with legislators and lobbyists, and  welcomes elected officials to University Park.

Lion Caucus is made up of a diverse group of undergraduate and  graduate students from any background or major.

As a graduate of Penn State, I am proud of these students for  devoting their time and resources to educating and advocating for their  fellow students, promoting civic engagement, and showcasing the Penn  State community--We Are.
