Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Celebrate Community Week.

As co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional Service Organization  Caucus, Congressman   Jimmy Panetta and I introduced a resolution to  designate the week of September 14 through September 20 as Celebrate  Community Week, where we honor the efforts of local service  organizations across the country.

The resolution recognizes the role of service organizations in  promoting humanitarian assistance, while also showing our youth the  value of giving back.

We specifically applaud Kiwanis International, Lions Clubs  International, Optimist International, and Rotary International for  encouraging and promoting community service and humanitarian assistance  through their local chapters.

The Celebrate Community Week resolution highlights the critical work  of our community service organizations.

Mr. Speaker, volunteer service is the cornerstone of a successful,  strong, and healthy community, and it is an important staple of  American life.

Mr. Speaker, I commend our community service organizations for  everything they do to help our communities flourish.
