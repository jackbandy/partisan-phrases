Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the One Big Beautiful Bill  Act marks the most significant investment in our farm economy in  decades and delivers the most sweeping reforms to SNAP since the  program's creation.

We are saving nearly $200 billion by restoring integrity to SNAP,  closing loopholes, reinforcing work, and ending unchecked State abuse,  all while preserving the program for the truly vulnerable.

At the same time, we are delivering $120 billion in deficit reduction  and saving 2 million family farms from the death tax. We strengthen the  farm safety net; invest in trade, research, and rural communities; and  help keep ag innovation here in the United States of America, not in  China.

This is a downpayment on the farm bill, and the rest is coming soon.  Make no mistake, this is a generational win for rural America.

I thank Agriculture Committee members for their continued work in  developing and advancing this policy. We are protecting taxpayers,  helping low-income Americans return to work, and securing the future of  American agriculture in our rural communities.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act delivers on President Trump's campaign  promises, and it is a win for the American people.
