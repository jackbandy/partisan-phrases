Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand before  Chairman Hill and support the GENIUS Act. It actually garnered 68  bipartisan votes in the Senate. I appreciate those Senators. They  demonstrated an awareness of the needs of a modern financial sector  here in the United States. I congratulate Chairman Hill and Chairman  Steil and thank them for their work on the stablecoin legislation.

The GENIUS Act represents an important step for this Congress in  establishing the United States as a leader in the digital asset space.

This legislation, together with the market structure bill that we  previously considered, which I have had the honor of cosponsoring with  my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee, will provide  important safeguards around the utility of vital digital assets in the  next generation of global finance.

Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, I intend to submit additional remarks for  the Record to clarify congressional intent on the effect the bill may  have on the ability to list certain derivative products.
