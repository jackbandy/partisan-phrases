Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a  privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.

The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 976

Resolved, That unless otherwise ordered, the hour of daily       meeting of the House shall be 2 p.m. on Mondays; noon on       Tuesdays (or 2 p.m. if no legislative business was conducted       on the preceding Monday); noon on Wednesdays and Thursdays;       and 9 a.m. on all other days of the week.

The resolution was agreed to.

A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
