Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize and  celebrate National FFA Week, an annual tradition that highlights the  contributions of one of our Nation's most impactful youth  organizations.

Last week, from February 15 to 22, we honored the FFA's mission,  achievements, and ongoing work in preparing future generations of  agricultural leaders.

Founded in 1928, the National FFA Organization has grown into a  dynamic force in agriculture, education, leadership development, and  career preparedness.

With over 1 million members and chapters in all 50 States, Puerto  Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, FFA stands as a pillar of strength  for young men and women pursuing careers in agriculture, agribusiness,  and related fields.

FFA is a transformative experience that instills a sense of  responsibility, leadership, and service in its members. The  agricultural education programs offered through FFA equip students with  the technical skills, scientific knowledge, and problem-solving  abilities necessary to meet the challenges of feeding, clothing, and  fueling our Nation.

Access to agricultural education is critical not only for our rural  communities but for the entire country.

Agriculture is the backbone of our economy. As I often say, food  security is national security, and investing in the next generation of  producers ensures that there is food on our tables, clothes on our  backs, and fuel in our vehicles. However, beyond that, agriculture is  science, technology, and innovation. Its cutting-edge advancements will  drive the future of food production and environmental stewardship.

The blue FFA jacket is more than just a uniform. It symbolizes hard  work, commitment, and leadership. The young men and women who wear it  today are tomorrow's farmers, veterinarians, researchers, policymakers,  and business leaders.

Their dedication to agricultural excellence and community service  exemplifies the very best of American values. The impact of FFA extends  far beyond agriculture. The leadership training, teamwork, and problem- solving skills that members develop prepare them for a wide range of  careers and civic responsibilities.

Many former FFA members have gone on to serve in Congress, lead  Fortune 500 companies, and contribute meaningfully to their local  communities, including the recently confirmed U.S. Secretary of  Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, the first Secretary of Agriculture to have  served as a State FFA officer.

As chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I understand the  vital importance of shaping the next generation of farmers, ranchers,  and producers. Through education and hands-on experiences, FFA  continues to make a lasting impact on the agriculture industry.

National FFA Week is also an opportunity to recognize the educators,  advisers, and mentors who guide these young leaders, as well as the  families and communities that support them. Their investment in  agricultural education ensures that future generations will continue to  innovate, adapt, and lead.

Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to celebrate the past successes of FFA  while also looking ahead to the incredible contributions that future  FFA leaders will make. Their passion, knowledge, and dedication give us  confidence in the future of American agriculture and the prosperity of  our Nation.
