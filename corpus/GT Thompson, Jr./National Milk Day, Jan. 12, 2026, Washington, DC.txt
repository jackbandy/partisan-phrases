National Milk Day


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Milk Day, which we celebrated yesterday.

National Milk Day dates back to January 11, 1878, to commemorate when  milk was first delivered in glass bottles.

Millions of Americans drink milk. It is a delicious and refreshing  beverage that provides key nutrients like calcium, potassium, and  vitamins A and D in every glass. Milk provides 13 essential nutrients,  which is especially important for growing children.

This is one of the reasons why my Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act is  so important. The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act will soon be signed  into law this week. It allows schools to offer flavored and unflavored  whole and 2 percent milk options.

National Milk Day allows us to recognize the many dairy farms across  the country. In my home State of Pennsylvania, the dairy industry  contributes $14.7 billion to the State's economy.

Mr. Speaker, I thank our American dairy farmers who work around the  clock to provide nutritious and delicious milk to all Americans.

Happy National Milk Day.
