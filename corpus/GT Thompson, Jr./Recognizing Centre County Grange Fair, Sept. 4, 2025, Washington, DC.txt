Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Centre County Grange Fair.

For more than 150 years, Centre County has welcomed visitors from  across the world to the Grange Fair. The Grange Fair has served as a  home away from home for families who, for a period of over a week, live  in a thousand tents and 1,500 recreational vehicles. It is a testament  to our unique and enduring spirit that the Grange Fair stands as the  only remaining tenting fair in the Nation.

This weeklong celebration encompasses the very best of our rural  communities, from concerts to motorsports and craft shows to animal  exhibits. The charm and nostalgia are everywhere.

With more than 200,000 visitors coming to Centre County every year,  attendees immerse themselves in the rich traditions this fair provides.

It is more than just a weeklong fair. It celebrates Pennsylvania  agriculture. This year, I was honored to be named ``friend of the  fair'' for my work on behalf of our ag community.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the Grange for its dedication to supporting  rural America and all the volunteers for making the Grange Fair the  best days of the summer.
