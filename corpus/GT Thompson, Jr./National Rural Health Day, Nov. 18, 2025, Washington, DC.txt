National Rural Health Day


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Thursday marks National  Rural Health Day.

Nearly 60 million Americans live in rural areas, and they too often  encounter limited access to primary care specialists and health  services. These gaps are worsened by transportation barriers, doctor  shortages, and hospital closures. These challenges don't just affect  individuals; they affect entire families and communities.

Before coming to Congress, I spent nearly 30 years in the nonprofit  healthcare field, assisting those with life-changing diseases and  disabilities.

Most of my congressional district is rural, and many constituents  must drive long distances to get the care that they need. Some do not  have broadband access. Some have limited transportation options.  Thankfully, telehealth has added tremendous reach and value to  communities across the country.

That is why I reintroduced the bipartisan Helping Ensure Access to  Local TeleHealth Act, or the HEALTH Act, which cuts red tape and allows  community health centers and rural health clinics to provide telehealth  services to their patients. Telehealth makes life simpler for rural and  underserved communities, especially for our seniors. Telehealth is an  essential part of healthcare that expands access to care for all  Americans, regardless of location.
