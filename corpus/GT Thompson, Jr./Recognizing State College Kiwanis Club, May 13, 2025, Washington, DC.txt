Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the State College Kiwanis Club for reaching a remarkable  milestone, 100 years of service to children and families in our  community.

Since 1925, the club has lived out Kiwanis International's mission of  improving the world one child and one community at a time.

Children are our future, and too many face challenges they cannot  overcome alone. It is our responsibility as a community to step in, and  the State College Kiwanis has done just that.

Through initiatives like its annual blueberry sale, the club provides  over $30,000 in scholarships and grants each year. Over the past  century, they have raised more than $1 million to support organizations  such as Centre Volunteers in Medicine, the Tides Program, the Jana  Marie Foundation, and Centre Safe.

Their impact goes far beyond fundraising. Whether promoting literacy,  supporting youth mental health, or investing in dental care, their work  ensures our children have the chance to thrive.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the State College Kiwanis Club for a century of  service and wish them continued success for the next 100 years.
