Recognizing Bailey Little


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  Bailey Little, a 2023 Bellefonte High School graduate.

Bailey recently received an American degree from the Future Farmers  of America. Bailey is the first Bellefonte FFA member in nearly two  decades to receive an American degree. She has been an active FFA  member since her freshman year.

The American degree is the highest FFA honor and is given to members  for their dedication to their chapter, leadership, and community  involvement.

To receive an American degree, members must receive their State FFA  degree, be an active member of their chapter for at least 3 years, and  take part in various agricultural education programs.

Bailey's FFA projects included raising beef cattle, dairy cows,  goats, poultry, and rabbits. Along with raising livestock, Bailey is a  small business owner, selling Western jewelry and clothing.  Additionally, Bailey and her fiance raise beef cattle in Centre County.

Mr. Speaker, Bailey should be proud of her accomplishments, and it is  a great example for FFA members in our community. I congratulate Bailey  on receiving the American degree.
