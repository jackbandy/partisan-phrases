Recognizing National Ems Week


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize  National EMS Week.

Since 1974, we have set time aside each year to honor the critical  work of our Nation's emergency medical services professionals. These  brave men and women are often the first line of defense in moments of  crisis, responding to emergencies with speed, skill, and selflessness.

Whether it is an accident on a rural road or a medical emergency in a  busy town center, EMS professionals are there to ensure that help  arrives when it is needed most.

These individuals provide more than just medical assistance. They  offer calm in chaos, hope in despair, and lifesaving care under  pressure. They work long hours, often in physically and emotionally  demanding environments, yet continue to serve with unwavering  dedication.

The job requires technical skills, physical strength, deep  compassion, and a calling to serve others.

EMS providers are vital to maintaining the health and safety of the  public, especially in rural communities like my district, where  resources can be limited and the stakes are high.

As someone who has spent more than three decades on the front lines  as a volunteer firefighter and EMT, I have seen firsthand the  extraordinary courage and commitment of EMS personnel. I have been  privileged to work alongside them during some of the most challenging  moments a person or community can face. I can say with certainty that  these professionals are heroes in every sense of the word.

Here in Pennsylvania, we are especially proud to recognize one of our  own. Chief Fred Ferguson of Moshannon Valley Emergency Medical Services  was recently named the recipient of the 2025 Pennsylvania EMS Educator  of the Year Award. This prestigious honor is awarded to an EMS educator  who has demonstrated excellence in preparing the next generation of  emergency responders.

Chief Ferguson has more than 30 years of experience as a paramedic.  He holds multiple instructor certifications, including basic life  support, pediatric advanced life support, advanced cardiac life  support, Stop the Bleed, and first aid.

Throughout his career, Chief Ferguson has trained thousands of  students, instilling in them the knowledge, skill, and integrity that  the profession demands.

Chief Ferguson's impact extends beyond the classroom. He was recently  appointed EMS Chief at Moshannon Valley EMS, where he continues to lead  with distinction.

In 2019, he was also honored with the Pennsylvania Office of Rural  Health Community Star Award, recognizing his contributions to improving  rural healthcare.

Chief Ferguson holds a bachelor's of science in microbiology from  Penn State University and multiple degrees in emergency medicine,  underscoring his deep commitment to both science and service.

Mr. Speaker, National EMS Week is about more than recognition. It is  about gratitude. It is about coming together as a nation to thank the  EMTs, paramedics, dispatchers, trainers, and supervisors who stand  ready every day and every night and in every corner of this country.

I congratulate Chief Ferguson and thank every EMS professional for  their courage, care, and commitment to saving lives. America is  stronger, safer, and more resilient because of them.
