Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the musical talents of Sorren Morelli. Sorren, a Brookville Area High  School junior, has once again earned the prestigious opportunity to  perform with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

The Student Side-By-Side program is highly competitive, selecting  only the most dedicated and talented student musicians from across the  region. Sorren's invitation back for a second year is a testament to  his exceptional talent on the violin and unwavering commitment to his  craft.

This opportunity is more than just a performance. It is a glimpse  into the life of a professional musician. Over 8 weeks, Sorren  rehearsed and performed with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, gaining  valuable experience. This, no doubt, will shape his bright future in  music education and conducting.

Through his dedication to the Brookfield orchestra, the PMEA  festivals, and the Venango Symphony, Sorren has set an example of what  passion, discipline, and perseverance can achieve.

We congratulate Sorren on this proud accomplishment, and we look  forward to everything his future holds.
