Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  essential legislation that supports our Nation's veterans. We must  ensure that our veterans are cared for and have the resources they need  to thrive so no veteran is left behind.

Currently, too many of our veterans struggle with the difficulties of  transitioning back into civilian life and far too many continue to face  homelessness or housing instability.

The Department of Veterans Affairs created the Grant and Per Diem  program to help address this issue.

Unfortunately, the application process for GPD grants is complex and  burdensome, often discouraging participation from groups that can make  a real difference.

To correct these inefficiencies, I am introducing the bipartisan  Simplifying Veterans Assistance Act, which requires the VA to provide  clear guidance and best practices for organizations applying for GPD  grants.

By simplifying the GPD application process and enhancing  communication between the VA and community organizations, we ensure  that those dedicated to serving our veterans have the necessary tools  and resources to combat veteran homelessness effectively.
