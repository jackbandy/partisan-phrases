United States Army's 250th Birthday


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today ahead of June  14th to celebrate an extraordinary milestone, the United States Army's  250th birthday.

Every year, just a few weeks after Memorial Day, our country  celebrates our Army's birthday. This marks the anniversary in 1775 when  the Continental Congress authorized the establishment of the  Continental Army to defend the 13 American Colonies.

It was the beginning of a force that would go on to secure our  freedom, shape our Nation's history, and stand as a pillar of strength  in times of war and peace.

As the oldest and largest branch of our Armed Forces, the U.S. Army  has played a central role in defending our Nation, upholding our  values, and advancing peace around the globe.

For 250 years, generations of soldiers have answered the call of duty  using the Army's values: loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service,  honor, integrity, and personal courage.

Mr. Speaker, as a proud Army dad, I know the sacrifices made by our  servicemembers and their families.

In Congress, I remain committed to supporting legislation that  strengthens our national defense and honors the men and women who wear  the uniform.

Mr. Speaker, I wish a happy 250th birthday to the United States Army.  May their legacy of service continue for generations to come.
