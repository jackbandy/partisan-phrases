Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the 60th anniversary of the AmeriCorps Seniors Foster Grandparent  Program.

This is one of the oldest, most impactful senior service programs in  the country. Since 1965, foster grandparents, who are volunteers aged  55 and older, have provided consistent support, mentorship, and care to  children and youth.

Through this intergenerational service, they help young people thrive  while strengthening communities.

Foster grandparents volunteer their time to help children through  tutoring, mentoring, and sometimes providing classroom support to  teachers. These grandparents have the ability to help young people in  need learn independence, self-confidence, and social skills.

Mr. Speaker, many of us have fond memories of our own grandparents,  and I am glad that for the past 60 years the foster grandparent program  has helped connect seniors with young people to form these wonderful  relationships.
