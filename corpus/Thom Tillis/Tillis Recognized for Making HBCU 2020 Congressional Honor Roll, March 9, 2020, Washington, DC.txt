Tillis Recognized for Making HBCU 2020 Congressional Honor Roll


Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) was recently recognized at the second annual State of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Address for making the HBCU 2020 Congressional Honor Roll.  

"North Carolina is home to the most HBCUs in the nation, which is why I have made it a priority to advocate and fight for HBCUs to ensure they have the support they need to continue their standard of excellence," said Senator Tillis. "Although we have made great strides for our 11 HBCUs in North Carolina, our work is far from over. This recognition is a huge honor and I look forward to our continued partnership."

This recognition is based on Senator Tillis' advocacy and commitment for HBCUs, including his support of the FUTURE Act. Last year, the U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan amendment to the House-passed FUTURE Act co-sponsored by Senator Tillis to make permanent $255 million in annual funding for HBCUs and MSIs, simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 20 million American families, and streamline income-driven repayment for nearly 8 million borrowers. Senator Tillis was also a co-sponsor of the FAFSA Act that was included in the legislation.

Senator Tillis has been a champion for North Carolina HBCUs. Last month, Tillis participated in a bipartisan panel at the 2020 HBCU Fly-In hosted by Senator Tim Scott (R-SC). The conference allows Presidents and Chancellors of HBCUs to continue the discussion on how to advance opportunities for black youth and participate in an open dialogue around bettering HBCU's and minority-serving institutions (MSI).
