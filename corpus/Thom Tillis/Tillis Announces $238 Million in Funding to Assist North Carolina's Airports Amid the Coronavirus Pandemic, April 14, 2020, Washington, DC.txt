Tillis Announces $238 Million in Funding to Assist North Carolina's Airports Amid the Coronavirus Pandemic


Today, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced the U.S. Department of Transportation is awarding $238.7 million to North Carolina's airports to assist continued operations and save workers' jobs during the coronavirus pandemic. The funding comes from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act that was supported by Senator Tillis.

"North Carolina's airports have seen a dramatic decrease in passenger travel due to COVID-19. This unprecedented travel reduction has drastically impacted airport revenues putting operations and jobs on the line," said Senator Tillis. "The $238 million in CARES Act funding for North Carolina will help ensure airports across the state have the resources necessary to maintain operations and payroll as we continue to work together to get through this crisis."

This funding will support continuing operations and replace lost revenue resulting from the sharp decline in passenger traffic and other airport business due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. The funds are available for airport capital expenditures, airport operating expenses including payroll and utilities, and airport debt payments.
