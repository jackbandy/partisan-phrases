Tillis Applauds President Trump Signing USMCA Trade Agreement Into Law


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) applauded President Trump for signing the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement into law. Senator Tillis has been a strong advocate for passage of the USMCA for the benefits it will provide to North Carolina's economy, creating new opportunities for North Carolina workers, farmers, and small business owners.

"Today is a great day for farmers, small businesses, and workers in North Carolina and across the country," said Senator Tillis. "I want to thank President Trump for continuously pushing to get the bipartisan USMCA across the finish line, and I am proud to have supported this trade agreement that will benefit North Carolinians for years to come."
