Tillis: Passage of the USMCA is a Win for North Carolinians


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) voted to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade deal. Senator Tillis has been a strong advocate for passage of the USMCA for the benefits it will provide to North Carolina's economy, creating new opportunities for North Carolina workers, farmers, and small business owners.

"Today we passed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, or USMCA, with huge bipartisan support," said Senator Tillis. "This is going to be a great opportunity for workers in N.C. and across the country, especially our farmers and small businesses. I'm proud to have supported the USMCA and I'm glad it's heading to the President's desk." 

North Carolina is the ninth-largest agricultural economy in the country, with nearly $90 billion a year in agriculture products. Since 2018, North Carolina has exported $10.5 billion to Canada and Mexico, with $6.7 billion to Canada and $3.8 billion to Mexico.
