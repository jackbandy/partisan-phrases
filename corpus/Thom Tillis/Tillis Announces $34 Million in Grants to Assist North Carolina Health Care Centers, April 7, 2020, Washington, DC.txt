Tillis Announces $34 Million in Grants to Assist North Carolina Health Care Centers


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will award more than $34 million in grants to North Carolina health care centers to assist efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The funding comes from the Phase 3 CARES Act which was supported by Senator Tillis.

"North Carolina's health care centers and workers are on the front lines in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and we must ensure they have the resources they need to assist North Carolinians in need," said Senator Tillis. "The economic stabilization and stimulus legislation I worked to get signed into law will provide these financial resources to North Carolina's health centers that are working around the clock to treat North Carolinians and keep us safe. I will continue to work on a bipartisan basis to push for solutions that help us come together to overcome this national crisis."
