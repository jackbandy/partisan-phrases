Tillis Co-Sponsors Bipartisan Legislation to Protect Seniors with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias from Elder Abuse


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) co-sponsored bipartisan legislation that would protect seniors with dementia from harm and exploitation and ensure that the Department of Justice's elder abuse training materials take into account individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The Promoting Alzheimer's Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse Act, was introduced by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and companion legislation is being introduced in the House by Representatives Ted Deutch (D-FL) and Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA).

Approximately one in 10 seniors aged 60 and older have experienced some form of elder abuse. For people with Alzheimer's and related dementias, the prevalence is much higher, with some estimates putting it at just over 50 percent.

"As a former caregiver to my grandmother with Alzheimer's, I understand firsthand how those battling this horrible disease face a heightened risk of elder abuse and are too often exploited," said Senator Tillis. "I am proud to co-sponsor this bipartisan legislation that would protect this vulnerable population and ensure we are doing whatever we can to prevent elder abuse."

The legislation has been endorsed by the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's Impact Movement (AIM) as well as the bipartisan, 3,000 member Elder Justice Coalition.

Specifically, Promoting Alzheimer's Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse Act would:

Require that the National Elder Justice Coordinator take into account people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias when creating or compiling elder abuse training materials;Instruct DOJ to consult with stakeholders, as appropriate, in developing these materials and to review and update existing materials; andInclude information in DOJ's annual report about where to access the publicly available training materials.The bill builds on the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act, which became law in October 2017 and required DOJ to create training materials to help criminal justice, health care, and social services personnel assess and respond to elder abuse cases.  It also aligns with the latest recommendations from the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, which include disseminating information on abuse of those with dementia and educating law enforcement about interacting with these individuals.
