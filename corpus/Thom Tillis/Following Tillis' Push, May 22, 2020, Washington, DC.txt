Following Tillis' Push, Department of Commerce Awards $80 Million Grant to North Carolina DOT


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) will receive an $80 million grant from the Department of Commerce Federal State Partnership Program. Senator Tillis wrote a letter to DOT Secretary Elaine Chao advocating for the project.

The funds will be used to purchases six locomotives and 13 passenger coaches to replace existing state-owned equipment that are 30 and 50 years old. The project is the second phase of NCDOT's equipment procurement program, building upon a previous Partnership Program award to procure passenger coaches. The equipment will serve Amtrak's Piedmont service between Charlotte and Raleigh, NC. The project will enhance service and support continued growth, including a fourth daily Piedmont round trip planned for 2023. The new fleet will reduce train cancellations and delays, provide consistent and reliable service, improved on-board amenities, as well as meeting all safety and accessibility requirements.

"As the two biggest cities and economic hubs in North Carolina, improving transportation between Charlotte and Raleigh continues to be an important step to create jobs and attract businesses," said Senator Tillis. "I am proud to have advocated for this grant on behalf of North Carolina and will continue to make infrastructure improvement a priority."
