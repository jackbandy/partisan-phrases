I will continue to work to keep North Carolinians up to date and ensure we have the support and assistance we need to combat the coronavirus."

$3.4 billion to assist in procurement of medical supplies for federal and state response efforts; vaccine, therapeutics, and diagnostics research and development; and hospital and health system preparedness;$950 million to go to state, local and tribal governments, with half of the funding being allocated to cities, states and tribes within 30 days of the legislation's enactment;$490 million to provide Medicare beneficiaries with better access to remote/telehealth services.Earlier today, Senator Tillis released a video describing the steps that are being taken to protect North Carolinians.
