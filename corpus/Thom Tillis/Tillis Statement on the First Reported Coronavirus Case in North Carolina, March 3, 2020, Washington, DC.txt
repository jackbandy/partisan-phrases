Tillis Statement on the First Reported Coronavirus Case in North Carolina


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued the following statement on the first reported coronavirus case in North Carolina:

"The health and well-being of North Carolinians is my top priority, and I'm working to make sure Congress comes together on a bipartisan basis to provide billions of dollars in federal assistance to combat the coronavirus and protect North Carolinians. I'm in close communication with Vice President Pence and other federal leaders, and I will do everything I can to continue supporting our state's medical institutions, universities, and health care systems, which are some of the best in the world and have a proven track record in treating infectious diseases."

Yesterday, Senator Tillis sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence on efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus and called on Congress to keep politics out of funding the nation's response efforts. This follows a letter Senator Tillis sent to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper regarding the threat of coronavirus to our servicemembers and military families worldwide on Friday.
