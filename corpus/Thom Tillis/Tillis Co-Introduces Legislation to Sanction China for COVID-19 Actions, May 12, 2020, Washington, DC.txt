Tillis Co-Introduces Legislation to Sanction China for COVID-19 Actions


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) joined Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) in introducing the COVID-19 Accountability Act, legislation that authorizes the President to impose sanctions on China if China fails to cooperate and provide a full accounting of the events leading up to the outbreak of COVID-19.

"The Chinese government engaged in one of the biggest cover-ups in modern history--lying to the world and allowing the spread of COVID-19 outside its borders," said Senator Tillis. "This legislation begins the process of holding the Chinese government accountable for its egregious misconduct."

Under the legislation the President would be required to make a certification to Congress within sixty days that China has:

-Provided a full and complete accounting to any COVID-19 investigation led by the United States, its allies or UN affiliate such as the World Health Organization (WHO).-Closed all operating wet markets that have the potential to expose humans to health risks through the introduction of zoonotic disease into the human population.-Released all Hong Kong pro-democracy advocates that were arrested in the post COVID-19 crackdowns. 

Without certification, the President would be authorized to impose a range of sanctions such as asset freezes, travel bans, visa revocations, restricting United States financial institutions from making loans or underwriting to Chinese businesses, and prohibiting Chinese firms from being listed on American stock exchanges.
