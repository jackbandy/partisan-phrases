Tillis Statement on Vote to Acquit President Trump


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued the following statement on the impeachment vote to acquit President Trump:

"This entire impeachment effort was motivated by partisan politics and a desire to remove the President from office instead of allowing the American people to decide his fate at the ballot box in November. Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats denied the President basic due process rights from the start and ultimately presented a weak case for removal that was rejected by the Senate. The President has been acquitted and we now need to move on. I'm committed to continuing my work to deliver more results for North Carolinians to keep our economy and military strong."
