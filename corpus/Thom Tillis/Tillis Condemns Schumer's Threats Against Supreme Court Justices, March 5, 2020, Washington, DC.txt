Tillis Condemns Schumer's Threats Against Supreme Court Justices


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued the following statement on Minority Leader Schumer's threatening comments about Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.

"Chuck Schumer's threat to Supreme Court Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch that they will "pay the price' and "will not know what hit' them unless they vote the way Democrats want is beyond disgusting and dangerous. This is a stark example of how unhinged Democrats have become as they embrace the extreme ideology and tactics of the far-left. Every Democrat needs to condemn Senator Schumer's remarks and support the rule of law. Anything less than that is unacceptable."
