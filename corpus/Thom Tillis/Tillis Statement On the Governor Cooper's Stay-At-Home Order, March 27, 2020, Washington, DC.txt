Tillis Statement On the Governor Cooper's Stay-At-Home Order


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued the following statement on Governor Cooper's stay-at-home order:

"We are all in this together, and in order to protect the health of North Carolinians and get through this crisis as quickly as possible, we must all do our part to contain community spread over the next several weeks. I've had discussions with Governor Cooper about the challenge of protecting both the physical and economic health of the state, and the Governor made the difficult, but correct decision to issue a statewide stay-at-home order. 

"I'm glad this order allows essential industries to continue their important work while also providing flexibility to North Carolina businesses that are able to practice social distancing and maintain a safe and healthy work environment to protect their employees and the general public."
