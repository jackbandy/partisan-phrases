Tillis Joins Senate Resolution Demanding Speaker Pelosi Transmit the Articles of Impeachment


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) signed on to a Senate Resolution demanding that the Speaker of the House immediately transmit the two Articles of Impeachment against President Trump to the Senate.

The resolution introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) criticizes Speaker Pelosi for claiming "the power to effectively veto a resolution passed by a duly elected majority of the House of Representatives" and notes that the refusal to forward the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is a "gross infringement on the constitutional authority of the Senate to try impeachment."  

"Since the moment Speaker Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry before even reading the transcript between President Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, House Democrats rushed through the process to produce a partisan political outcome," said Senator Tillis. "House Democrats now have buyer's remorse and are refusing to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate because they are embarrassed with the weak case they produced. If Speaker Pelosi really stands by her claim that she is "proud' of the work Democrats did on impeachment, she should stop the political games and allow the Senate to begin the trial."

26 Republican Senators have signed on to the resolution.
