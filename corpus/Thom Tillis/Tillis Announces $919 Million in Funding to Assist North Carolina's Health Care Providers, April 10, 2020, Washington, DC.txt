Tillis Announces $919 Million in Funding to Assist North Carolina's Health Care Providers


Today, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will award $919,171,087 million in grants to 6,906 health care providers and health systems in North Carolina to assist with the coronavirus response.

"North Carolina's health care providers are on the frontlines, working around the clock to combat COVID-19 and we must ensure they have the resources they need," said Senator Tillis. "The first round of funding provides more than $900 million to our health care providers that are keeping us safe, and I will continue to work on a bipartisan basis to get our country through this crisis."

The funding comes from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, that was supported by Senator Tillis. It will support health care-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to coronavirus and ensure uninsured Americans can get the testing and treatment they need without receiving a surprise bill from a provider.

This is the first wave of funding awarded to health care providers from the $100 billion appropriated by the CARES Act. It is being distributed immediately proportionate to providers' share of Medicare fee-for-service reimbursements in 2019. This quick dispersal of funds will provide relief to both providers in coronavirus hotspot areas and those providers who are struggling to keep their doors open due to canceled elective services.
