-Jordan Harris Sheldon, Mooresville Police Department, North Carolina   -Officer Jordan Sheldon was shot and killed while conducting a traffic stop. Officer Sheldon served with the Mooresville Police Department for six years.-Makeem Richtrell Brooks, Northampton County Sheriff's Office, North Carolina   -Deputy Makeem Brooks was killed in a single-vehicle crash while responding to a shots fired call. Deputy Brooks served with the Northampton County Sheriff's Office for six months.

"My heart goes out to the families and colleagues of Officer Sheldon and Deputy Brooks as we honor them along with all the officers who were added to the National Peace Officers Memorial," said Senator Tillis. "We will never forget those who paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect others and keep our communities safe." In 1962, President Kennedy proclaimed May 15th as National Peace Officers Memorial Day and the calendar week in which May 15th falls, as National Police Week. Established by a joint resolution of Congress in 1962, National Police Week pays special recognition to those law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. This year, National Police Week will run from Sunday, May 10th through Saturday, May 16th.
