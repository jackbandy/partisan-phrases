Following Tillis' Bipartisan Push, President Trump Extends Benefits for National Guard Responding to COVID-19


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) applauded President Trump for announcing that he will be extending National Guard Title 32 orders through mid-August.

"As cities began shutting down with the onset of the coronavirus, the National Guard stepped up to provide invaluable service and support to communities across our country," said Senator Tillis. "It's important to remember that this pandemic is not over which is why we must continue to take care of these brave men and women. I will continue my work to support these frontline heroes and I applaud President Trump for hearing our request and taking this necessary action to extend the benefits they deserve."

Last week, Senator Tillis and his colleagues sent a bipartisan letter to President Trump, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Peter Gaynor urging the administration to ensure the National Guard personnel who are serving on the frontlines of the COVID-19 response efforts across the nation receive the federal benefits they have earned, including recommendations for addressing concerns related to the National Guard's federal status, leave, health care, and GI Bill and retirement benefits.

Specifically, the letter requested: 

An extension of the National Guards Title 32 orders, which are currently in place until June 24.An exemption for National Guard members from having to use annual leave to quarantine. The letter also requests that members be able to sell back their leave or roll it over.Members who were activated are provided Transition Assistance Management Program (TAMP) for 180 days after coming off Title 32 orders. The GI Bill and retirement benefits are protected for these members currently serving under Title 32.
