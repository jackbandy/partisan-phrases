Tillis Announces $16.5 Million Grant for North Carolina Public Housing Amid Coronavirus Pandemic


Today, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced a $16,572,122 grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for local housing authorities across North Carolina in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. "North Carolina's housing authorities have been severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic and are in dire need of assistance," said Senator Tillis. "I was proud to support the CARES Act that provides this much-needed assistance so these housing authorities can maintain services and support North Carolinians in need." This funding is made available through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Public Housing Operation Fund, which received additional funding in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) that was supported by Senator Tillis. It will provide North Carolina communities with financial resources to manage and maintain resident services, as well as support and respond to the coronavirus pandemic in public housing.
