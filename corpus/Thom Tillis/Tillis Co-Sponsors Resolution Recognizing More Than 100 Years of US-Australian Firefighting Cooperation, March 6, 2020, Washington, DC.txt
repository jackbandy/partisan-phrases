Tillis Co-Sponsors Resolution Recognizing More Than 100 Years of US-Australian Firefighting Cooperation


This week, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) co-sponsored a bipartisan resolution recognizing the more than 100 years of firefighting cooperation and security assistance between the United States and Australia.

The Senate resolution comes the same week the last brushfires were extinguished in New South Wales, the worst hit jurisdiction of the 2019-2020 Australian brush fire season. Over the course of a grueling and destructive 240 days, more than 300 American firefighters were deployed to Australia on behalf of multiple federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior and the USDA Forest Service through the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC).

"Both the United States and Australia have both battled devasting wildfires in recent years and it's important we recognize the longstanding relationship between our two countries." Said Senator Tillis. "When our west coast needed help, firefighters traveled from Australia to assist. When Australia faced devasting wildfires, the United States proudly sent firefighters, including some from my great state of North Carolina. I am proud to recognize the bravery and sacrifice both of our countries have shown towards each other and look forward to our continued partnership."
