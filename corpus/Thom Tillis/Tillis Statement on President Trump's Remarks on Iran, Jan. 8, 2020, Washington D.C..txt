Tillis Statement on President Trump's Remarks on Iran


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued the following statement on President Trump's remarks on the escalating tensions between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran:

"President Trump made the right decision to order the drone strike eliminating Qasem Soleimani, ridding the world of a murderous terrorist leader and resulting in a strategic American victory. The President's bold decision and strong leadership sent a clear message to Iranian leaders that their continued aggression against American servicemembers and civilians will result in real consequences. The strike on Soleimani acted as a deterrent to de-escalate the situation, an outcome all Americans should embrace."
