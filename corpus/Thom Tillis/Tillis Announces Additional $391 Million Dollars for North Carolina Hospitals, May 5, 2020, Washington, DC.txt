Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will award more than $391 million to North Carolina health care providers who provided care for COVID-19 patients, including high-impact hospitals, rural providers, and those treating low-income and uninsured patients. The allocation for rural providers includes rural acute care general hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs), Rural Health Clinics (RHCs), and Community Health Centers located in rural areas. 

Senator Tillis previously announced more than $919 million in grants to health care providers and health systems in North Carolina and $34 million in grants to North Carolina health care centers to assist efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The funding comes from the CARES Act, legislation supported by Senator Tillis.

"As our hospitals and frontline workers continue their heroic care for COVID-19 patients, we must ensure they have the proper resources to provide for every North Carolinian," said Senator Tillis. "Hospitals have struggled financially with the delay of elective surgeries and increased costs due to COVID response, and this crucial funding will help provide our hospitals with more resources to ensure the safety of all patients."

-High-impact hospitals: $79,025,656-Hospitals treating low-income and uninsured patients: $29,992,087-Rural providers: $282,581,596
