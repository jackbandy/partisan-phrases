Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued the following statement in response to Governor Cooper's executive order temporarily closing K-12 schools for two weeks and mandating the cancellation of gatherings of more than 100 people:

"We are all in this together and although these measures will undoubtedly present some serious challenges to our faith communities and working parents, it's vital that we protect the health and well-being of North Carolinians. The next several weeks are crucial to containing the spread of coronavirus and combatting this pandemic, and I applaud Governor Cooper for taking these important steps. By taking precautions and following the guidelines of our local and state officials, we will better protect the health of our loved ones and get through this as soon as possible."
