Tillis Announces More Than $12 Million To Expand COVID-19 Testing At North Carolina Health Care Centers


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will award more than $12 million to 39 North Carolina HRSA funded health care centers to support expanded COVID-19 testing. This award is part of the Health Care Enhancement Act and Paycheck Protection Program, which Senator Tillis supported. The funding will be used to expand the range of testing and testing-related activities including the expansion of walk-up or drive-up testing capabilities, as well as the purchase of additional protective resources, laboratory services, training for staff, and expanded outreach.

"This funding will provide our health care facilities across the state with expanded testing capabilities, which is key in our efforts to protect the health of North Carolinians and begging the process of the safe reopening of our economy," said Senator Tillis.

Senator Tillis previously announced more than $919 million in grants to health care providers and health systems in North Carolina and $34 million in grants to North Carolina health care centers to assist efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic as well as an additional $391 million to North Carolina health care providers who provided care for COVID-19 patients, including high-impact hospitals, rural providers, and those treating low-income and uninsured patients. The funding comes from the CARES Act, legislation supported by Senator Tillis.
