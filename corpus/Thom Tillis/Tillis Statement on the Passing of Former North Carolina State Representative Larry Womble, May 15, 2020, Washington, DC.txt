Tillis Statement on the Passing of Former North Carolina State Representative Larry Womble


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued the following statement on the passing of former North Carolina State Representative Larry Womble: 

"Larry Womble will be forever known as the tireless champion for the victims of North Carolina's shameful eugenics and sterilization program. Larry was relentless in shining a light on one of the darkest moments of our state's history, and he never backed down and never gave up in the pursuit of justice. One of the greatest honors of my life was supporting Larry's successful mission to make North Carolina the first state in the nation to provide compensation to the victims of the state-run eugenics program. Larry had a heart of gold and epitomized what it means to be a servant leader. Susan and I are deeply saddened to lose such a great man, and we send our deepest condolences to Larry's family."
