Tillis Supports Bipartisan Agreement To Help More Small Businesses


Today, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued the following statement on the bipartisan agreement on additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program:

"I'm glad we were able to pass additional funding to help North Carolina's small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. It should have never taken this long. Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer halted this program for a week in order to play partisan political games resulting in extra unnecessary hardship and uncertainty for small business owners across the state and country. This cannot happen again. Congress will likely need to allocate additional funds to this program and make improvements based on feedback we have heard from small businesses and non-profits. I'm committed to putting the health and jobs of North Carolinians first, and we cannot allow partisan politics to get in the way of assisting the American people during this global crisis."

According to the SBA, there have been 39,520 approved loans in North Carolina totaling $8.05 billion as of April 13, before funding for the program ran out.
