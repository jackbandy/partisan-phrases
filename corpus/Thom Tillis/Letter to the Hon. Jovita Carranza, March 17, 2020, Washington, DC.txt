Letter to the Hon. Jovita Carranza, Admin. of the Small Business Administration - Hudson, Price and Tillis Send Bipartisan Letter Urging Swift Approval of Governor's Request For Small Business Administration Disaster Declaration


Dear Ms. Carranza, We write in support of North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper's March 13, 2020, request for a Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster declaration for economic injury resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).  Small businesses across the state are currently sustaining severe economic impacts from this pandemic.  Our officeshavealready received many correspondences from small businesses that are eager to access financial assistance through SBA's relief programs.  The State is also experiencing the economic fallout from COVID-19.  On March 10, 2020, Governor Cooper declared a State of Emergency for North Carolina to activate the State Emergency Operations Center, and established a Coronavirus Task Force to work with state, local, and federal officials to respond to the challenges posed by COVID-19.   Immediate action is critical to stem the economic loss from COVID-19.  Therefore, we ask for your fair and timely consideration of the Governor's request.  Please reach out to our staffsif you are in need of additional information.
