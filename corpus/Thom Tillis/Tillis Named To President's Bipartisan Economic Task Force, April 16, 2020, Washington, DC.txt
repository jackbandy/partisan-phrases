Tillis Named To President's Bipartisan Economic Task Force


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) was named as a member of President Trump's bipartisan Congressional Economic Task Force to provide advice on how and when to re-open the nation's economy.

"I've talked to countless North Carolinians over the last several weeks and they're rightfully concerned about protecting the health of their loved ones and getting clarity on how and when we can safely re-open the economy. I strongly believe that data must drive this decision and we must properly time and implement a staggered re-opening based on the unique conditions on the ground in our states, cities, and towns. I'll continue to work with President Trump and Governor Cooper in the weeks ahead as North Carolinians keep doing their part to defeat this virus and get ready to begin our nation's economic recovery."
