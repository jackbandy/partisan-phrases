Following Tillis Support, CDC Awards $13.8 Million to North Carolina For Coronavirus Emergency Preparations


Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced it will award $13.8 million to the state of North Carolina to combat coronavirus, critical funding that Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) helped secure in the passage earlier this month of the bipartisan Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act.

"I worked across the aisle to take quick action to provide the state of North Carolina with $13.8 million in federal funding to assist our state and local officials to protect the health of North Carolinians and get our communities prepared," said Senator Tillis. "I'll continue to work on a bipartisan basis to make sure our state has the resources it needs to prepare and respond to this public health crisis."
