Tillis Votes In Favor Of Opening Debate On Bill To Stabilize Economy, Provide Direct Payments To Hardworking North Carolinians


Tonight, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued the following statement after the Senate, on a party line vote, rejected a procedural vote opening debate on the CARES Act, an economic stabilization package that includes direct payments to North Carolina families. Tillis voted in favor of opening debate on the legislation, which would give negotiators an additional 30 hours to reach a bipartisan compromise agreement.

"Our nation is being confronted with an unprecedented crisis. This is the time that our leaders must work together at warp speed, with the understanding that neither party will be able to get everything it wants, but that we all need to be willing to compromise.

"Attempts to score cheap, partisan political points only betray the trust and confidence of the American people and come at the expense of quickly implementing the solutions we need to stabilize our economy and provide hardworking North Carolinians with direct financial assistance.

"I will continue to do my part to forge consensus, and it's time for my colleagues in the House and Senate to rise to the occasion by casting partisanship aside in order to put the physical and economic health of our nation first."
