Tillis Sponsors Resolution to Censure Schumer for Threatening Supreme Court Justices


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) signed on to a resolution to censure Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) for threatening two U.S. Supreme Court Justices. The resolution, co-sponsored by 14 Senators upon introduction, condemns the Senate Minority Leader's remarks at a pro-abortion rally in front of the Supreme Court yesterday, noting that political violence has increased in the United States over the last decade, including the targeting and murder of federal judges and their family members.

"Chuck Schumer's threat to Supreme Court Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch that they will "pay the price' and "will not know what hit' them unless they vote the way Democrats want is beyond disgusting and dangerous," said Senator Tillis. "I strongly support this resolution to censure Senator Schumer to hold him accountable for such unacceptable rhetoric targeting the integrity of the Supreme Court."

Yesterday, Senator Schumer threatened Justices by name saying, "I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions."
