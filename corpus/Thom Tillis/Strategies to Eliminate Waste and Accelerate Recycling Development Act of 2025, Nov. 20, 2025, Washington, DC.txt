Mr. TILLIS.  7, S. 351.

The clerk will report the bill by title.

The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

A bill (S. 351) to establish a pilot grant program to       improve recycling accessibility, to require the Administrator       of the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out certain       activities to collect and disseminate data on recycling and       composting programs in the United States, and for other       purposes.

Mr. TILLIS. I know of no further debate on the bill.
