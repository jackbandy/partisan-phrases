Tillis Applauds President Trump on State of the Union Address


"Tonight, the President laid a wonderful foundation for answering that age old question: are you better off now than you were four years ago? Record low unemployment, record high job creation, new trade agreements with Canada, Mexico and China. Job creation opportunities for small businesses and farmers in North Carolina unlike anything we've seen in years. I am proud to have been there to support the President on these policies and I look forward to us continuing the good work in this session and the Congress to come."

Since President Trump's election, 220,000 jobs have been created in North Carolina. The unemployment rate is currently at 3.7 percent and the state's labor force participation rate is rising.  The 252 opportunity zones in North Carolina are attracting investment to previously forgotten communities, including in Cumberland, Guilford, and Wake counties. Entrepreneurship is booming, as new business applications in North Carolina are up 30 percent since the election.
