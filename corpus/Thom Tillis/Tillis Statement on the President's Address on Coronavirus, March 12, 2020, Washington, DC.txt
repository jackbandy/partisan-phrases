Tillis Statement on the President's Address on Coronavirus


Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued the following statement on President Trump's address to the nation last night: 

"President Trump displayed decisive leadership in outlining steps he is taking to protect the physical and economic health of our nation against the threat of the coronavirus. The President previously made the right call to immediately ban travel from China, and he has made the right call to temporarily ban travel from Europe.

"It is incumbent on our nation's leaders to cease the political posturing and set aside our partisan differences in order to do what is best for our nation to address this public health crisis. I will continue to do my part to make sure we put the health and safety of North Carolinians first and make sure our state is prepared and ready to respond."
