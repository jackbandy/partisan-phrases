As UNC, Duke Move to Online Classes in Response to Coronavirus, Tillis Takes Action to Protect GI Bill Benefits for Student Veterans


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) co-sponsored legislation that would allow veterans on the GI Bill to continue receiving full benefits as universities move classes online to prevent the spread of COVID-19. There were more than 34,000 student veterans using their GI Bill benefits in North Carolina, including more than 6,000 in the UNC System, as of the 2017-2018 academic year.

"With the UNC system, Duke, and other North Carolina schools moving to online classes in response to coronavirus, I'm taking action to protect the GI Bill benefits for students who bravely served our nation," said Senator Tillis. "Veterans shouldn't see the GI Bill benefits they earned unintentionally cut because of the health and safety precautions being taken by our colleges and universities, and this legislation will ensure they will not be affected."

The GI Bill determines student veterans' benefits based on whether or not they attend a physical university in person versus an online program. As colleges and universities close campuses to prevent the spread of the COVID-19, veterans on the GI Bill could lose or have their benefits cut. This bill would allow these student veterans to continue to receive full benefits even if the universities they attend move classes online due to COVID-19.
