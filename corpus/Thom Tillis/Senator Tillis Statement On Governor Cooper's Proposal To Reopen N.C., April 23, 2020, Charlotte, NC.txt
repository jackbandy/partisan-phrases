Senator Tillis Statement On Governor Cooper's Proposal To Reopen N.C., Extend Stay At Home Order


Today, Senator Thom Tillis issued the following statement:

"I've long said that we all need to do our part on social distancing and put the peak of the curve in our rear-view mirror before we can begin to safely reopen our economy. Governor Cooper's plan is in line with the White House Coronavirus Task Force's recommended guidance for states to reopen.

"So many families and small businesses are suffering right now, and I share the urgency of many North Carolinians to get our economy back up and running as soon as possible. At the same time, the worst thing that could happen is for us to have a significantly worse second spike that results in more loss of life and forces another shutdown of our economy. We need to base decisions on the data from our state and counties, on public safety, and on the best long-term economic interests of our state. By flattening the curve and getting past the peak, we will put North Carolina in the best position to safely reopen our economy and get North Carolinians back to work."
