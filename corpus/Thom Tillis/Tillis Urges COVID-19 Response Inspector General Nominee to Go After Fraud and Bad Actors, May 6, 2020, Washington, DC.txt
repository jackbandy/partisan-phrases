Tillis Urges COVID-19 Response Inspector General Nominee to Go After Fraud and Bad Actors


Yesterday, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) participated in a Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee nominations hearing to consider Brian D. Miller to be Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, to serve as a watchdog over the implementation of the CARES Act. Senator Tillis urged the Inspector General nominee to be a strong and independent voice that goes after fraud and bad actors.

Senator Tillis: I have confidence that you'll go about this job in a very independent way and you'll hold anybody accountable who tries to veer you off of what you think is right. Just one last question for you, is there such a thing as good fraud and bad fraud?

Mr. Miller: I would think that any fraud is bad.

Senator Tillis: I think fraud is fraud.

Mr. Miller: Yes.

Senator Tillis: I expect you to be committed to taking a look at all the benefactors of the programs that come under the CARES Act and you look through the simple lens of, was any of the taxpayer dollars that were sent out in good faith to help us recover during this virus response inappropriately allocated to somebody because of fraud. I want you to go after the big businesses, the small businesses, and everybody in between if they've taken advantage of this program.
