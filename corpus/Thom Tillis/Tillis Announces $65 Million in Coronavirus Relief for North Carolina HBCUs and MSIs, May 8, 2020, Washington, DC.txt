Tillis Announces $65 Million in Coronavirus Relief for North Carolina HBCUs and MSIs


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced an additional round of coronavirus relief funding for North Carolina's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to help ensure learning continues during the coronavirus crisis.

The funds--totaling $65,228,325--come from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was supported by Senator Tillis. Institutions may use this funding to cover the cost of technology associated with a transition to distance education, grants to cover the costs of attendance for eligible students and training for faculty and staff. Additionally, funds may be used to cover operational costs, such as lost revenue, reimbursements for prior expenses and payroll.

"HBCUs and MSIs play an important role in North Carolina's higher education system and face unique challenges while we combat the coronavirus pandemic," said Senator Tillis. "This funding in addition to the $378 million already allocated to North Carolina education institutions will ensure they can keep their operations running, allow students to continue to pursue learning opportunities, and serve critical needs in our communities." 

Senator Tillis previously announced North Carolina colleges and universities received over $378 million in the first round of emergency grants to support postsecondary students and institutes of higher education impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
