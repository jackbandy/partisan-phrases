Tillis Supports Passage of Families First Coronavirus Response Act


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced his support for the Families First Coronavirus Response Act:

"All leaders need to set aside their partisan differences and work together to combat coronavirus and protect the health and well-being of the American people. I'm proud to support these bipartisan solutions to help slow the spread of coronavirus by ensuring access to free testing and by providing a stronger temporary social safety net to give North Carolinians peace of mind as we confront this crisis together.

"I'm glad that both parties were able to unite to make commonsense improvements to the bill to help mitigate unintended consequences for our hardworking small business owners. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department are taking steps to assist our job creators, and Congress needs to keep pushing for additional action to prevent these small business owners from losing their livelihoods.

"I strongly support the passage of this bill, and we need to make sure this is only the beginning of decisive measures. Congress must continue to take aggressive action in the days and weeks ahead, and I will keep working across the aisle to push for solutions to protect the physical and economic health of North Carolina families."
