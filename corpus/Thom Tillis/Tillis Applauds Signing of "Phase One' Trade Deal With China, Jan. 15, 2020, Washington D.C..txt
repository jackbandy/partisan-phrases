Tillis Applauds Signing of "Phase One' Trade Deal With China


Today, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) issued the following video statement, congratulating President Trump on his successful negotiations and signing of the historic China "Phase One' Trade Deal, opening up increased trade for North Carolina farm products and other goods. Under the agreement, China will purchase $200 billion worth of U.S. goods, which includes $40 billion in agricultural products. Agriculture is North Carolina's largest economic driver. 

"Congratulations to President Trump," said Senator Tillis. "After more than a year of negotiating with China, he signed an agreement that's great for North Carolina, small businesses, and farmers who are going to benefit from this - nearly twice the purchases from the United States, as we've seen historically. Hog farmers, farmers of all kinds, are going to benefit from this deal and I'm proud President Trump stuck with the negotiations and got a great deal for the United States."
