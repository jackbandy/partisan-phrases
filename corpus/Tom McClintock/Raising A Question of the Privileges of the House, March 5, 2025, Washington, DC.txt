Raising A Question of the Privileges of the House

Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Green deliberately disrupted  Congress' proceedings during a joint session yesterday.

This was an affront to the Constitution, which commands that the  President report to the Congress from time to time. It was an insult to  the Presidency, and it was a disgrace to this body.

It was perpetrated not by some lunatic wearing buffalo horns but,  rather, by an elected Member of the United States Congress. This is  worthy of the harshest sanctions that we can apply.

Mr. Speaker, many Members repeatedly interrupted this Presidential  address with catcalls and insults and other gestures of disrespect. A  Member once did this to President Obama. He apologized, and he was  reprimanded.

I didn't hear an apology from Mr. Green right now. What I heard was  deliberate, calculated defiance.

The whole reason for this building to exist and the whole reason for  this House Chamber is to exchange our views, sometimes very sharply  different views, and talk out the differences among us. In order for  that to work, that discussion has to be accompanied by civility and  decorum.

Accordingly, our rules insist on that. I believe that all of those  who breach  these rules need to be held accountable, lest this event become just  another sad milestone in the denigration of this institution.
