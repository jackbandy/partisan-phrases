Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, Benjamin Franklin told of a French woman  who once confided to her sister: ``I don't know how it happens, sister,  but I meet with nobody but myself that is always in the right.'' He was  reminding his colleagues that democracies were never designed to make  perfect decisions, only the most acceptable ones to the most people.

My disappointment in the Senate version before us is vast, but it has  one redeeming quality: It is within reach. No, it doesn't begin to  address the dangerous debt that threatens our Nation's solvency, but it  does open up a process that is absolutely critical if we are going to  stop a $4.5 trillion tax increase that would devastate our economy,  provide the funds to secure our borders, and provide for our defense in  a dangerous world.

I am frustrated with the Senate numbers, but in DOGE we trust. I  think we can achieve a trillion dollars of savings as a result of its  work. The mass repatriation of millions of illegal aliens should save  another $150 billion. Restoring the work requirement for able-bodied  welfare recipients will save hundreds of billions of dollars more  without touching a single service for the truly needy. The economic  rebound from the regulatory and fiscal reforms and from the bilateral  free trade agreements the President intends to negotiate are  potentially explosive.

None of these reforms are in this resolution, but all of them depend  on this resolution. If anybody has a better alternative, they need to  bring it to a vote in both Houses this week. Otherwise, let us take a  little of Benjamin Franklin's advice, doubt a little of our own  infallibility, and get on with the work we were elected to do and upon  which the prosperity of our people and the future of our Nation  depends.
