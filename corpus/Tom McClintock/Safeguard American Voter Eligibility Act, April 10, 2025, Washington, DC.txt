Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act

Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, in every election, somebody wins and  somebody loses. Democracy depends on the losing side trusting that the  election was a fair and accurate reflection of the will of the  majority, and the winning side depends on the same perception for the  legitimacy of their office.

For centuries, our elections were the gold standard for the world  because they were very hard to cheat in. Essential components of this  process were 30-day registration, in-person election day voting, and  proof of identity.

In recent years, in many States, the woke left has torn down these  safeguards. Mail-in ballots where there is no chain of custody,  counting ballots weeks after election day, counting ballots in secret,  ballot harvesting, same-day registration, turning election day into  election month, and forbidding proof of identity all make cheating easy  and destroy the public's confidence in the process.

In many jurisdictions, the Democrats have made it clear that they  intend to allow noncitizens to vote, the ultimate in foreign election  interference.

I have news for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle:  American elections are for Americans.

The SAVE Act restores this vital principle by requiring proof of  citizenship and identity in the Federal elections that affect every  American. Americans should pay close attention to this vote, for it  will reveal those who would subvert their vote to foreign nationals.
