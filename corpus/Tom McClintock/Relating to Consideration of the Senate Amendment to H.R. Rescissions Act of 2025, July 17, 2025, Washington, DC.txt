Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, we have had a great debate between  deficits and taxes, but deficits and taxes are two sides of the same  coin. To spend a dollar, Mr. Speaker, you must either tax it now or  borrow it now and tax it later. Taxes and deficits are both driven by  spending.

This bill rescinds some of the most stupid spending in the entire  Federal Government. These are the kindest cuts of all: subsidies for  state media and grants to corrupt NGOs for outrageous foreign  propaganda.

Mr. Speaker, $9 billion comes to about $70 for an average American  family.

Mr. Speaker, do you think they prefer to spend that $70 on a new pair  of shoes for their child or for ``girl-centric climate change  programs'' in Brazil?

That is the choice.

Congress squanders hundreds of billions of dollars annually on  destructive subsidies and useless grants like these. Let us finally  take this first, small step toward the solvency of our Nation, relief  for our people, and redemption for our Congress.
