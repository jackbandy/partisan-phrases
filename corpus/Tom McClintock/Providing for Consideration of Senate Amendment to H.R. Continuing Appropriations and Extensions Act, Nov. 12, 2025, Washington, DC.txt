Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, Jimmy Failla offered Democrats this pro  tip: If you are going to call it the Republican shutdown, you are not  supposed to get mad that it is ending.

Anyone who remembers their ``Schoolhouse Rock'' knows that once the  House originates an appropriation, the Senate must either amend it or  pass it. Now, the House did its job on September 19 with a simple  appropriation that made no policy changes. It merely kept the  government operating at current levels while we finished debating  priorities.

Democrats deliberately blocked the Senate from acting, demanding $1.5  trillion of new spending as a ransom. Finally, thank God, eight of them  put country ahead of party and voted to end this madness.

Hearing the bitter recriminations from our leftist colleagues, it  seems unlikely we will see much bipartisanship today, but with or  without, we will reopen the government tonight and get back to  addressing the challenges that confront our country.
