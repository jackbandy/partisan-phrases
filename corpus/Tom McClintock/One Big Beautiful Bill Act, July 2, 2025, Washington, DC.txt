One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, this bill fulfills many of the promises  we made to the American people: lower taxes, lighter regulations, a  secure border, more frugal spending, and a war on waste. Throughout  history, these are the policies that have produced prosperity and  security, and there is every reason to believe that they will again.

I remind my conservative friends who say this bill doesn't go far  enough that our process was not designed to make perfect law. It was  designed to make the best law that is acceptable to a majority. Judging  by the narrow votes, we have pushed this bill about as far toward  perfection as our process allows.

The proof is not in the debate points scored today, but rather, next  year when Americans will ask themselves if  they are better off. I believe, because of this bill, the answer will  be a resounding yes, and perhaps that is what the Democrats fear most.
