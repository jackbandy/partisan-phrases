Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Three years ago today, I was diagnosed with  neuroendocrine cancer. That day, my youngest child, my daughter, turned  2 months old.

There is a drug that I have to take every month, every 28 days, and  the first time I saw the bill for that, the list price on that drug was  $24,000 per injection. For people that don't have insurance or Medicaid  or aren't covered, they are not getting that shot. They are not going  to survive, some of them. This is a choice for some of you between your  career and saving people's lives.

There are so many folks who have reached out over the last several  months panicking about their disabled children, about their senior  citizen parents who are in nursing homes, people struggling with  cancer, Alzheimer's, dementia, sickle cell, diabetes, all of these  illnesses. You have the power today to make sure that they can live  with dignity and stay alive, or you can choose your career. That is  your choice.

We choose to keep people alive. We choose to have healthcare in this  country. We refuse to cut healthcare for 17 million people nationwide  and 1.6 million people in Texas because it is wrong and it is immoral  and we can take a different course.
