Undersea Cable Control Act

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2503.

Communication systems and access to the internet are highly dependent  on undersea cables. Ninety-nine percent of intercontinental data  travels via undersea fiber-optic cables on the ocean floor.

It goes without saying that control and manufacture of these cables  matter not just for economic development but will matter in any  conflict.

The United States, with allies and partners, must maintain strategic  independence and should seek to become the primary source of this  critical infrastructure. This bill will force the Bureau of Industry  and Security to provide a study along these lines, which is long  overdue.

Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill on undersea  cables and believe it is a smart step to develop a strategy for  American economic statecraft in this important area.
