Horrific Ice Abuses

Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Americans are living in a time of viciousness.  Under Donald Trump, we are living in America the brutal, a Nation where  the wrong skin color, the wrong accent, the wrong language makes you a  suspect, puts you in danger, threatens your life. Masked agents without  warrants and long guns are barging into people's homes and businesses  without apology. Americans who stand up for the Constitution, for the  rule of law, and for due process are threatened and some are killed.

We have seen it out on the streets in Los Angeles, in Chicago, in  Minneapolis, and across the country. We have also seen it in secret. I  saw it just last week in a detention center in Dilley.

What do we call a place that keeps a 2-month-old baby in a trailer  prison? Is that what America is? What do we call a place that keeps a  5-year-old boy in a trailer prison, that refuses to provide any  education, that withholds medical care, that traumatizes children so  brutally?

That is what ICE has become, not an immigration enforcement agency,  but a reckless, lawless, brutal agency. Congress should disband ICE,  should impeach Kristi Noem, and this Congress should help restore the  Constitution of the United States of America to the people of our  Nation.
