Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the PARTNER Act. This  is a bipartisan bill, supported by colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, that strengthens American diplomacy, science, and leadership in  the world.

The PARTNER Act does something very simple but very important. It  extends basic legal protections, known as privileges and immunities, to  several key international organizations that the United States works  closely with but that, until now, have lacked the same recognition that  we give to other multilateral institutions.

Let me explain why this is very important.

These legal protections are not special favors. They are the standard  tools that allow international organizations to do their work  effectively and independently. They protect institutions from lawsuits,  taxation, or other interference that could disrupt their missions,  while still ensuring that individuals remain accountable for their own  private actions.

They are reciprocal. Just as American diplomats and officials enjoy  these protections when we serve in international organizations abroad,  we extend them to our partners here in the United States. It is the  basic infrastructure of diplomacy.

Why is this bill important right now?

First, our strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific. ASEAN, the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations, is central to U.S. engagement  in Asia. Recognizing its diplomatic status here in the United States  shows our commitment to the region's future and to working with our  Asian partners on equal footing.

Second, the Western Hemisphere, of which we are a part, is obviously  incredibly important to the United States. CARICOM, the Caribbean  Community, plays a crucial role in democratic governance, regional  security, and disaster preparedness. Extending privileges and  immunities supports CARICOM as a unified voice for the Caribbean and  strengthens U.S. ties to a region where influence should be felt  through real and consistent engagement.

Third, science and technology leadership. CERN, the European  Organization for Nuclear Research, is one of the world's premier  scientific organizations. It is partnering with United States  researchers on the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, a $3 billion  project based right here in United States. This is some of the most  important and cutting-edge physics research in the world that will,  hopefully, allow us to better understand the universe.

By extending privileges and immunities to CERN, we can speed up the  timeline for this groundbreaking work, control costs, and ensure that  American scientists remain at the forefront of the discovery.

Fourth, our Pacific and African partners. This bill authorizes the  President to extend protections to the Pacific Islands Forum, a vital  regional body in the South Pacific where small island nations are on  the front lines of climate change and facing significant diplomatic  overtures by China.

The bill fixes a gap in U.S. law by ensuring the African Union's  observer  mission to the United Nations in New York receives the same recognition  as the AU itself.

Taken together, these provisions make clear that the United States  values our partnerships and will invest in multilateral cooperation  that advances our interests and our American values.

Mr. Speaker, Congress has extended privileges and immunities before  to the European Union, to the African Union, and, of course, to the  United Nations and the Organization of American States. This bill  simply applies the same standard to other organizations that the United  States works with every single day.

At a time when our competitors are working overtime to expand their  influence in Asia, the Caribbean, the Pacific, and Africa we cannot  afford to sit back.

The PARTNER Act is a concrete step to strengthen U.S. leadership,  deepen our alliances, and keep America the center of global diplomacy  and science.

I thank all of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, for their  leadership and for their work on this bill. This bill has broad  bipartisan support. It is good for American diplomacy, good for  American science, and good for American leadership in the world.

Mr. CASTRO of Texas. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
