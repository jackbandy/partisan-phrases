Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National  Public Health Week and the UT School of Public Health San Antonio. It  is an honor to shed light onto a mission devoted to strengthening our  communities, improving quality of life, and ensuring that everyone has  equal access to quality health and wellness services.

Health extends beyond clinics and hospitals. It is the cornerstone of  a strong nation. By engaging our communities, public health workers  address health care disparities and implement competent wellness  programs that provide essential services to diverse communities.

The opening of the UT School of Public Health San Antonio--the newest  addition to the UT Health San Antonio system--underscores the  dedication to implementing tools that lead to a healthier life. The  institution is a step forward in addressing the challenges faced by  communities in San Antonio and South Texas. Through cutting edge- research, the new generation of public health workers will drive our  nation forward.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize and bring attention to this  special celebration.
