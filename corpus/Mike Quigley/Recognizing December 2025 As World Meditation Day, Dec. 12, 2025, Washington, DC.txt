Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sunday, December  21, 2025, as World Meditation Day, which is designated by the United  Nations to celebrate the growing recognition of meditation as a  practical tool for mental well-being and peace.

The day will culminate in a global moment of stillness at 10 am ET,  when millions of people across time zones will join a live, guided  meditation led by global humanitarian Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar,  founder of The Art of Living Foundation. Gurudev has devoted his life  to serving humanity, promoting peace, and advocating human values for  over 45 years.

Gurudev is universally acknowledged for his ground-breaking work in  stress-management and personal development through powerful breathing  techniques such as SKY Breath Meditation, which have benefited more  than 800 million people across 182 countries.

Various events throughout the United States will bring communities  together in a shared moment of peace and connection during the holiday  season, supporting mental well-being, resilience, and utility across  our cities.

Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence  in recognition of the World Meditation Day.
