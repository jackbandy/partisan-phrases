Snap Cuts

Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, last weekend, I visited Saint Sabina Church  in Chicago for emergency food distribution.

There, I talked to a single mother with a young child with  disabilities. She showed up in the cold 4 hours early for a food  distribution of a single box of food. Without her November SNAP  payment, she said that she would have to skip meals to make ends meet.

I also talked to seniors who were deciding whether to purchase their  groceries or their medicine for the month.

For these Chicagoans, the administration's delay in SNAP benefits  made for a brutal month. For the 360,000 Illinoisans who will be cut  off of SNAP because of the big, ugly bill, they will be weighing these  tradeoffs for years to come. Veterans, older Americans, and kids aging  out of foster care will lose benefits.

They deserve better. We must keep fighting for them.
