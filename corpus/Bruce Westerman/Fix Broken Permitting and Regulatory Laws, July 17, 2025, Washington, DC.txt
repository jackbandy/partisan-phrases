Fix Broken Permitting and Regulatory Laws

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to shed light on the broken  permitting process that creates roadblocks to unleashing American  innovation and development while costing more taxpayer dollars with  basically nothing to show for the expenses.

The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 attempted to change course and  imposed a 2-year deadline and a 150-page cap on environmental impact  statements. However, the Council on Environmental Quality reports that  61 percent of environmental impact statements still take over 2 years  to complete.

The other two branches of government are taking actions to inject  some regulatory common sense into the process. President Trump's  ``Unleashing American Energy'' executive order directs Federal agencies  to confine NEPA analysis to applicable law, and in May, the Supreme  Court ruled unanimously on narrowing the scope of NEPA.

It is time for Congress to take bipartisan, bicameral action to fix  the broken permitting and regulatory laws so that America can thrive.
