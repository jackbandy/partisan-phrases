Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 879, I call  up the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 80) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Bureau of Land Management relating to ``National  Petroleum Reserve in Alaska Integrated Activity Plan Record of  Decision'', and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.

The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.

Mr. WESTERMAN.  Res. 80.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 80, which repeals the  Biden administration's 2022 Integrated Activity Plan, or IAP, for the  National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, also known as the NPR-A.

Under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976, the  approximately 23-million-acre NPR-A was designated by Congress due to  its vast energy resources. In 1980, Congress amended the act and  directed the Secretary of the Interior to conduct ``an expeditious  program of competitive leasing of oil and gas in the National Petroleum  Reserve in Alaska.''

In 2020, in President Trump's first administration, the Bureau of  Land Management released its IAP for the NPR-A. The 2020 IAP listened  to local voices and opened up access to over 18.5 million acres of the  NPR-A for oil and gas leasing. Over 13 million acres were made  available for new infrastructure development.

Nagruk Harcharek, president of the Voice of the Arctic Inupiat,  stated in a September 2023 Natural Resources Committee hearing that:  ``We also felt heard when BLM released an NPR-A Integrated Activity  Plan (IAP) in June 2020 that considered the interests of our  communities, including future community infrastructure needs.''

The IAP outlining management activities for natural resources  throughout the NPR-A was thoughtfully crafted by the first Trump  administration, taking into account the voices of local indigenous  Tribal communities.

Regrettably, in 2022, the Biden administration replaced the 2020 IAP  with a new one, reducing the available acreage for oil and gas leasing  by 37 percent and reducing areas available to new infrastructure by  over 2.3 million acres.

In November 2023, during another hearing on the matter, we heard from  Commissioner John Boyle of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources,  who expressed concerns about the Biden administration's NPR-A  rulemaking process. ``The process to date has been confusingly  deficient as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has scheduled and  canceled public meetings on short notice, avoided consultation  obligations, and attempted to avoid procedural safeguards that are  meant to keep rulemakings of enormous public cost and consequence from  being hastily and arbitrarily implemented. Neither comprehensive  environmental nor economic reviews have been completed for a proposal  that will dramatically change environmental and economic management in  what may be the largest Federal petroleum asset in the country.''

In that same hearing, Mr. Harcharek shared:

``This decision, coupled with further `protections' for NPR-A, will  undoubtedly shrink the economic opportunities available to the North  Slope. It virtually guarantees to set us back on our journey toward  self-determination by requiring further reliance on the Federal and  State government to provide for the basic needs of the people on the  North Slope.''

Ultimately, the Biden administration stymied energy production within  the NPR-A and failed to offer leases in a manner that would boost  revenue and provide economic stability to the region and the State.

The most recent lease sale in the NPR-A took place in 2019, when the  BLM leased over 1 million acres, generating more than $11 million,  including roughly $5.6 million for the State of Alaska.

Revenue from developing these resources is essential to the  livelihoods of all Alaskans. For example, in fiscal year 2022, Alaskan  oil and natural gas production, largely driven by the consequences of  the pro-energy policies of the first Trump administration, generated  $4.5 billion in State and local revenue and supported over 69,250  direct and indirect jobs.

Alaska's role as a leader in unleashing American energy dominance  will continue. In the Working Families Tax Cut Act, Congress  highlighted the importance of the NPR-A and required five lease sales  to be held in the area over the next 10 years.

To ensure our energy independence, we must unleash American energy  and ensure access to our own resources here at home. This legislation  is an important step in doing just that.

I thank Representative Begich and Senator Sullivan for their work to  bring S.J. Res. 80 to the House floor so that we can nullify yet  another misguided Biden-era action and take another step to put our  Nation's energy policy back on the right track.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I point out that, while the current  administration did recently rescind the 2024 rule this month, passage  of a CRA is still necessary to prevent a future administration from,  again, weaponizing IAPs similar to this one that ignore congressional  intent. By replacing the 2022 IAP, BLM wouldn't be left in limbo. They  would revert back to the initial IAP finalized under the first Trump  administration, which did take into account Native Tribal voices, and  it is consistent with the requirements included in the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope, ICAS, the North Slope Borough,  and the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, ASRC, that specifically  states BLM failed to engage in meaningful government-to-government  consultation with ASRC, the Borough, and ICAS.

This admission contradicts Federal consultation requirements and  disregards the voices of the very communities most affected. Our  leadership has consistently raised concerns about this process and its  outcome, yet those concerns were ignored.                                                 October 3, 2025.       Re Support for S.J. Res. 80 and H.J. Res. 124--Congressional           Review Act Disapproval of the BLM NPR-A Integrated           Activity Plan (IAP) Record of Decision (ROD).       Hon. Lisa Murkowski,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Dan Sullivan,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nicholas Begich III,      U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.

Dear Senators Murkowski, Sullivan, and Representative       Begich: On behalf of the North Slope Inupiaq leadership--      including Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC), the North       Slope Borough (Borough), and the Inupiat Community of the       Arctic Slope (ICAS)--we write in strong support of S.J. Res.       80, introduced by Senators Sullivan and Murkowski, and H.J.       Res. 124 in the House, each providing for congressional       disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code,       of the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land Management       relating to the ``National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska       Integrated Activity Plan Record of Decision.''                                  Background

The North Slope Inupiat have called the Arctic home for       over 10,000 years. We are proud of our self-determination       efforts to ensure future generations of Inupiat continue to       reside in our communities and have access to essential       services. Without a stable economy, our communities will       suffer, along with our ability to fully engage in and sustain       our Inupiaq cultural traditions, including our vital       subsistence way of life.

The North Slope of Alaska spans an area nearly the size of       the state of Minnesota and, within that expansive area, there       are eight Inupiaq communities--Anaktuvuk Pass, Atqasuk,       Kaktovik, Nuiqsut, Point Hope, Point Lay, Utqiagvik, and       Wainwright. None of our communities are connected by a       permanent road system; all supplies must be flown or barged       in, making the cost of living extremely high and economic       opportunities generally low.

Over fifty years ago, the Federal Government directed       Alaska Native people to organize into a new structure of       indigenous representation. The Alaska Native Claims       Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA) was a dramatically different       and transformative approach by the Federal Government to       federal Indian policy. The fact that our ancestral lands were       claimed by the Federal Government before our people had a       right to settle aboriginal land claims should inform every       decision the Federal Government makes in managing those       lands.

Unlike the Lower 48 model of indigenous representation       where tribal governments typically administer the delivery of       services such as healthcare, public safety, education, land       management, and economic development, the passage of ANCSA       created a shared system of Alaska Native representation and       delivery of services. Our region has a multitude of Alaska       Native entities that work together to effectively serve,       provide for, and enrich the lives of the North Slope Inupiat       we represent. Our three regional entities, the ICAS, the       Borough, and ASRC are three of those entities. While our       roles differ, our constituencies overlap, which is why we       work closely together to protect the cultural and economic       interests of the North Slope Inupiat.

While our leaders over fifty years ago were initially wary       of any development on our lands, our Inupiaq leaders have       spent decades prioritizing open communication and       transparency in planning with industry. We have exercised       true self-determination through a unique framework of Alaska       Native governance--a framework that relies on our tribal       governments, municipal governments, and Alaska Native       corporations established by Congress to serve our indigenous       constituents. For millennia, Inupiaq ingenuity has       transformed our relationship with industry into a partnership       that has both protected our environment and our way of life       and has brought significant economic benefits to the region       that would have otherwise been absent. Our North Slope       residents are keenly aware that advances in our communities--      running water, local schools, health care, public safety,       electricity, and more--have come because of the coordination       and cooperation of Alaska Native leaders and entities across       the region.      ICAS

Established in 1971, the Inupiat Community of the Arctic       Slope is the federally recognized regional tribal government       for the North Slope and represents over 14,000 Inupiaq tribal       members. The mission of ICAS is to exercise its sovereign       rights and powers for the benefit of tribal members, to       conserve and retain tribal lands and resources including       subsistence. For millennia Inupiaq ingenuity has transformed       our relationship with industry into a partnership that has       both protected our environment and our way of life and has       brought significant economic benefits to the region that       would have otherwise been absent. Our North Slope residents       are keenly aware that advances in our communities--running       water, local schools, health care, public safety,       electricity, and more--have come because of the       coordination and cooperation of Alaska Native leaders and       entities across the region.      Borough

The Borough is a home rule government located above the       Arctic Circle that represents roughly 10,000 residents. The       Borough's jurisdiction includes the entire National Petroleum       Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and the eight villages within it. In       1972, the North Slope Inupiat formed the Borough, in part, to       ensure our communities would benefit from oil and gas       development on their ancestral homelands. It was the first       time Alaska Natives took control of their destiny using a       regional municipal government. The Borough exercises its       powers of taxation, property assessment, education, and       planning and zoning services to serve our communities. Taxes       levied on oil and gas infrastructure, not development, have       enabled the Borough to invest in public infrastructure and       utilities, support education, and provide police, fire,       emergency, health, and other services. Elsewhere in rural       Alaska, these services are typically provided primarily by       the State or Federal Government, or both.      ASRC

ASRC is a for-profit, land-owning Alaska Native regional       corporation formed pursuant to ANCSA. ASRC represents the       same region as the Borough and ICAS, and the same eight       villages whose residents are predominantly Inupiat, and who       comprise many of our over 14,000 Alaska Native shareholders.       ASRC holds the title to approximately five million acres of       land on the North Slope, including both surface and       subsurface lands. These lands--the ancestral lands of the       North Slope Inupiat--were conveyed to ASRC by the United       States pursuant to ANCSA to provide for the economic and       cultural well-being of our Inupiaq shareholders.

ASRC is committed to both providing sound financial returns       to our shareholders, through jobs and dividends, and to       preserving our Inupiaq way of life, culture, and traditions,       including the ability to maintain a subsistence lifestyle       that supports our communities. In furtherance of this       congressionally mandated mission to provide benefits to our       shareholders, ASRC conducts and continues to invest in a       variety of activities related to infrastructure and natural       resource development and other economic initiatives.

ASRC's perspective is based on the dual realities that our       Inupiaq culture and communities depend on a healthy ecosystem       and subsistence resources, as well as infrastructure and       resource development as the foundation of sustainable North       Slope communities.                    Disapproval of the 2022 NPR-A IAP ROD

The NPR-A lies entirely within the homelands of the North       Slope Inupiat. Congress established the NPR-A with a clear       purpose: to ensure energy security for the Nation while       respecting the needs of Alaska Natives. Instead, the 2022       Record of Decision (ROD) issued by BLM has imposed sweeping       restrictions that curtail responsible development, undermine       congressional intent, and disregard the well-being of the       people who depend on these lands for both subsistence and       livelihoods.

The impacts of the 2022 ROD are especially severe for the       North Slope. Oil and gas development in the NPR-A funds the       Borough's schools, emergency services, and infrastructure. It       supports jobs for Inupiaq shareholders and residents. It       underwrites the continuation of our communities, even as we       maintain our subsistence way of life. By arbitrarily locking       away vast portions of the NPR-A, BLM's rule threatens these       essential services and imposes disproportionate burdens on       our people.

Equally concerning, BLM failed to engage in meaningful       government-to-government consultation with ASRC, the Borough,       and ICAS. This omission contradicts federal consultation       requirements and disregards the voices of the very       communities most affected. Our leadership has consistently       raised concerns about this process and its outcomes, yet       those concerns were ignored.

The 2022 ROD ignores congressional intent under ANCSA, the       Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980       (ANILCA), the National Petroleum Reserve Production Act of       1976 (NPRPA), and the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1980. The       2022 ROD also disregards the economic needs of North Slope       communities, and creates unnecessary obstacles to       infrastructure, energy, and community health across the North       Slope of Alaska.                  Support for S.J. Res 80 and H.J. Res. 124

For these reasons, our trilateral organizations strongly       support passage of S.J. Res. 80 and H.J. Res. 124 to       disapprove the 2022 NPR-A IAP ROD. Overturning this rule is       necessary to restore balance to federal policy,       reaffirm Congress's intent for the NPR-A, and uphold the       economic, cultural, and subsistence well-being of the North       Slope Inupiat.

Our identity, resilience, and survival are deeply rooted in       our traditional lands that the NPR-A boundaries encompass. We       take great pride in our ongoing efforts toward self-      determination, focused on securing a future where future       generations of Inupiat can continue to live in our       communities with access to the essential services they need       to thrive. We thank you for your leadership on this important       resolution and look forward to continued collaboration to       ensure that federal policies in the NPR-A reflect both       national priorities and the needs of the people who call the       Arctic home.            Sincerely,      Nicole Wojciechowski,

President, Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope.      Josiah Patkotak,

Mayor, North Slope Borough.      Rex A. Rock Sr.,

President and CEO, Arctic Slope Regional Corporation.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would submit that a recipe for disaster  is when an administration goes out on their own, goes around the laws  that Congress passed, and implements bad rules on their way out the  door and expects no repercussions from that.

I would say a recipe for good governance is when Congress acts within  their power to disapprove of these rules, and that is exactly what we  are doing with the CRA to make sure that these rules are followed.

Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, it has been stated that gas and energy prices won't be  reduced by passing this CRA, and I contend that they will because  overturning these rules would incentivize much-needed investment  throughout the State or the entire North Slope.

The regional impacts of increased energy production in Alaska cannot  be overstated. Refineries in the region, including California and  Washington, are equipped to handle Alaskan oil, and the refinery in  Kenai produces most of the State of Alaska's gasoline. The North Pole  refinery provides jet fuel for our military, amongst other aviation  fuels. Two other refineries located in Valdez and near Fairbanks also  produce diesel and heating fuels.

Let me point out that 3 out of 10 State households in Alaska rely on  fuel oil, kerosene, or propane for home heating. You may ask why they  would rely on these fuels that are traditionally more expensive when  Alaska has trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. That is because that  natural gas is on the North Slope, and even in the city of Anchorage,  they are running out of natural gas because they can't move the gas  from the North Slope and can't develop infrastructure. Not only can  they not meet their own needs with that gas, they certainly can't  export it to our allies.

As many have shared, the NPR-A is essential to unleashing American  energy dominance and sustaining economies throughout Alaska.

Congress must also act to undo the harm that the previous  administration imposed, and we must work to unlock the estimated 8.7  billion barrels of oil and 25 trillion cubic feet of natural gas the  NPR-A holds.

By repealing this decision, we can help uphold Tribal voices and  revert to the 2020 IAP that considered their meaningful input.

Letting these plans to shut down energy production in the NPR-A  linger would be devastating to Alaskans, especially the Native  communities on the North Slope. Without jobs, people may leave these  communities, jeopardizing the culture and social fabric of the region.  We cannot afford to let this happen. We must pass S.J. Res. 80.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage of this  important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
