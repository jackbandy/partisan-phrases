Benefits That Endure for Lifetimes of Service Act


Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1682) to amend the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act  to provide for lifetime National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands  Passes for family members of members of the Armed Forces who lost their  lives while serving their country.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1682

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Benefits that Endure for       Lifetimes Of Service Act'' or ``BELO'S Act''.       SEC. 2. LIFETIME PASSES.

Section 805(b)(2) of the Federal Lands Recreation       Enhancement Act (16 U.S.C. 6804(b)(2)) is amended by adding       at the end the following:

``(D) Any individual who is a survivor entitled to--

``(i) a death gratuity under section 1475 of title 10,       United States Code; or

``(ii) dependency and indemnity compensation under chapter       13 of title 38, United States Code.''.

Mr. WESTERMAN.  1682, the bill now under  consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again thank Representatives Evans  and Panetta for their efforts to introduce this meaningful legislation.

This bill would reduce the financial burden on our military families  who want to visit our national parks and expand their access to the  healing powers of outdoor recreation.

Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
