One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, which  unleashes American energy and unlocks many of our abundant natural  resources.

We are incentivizing domestic production in the Gulf of America and  Alaska with at least 30 lease sales in the Gulf and 6 lease sales in  the Cook Inlet. We are mandating lease sales every other year in the  National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.

Our mission to responsibly develop our resources doesn't end there.  The bill also requires coal lease sales. It reduces royalty rates on  oil, gas, and coal production, and it incentivizes production, thereby  lowering energy costs and supplying our country with domestically  dependable energy.

That is just the beginning. The bill also invests in crucial water  resource infrastructure and helps implement President Trump's executive  orders on forest management.

Republicans on the House Committee on Natural Resources are proud of  this historic legislation that unlocks our domestic resources'  potential and supports hardworking Americans and communities nationwide  as we become energy-dominant again and mine, refine, and manufacture in  America.

I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
