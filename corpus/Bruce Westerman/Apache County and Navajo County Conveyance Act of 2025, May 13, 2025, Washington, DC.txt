Mr. WESTERMAN.  1829, the bill now under  consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly support Congressman Crane's bill, the Apache  County and Navajo County Conveyance Act of 2025. This legislation would  transfer small parcels of Federal land to Apache and Navajo Counties to  expand existing cemeteries.

Located in eastern Arizona, the communities in Pinedale and Alpine  are surrounded by the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. Given the  large Federal footprint, both communities have struggled to expand  their respective cemeteries, which are currently located on U.S. Forest  Service land and operated under a special use permit. If the cemeteries  are not expanded, families will be forced to travel long distances to  distant cemeteries to visit their deceased relatives.

To address this need, Pinedale and Alpine have worked with their  respective counties to identify additional land to expand their  cemeteries.

This bill provides a straightforward, commonsense solution by  transferring U.S. Forest Service land adjacent to the cemeteries to the  respective counties.

While this is a straightforward bill, I think many of us can attest  to the invaluable role a burial place can play in the grieving process.  Burial sites are sacred, eternal resting places that provide closure  for the families of the deceased. Families should not be forced to  travel long distances to lay their loved ones to rest due to the red  tape of Federal land ownership.

As chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, I fought to elevate  the voices of rural communities and highlight their unique challenges.  This bill addresses one of those unique challenges.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Crane for his work on this  legislation.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1829 will ensure that two rural  communities in eastern Arizona have the space to lay their beloved  community members to rest. I thank Congressman Crane for spearheading  this critical issue on behalf of his constituents.

Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
