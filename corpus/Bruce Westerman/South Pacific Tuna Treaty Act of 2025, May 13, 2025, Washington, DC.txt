Mr. WESTERMAN.  531, the bill now under  consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the South Pacific Tuna  Treaty Act of 2025, introduced by my friend, Congresswoman Radewagen  from American Samoa.

This legislation, which was adopted by voice vote in the House in the  118th Congress, codifies updates to the South Pacific Tuna Treaty that  were first agreed to in 2016 and later adopted by the United States  Senate in 2022.

The United States first entered into this treaty with 16 Pacific  Island nations under President Ronald Reagan. It gives the United  States access to some of the most fertile fishing waters that are found  anywhere in the world.

This strengthens the United States' tuna fleet, which has experienced  a rapid decline in recent decades, while also bolstering the United  States' presence in the South Pacific.

The 2016 amendments improved the treaty's execution and clarified  specific provisions. However, these important updates have not been  codified, which has caused regulatory uncertainty.

Mr. Speaker, adopting this legislation will bring about the next  chapter of the United States' engagement in the South Pacific. I thank  Mrs. Radewagen for her leadership on this important issue, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, on April 17, American Samoa celebrated  125 years as a territory of the United States. As we observe this  historic milestone, enacting this legislation will ensure that the  United States will continue its strong presence in the Pacific region.

When President Reagan first signed the legislation that established  this treaty in the 1980s, he spoke of the bonds of friendship and  affection that unite our people. This bill will ensure that these  important partnerships will continue for years and decades to come.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Radewagen once again for her  tireless work on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support its  swift passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.
