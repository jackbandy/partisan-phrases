Recognizing Jerome Powell


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699024/recognizing-jerome-powell


Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chair Jerome  Powell, who has served with honor and integrity on the Federal  Reserve's Board of Governors for 13 years.

Mr. Speaker, I rise and join Democrats, Republicans, and other  leaders because the Justice Department's criminal investigation into  Chair Powell is yet another attempt by Trump to take control of the  Fed, endangering household finances across the country.

Our economy relies on an independent Federal Reserve, and every  American should be deeply concerned and alarmed by this  administration's dangerous efforts to politicize our central bank.

Interest rate decisions directly impact American households through  inflation, the labor market, savings, and household costs. It is  imperative that these decisions be driven by economic data and  evidence, not partisan pressure.

I ask my colleagues to stand up and use their voices to defend an  independent Fed.
