Pressure Regulatory Organizations to End Chinese Threats to Taiwan Act

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1531, the PROTECT Taiwan Act,  sponsored by Representatives Lucas and Gonzalez.

China continues its provocations toward Taiwan with increasingly  hostile rhetoric and actions. This includes military incursions into  Taiwan's airspace and territorial waters. Thus, I agree with the  sponsors of this bill that Congress must stand up for Taiwan and its  people as they confront this threat.

This is especially true, given the Trump administration's naive,  waffling actions regarding Taiwan's status. It is important that this  body continue to stand up for our decades-long relationship as allies  and trading partners.

This bill is a sensible measure to warn China that the United States  is poised to act should it escalate its aggression toward Taiwan. If  China chooses to do so, the United States would be required to oppose  China's participation in a number of international financial  organizations, including the Bank for International Settlements and the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, we share economic security and democratic values with  our friends from Taiwan. In the face of increasingly hostile words and  actions from China and predictably flimsy support from the President,  it is important that Congress stand strong for the Taiwanese people.

Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
