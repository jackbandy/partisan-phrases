Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3190, the BRAVE Burma Act,  sponsored by Representative Huizenga.

In February of 2021, Burma experienced a military coup that overthrew  the country's democratically elected government.

The military has carried out mass violence against civilians,  including genocide, mass displacement, and other crimes against  humanity. This is particularly true for the nation's Muslim ethnic  minority, which bears the brunt of the illegitimate government's  violent and regressive persecution.

Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes several economic levers available  to the United States. This includes potential sanctions and restricting  Burma's access to support from the International Monetary Fund. These  are sensible steps to demonstrate Congress' continuing support for the  people of Burma.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, this bill aims to address the ongoing  humanitarian crisis in Burma by cutting off revenue sources for the  country's ruthless and illegitimate leadership. Congress must do  whatever is possible to protect human rights, stand for democratic  values, and object to the atrocities committed against the Burmese  people.

Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
