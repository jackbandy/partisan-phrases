Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of an  outstanding South Carolina family and small business whose story  reflects the true American values of hard work, service, and community.  George and Joanna Katergaris along with their children, Mina and Mike,  are the longtime owners of the Wagon Wheel Restaurant in Fort Lawn,  South Carolina.

For nearly five decades, the Wagon Wheel has been a cornerstone of  the community and a gathering place for generations of families all  across Chester County.

George and Joanna came to the United States from Greece in the 1970s  in search of an opportunity and a better life for their family. They  arrived in America with no connections, no government handouts, no  safety net to rely on, and worked their way forward step by step. With  them, they brought a deep respect for the values of faith, family, and  hard work.

When the Katergaris family took ownership of the Wagon Wheel in 1978,  the road ahead was challenging. Their restaurant was located in a  location with dirt roads and one paved road. With dedication and a  clear commitment to quality, they built the restaurant into a beloved  local institution.

Known for its traditional southern cooking and welcoming atmosphere,  the Wagon Wheel quickly became a place where neighbors, friends, and  families gathered year after year. Over time, southern dishes like  fried squash, fresh seasonal vegetables, and homemade dinner rolls  became favorites on the menu, but it is the welcoming atmosphere and  care in every detail that kept people coming back.

The Katergaris family has created an environment defined by quality,  by consistency, and by genuine hospitality.

The connection between the restaurant and its community has always  been strong. Over the years, customers have shown their appreciation in  countless ways, just as the owners have consistently given back through  service and care. This mutual respect reflects the close relationships  that they have grown over generations and made the restaurant a  cornerstone in this area.

Today, the Wagon Wheel continues to thrive under their daughter,  Mina, and her husband, Bill Nixon, who carry on the same traditions and  standards that have guided the restaurant for nearly 50 years. Their  son, Mike, also remains actively involved, especially during the  busiest times of the year. Together, with their dedicated staff, they  have upheld a strong reputation that continues to define the Wagon  Wheel Restaurant.

The story of the Wagon Wheel Restaurant is a testament of their hard  work, their integrity, and their devotion to the community. It reminds  us that real, lasting success is about the people that you treat well  along the way.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the family of South Carolina, I thank  George and Joanna and their family for their many years of service in  Fort Lawn and Chester County. I pray their work continues to inspire  people to lead by their strong values. They epitomize the American  spirit of faith, family, and freedom.
