Recognizing David Camhi


Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional  public servant, David Camhi, whose unwavering dedication to law  enforcement and public safety has made an everlasting impact on his  community.

Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Camhi has exemplified the  highest standards of service, of leadership, and of integrity.

For over 15 years, Mr. Camhi has served with distinction in the New  York Police Department. His leadership, his commitment, and his  generosity have been nothing short of extraordinary. He has led complex  criminal investigations and tactical operations with unparalleled  precision and excellence. His expertise spans critical areas such as  counter-terrorism, crisis management, and investigations, ensuring the  safety of New York City and its residents, this, in spite of the  political winds in New York which have favored the criminal instead of  favoring the victim.

From his roles as special operations sergeant and platoon commander  to integrity control officer, Mr. Camhi has continuously demonstrated  the core  mission of the New York City Police Department: to enhance the quality  of life in New York City by working in partnership with the community  to enforce the law, preserve peace, protect the people, reduce fear,  and maintain order.

In every position that he has held, he has embodied the values of  public service and law enforcement with passion, professionalism, and  courage.

Before his career in law enforcement, Mr. Camhi began his public  service journey as a chief of staff for the New York State Assembly. In  that capacity, he gained invaluable experience in legislative affairs  and policy development, providing him with a unique perspective on  bridging the gap between law enforcement operations and public policy.  This foundation has allowed him to create a more comprehensive approach  to community safety and to fostering collaboration among Federal,  State, and local agencies.

Currently, as the commanding officer of the New York Police  Department's Detective Bureau Tactical Training Unit, Mr. Camhi plays a  vital role in preparing law enforcement officers for the challenges  they face. Under his leadership, the unit provides essential tactical  investigative training to detective bureau personnel, to special  operations units, to military units, and to law enforcement officers at  every level, Federal, State, and local.

Beyond his operational leadership, Mr. Camhi has proven to be a  respected mentor and instructor, shaping the next generation of law  enforcement professionals. His commitment to training ensures that  officers are not only ready for the dangers they face but are also  guided by the highest ethical standards as they serve their  communities.

Through all his professional accomplishments, Mr. Camhi holds one  thing above all: his family. He remains a devoted son, a devoted  husband, and a devoted father, which is a testament to the values that  guide his work and his life. Despite the demands of his career, he was  always present, especially for his son, Sam, making sure that he always  had his dad at every important moment. His dedication was not just to  his job, but to his family.

I would also add that David's father was in law enforcement for a  number of years, and when 9/11 occurred, guess who was first to  volunteer his time to risk his health to go help clean up the damages  of 9/11?

On behalf of the American people, I extend my deepest appreciation  for his tireless efforts and exemplary service. May his leadership and  dedication continue to inspire others for generations to come.

Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for David Camhi.
