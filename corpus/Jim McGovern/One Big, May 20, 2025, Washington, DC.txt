One Big, Beautiful Bill

Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have news for insomniacs. Republicans  have scheduled a Rules Committee meeting on their one big, beautiful  bill at 1 o'clock in the morning.

This is the bill that will cause millions of Americans to lose their  healthcare and nutrition assistance in order the pay for tax breaks for  billionaires. Who does that?

Why are they meeting at 1 o'clock in the morning? It turns out their  big, beautiful bill is really a big, ugly bill.

Republicans don't want you, the American people, to know what they  are doing. Tune in tonight at 1 a.m. Call your Congressperson and tell  them to vote ``no'' on this garbage. Watch as Democrats fight like hell  to protect you, the American people.
