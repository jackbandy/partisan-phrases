Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I recently had the pleasure of visiting  Refettorio Harlem, an incredible nonprofit restaurant and food pantry  in New York City.

Refettorio Harlem is housed in the historic Emanuel AME Church and is  run by Free Food Harlem. With incredible partners like Food for Soul, 2  nights a week, chefs transform perfectly good but unused food into  multicourse fine dining dishes, served free of charge to anyone in  need.

On Wednesday and Friday evenings, Refettorio is bustling with  community and conversation as neighbors come together for a shared meal  and a welcoming space.

During my visit, I tasted a delicious bowl of zero waste ramen with  glazed chicken and bok choy, perfect for a cold winter day.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Jill, Matt, and Bob, and everyone at Refettorio  for taking a few minutes during meal prep to show me around.

Refettorio Harlem is a spectacular example of what is possible when  dedicated, like-minded people come together to not only fight hunger  but also combat food waste. We need to uplift more innovative models  like Refettorio Harlem to end hunger now.
