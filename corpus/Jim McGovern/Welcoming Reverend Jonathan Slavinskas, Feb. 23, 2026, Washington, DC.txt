Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this morning I am honored to have my dear  friend, Father Jonathan Slavinskas, pastor of St. Bernard's Church of  Our Lady of Providence Parish in my hometown of Worcester,  Massachusetts, give today's opening prayer.

Father Jonathan, as he is known by his parishioners, is a true force  of good in the Lincoln Street area. He is always a welcoming and  friendly face who is known for buying pizza for the neighborhood kids  or opening up the gym for pickup basketball games.

He is also the chaplain for both the Worcester Police Department and  the Worcester Fire Department. He cares deeply about our immigrant  community.

Day in and day out, Father Jonathan lives out his Catholic faith in  big and small ways. He shows up for his community and is always there  for his people, especially when they are going through rough times.

Father Jonathan has long been a cherished friend of the entire  McGovern family, especially of my daughter, Molly, who sadly passed  away last April. Lisa and I will forever be grateful to him.

Mr. Speaker, with a friendly smile and a touch of humor, Father  Jonathan goes out of his way to make those around him welcome both in  the church and in the neighborhood. We should all be inspired by his  remarkable example.
