Impact of Proposed Snap Cuts

Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last month Republicans passed a budget  that enables massive cuts that are going to kick people off of food  assistance. Children, seniors, disabled veterans, workers--people who  all rely on SNAP, the Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program, to  help purchase food when times get tough, Republicans want to rip it  away, take food off the tables of hungry Americans.

This is a program that is there for all of us. If you lose your job,  if your hours get cut, if you become disabled or have trouble paying  bills, you can turn to SNAP to help make ends meet.

Republicans don't want to talk about how their cuts are going to hurt  people. They haven't held one hearing or briefing on the program, so  Democrats went around them. We are holding a hearing today at 3 p.m. to  talk about their plan to steal people's food assistance so they can  give tax breaks to billionaires.

We will continue to expose the corruption as we work to end hunger  now.
