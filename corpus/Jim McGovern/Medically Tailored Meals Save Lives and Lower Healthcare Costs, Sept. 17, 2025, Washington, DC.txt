Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, food is medicine, and medically tailored  meals provide people living with chronic illness essential nutrition to  improve their health and keep them out of the hospital.

Incredible providers like Community Servings in my home State of  Massachusetts, God's Love We Deliver in New York City, and dozens of  agencies across the country have proven these meals work.

Among individuals with complex health conditions, MTMs have led to a  70 percent drop in emergency room visits and cut hospital admissions in  half. If all eligible patients received MTMs, studies show that we  could save over $32 billion in the first year alone.

Today, I am reintroducing bipartisan, bicameral legislation with  Representatives Malliotakis, Pingree, Fitzpatrick, and Evans and  Senators Booker, Marshall, Smith, and Cassidy to pilot the coverage of  MTMs in traditional Medicare. Our bill, which expands access to these  lifesaving meals, will lead to billions of dollars in savings without  adding one dime to the deficit.

I urge my colleagues to join the growing bipartisan Food is Medicine  movement and pass our medically tailored meals bill. Let's work  together to end hunger now.
