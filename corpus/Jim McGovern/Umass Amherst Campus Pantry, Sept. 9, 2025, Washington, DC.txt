Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, students at the University of  Massachusetts Amherst recently joined together to address the terrible  problem of food insecurity on their campus. After witnessing--and some  even experiencing--difficulty affording nutritious food, these  remarkable students worked with Chancellor Reyes and his team, the  Amherst Survival Center, and the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts to  establish the UMass Amherst Campus Pantry.

Last Friday, I was proud to stand with them to officially open the  pantry, which is a welcoming space that will provide anyone in the  UMass community with a little extra help when they need it. The shelves  are stocked with nutritious food, including food grown locally by the  incredible farmers in western Massachusetts.

Mr. Speaker, times are tough. Food costs are high and people are  struggling. No community and no college campus in our country are  immune from food insecurity.

I am so proud of the students at UMass Amherst and the administration  for working toward a food-secure campus. I encourage students across  the country to work with their colleges and universities to address  campus food insecurity and finally end hunger now.
