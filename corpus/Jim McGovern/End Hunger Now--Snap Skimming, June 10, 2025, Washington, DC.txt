End Hunger Now--Snap Skimming


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692258/end-hunger-now-snap-skimming


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last December, Democrats and Republicans  negotiated a bipartisan deal to extend the law replacing stolen SNAP  benefits for an additional 4 years.

At the eleventh hour, Speaker Johnson and Republicans reneged on that  deal, blocking reimbursement of stolen SNAP benefits.

Since that time, thieves have stolen $10 million from 20,000 families  in Massachusetts alone, leaving them with decimated food budgets and  nowhere to turn, through no fault of their own.

Now, some Republicans of Congress seem to be just discovering this  problem after being shamed by their constituents. They are rolling out  new bills to reimburse benefits.

I ask my Republican colleagues, where were you in December when the  law expired? Republicans tanked the bipartisan deal to continue benefit  replacement.

We don't need more gratuitous bills from Republicans who just voted  to cut SNAP by $300 billion. We need them to step up and tell Speaker  Johnson to schedule a vote on benefit replacement this week.

Hungry families can't wait another 6 months for relief. Unlike so  many of my Republican colleagues, they don't get invited to fancy  dinners at Mar-a-Lago or billionaire-hosted fundraisers.

Let's get serious and protect families from theft and end hunger now.
