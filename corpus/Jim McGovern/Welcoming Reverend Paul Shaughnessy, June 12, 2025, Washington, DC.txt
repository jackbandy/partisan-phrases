Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an extraordinary  man, a man of faith and courage, Father Paul Shaughnessy. He was born  in Worcester, Massachusetts, and currently serves as a parish priest at  St. Cecilia's Church in Leominster, Massachusetts, but his impact  extends far beyond any district lines.

He is a Jesuit priest and a Navy Chaplain who has dedicated his life  to service. He is a graduate of the College of Holy Cross--a classmate  of my colleague, Congressman Mark DeSaulnier--and also a graduate of  Weston Jesuit School of Theology, and the Naval War College.

Father Shaughnessy served as a member of the Chaplain Corps of the  U.S. Navy and served four tours of duty to Iraq, helping sailors and  marines cope with life-and-death issues, while also providing spiritual  moral guidance. He was a frontline chaplain through brutal fighting in  Iraq with my colleague, Congressman Seth Moulton.

Mr. Speaker, Father Shaughnessy is not just a priest. He is a quiet  force who brings peace and strength to those in the toughest of  circumstances. I am honored to have him here with us today.
