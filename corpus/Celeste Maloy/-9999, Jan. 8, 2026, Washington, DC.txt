Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, it is hard not to smile when I stand here and  talk about Doug LaMalfa, even on this really difficult week because  Doug always made me smile.

From the beginning, he made me feel like I was really special, and I  have learned this week that that is maybe the least special thing about  me because everybody here felt like they were Doug LaMalfa's best  friend.

The night I was sworn in as a Member of Congress, I started getting  texts on my phone from a number I didn't recognize. They were pictures  of me being sworn in from an angle that looked suspiciously like the  House floor, which is against the rules.

I promised him I would never tell anyone where I got those pictures,  so I am not going to tell you, but I still don't know how he had my  number the minute I got sworn in.

He has never missed a chance to get me to sing Utah's State song with  him whether we are in an airport or on the House floor or walking  through the tunnels. He never failed to accompany that with jokes from  ``My Cousin Vinny'' about the ``youts.''

I hope that hearing all of these memories and all of these stories  that people have of Doug will comfort his family, his staff, and  everybody else who is missing him at this difficult time because, even  though I am smiling, I am deeply mourning for my friend, Doug LaMalfa.
