Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, this week, I introduced a bill that would  exempt from Federal Government shutdowns the Federal and independent  agencies that are exclusively or primarily federally funded but have  jurisdiction over local District of Columbia civil and criminal justice  matters. This bill is modeled on a provision I have gotten enacted each  year since the 2013 Federal Government shutdown to exempt the D.C.  government from Federal Government shutdowns.

This bill would exempt the following agencies from Federal Government  shutdowns: the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for D.C.,  the D.C. Courts, the D.C. Public Defender Service, the D.C. Commission  on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure, the D.C. Judicial Nomination  Commission and the D.C. Criminal Justice Coordinating Council. With one  exception, these agencies are not under D.C.'s control. These agencies  provide critical local services to D.C., including law enforcement, and  should continue to function as usual during a Federal Government  shutdown.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
