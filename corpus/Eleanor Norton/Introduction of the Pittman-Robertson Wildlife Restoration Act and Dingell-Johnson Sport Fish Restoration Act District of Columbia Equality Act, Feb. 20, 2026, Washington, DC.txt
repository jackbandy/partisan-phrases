Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Pittman-Robertson  Wildlife Restoration Act and Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act  District of Columbia Equality Act. This bill would make the District of  Columbia eligible for federal funding under the Pittman-Robertson  Wildlife Restoration Act and the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration  Act in the same manner as states. D.C. residents pay the same federal  taxes as residents of the states and, therefore, D.C. should be treated  as a state under federal programs. D.C. has roughly 7,800 acres of  parkland, covering nearly a quarter of the city.

The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act provides funding to  states for five distinct purposes: program administration, wildlife  restoration, basic hunter education and safety, enhanced hunter  education and safety grants and multistate conservation grants. In  general, D.C. is not eligible for funding under this Act.

The Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act provides funding for  sport fish restoration, aquatic education, wetlands restoration and  boat-related activities. Under this Act, each state receives a minimum  of one percent of the total amount apportioned, while D.C. is capped at  one-third of one percent.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
