Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill that would make a  small but respectful change to federal law by adding the Mayor of the  District of Columbia to the list of named principals for whom the  President shall order the U.S. flag be flown at half-staff. Current law  states that the President shall make this order ``upon the death of  principal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a  State, territory, or possession, as a mark of respect to their  memory.'' Surely the D.C. Mayor, who has the same responsibilities as  governors of states and territories, should qualify as such a  principal. This bill is part of our series of bills to ensure equal  treatment for the over 700,000 D.C. residents. In the 116th Congress,  the House Committee on the Judiciary passed this bill.

Congress has already acknowledged that D.C. is entitled to a place  among the states for certain honors. For example, legislation we got  enacted gave D.C. a coin after D.C. was omitted from legislation  creating coins for the states and required the armed services to  display the D.C. flag whenever the flags of the states are displayed.  We got D.C.'s Frederick Douglass and Pierre L'Enfant statues placed in  the Capitol, alongside two statues from each state. We also  successfully worked with the U.S. Postal Service to create a D.C.  stamp, like the stamps for the states, and with the National Park  Service to add the D.C. flag alongside the state flags near Union  Station.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
