Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Protecting Homes from  Trains Act of 2025, which would establish a grant program for the  design and construction of barriers to mitigate rail activity that can  harm homes and their occupants, including derailments, noise and  vibrations. District of Columbia residents frequently tell me about the  negative impact of train noise and vibrations on their lives. Train  noise and vibrations can harm health and quality of life and can even  harm the structural integrity of homes.

As a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and  as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, I  have been working to reduce train noise and vibrations. I have convened  community meetings with the Federal Railroad Administration, the  District of Columbia Department of Transportation and the Federal  Highway Administration. I established the Congressional Quiet Rails  Caucus. I introduced a bill directing the Government Accountability  Office (GAO) to conduct a study on how to reduce train noise and  vibrations near homes. I separately requested GAO to conduct that  study, which it has agreed to do.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
