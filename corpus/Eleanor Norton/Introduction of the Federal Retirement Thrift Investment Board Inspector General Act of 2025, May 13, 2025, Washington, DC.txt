Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Federal Retirement  Thrift Investment Board Inspector General Act of 2025, which would  create an independent Inspector General (IG) for the Federal Retirement  Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB). The FRTIB administers the Thrift  Savings Plan (TSP), the retirement savings and investment plan for  federal employees.

In 2022, the FRTIB launched a new recordkeeping system with the goal  of modernizing TSP's recordkeeping, improving customer service and  bolstering cybersecurity. There were widespread problems with the new  system, including account access, account balances, missing or  incomplete information in accounts and hours-long wait times to reach  customer service. I, along with several colleagues, asked the  Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine the implementation of  the new system. GAO found that FRTIB ``did not fully implement key  acquisition management practices . . . [which] significantly increased  the risk of a problematic rollout of the new system.''

TSP has approximately 7.2 million participants and $937 billion in  assets, making it the world's largest defined contribution plan.  Federal employees dedicate their careers to serving our country, and  they deserve a retirement savings and investment plan that provides  top-tier customer support and security.

While the Employee Benefits Security Administration has oversight  responsibility for TSP, as it does for private sector 401(k) plans,  there is no IG for the FRTIB. The problems with the rollout of the  recordkeeping system are evidence enough that the FRTIB needs an  independent IG.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
