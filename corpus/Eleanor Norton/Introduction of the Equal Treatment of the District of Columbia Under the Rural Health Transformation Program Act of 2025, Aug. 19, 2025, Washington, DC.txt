Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Equal Treatment of  the District of Columbia Under the Rural Health Transformation Program  Act of 2025, which would make the District of Columbia eligible for  funding under the Rural Health Transformation Program (Program). The  $50 billion Program was established by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act  (H.R. 1). While the Program's title refers to rural health, H.R. 1  permits the Program's funds to be used for health care services,  providers and technology outside rural areas.

Senate Republicans, who created the Program, made only the 50 states  eligible for funding, likely depriving D.C. of hundreds of millions of  dollars. D.C. is treated as a state for most federal programs because  D.C. residents pay the same federal taxes as residents of states, and  there is no reason D.C. should not be eligible for the Program's funds.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
