Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia  Non-Discrimination Home Rule Act of 2025, which would end the  applicability of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)  to the District of Columbia government. This bill would treat the D.C.  government in the same manner as state governments under RFRA, and  allow D.C. to protect LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights.

RFRA, which provides more protection for religious exercise than the  First Amendment requires, applies to the federal government and the  D.C. government, but not to state governments.

While RFRA was designed to be a shield to protect religious freedom,  it is being used, as evidenced by the Supreme Court's 2014 Hobby Lobby  decision, as a sword to discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community and  women. Republicans in Congress have cited RFRA as a justification for  trying to overturn D.C. non-discrimination laws. For example, since  2015, Republicans have repeatedly tried to nullify or block D.C.'s  Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014, which  prohibits employers from discriminating against employees and their  families based on reproductive health decisions, claiming, in part,  that it violates RFRA.

This bill would help ensure that D.C. is able to enact and carry out  non-discrimination laws. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  bill.
