Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Government  Accountability Office District of Columbia Home Rule Act. This bill  would repeal the authority of the U.S. Government Accountability Office  (GAO) over the District of Columbia.

GAO, a federal agency that conducts investigations and audits for  Congress, has the same authority over D.C. that it has over federal  agencies. GAO's authorizing statute defines D.C. as a federal agency.  In addition, GAO's authorizing statute and the D.C. Home Rule Act  require GAO to engage in specific types of oversight of D.C.

D.C. is not a federal agency, and it should never be treated as such.  D.C. already has a locally appointed auditor and inspector general, so  GAO's authority over D.C. is both redundant and offensive. GAO does not  have general authority over states and cities, and therefore it should  not have such authority over D.C.

This bill is an important step to increase home rule for D.C. I urge  my colleagues to support this bill.
