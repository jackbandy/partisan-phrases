Introduction of the Salary History Question Prohibition Act of 2025


Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Salary History  Question Prohibition Act of 2025, which would help reduce the gender  and racial pay gap by prohibiting employers from asking job applicants  for their salary history before making a job or salary offer. Even  though many employers may not intentionally discriminate against  applicants based on gender or race, setting pay based on salary history  can reinforce the pay gap. Members of historically disadvantaged groups  often start their careers with unfair and artificially low pay compared  to their white male counterparts, and these disparities compound  throughout their careers. The House passed this bill as part of the  Paycheck Fairness Act in the 116th and 117th Congresses.

There is much work to do to end the pay gap. This bill represents a  crucial step towards that goal. I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.
