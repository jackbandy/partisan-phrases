Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia  Clemency Home Rule Act, which would give the District of Columbia  exclusive authority to grant clemency for D.C. crimes. Currently, the  president exercises the authority to grant clemency for D.C.  crimes, though presidents rarely do so. D.C. residents deserve a say in  whether their fellow residents deserve mercy. In the 117th Congress,  the House Committee on Oversight and Reform passed this bill as part of  the District of Columbia Home Rule Expansion Act of 2022 (H.R. 8861).

While D.C. law appears to give the mayor authority to grant clemency  for certain D.C. crimes (D.C. Code 1-301.76), under current practice,  clemency petitions for D.C. crimes, like federal crimes, are submitted  to the Department of Justice for the president's consideration.

The states and territories have full control over their criminal  justice systems, including clemency. D.C. also should have full control  over its criminal justice system. Since the D.C. Council has authority  to enact local D.C. laws, D.C. officials are in the best position to  grant clemency for D.C. crimes. This bill would give D.C. authority to  use any type of clemency system.

This bill is an important step in expanding D.C. home rule. I urge my  colleagues to support it.
