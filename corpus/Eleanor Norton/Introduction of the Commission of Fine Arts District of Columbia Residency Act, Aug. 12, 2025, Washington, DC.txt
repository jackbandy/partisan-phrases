Introduction of the Commission of Fine Arts District of Columbia Residency Act


Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Commission of Fine  Arts District of Columbia Residency Act. This bill would require that a  majority of the members of the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) be  District of Columbia residents.

Under federal law and presidential executive orders (EOs), the CFA  has review authority for federal property in D.C., certain military  property, certain coins and medals, D.C.-owned parks and buildings and  certain private land in D.C. Under the EOs, CFA has review authority  for the design of D.C.-owned parks and buildings. Under the Shipstead- Luce Act, CFA has review authority for the design of private buildings  in D.C. ``adjacent to public buildings and grounds of major  importance,'' such as Rock Creek Park and the Potomac riverfront. Under  the Old Georgetown Act, the CFA has review authority for the design of  private buildings in the part of Georgetown referred to as ``Old  Georgetown'' in the act.

Residency requirements for government positions are found in federal,  state and D.C. law, including for members of the National Capital  Planning Commission. The primary reason such laws exist is so that  government officials have a connection to the residents they serve and  knowledge of the unique issues and challenges faced by residents.

I have also introduced the Commission of Fine Arts District of  Columbia Home Rule Act, which would remove the authority of the CFA  over non-federal property in D.C. However, until that bill is enacted,  a majority of the members should be D.C. residents.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
