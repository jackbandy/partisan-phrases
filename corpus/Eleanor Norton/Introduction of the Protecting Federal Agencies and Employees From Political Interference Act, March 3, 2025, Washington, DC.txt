Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the Protecting Federal  Agencies and Employees from Political Interference Act, which would  prohibit the relocation outside of the National Capital Region (NCR) of  the headquarters for any federal agency located in the NCR or any  federal employee position with a duty station in the NCR. Last week,  the Trump administration directed federal agencies to submit ``proposed  relocations of agency bureaus and offices from Washington, DC and the  National Capital Region to less-costly parts of the country.''

The first Trump administration relocated a few agencies outside the  NCR, which harmed the operations of the agencies and deprived the  federal government of the expertise of experienced federal employees.  For example, in 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture relocated the  Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and  Agriculture from the NCR to Kansas City. A 2022 Government  Accountability Office report found that the relocation led to the  agencies ``losing . . . institutional knowledge and critical  expertise.'' As a former head of ERS said in 2021, ``The agencies have  been decimated. Their ability to perform the functions they were  created to perform--it doesn't exist anymore.''

Employees in the headquarters for the agencies located in the NCR  perform the indispensable work of keeping Congress informed of agency  activities. Congress cannot write laws or conduct oversight without the  critical information provided by agencies.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
