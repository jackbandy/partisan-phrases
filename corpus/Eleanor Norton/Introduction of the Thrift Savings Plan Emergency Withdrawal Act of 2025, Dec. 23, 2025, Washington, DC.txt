Introduction of the Thrift Savings Plan Emergency Withdrawal Act of 2025


Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Thrift Savings Plan  Emergency Withdrawal Act of 2025, which would expand the circumstances  in which a federal employee recently separated from the federal  government can take a penalty-free withdrawal from their Thrift Savings  Plan (TSP) account. This bill would help former federal employees pay  their bills after separation.

First, this bill would allow a penalty-free withdrawal to make up the  gap between the interim payments a retiree receives during the period  the Office of Personnel Management is calculating the retiree's final  annuity and the estimated final annuity. A retiree's interim payment is  generally only 60 percent to 80 percent of the finalized net payment.  Second, this bill would allow a penalty-free withdrawal if an  individual is involuntarily separated from the federal government. In  both cases, the maximum withdrawal would be $100,000. Individuals would  be able to make a withdrawal for up to a year after separation and to  repay the withdrawn amount within three years to avoid the existing  early withdrawal penalty, which is a 10 percent additional tax.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
