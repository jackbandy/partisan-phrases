Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Postal Facilities  Security Camera Act. This bill would require, subject to  appropriations, the United States Postal Service (USPS) to install  security cameras at each postal facility to protect USPS employees,  customers and property. This bill would also authorize appropriations  to carry out the camera program.

I asked USPS to expand the use of security cameras at postal  facilities in the District of Columbia and across the country after  learning that a D.C. resident had been robbed in the parking lot of a  post office in D.C. The parking lot was not monitored by a security  camera. USPS responded that it was not financially feasible to install  and maintain security cameras at every postal facility.

USPS should have security cameras monitoring its facilities--both  inside and outside--to protect employees, customers and property.  Security cameras can deter crime and assist in arrests and  prosecutions.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
