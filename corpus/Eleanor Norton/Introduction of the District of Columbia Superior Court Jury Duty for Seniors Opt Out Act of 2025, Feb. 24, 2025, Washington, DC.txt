Introduction of the District of Columbia Superior Court Jury Duty for Seniors Opt Out Act of 2025


Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia  Superior Court Jury Duty for Seniors Opt Out Act of 2025, which would  allow individuals 70 years of age or older to opt out of jury service  in D.C.'s local trial court, the Superior Court.

Most federal courts allow individuals 70 years of age or older to opt  out of jury service, including the federal district court for D.C. A  majority of states have similar provisions for their courts.

Under the D.C. Home Rule Act, the D.C. Council does not have  authority to amend title 11 of the D.C. Code (relating to organization  and jurisdiction of the local D.C. courts). This bill would amend title  11.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
