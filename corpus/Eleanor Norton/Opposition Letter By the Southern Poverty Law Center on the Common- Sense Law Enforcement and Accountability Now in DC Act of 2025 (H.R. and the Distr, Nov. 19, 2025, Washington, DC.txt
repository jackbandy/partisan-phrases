Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, the House of Representatives debated  the Common-Sense Law Enforcement and Accountability Now in DC Act of  2025 (H.R. 5107) and the District of Columbia Cash Bail Reform Act of  2025 (H.R. 5214). I include in the Record a letter opposing these bills  by the Southern Poverty Law Center.                                     Southern Poverty Law Center,                                  Montgomery, AL, November 18, 2025.                     Vote NO on H.R. 5107 and H.R. 5214

Dear Representative: On behalf of the Southern Poverty Law       Center, a civil rights organization committed to advancing       racial justice, public safety, and democratic accountability,       we write to urge you to vote NO on two deeply harmful bills--      H.R. 5107 and H.R. 5214--that together constitute a direct       assault on the District of Columbia's right to self-govern       and on decades of evidence-based progress in public safety.       Far from addressing genuine community needs, these proposals       would drag the District backward into punitive ``tough on       crime'' strategies that have already devastated Black and       Brown communities nationwide while failing to make anyone       safer.

Further criminalization and incarceration are not the       answer to complex societal challenges rooted in poverty,       inequality, and disinvestment. True public safety comes not       from harsh punishment, but from transforming the criminal       legal system, investing in community-based supports, and       reimagining safety in ways that are fair, effective, and       rooted in public health. The District's recent reforms--      including the accountability measures strengthened under the       Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of       2022, which H.R. 5107 seeks to overturn, and its long-      standing risk-based pretrial system, which H.R. 5214 would       upend--reflect precisely this kind of thoughtful, data-driven       policymaking. These reforms enjoy broad public support, align       with national best practices, and have contributed to       meaningful gains: D.C.'s crime rate is now the lowest it has       been in 30 years, and violent crime fell 35 percent from 2023       to 2024.

These achievements were not accidental. They are the result       of decades of community organizing, research-informed policy,       and consistent engagement with impacted residents. They       reflect a growing national consensus that smart, preventative       investments are more effective than reactionary       criminalization--and they save taxpayer dollars by shifting       scarce resources away from mass incarceration and toward       education, housing, mental health, and violence prevention.

H.R. 5107 and H.R. 5214 would undo this progress. By       stripping away essential police accountability measures and       re-imposing wealth-based pretrial detention, these bills       would re-entrench systems that have already been proven       ineffective, discriminatory, and fiscally irresponsible. They       would override the will of D.C. residents, destabilize       communities, and reinstate practices that make the District       less safe.

The residents of Washington, D.C., like those of any other       jurisdiction, deserve the right to elect leaders who       determine their own laws, public safety policies, and budget.       Yet these bills, introduced under the guise of improving       safety, are part of a broader political effort to impose       ideologically driven federal control on Black-led cities and       to roll back successful reforms through fear-based narratives       about ``law and order.'' This is not about safety; it is       about weaponizing federal power to score political points and       undermine civil rights protections. An administration that       truly cared about public safety would not have rescinded       hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants for gun       violence prevention, victim services, and community-based       safety programs.

We urge Congress to reject these attacks on D.C.'s       autonomy. Allowing such federal overreach would set a       dangerous precedent for undermining local governance       nationwide, particularly in jurisdictions with progressive or       Black leadership. This fight is not just about the District       of Columbia, it is about protecting democracy, equity, and       self-determination in communities across the country.      Vote NO on H.R. 5214--``District of Columbia Cash Bail Reform           Act of 2025''

This bill seeks to do two things: create a list of offenses       for which a person must be detained for the entire pretrial       period based solely on what they were charged with, without       regard for the particular circumstances and without providing       due process; and create a list of offenses for which a person       must pay money in order to be released from pretrial       detention, even if they do not pose a risk to public safety       or a risk of flight. This bill would create a wealth-based,       two-tiered system of justice that benefits the multibillion-      dollar for-profit bail industry, all without improving public       safety.      Money bail creates a two-tiered system of justice without           protecting public safety

Money bail has created a two-tiered justice system--one       that privileges wealth over safety. It allows people with       money to purchase their freedom regardless of the risk they       pose to others, while those without financial means remain       jailed even when they present no threat This system doesn't       ask whether someone is dangerous; it only asks whether they       can pay. The result is a system where wealth, not justice,       determines who waits for trial at home and who waits behind       bars.

By setting a price on freedom, cash bail effectively       divides our justice system into two: one for the wealthy and       one for everyone else. Those who can afford bail walk free;       those who cannot are punished for their poverty without even       having been convicted of anything. Beyond being fundamentally       unfair, this practice undermines public safety. Pretrial       detention destabilizes lives--causing people to lose their       jobs, homes, or even custody of their children. Research       shows that the likelihood of a future arrest jumps from 24       percent after one day in jail to 45 percent after three days,       proof that unnecessary detention fuels instability and       recidivism. When someone cannot afford bail, they can sit in       jail for days, months, or even years without a conviction.       That is not justice--it is punishment for being poor.      Jurisdictions that have reformed their bail practices have           been successful

Every person deserves to live in a community that is safe,       fair, and just. Bail reform advances that goal by ensuring       that decisions about pretrial detention are based on public       safety--not on a person's wealth. Across the country, study       after study has proven that jurisdictions that have reformed       or eliminated cash bail have made their systems fairer       without increasing crime. Judges       who focus on safety rather than money make decisions that       better protect both individuals and their communities.

The results speak for themselves. After Illinois eliminated       cash bail, violent crime dropped by 7 percent and property       crime by 14 percent. New Jersey's reforms led to a 20 percent       reduction in violent crime while maintaining high court       appearance rates. In Harris County, Texas, ending cash bail       for most misdemeanors did not increase crime. A nationwide       study by the Brennan Center for Justice found the same       pattern across nearly two dozen jurisdictions: bail reform       does not lead to higher crime. The data is consistent and       compelling--bail reform enhances justice and preserves       safety, despite fearmongering from its opponents.      D.C.'s risk-based bail system has served as a national model           since 1992

For more than three decades, Washington, D.C. has shown       that a justice system without cash bail can work, and work       well. Since 1992, judges in D.C. have made pretrial decisions       based on a person's risk to public safety rather than their       ability to pay. The outcomes are impressive: in the last four       years, 88 percent of people released pretrial in D.C.       remained completely arrest-free, and 98 percent remained free       from arrest for violent offenses. These numbers demonstrate       that when freedom is tied to fairness, not finances,       communities are safer and more stable.

Under D.C.'s system, judges assess risk through evidence-      based hearings. Detention is used only when no safe       alternative exists, ensuring that pretrial incarceration is a       rare and deliberate outcome--not the default. D.C. also       invests in supportive pretrial services such as court date       reminders, transportation assistance, and access to mental       health care. These measures help people appear in court and       stay on track, strengthening both accountability and public       safety. Transparent hearings and timely decisions make the       process fair, fast, and equitable--showing that justice does       not have to come at the expense of compassion.      Mandatory cash bail only benefits the multibillion-dollar           for-profit bail industry

Mandatory cash bail doesn't protect communities--it       protects profits. The effort to roll back bail reform is a       handout to the for-profit bail industry, which thrives on the       desperation of working families. Bail bonds function like       predatory payday loans: families must pay a nonrefundable fee       to a bail bondsman, money they never get back--even if       charges are dropped. This $2 billion-a-year industry depends       entirely on maintaining cash bail, because without it, its       exploitative business model collapses.

The bail industry has built a powerful political machine to       protect its profits. The American Bail Coalition, its chief       lobbying group, spends millions to oppose reform efforts       across the country. It has partnered with well-funded       conservative organizations to push legislation that       criminalizes charitable bail funds--programs that help       families avoid these predatory practices. In short, mandatory       cash bail enriches a few at the expense of justice, safety,       and the public good. Congress should not allow corporate       greed to dictate who sits in jail and who walks free.      Mandatory pretrial detention based on charge alone violates           the Constitution

The proposed bill's provision requiring automatic pretrial       detention based solely on the charge is not only unjust--it       is almost certainly unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court       made this clear in United States v. Salerno, holding that       pretrial detention must be a ``carefully limited exception,''       not the rule. Detaining someone without an individualized       hearing strips them of due process and violates one of our       most fundamental constitutional rights: the presumption of       innocence. Liberty cannot be taken away solely based on       accusation, without more.

We are not aware of a single jurisdiction in the country       that allows detention based solely on the nature of the       charge, and for good reason--it would not withstand       constitutional scrutiny. This bill would set a dangerous       precedent, eroding basic civil liberties and undermining       decades of legal precedent that protect fairness in our       criminal justice system.        Vote NO on H.R. 5107--``The Common Sense Law Enforcement and                      Accountability in D.C. Now Act''

Congress should reject H.R. 5107 because it would override       critical public-safety reforms adopted unanimously by the       District of Columbia Council in the Comprehensive Policing       and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022--reforms designed to       hold officers accountable, improve transparency, and       strengthen community trust. These are not abstract ideals;       they were enacted in response to concrete, well-documented       failures within the Metropolitan Police Department.      The D.C. reforms were necessary to hold officers accountable           for serious misconduct

Before the Act, D.C. had no effective mechanism to remove       officers who engaged in egregious criminal behavior. A 2021       audit revealed that at least 64 officers were found by       internal investigators to have committed criminal misconduct.       The department attempted to fire 24 of those officers--but 21       were shielded by procedural barriers, often driven by union       intervention. Even more troubling, the department made no       attempt to fire more than 40 officers involved in criminal       conduct such as drunk driving, harassment, property damage,       theft, and stalking. Every officer credibly accused of       domestic violence remained on the force, including one       officer who admitted to punching his wife so hard in the face       that he fractured her eye socket, and another officer who       used a car to run over the mother of his child. Some officers       remain on the force due to the powerful police union's       refusal to allow officers to be held accountable. This was       true for a D.C. officer who, ultimately, remained on the       force after having been convicted of sexually assaulting a       woman in his patrol car.

The Act responded to these failures by streamlining the       process for removing officers who commit serious misconduct       and by prohibiting agencies from hiring officers with known       records of abuse. It also established a police-misconduct       database to prevent the well-documented problem of       ``wandering officers''--individuals fired or forced out for       misconduct who quietly move to new departments. States like       Florida and Texas have documented hundreds to thousands of       such cases annually. There are almost 1,100 wandering       officers in any given year in Florida; in Texas, about a       quarter of law enforcement officers fired for misconduct were       subsequently hired by another law enforcement agency.       Weakening the Act would mean turning a blind eye to the       recycling of abusive officers. Databases to keep track of       officer misconduct help law enforcement agencies avoid       unknowingly hiring an officer with documented behavioral       problems.      The Act includes essential safeguards to address excessive           use of force

D.C. law enforcement reports roughly 2,300 use-of-force       incidents every year--a number that demands oversight,       especially since a small group of officers account for a       disproportionate share of these incidents. Eighty-six       officers reported five or more uses of force, and 17 reported       at least 10. Use of force overwhelmingly targets Black       residents, who are the subjects in roughly 94% of documented       incidents. Importantly, these numbers reflect only cases       officers self-reported, meaning the true numbers are likely       far higher.

To confront these issues, the Act created a Use of Force       Review Board, required robust de-escalation training, and       mandated public release of body-worn camera footage after       shootings and other serious events. Jurisdictions that       release such footage consistently see improved community       trust and enhanced transparency. Body cameras provide an       impartial record, encourage better policing practices, and       allow communities to participate meaningfully in oversight.       These policies do not endanger public safety--they strengthen       it.      Transparency and accountability lead to safer communities

Contrary to fear-based narratives, reforms that require       accountability do not undermine law enforcement; they help       restore public confidence and encourage collaboration between       police and the communities they serve. As the District's       Attorney General has explained, ``the Comprehensive Policing       and Justice Reform Amendment Act is designed to improve       public safety by strengthening cooperation between officers       of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and the community       they serve. This legislation is essential in ensuring the       swift and certain discipline of officers who use excessive       force or violate constitutional rights, which will go far to       improve trust and mutual respect between police officers and       the community.''

By overturning D.C.'s locally enacted reforms, H.R. 5107       would reinstate a system where officers who commit serious       misconduct remain on the force, where excessive use of force       goes unaddressed, and where transparency is weakened.       Congress should respect D.C.'s democratic process, support       evidence-based public-safety measures, and vote NO on H.R.       5107.

In this pivotal moment, Congress has a choice: to respect       the District's democratic will and its proven, evidence-based       approach to public safety, or to impose regressive federal       mandates that endanger civil rights, destabilize communities,       and undermine decades of progress. H.R. 5107 and H.R. 5214       are not solutions--they are setbacks that would weaken       accountability, revive discriminatory practices, and replace       effective reforms with policies long discredited by research       and experience. We urge you to stand with the residents of       Washington, D.C., to uphold the principles of local self-      governance, and to vote NO on these bills. The nation is       watching, and your leadership in defending justice, equity,       and democracy is essential.
