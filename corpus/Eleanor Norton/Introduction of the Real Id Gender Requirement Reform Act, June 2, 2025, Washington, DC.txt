Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the REAL ID Gender  Requirement Reform Act, which would repeal the requirement in the REAL  ID Act that REAL ID-compliant licenses include gender. Instead, states  would decide whether to include gender on their respective REAL ID- compliant licenses. I am pleased Representative Maxwell Frost is co- leading this bill.

Under this bill, if a state includes gender on its REAL ID-compliant  licenses, the state must allow individuals to change the gender  designation on their license through self-attestation. It would also  require states that include gender on their REAL ID-compliant licenses  to have a neutral or other designation gender field, in addition to  male or female.

Under the REAL ID Act, gender must be included on a license. This can  be problematic for transgender and nonbinary individuals. I recognize  that some LGBTQ+ individuals do not want gender designations on  licenses at all, while others do want gender designation so as to  express their identity. I believe this bill strikes the middle ground,  while showing Congress' support for LGBTQ+ individuals.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
