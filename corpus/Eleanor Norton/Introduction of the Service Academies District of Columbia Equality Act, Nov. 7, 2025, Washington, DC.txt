Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Service Academies  District of Columbia Equality Act, which would give the District of  Columbia the same number of appointments and nominations to the U.S.  service academies as states. Currently, each member of the House and  each senator is allocated five appointments to each service academy-- the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Air  Force Academy--and each member of the House and each senator is allowed  15 nominations for each appointment. Therefore, since D.C. has no  senators, D.C. is deprived of 10 appointments and, assuming all  appointments are vacant, 150 nominations to each service academy.  Senator Tim Kaine has introduced the companion bill.

This bill would provide equality for D.C. residents who choose to  serve their country by applying to a service academy. It is remarkable  that D.C. residents volunteer to fight and die for a country that  denies them statehood, voting representation in Congress and full home  rule. D.C. servicemembers have helped secure voting rights for people  around the world, yet have always been denied those same rights when  they returned home. D.C. residents, who pay the same federal taxes as  residents of states, deserve the same opportunity as residents of  states to attend our prestigious service academies.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
