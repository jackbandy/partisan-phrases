Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Restroom Access Act  of 2025, which would require a retail establishment to provide an  individual who has a medical condition requiring immediate use of a  restroom, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, access to an  employee-only restroom when such an establishment does not have a  public restroom. Individuals would be required to present a Department  of Labor-issued identification card certifying that they have an  eligible medical condition.

Individuals who have certain medical conditions need immediate access  to a restroom. When public restrooms are not available, these  individuals may experience uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. As  long as there are no safety concerns, which this bill addresses, these  individuals should be able to use an employee-only restroom.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
