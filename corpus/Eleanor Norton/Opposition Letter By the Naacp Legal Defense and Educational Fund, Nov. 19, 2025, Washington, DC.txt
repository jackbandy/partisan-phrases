Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, the House of Representatives debated  the Common-Sense Law Enforcement and Accountability Now in DC Act of  2025 (H.R. 5107) and the District of Columbia Cash Bail Reform Act of  2025 (H.R. 5214). I include in the Record a letter opposing these bills  by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.                                              Legal Defense Fund,                                                  November 18, 2025.      Re ``Vote No'' on H.R. 5107 and H.R. 5214.       Hon. Mike Johnson,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      House Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.

Dear Speaker Johnson and Minority Leader Jeffries: The       NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF) strongly       opposes The Common Sense Law Enforcement and Accountability       in D.C. Now Act (H.R. 5107), and The D.C. Cash Bail Reform       Act (H.R. 5214). These bills will make the District of       Columbia (D.C. or the District) less safe and just.       Congresses must cease these repeated attempts--against the       will of D.C. residents and locally elected leadership--to       override D.C. laws that were enacted by and for the District.       We urge all members to ``Vote No'' on these harmful bills.   Commonsense policing reforms have not hindered historic low crime rates                                  in D.C.

H.R. 5107 would strike down, without sufficient       justification, the majority of Comprehensive Policing and       Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 (CPJRAA), which enacted       police transparency and accountability measures informed by       the recommendations of the D.C. Police Reform Commission, a       body of retired law enforcement, community leaders, experts,       and directly impacted residents. While only two years of       crime data is available since the implementation of the       CPJRAA, that data shows drops in violent crime each year       following the passage of the law in 2024 and again in 2025.       Therefore, the CPJRAA's passage, at a minimum, had no       negative impact on public safety in D.C. In fact, after the       CPJRAA was enacted, D.C. saw a 30-year low in violent crime       and thus the law is associated with MPD's successful crime       reduction efforts.

The 2022 D.C. statute also includes measures D.C. residents       deemed important such as mandatory public release of body       worn camera footage within five days of officer-involved       deaths or serious bodily injury, strengthened civilian       oversight of police use of force, limitations on consent       searches, requiring additional law enforcement training on       racial bias and de-escalation tactics, the creation of public       databases of sustained officer misconduct cases, and the       prohibition of the possession or acquisition of military       weapons by law enforcement agencies.

Historically criminal justice laws and policies have been       determined by local jurisdiction based on their specific       needs. Several other jurisdictions have enacted policies       similar to those in the CPJRAA. States across the country       have enacted policies like these because many believe that       holding law enforcement accountable for abuse of power and       racial bias can deter misconduct. Some jurisdictions have       seen reduction of crime after holding law enforcement       accountable for violating the law and their department       policies.

Moreover, the power provided through the CPJRAA to remove       disciplinary matters from collective bargaining was much-      needed. Before the law's enactment, a 2022 report from the       Office of the District of Columbia Auditor found that the       reinstatement of 36 fired Metropolitan Police Department D.C.       (MPD) officers had cost the city $14.3 million in back pay.       Notably, 15 of the reinstated officers had been terminated       for misconduct classified as a ``threat to safety'' which       includes cases when an officer imposed risk or harm to       people, through action or inaction, including physical or       sexual violence and mishandling firearms. The CPJRAA, by       excluding disciplinary matters from collective bargaining,       offered an opportunity to improve MPD's accountability system       which benefits the public and officers alike. The       reinstatement of ``bad cops'' has also been shown to       demoralize officers who observe their colleagues return to       the force despite their failure to abide by policies or laws.

Without due process mandatory pretrial detention jeopardizes liberty

H.R. 5214 would reinstitute cash bail and create mandatory       detention for a person charged with certain offenses before       even going to trial. Requiring a person merely charged with       an offense to be detained pretrial with no opportunity for a       hearing to challenge the detention raises serious due process       concerns, as there is no opportunity for the court to       determine if this serious deprivation of liberty is       justified. This legislation would significantly change the       system D.C. has had in place since 1992, that has produced       higher appearance rates than the national average without       wealth-based pretrial detention. Between 1990 and 2009 the       number of people charged with an offense who received cash       bail jumped from 37 percent to 61 percent. Cash bail has,       historically, disproportionately impacted low-income Black       communities while disparities in the Black-white wealth gap       persists amidst racially discriminatory policies that have       not been       fully addressed. Overall Black and Brown defendants are 10-25       percent more likely than white defendants to be held       pretrial, and that number skyrockets to 50 percent for young       Black men compared with white defendants. Not only would       Black men be placed in pretrial detention at a       disproportionate rate, but in 2022, The U.S. Commission on       Civil Rights found that Black men received bail amounts 35       percent higher than white men and 16 percent higher than       Latino men. The presence of cash bail destabilizes people's       lives, with pretrial detention increasing the probability of       both being convicted and being imprisoned, and contributes to       the cycle of limiting upward mobility for Black people in       D.C. by potentially hindering employment while jailed.

Further, the rationale behind reinstituting cash bail is to       protect public safety by ensuring that law enforcement is not       forced to repeatedly arrest the same ``dangerous       individuals.'' However, in D.C., of the 88 percent of       individuals who are released before trial, 89 percent remain       arrest-free, with only 1 percent arrested for a violent       crime. Nationwide, this trend is consistent, with no       statistically significant link between bail reform and       increases in crime. In fact, data shows that placing someone       in pre-trial detention for any length of time actually       increases the likelihood that they will be re-arrested and       sentenced to prison in the future. As a result, H.R. 5214       will not live up to its purpose, and will instead, create       further barriers for the low-income Black community in D.C.

We all want our communities to feel safe for all who reside       and visit, and the District of Columbia is no different. The       changes proposed by these bills have proven to be ineffective       in deterring crime and will only further the loss of key       community resources. Additionally, data shows that members of       the D.C. community know best when addressing criminal justice       policies within their community. They deserve the right to       determine their own policies and laws. We strongly urge all       members to vote ``NO'' on H.R. 5107, and H.R. 5214.
