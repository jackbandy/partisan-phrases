Introduction of the Salary Transparency Act

Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Salary Transparency  Act, which would require employers to provide the salary range for jobs  in advertisements and interviews and to existing employees.

Several states have enacted laws relating to salary range disclosure,  and the Federal Government should follow their lead and make salary  range disclosure a national requirement. Salary transparency is an  important tool to combat the gender and race pay gap. Salary secrecy  facilitates both intentional and unintentional pay discrimination and  perpetuates the pay gap.

Studies have consistently shown that when women negotiate for their  salaries, they negotiate for less than similarly situated men.  Frequently, this is because the salary they request is a certain  percentage higher than their current salary. Because women on average  make less than men, this practice perpetuates the pay gap. The same is  true for people of color, who earn less on average than their white  counterparts. Requiring employers to disclose the salary range for a  job will help address this harmful aspect of salary negotiations and  lead to a reduction in the gender and race pay gap.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
