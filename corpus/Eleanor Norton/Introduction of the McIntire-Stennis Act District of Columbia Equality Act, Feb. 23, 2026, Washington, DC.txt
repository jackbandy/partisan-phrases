Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the McIntire-Stennis Act  District of Columbia Equality Act, which would make the District of  Columbia eligible for funding under the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative  Forestry Act (Act) in the same manner as states.

The Act provides funding to states and certain territories for  forestry research programs. The funding assists states and territories  in carrying out forestry research programs at state forestry schools  and colleges and developing a trained pool of forest scientists capable  of conducting forestry research.

D.C. residents pay the same federal taxes as residents of states and  therefore D.C. is almost always treated as a state under federal  programs. The Act defines ``State'' to include Puerto Rico, the Virgin  Islands and Guam, whose residents do not pay full federal taxes. D.C.'s  exclusion from the Act makes it ineligible for funding that would  support research at D.C.'s public university, the University of the  District of Columbia (UDC). The College of Agriculture, Urban  Sustainability and Environmental Sciences at UDC, the Nation's only  urban land-grant university, offers programs that complement D.C.'s  ongoing forestry efforts and serve individuals in D.C. and beyond.  Rectifying D.C.'s exclusion from the Act would ensure equal treatment  for D.C. and provide UDC a fair share of resources.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
