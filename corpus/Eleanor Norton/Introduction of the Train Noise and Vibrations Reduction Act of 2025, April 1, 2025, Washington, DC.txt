Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Train Noise and  Vibrations Reduction Act of 2025, which would direct the Government  Accountability Office (GAO) to submit a report to Congress containing  recommendations on how to reduce train noise and vibrations near homes,  as well as estimates of the costs and benefits of each such  recommendation. The report would include recommendations regarding  modifications to trains, tracks and maintenance procedures, speed  limits, mitigation measures between tracks and homes, the distance  between tracks and homes, limits on the number of trains and the number  of cars on trains, limits on hours of operations, building noise  insulation and modifications to soil conditions. The report would be  due to Congress no later than one year after the enactment of this  bill.

I hear from District of Columbia residents frequently about the  negative impact of train noise and vibrations on their lives. The noise  and vibrations can harm health and quality of life and can even damage  the structural integrity of homes. As a senior member of the Committee  on Transportation and Infrastructure and as the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, I have been committed to reducing  transportation noise pollution. I have convened community meetings with  the Federal Railroad Administration, the D.C. Department of  Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration to examine how to  reduce train noise and vibrations. A GAO report on reducing train noise  and vibrations can help us identify viable, long-term solutions for  communities.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
