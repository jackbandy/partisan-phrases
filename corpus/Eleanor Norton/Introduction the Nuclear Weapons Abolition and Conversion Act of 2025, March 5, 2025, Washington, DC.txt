Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Nuclear Weapons  Abolition and Conversion Act of 2025. This bill would require the  United States, beginning on the date that the president certifies to  Congress that all countries possessing nuclear weapons have begun the  verifiable and irreversible elimination of such weapons under the  Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (Treaty), to redirect  resources that are being used for nuclear weapons programs to be used  for addressing the climate crisis and human and infrastructure needs,  such as housing, health care and restoring the environment.

In 1993, District of Columbia peace activists were successful in  getting a ballot initiative in D.C. passed that called for nuclear  disarmament. Since then, I have introduced a bill each Congress based  on that initiative, including this bill. In March 2019, the D.C.  Council passed a ``Sense of the Council'' resolution urging the United  States to approve the Treaty. These actions show that D.C. residents  were early, prescient leaders on this important issue. It seems that  the rest of the world is, thankfully, starting to catch up to D.C.

As the only Nation that has used nuclear weapons in war, and that  still possesses one of the largest nuclear weapons arsenals, this bill  would help the United States reestablish its moral leadership in the  world.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
