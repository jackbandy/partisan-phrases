Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia  Courts and Public Defender Service Employment Non-Discrimination Act,  which would provide for coverage of employees of the local D.C. courts  and the D.C. Public Defender Service (PDS) under the D.C. Human Rights  Act of 1977 (DCHRA). In 2022, the D.C. Court of Appeals  held that the DCHRA, which protects employees of the D.C. government  and private employers from discrimination, is inapplicable to employees  of the local D.C. courts. The court has not ruled on the applicability  of the DCHRA to PDS employees.

The local D.C. courts and PDS are unique entities, and they sometimes  fall through the regulatory cracks. They are neither federal nor D.C.  government entities, though both were created and are funded by  Congress, and their employees are treated as federal employees for some  employee benefits. This bill would ensure that their employees have  comprehensive protections from and remedies for employment  discrimination.

While employees of the local D.C. courts and PDS are protected by  federal anti-discrimination laws, the DCHRA provides much broader  protections and remedies for employees than federal anti-discrimination  laws.

While the D.C. Council may have the authority to enact this bill  itself, only Congress has the clear authority to do so, given the  express limitation in the D.C. Home Rule Act on the Council's authority  to legislate on matters affecting the operations of the local D.C.  courts, and given that Congress has generally served as the legislative  body for PDS matters.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
