Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Blue Envelope Act of  2025. This bill would make blue envelope programs, which improve  interactions between police officers and drivers with difficulty  communicating through speech during a traffic stop, eligible for  federal transportation safety funding. The American Association of  People with Disabilities has endorsed this bill.

Blue envelope programs allow drivers, upon request, to receive a blue  envelope that explains on the front that the driver has difficulty  communicating through speech and that holds the documents a police  officer might request during a traffic stop. These programs exist in  many jurisdictions across the country, including statewide in  Massachusetts, Connecticut, Arkansas, Rhode Island, Arizona and  Vermont.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
