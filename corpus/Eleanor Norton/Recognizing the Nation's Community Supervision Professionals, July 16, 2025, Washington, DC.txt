Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Nation's community  supervision professionals, who are dedicated public servants and  perform many vital roles in their work with justice-involved adults and  juveniles. They identify opportunities and services to help justice- involved individuals contribute to society, while holding them  accountable for their actions. They remain mindful of their role in  protecting public safety.

In honor of Pretrial, Probation and Parole Supervision Week 2025,  whose theme is ``Heroes Behind the Mission: Transforming Lives,  Enhancing Public Safety,'' we salute all those who have chosen this  important career. In the District of Columbia, we especially thank the  employees of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the  District of Columbia (CSOSA) and the Pretrial Services Agency for the  District of Columbia (PSA) for their service. CSOSA and PSA are models  of excellence in community supervision.

Community supervision agencies are valuable partners of other  government agencies, nonprofits, neighborhood-based groups and all who  strive to make our Nation safer and stronger. We extend our gratitude  to community supervision professionals and recognize their many  achievements as we proclaim July 20 through July 26, 2025, as Pretrial,  Probation and Parole Supervision Week 2025.
