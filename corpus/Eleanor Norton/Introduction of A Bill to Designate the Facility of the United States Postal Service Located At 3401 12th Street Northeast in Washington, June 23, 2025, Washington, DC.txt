Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill to name the post  office at 3401 12th Street, Northeast in the District of Columbia for  go-go legend Chuck Brown.

Chuck Brown, the ``Godfather of Go-Go,'' is beloved by D.C. for his  innovative and unique sound, which gave us go-go music. Go-go is the  beat of D.C., giving D.C. its own musical identity and reminding the  Nation that D.C. has always been the hometown of talented artists.  Chuck Brown was a strong supporter of D.C. statehood, including playing  a concert on a hot and humid day on the U.S. Capitol Grounds in 2010 in  support of statehood.

Chuck Brown was born on August 22, 1936, and passed away on May 16,  2012. He was a D.C. resident most of his life. He taught himself to  play guitar, becoming a virtuoso singer, songwriter, guitarist and band  leader. His musical catalogue spanned 22 studio albums over three  decades. He earned a Grammy nomination in 2010 for the song ``Love''  from his album ``We Got This,'' and was awarded a National Endowment  for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship in 2005.

D.C. named a park located at 2901 20th Street, Northeast, for Chuck  Brown, and named a street near the historic Howard Theater for him.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
