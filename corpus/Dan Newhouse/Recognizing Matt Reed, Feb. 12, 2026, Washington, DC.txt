Recognizing Matt Reed

Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my outgoing  communications director, Mr. Matt Reed.

Matt has been on my staff for 2\1/2\ years. During that time, he has  been a crucial member of my team.

Matt has tremendous work ethic, an infectious sense of humor, and is  a friend to everyone in the office. From late hours in the D.C. office  to road trips throughout central Washington, Matt has been my megaphone  across three Congresses, and we have enjoyed every minute of it.

As Matt departs from the House for, I am sorry to say, the upper  Chamber, I am confident that he will succeed in his new role and that  he will have a bright future ahead of him.
