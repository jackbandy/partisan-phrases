Congratulating the Washington Cattleman's Association on Their 100th Anniversary


Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the  Washington Cattleman's Association on their 100th anniversary, an  incredible milestone that ranchers in our State should be proud of.

Since its inception in 1925, the Washington Cattleman's Association  has been instrumental in promoting the agriculture and cattle industry  in the State of Washington. They preserve, protect, and promote the  beef industry through producer and consumer education, legislative  advocacy, regulatory scrutiny, and legal intervention.

Based in Ellensburg, Washington, the Washington Cattleman's  Association has 1,500 members across the State. Their excellent  leadership in Olympia and Washington D.C. has helped advance important  legislation and cut red tape for ranchers in our State. Despite  challenges facing ranchers and cattleman in the State, the Washington  Cattleman's Association has been instrumental in establishing water,  grazing, and local conservation efforts that has helped build our  robust cattle industry here in Washington.

Their exceptional work has helped so many ranchers, and on their  100th anniversary, I thank them for all they do for the State of  Washington.
