Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the  privileges of the House.

The form of the resolution is as follows:

Resolution Censuring Representative Al Green of Texas.

Whereas, on March 4, 2025, during the joint session of Congress  convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution 11, the President of  the United States, speaking at the invitation of the House and Senate,  had his remarks interrupted by the Representative from Texas, Mr.  Green;

Whereas, the conduct of the Representative from Texas disrupted the  proceedings of the joint address and was a breach of proper conduct;  and

Whereas, after numerous disruptions, the Representative from Texas  had to be removed from the Chamber by the Sergeant at Arms:

Now, therefore, be it resolved that Representative Al Green be  censured; Representative Al Green forthwith present himself in the well  of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure; and  Representative Al Green be censured with the public reading of this  resolution by the Speaker.
