Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Moore doing this Special  Order this evening. It is truly an honor and a privilege for me to join  my colleagues in honoring the life and the legacy of our good friend,  Doug LaMalfa.

Throughout my time in Congress, I worked hand in hand with Doug on  the many issues that face the American West. He had a love for his  work. He had an understanding as a fellow farmer in the value of the  rural way of life, and he fought to protect all of those things.

When I stepped down as chairman of the Western Caucus, Doug was the  clear choice to take the gavel. He was elected unanimously to lead the  caucus into its next chapter. Truly, Congress and the people of  California's First Congressional District have lost a true advocate for  the issues that we all face.

Mr. Speaker, Doug was much more than a colleague. Doug was a dear  friend. He had a kind soul and a sincere love for all of the people in  his life, as you have heard this evening. While Doug may have towered  over you, as you shook his big hand, you were never small in his eyes.  He was humble, generous, a loyal friend, and liked by everyone he met.

I am going to miss Doug's big grin, as he always greeted me as  Lieutenant Dan. Joan and I are going to truly miss Doug. We send our  deepest condolences to his wife, Jill, and their four kids during this  incredibly difficult time. I thank and ask all of my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to join us in honoring the great work that Doug  accomplished over the years.

May we preserve his legacy. May we be more like him, and may he rest  in peace.
