Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Cole for yielding me  time.

Mr. Speaker, over 40 days after the Senate Democrats shut down the  Federal Government, we are finally reopening. The result of the  shutdown has been thousands of employee furloughs, major disruptions to  our air travel, servicemembers going without pay, delayed food  assistance for low-income individuals and families, and much, much  more.

Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Appropriations,  the responsibility of funding the Federal Government is one that I take  very seriously, especially in light of our Nation's debt surpassing $38  trillion.

The performative tactics that we have watched over the last 7 weeks  have truly been a disservice to Americans. My friends across the aisle  should never have put leverage or politics over those people who they  represent.

The most important thing right now is that we get back to work,  making sure that the Federal Government can provide the essential  services that people depend on and that Congress can continue working  to pass full-year funding legislation, providing responsible Federal  spending and funding those essential services.

Mr. Speaker, we are making significant progress with the inclusion of  these three appropriations bills, but our work is far from over. I  encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this deal, vote to end this unnecessary shutdown, and help us get back  to the business of hardworking Americans across this country.
