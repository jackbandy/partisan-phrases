Mr. McGUIRE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member  Smith for their leadership.

Mr. Speaker, as a Navy SEAL veteran, I am incredibly proud to rise  today in support of the fiscal year 2026 National Defense Authorization  Act.

This transformative piece of legislation delivers on the peace  through strength mandate of this administration. This bill that we are  voting on today stands as a once-in-a-generation reform of the  Department of War's acquisition procedures to ensure that the  warfighter and services have the right equipment in a timely and  expeditious manner for the fight in the moment and the future. God  forbid if we have to go to war. We want our men and women to be able to  win the fight and return home safely.

Mr. Speaker, I promised when I took office to deliver for Virginia's  Fifth District. This bill does just that with more for the  Commonwealth, supporting the growing nuclear industry, advanced  manufacturing, and workforce development sectors. It also takes  necessary steps to address the extraordinary threats in the cyber  domain posed by AI and quantum computing.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the committee staff and my own staff for their  hard work on this year's bill, and I encourage all of my colleagues to  vote ``yes.''
