Mr. McGUIRE. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member  Smith for their leadership and vision during this process.

Mr. Chair, this year's National Defense Authorization Act represents  a significant step toward achieving President Trump's vision of peace  through strength.

Since the end of the Cold War, the United States' defense industrial  base has severely atrophied, and the Pentagon's overburdensome and  bureaucratic acquisition process hasn't kept up with the speed needed  to procure and field the cutting edge technology.

As we have seen from conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, our  adversaries are not wasting time innovating and changing the face of  modern warfare. God forbid, if we have to go to war, we want our men  and women to be able to win the fight and return home safely.

I also thank the professional staff of the committee for including  several of my proposals that strengthen the industrial base in the  Commonwealth of Virginia's Fifth Congressional District. I thank my own  staff for their hard work and also thank the professional staff for  their work on this year's bill.

Mr. Chair, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this  bill.
