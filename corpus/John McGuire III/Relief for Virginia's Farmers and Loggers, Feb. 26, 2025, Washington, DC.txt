Mr. McGUIRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about an important  milestone in my congressional career. Last week, I introduced my first  bill as a Member of this body. I introduced the Agricultural and  Forestry Hauling Efficiency Act.

For me, this is a safety concern. On the one hand, this bill helps  farmers and loggers feed and fuel this country by helping them move  product across the Commonwealth of Virginia directly from their farms  to their processors, but the bill also increases transportation safety.

Agriculture and logging are two of the largest industries in the  Commonwealth of Virginia, combining for over $120 billion in annual  economic impact. However, unlike many other States, currently Virginia  loggers primarily use rural roadways to transport product because of  weight limitations on interstate highways.

My bill increases the maximum weight allowance from 80,000 pounds to  90,000 pounds on interstate highways in Virginia for trucks hauling  certain agricultural and forest products. This will ensure a safer and  more efficient transportation system while reducing congestion and  fatalities on secondary roads.

I am proud that the first bill that I introduced in Congress is very  important not only for my district but for the rest of the  Commonwealth.

I thank Congressman  Rob Wittman for supporting this legislation, and  I thank the associations that advocated for this bill.
