One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Mr. McGUIRE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding me the time.

Mr. Speaker, this one big, beautiful bill delivers the American  people the promises of President Trump's America First agenda and  prevents the largest single tax hike on the middle class in history.

A ``no'' vote on this bill is a vote for sabotaging the United  States' energy dominance and blocking critical investments to  revolutionize our military to address 21st century threats.

It eliminates over $700 billion in wasteful Medicaid spending for  illegal aliens and people who can work but refuse to work, instead of  America's most vulnerable.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  historic piece of legislation.
