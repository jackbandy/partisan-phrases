Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Figures for  yielding.

I rise today in support of H.R. 3962, the Enhancing, Science,  Treatment, and Upkeep of America's Resilient and Important Estuarine  Systems Act, or ESTUARIES Act.

Estuaries rank among the most productive ecosystems in the country,  where freshwater meets saltwater, and entire communities benefit from  that key meeting point.

Families depend on estuaries for clean water. Fishers depend on them  for healthy stocks. Small businesses depend on them for tourism,  recreation, and the natural beauty that draws people to our coasts.  When estuaries thrive, local communities thrive. The National Estuary  Program makes that possible.

For more than three decades, NEP partnerships have restored wetlands,  improved water quality, reduced toxic pollutants, strengthened fish  habitat, and built natural buffers that protect homes and businesses  from flooding and storm surge.

These partnerships unite scientists, local governments, Tribal  nations, fishers and anglers, farmers, and community leaders around a  shared plan, and those plans deliver results.

In Tillamook Bay in Oregon, in the district I am honored to  represent, the NEP helped restore hundreds of acres of tidal wetland  which improved salmon runs, protected dairy farms from flooding, and  created new recreational corridors.

On the Gulf Coast, NEP projects rebuilt marshes that shield front- line communities from hurricanes. In New England, estuary programs  helped revive the shellfish beds that sustain entire working  waterfronts.

This bill continues the NEP's successful legacy. The ESTUARIES Act  reauthorizes competitive grants from 2031 so every estuary of national  significance can implement science-driven conservation, respond to  emerging threats, and support long-term economic resilience.

This bill upholds a simple principle: When we give local experts the  tools they need, they protect the ecosystems that protect us.

This legislation reflects a strong bipartisan, bicameral commitment  to support these critical ecosystems and recognize their significance.

I thank Representative Figures for leading this effort. I thank, as  well, Representative Johnson for his support. Also, I thank my fellow  co-chairs of the Bipartisan Estuary Caucus for their partnership:  Representatives Haridopolos, Mast, and Ranking Member Larsen. Together  we can continue decades of success in estuary restoration and  resilience.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the ESTUARIES  Act.
