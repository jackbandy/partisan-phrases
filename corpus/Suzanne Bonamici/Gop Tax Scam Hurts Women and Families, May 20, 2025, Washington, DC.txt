Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the big, bad  billionaire bill, especially the cuts to Medicaid.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, this bill will result  in more than 13 million people across the country losing health  insurance coverage, and people with disabilities will be the hardest  hit.

Medicaid is the primary program for comprehensive health and long- term care coverage to one in three people with disabilities.

My colleagues across the aisle are so focused on giving tax cuts to  billionaires, I think they have lost sight of the everyday people who  will be harmed by their reckless decisions.

One of my constituents, Rachael, is a caretaker for her adult son  with Down syndrome. Payments from Medicaid allow Rachael's son to  survive. Rachael told me that without these payments her son could die.

Republicans have claimed that vulnerable populations who need  Medicaid will not be harmed by provisions in this legislation, but we  saw this play out before.

In 2011, when States had to cut spending to comply with Federal  requirements, many people with disabilities were hit hard and fast by  the loss of services.

I implore every one of my colleagues: Do not be complicit in  destabilizing the lives of millions of people, including Rachael's son  who will have their healthcare ripped away.
