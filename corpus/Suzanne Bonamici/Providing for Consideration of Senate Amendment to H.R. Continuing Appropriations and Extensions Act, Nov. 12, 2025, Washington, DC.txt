Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this  continuing resolution. I will not support a bill that will continue the  Republicans' assault on Americans and their pocketbooks. At a time when  Oregonians and Americans are already struggling with rising costs, this  bill locks in devastating cuts to healthcare and drives up the cost, in  many cases, significantly.

The assault on healthcare and the Republican shutdown more broadly  are further proof that the first 10 months of this Trump administration  have been chaotic, harmful, and completely out of touch with the needs  of the American people. Donald Trump held an extravagant Great Gatsby  party at Mar-a-Lago the night before SNAP benefits expired, while the  administration and Republicans continue to ignore the needs of working  families. That is not governing. They have abandoned their  responsibility to bring down costs and grow the economy.

Mr. Speaker, this bill was already bad, but now they have added this  corrupt, get-rich-quick scheme to give hundreds of thousands of  taxpayer dollars to Trump-aligned Senators. That is outrageous.  Oregonians and Americans deserve better.

My colleagues should listen to their constituents, vote ``no,'' and  come back to the table and join us in the work to make healthcare  affordable and accessible to all.
