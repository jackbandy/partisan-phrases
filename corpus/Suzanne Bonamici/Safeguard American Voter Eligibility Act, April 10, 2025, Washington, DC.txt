Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act

Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise  today in strong opposition to the SAVE Act.

This bill will make it more difficult to register to vote, and it  will prevent millions of American citizens, including married women who  change their name and rural Americans, from exercising their right to  vote. It creates an enormous and expensive unfunded mandate on election  offices, and for what?

Federal law already requires people to attest under penalty of  perjury that they are U.S. citizens when they register to vote.  Noncitizens attempting to register to vote is exceedingly rare, and if  they do, they face severe consequences, including fines, up to 5 years  in prison, and deportation.

Mr. Speaker, more than 140 million Americans do not have a passport.  Approximately 70 million women do not have a birth certificate that  matches their current legal name. Millions and millions of rural voters  would have to travel long distances to try to register to vote.

We don't have to guess what would happen if this bill were to pass.  In 2011, Kansas had a proof-of-citizenship requirement.

Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, in Kansas, more than 30,000 U.S. citizens,  12 percent of everyone seeking to register to vote, were barred from  voting.

Other States have tried. In all of them, a significant number of  citizens have been wrongly barred from voting. It is unacceptable. It  is voter suppression. It is wrong.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the SAVE  Act.
