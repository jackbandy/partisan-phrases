We Need the Department of Education

Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, it is all over the news this morning.

In just a few hours, it is expected that Donald Trump will sign an  executive order to shut down the Department of Education. I condemn  that in the strongest possible terms.

This will slash support for students with disabilities, undermine  schools in rural communities, and also eliminate the civil rights  protections that people fought and died for.

This executive order will be an illegal and unconstitutional abuse of  power. An act of Congress created the Department of Education and only  an act of Congress can dismantle it, and we will fight that.

Last month, I introduced H. Res. 94 in defense of public education.  We have more than 80 colleagues on that resolution. I want everyone to  join us in signing that. Do not let them bulldoze our public education  system.

They are going to try to justify it by saying we have to return  authority to States and local school boards, but they already have the  authority. The Department of Education and the Federal Government don't  set curriculum. They don't decide how many kids are in each class. What  the Department of Education does is it protects civil rights, gives  support to students who are low income and students with disabilities.

Mr. Speaker, we will fight the efforts to defund this important work.  If we can't legislate, we will litigate, but we will not back down.
