Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chair, I thank Representative Stansbury for  yielding.

Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to this amendment, which would  ban transgender women from participating in women's sports but also  lead to challenges on all women's bodies, making the military and  academies less safe for any women to enlist, no matter who they are.

Military personnel already undergo in-depth medical exams, and this  amendment would allow for women and trans people to be subjected to  increased and invasive targeting and harassment.

Athletic associations and the service academies are better prepared  to understand the sports that they regulate and how to provide both  respect for transgender people and fairness in sports. These  associations and academies should be addressing this issue, not  politicians, especially politicians who do not understand that trans  people are not men who put on skirts.

Republicans have already banned trans people from the military and  the service academies via executive action. This amendment is just  another backdoor attempt to discourage transgender people from  enlisting in the future while making the military less safe for all  women and embedding discrimination into law. This amendment is a  classic example of politicians trying to insert themselves where they  don't belong. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.
