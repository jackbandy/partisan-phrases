Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the outstanding  leadership of Sheriff Randy Retter, who dedicated 37 years of law  enforcement experience to my district in Wayne County.

Over that career, Sheriff Retter has worked tirelessly, holding  positions of ever-increasing responsibility, beginning as a road patrol  officer before being ultimately elected sheriff of Wayne County and  having served as president of the Indiana Sheriffs' Association.

It was as sheriff that Mr. Retter met with the U.S. Customs and  Border Protection to diligently detain illegal criminal migrants,  making the Sixth District far safer for Hoosiers to live and work in.

It was this past Tuesday in the joint session that I had the  privilege of hosting Sheriff Retter as my guest for the President's  joint address to Congress. It was our first. We shared that experience  together.

It was there that the President reaffirmed his steadfast support for  our Nation's law enforcement officers and their vital work to protect  our communities.
