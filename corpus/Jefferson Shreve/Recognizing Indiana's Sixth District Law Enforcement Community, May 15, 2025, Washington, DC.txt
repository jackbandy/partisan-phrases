Recognizing Indiana's Sixth District Law Enforcement Community


Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of our law enforcement  community in Indiana's Sixth District and across our Hoosier State.

Police Week is a time for all of us to recognize and honor those  serving our communities and, most especially, those who have given  their lives in the line of duty.

This week, I was joined by our Johnson County Sheriff Duane Burgess.  Duane and his deputies work tirelessly to keep Johnson County a safe  community in which to live, work, and to raise a family.

I thank Sheriff Burgess for his many years of dedicated service.

During my short time in Congress, I have prioritized issues,  including protecting qualified immunity and officer safety and  wellness. I remain committed to providing support for our law  enforcement officers who do such vital work to protect our communities.
