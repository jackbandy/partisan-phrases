Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman Cole, I move to  strike the last word.

Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Chair, my amendment provides $55 million to build a  new aviation maintenance hangar and operations building and renovate  the existing hangar space at our Shelbyville, Indiana, Army Aviation  Support Facility.

Mr. Chair, 900 Indiana guardsmen assigned to the 38th Combat Aviation  Brigade have supported 16 deployments since 2001, including to Iraq,  Kuwait, and Bosnia. Our Shelbyville facility remains a crown jewel of  Indiana and Midwest Army aviation.

This proud combat aviation unit has one of the oldest Army aviation  flight facilities in the National Guard. Built in 1972, it currently  supports 11 aircraft and more than 50 full-time personnel.

Upgrading the facility will save over 500 man-hours and prevent more  than $200,000 in annual damage to blades and equipment. A new facility  supports rapid homeland response and will sustain recruitment and  retention of Indiana's finest soldiers. This amendment serves to equip  our next generation of guardsmen to protect our homeland both at home  and abroad.

I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                    Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Correa
