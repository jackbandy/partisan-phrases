Protecting America's Infrastructure


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695343/protecting-americas-infrastructure


Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, our Department of Defense is charged with  protecting America's critical infrastructure. Our current standards are  simply insufficient. The United States is vulnerable to attack on our  defense infrastructure by our adversaries, as we were reminded of today  like no other.

Fortifying our defense critical infrastructure is imperative, and  funding it is our job. My amendment No. 269 directs a comprehensive  review of current interagency coordination of DOD implementation to  ensure physical and cybersecurity for our air, rail, and maritime  infrastructure that underpins our military readiness.

My amendment No. 270 directs our Secretary of State with developing a  comprehensive strategy to counter Iran's and Hezbollah's missionary and  propaganda operations in Latin America.

Iran's goal in Latin America is to export its ideology to the region,  so as to cultivate anti-Americanism in our Western Hemisphere. There  must be a clear plan and strategy to counter their malign influence.

Mr. Speaker, these two amendments were unanimously passed yesterday  and included in the National Defense Authorization Act, and I thank my  colleagues for supporting these amendments.
