On to the Rose Bowl

Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, for the first time in my life, Indiana  University has won the Big Ten football championship outright, beating  formerly number one Ohio State 13-10.

The pundits said Ohio State brought the third-most talented roster in  the country. Indiana was ranked 72 at the start of the season, but our  Hoosiers refused to be defined by those numbers. They responded with  discipline, toughness, and a belief in one another that reshaped  Indiana football.

This championship is a testament to the student-athletes who  committed to the rebuild, the staff who kept driving, and our Hoosier  fans, who stayed loyal for generations, awaiting this moment.

Mr. Speaker, as a former chairman of IU's Alumni Association and on  behalf of 805,000 living IU alumni, we celebrate this historic  achievement for our university. Congratulations to Coach Cignetti and  our Hoosiers for bringing the Big Ten title home.

Now on to the Rose Bowl.
