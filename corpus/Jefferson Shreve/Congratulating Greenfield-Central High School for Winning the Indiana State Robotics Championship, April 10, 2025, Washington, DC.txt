Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, the robotics industry is quietly reshaping  the manufacturing and distribution economies of Indiana and our world.

I rise today to congratulate a team of extraordinary young students  at Greenfield-Central High School back home in my district for their  winning performance at our Indiana State robotics competition.

Greenfield-Central's team surpassed 62 other terrific Hoosier teams  to claim top honors. Coach Jason led The Exothermics, Greenfield  Central's team, comprised of juniors Simon, Hayley, and Brayden.

These talented young Hoosiers will again showcase their talents at  VEX World competition in Dallas later this year. These students  exemplify the best of the next generation of innovators, engineers, and  scientists. Their work underscores the importance of a STEM education.

Many Hoosiers have celebrated victories on basketball courts, and I  am proud to take this opportunity to spotlight these victories of our  young Hoosiers in robotics innovation. Their talented minds will  reshape our economy.
