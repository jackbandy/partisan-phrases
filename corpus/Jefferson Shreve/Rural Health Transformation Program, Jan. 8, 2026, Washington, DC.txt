Rural Health Transformation Program


Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, a simple principle should guide us: where we  live should not determine the quality of healthcare that we can get,  but for too many Hoosiers, especially in our rural communities, this  isn't the reality.

That is why the Working Families Tax Cut Act matters. Through the new  Rural Health Transformation Program, Indiana is receiving $207 million  in first-year funding, the first of 5 years of support, to strengthen  rural healthcare statewide.

This funding will support hospitals and strengthen emergency care for  Hoosiers who can get that care close to home. For communities from  Connersville to Richmond and across Rush, Shelby, and Henry Counties,  this means quality care closer, shorter drives for appointments, faster  response times when minutes count, especially for our seniors,  veterans, and working families.

This is the right kind of investment, helping our rural communities  stay healthy without raising taxes, without growing bureaucracy, and  without leaving Hoosiers behind.
