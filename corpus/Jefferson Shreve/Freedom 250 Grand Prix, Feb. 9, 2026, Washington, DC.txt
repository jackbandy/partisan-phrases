Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, this August, Washington will hear a sound we  know well in Indiana, the roar of IndyCar engines.

The Freedom 250 Grand Prix will bring IndyCar to our Nation's Capital  as we mark 250 years of American ingenuity.

IndyCar was born in my hometown of Indianapolis. It is rooted in a  tradition that goes back more than a century, built by American  workers, American engineers, and American manufacturers.

IndyCar reflects who we Hoosiers are: competitive, inventive, always  pushing forward. I will be honest, Washington could use a little less  gridlock and a little more green flag.

This event isn't simply a race. It is a statement. America leads.  America builds. America innovates.

This August, we will put that on display at 200 miles an hour right  here in our Nation's Capital.

Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House, let's prepare to  start our engines.
