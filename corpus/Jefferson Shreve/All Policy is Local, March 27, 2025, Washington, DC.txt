All Policy is Local

Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, during this past district work period, I had  the opportunity of hosting discussions with business leaders and  constituents across Indiana's Sixth District. With our community  leaders, we had conversations that focused on the need to extend the  progrowth policies of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Over 17 visits across my district, I spoke with our seniors on  Medicare Advantage. I spoke with Hoosier farmers on National Ag Day at  our Purdue Extension facility in Johnson County. I heard from our  Indiana Realtors--and no one knows our communities like our Realtors-- about the importance of homeownership and having sufficient housing  inventory for job growth and economic creation.

I appreciate these listen-and-learn opportunities with our local  small businesses and constituents. All policy is so very local.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to work with businesses across Indiana's  Sixth District to bring business sense to Washington. The American  people expect results, and we must deliver.
