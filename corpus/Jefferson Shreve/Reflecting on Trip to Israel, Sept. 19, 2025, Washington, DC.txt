Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on my very recent  visit to Israel. It was a humbling journey through the Holy Land, where  the history and resilience of the Israeli people left a deep  impression.

I stood inside Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulcher, a profound  moment for me as a Christian.

I was grateful to have met Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel's  President Herzog, and our own Ambassador Mike Huckabee. Each visit  afforded a deeper understanding of the enduring bond between our  nations.

Our delegation visited the site of the Nova music festival, where  Hamas terrorists carried out one of the most horrific attacks on  October 7.

The trip was both sobering and inspiring. It reaffirmed my conviction  to stand with the people of Israel, while working toward the goal of a  more peaceful Middle East.
