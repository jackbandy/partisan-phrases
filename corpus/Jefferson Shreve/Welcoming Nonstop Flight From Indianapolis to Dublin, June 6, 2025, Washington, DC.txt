Welcoming Nonstop Flight From Indianapolis to Dublin

Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, Indiana is at the Crossroads of America. The  Indianapolis International Airport is in my district. It is one of the  reasons we proudly hold the claim to the distinction of Crossroads of  America.

This past month, Indianapolis International Airport welcomed a  nonstop transatlantic flight to one of our gates. The flight from  Indianapolis to Dublin on Aer Lingus marked the start of daily nonstop  service to this European gateway and onward connections throughout  Europe.

Importantly, it represents an important economic development tool.  Indianapolis has long been recognized as one of our country's best  midsize airports. We completed a multiyear, multibillion-dollar  infrastructure project to ensure that Indianapolis is prepared for our  growing economy.

In addition to 53 nonstop designations served by Indianapolis, we are  the home of FedEx's national hub, only the second largest in the  country for FedEx. Our maiden Aer Lingus flight is a testament to the  strength of Indianapolis and reflects the global reach of our Hoosier  economy.

I look forward to continuing my work to enhance IND and other  airports across Indiana's Sixth District.
