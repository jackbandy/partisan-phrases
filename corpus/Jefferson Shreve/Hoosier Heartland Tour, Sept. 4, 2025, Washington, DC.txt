Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer an epilogue on my just- completed Hoosier Heartland Tour across Indiana's Sixth District.

I participated in 45 events. I engaged meaningfully with 1,800  Hoosiers. I reported back on my work in Congress. I listened to their  concerns and priorities.

I met with leaders in our communities, including our Governor, to  discuss how our Federal policies affect their lives. Together, we  explored opportunities to deliver more for all Hoosiers.

I visited hardworking families, farmers, local businessowners, and  the employees who make them go. I discussed our passage of the working  families tax cuts. This bill, now law, allows Hoosiers to avoid perhaps  the largest tax hike in our history. It offers tax predictability that  encourages investment in Indiana's economy and a pathway to quickened  economic growth.

My tour fostered conversations that will guide my work throughout the  fall here in Congress. I return more committed than ever to advocate  for Indiana's priorities and ensuring that our voices are represented  in this Chamber.
