Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the air traffic  controllers and the men and women of the FAA.

For 43 days, while the Democrats kept our government closed, the  aviation system that they rely upon and the traveling public depend  upon was pushed to the brink.

As a member of the Aviation Subcommittee, I have seen up close how  critical a fully functioning system is to safety and commerce.

The Indianapolis International Airport is in my district. I spent  time in the tower. I spent time in INDY Center, the regional air  traffic control center. I met with the team running traffic in and out  of the second largest FedEx air cargo hub in our district.

When the good people who keep our skies moving tell you what is at  stake, you pay attention. Their work is why I pushed to secure funding  to modernize our outdated air traffic control technology. We have to  invest in the next generation of controllers, cut the bureaucratic lag,  and build a system worthy of the people who run it. I intend to keep at  it.
