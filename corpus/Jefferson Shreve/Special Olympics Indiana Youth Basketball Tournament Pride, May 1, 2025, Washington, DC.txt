Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hundreds of  young Hoosiers who just participated in our annual Special Olympics  Indiana Youth Basketball Tournament.

Basketball is a beloved tradition in my Hoosier State, and this  tournament is amongst the largest in North America. It has been hosted  at the University of Indianapolis, just 2 miles from my home, since  2010.

This year's event brought together athletes from across our State to  compete in five-on-five, three-on-three, and individual basketball  skill competitions.

Special Olympics Indiana transforms young lives through the power of  sports, breaking down barriers while building up kids with intellectual  disabilities. It provides 19,000 Hoosier youth an opportunity to  fulfill their sporting ambitions, all with the support of 10,000  volunteers and not one red cent of taxpayer money.

These special young athletes embody the spirit of perseverance on the  court and in their lives. They have bright futures ahead of them, and  we are proud.
