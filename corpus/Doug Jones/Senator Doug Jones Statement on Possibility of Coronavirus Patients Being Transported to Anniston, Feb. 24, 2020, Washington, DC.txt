Senator Doug Jones Statement on Possibility of Coronavirus Patients Being Transported to Anniston, Alabama


Senator Doug Jones (D-Ala.) today issued the following statement about the possibility of coronavirus patients being transported and housed at the Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama:

"Over the weekend, my staff and I participated in briefings regarding the announcement that Americans from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who tested positive for the coronavirus might be transported to and housed at the Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) in Anniston, Alabama. We were advised that the announcement on Saturday regarding the CDP was premature, and although the CDP is one of a number of contingency sites, at this time, the multi-agency plan anticipates using other sites first.

"It is my understanding that this information is being provided to officials in Anniston, and the folks at the CDP have been told that if their facility is needed in the future, adequate notice and details will be provided. I urge the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Centers for Disease Control to do all they can to provide the best care possible for those who must endure quarantine and those who are suffering from this virus.

"My first priority is to protect the people of Alabama, and I have utmost confidence that, if called upon, the unmatched professionals at the CDP will rise to the occasion.  I urge the Administration to continue to keep Congress and the American people informed about their response to this virus and their efforts to prevent any further infections in the United States. We will continue to monitor this evolving situation with hope and compassion for all affected."
