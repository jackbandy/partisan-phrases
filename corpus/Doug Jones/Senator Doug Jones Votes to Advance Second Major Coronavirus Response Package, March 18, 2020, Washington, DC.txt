Senator Doug Jones Votes to Advance Second Major Coronavirus Response Package


Senator Doug Jones (D-Ala.) today voted to pass the second major legislative package in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. The legislation has already been approved by the House and now will go to the President for his signature. 

The multibillion-dollar bill will increase food assistance for older Americans, pregnant women, and children. It will also provide 14 days of paid sick leave to many workers who did not have it previously, and creates the opportunity for 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave during this crisis, along with provisions to allow the federal government to better assist small businesses. Senator Jones has heard from many small business owners in Alabama who are concerned with the new paid sick leave provisions and have asked for more assistance, which is expected to be addressed in the third legislative package. 

Senator Jones issued the following statement after the vote today:

"This second round of assistance is an important step to help mitigate the severe impacts of COVID-19 -- but it certainly won't be the last step we take. I know that many folks have already lost their jobs or are in danger of doing so because of this crisis. In the third legislative aid package, which is already being negotiated, I am going to advocate for priorities like direct assistance payments to Americans, expanded unemployment benefits, incentives for companies to retain and pay their workers, grace periods on mortgage and rent payments, and prohibitions on foreclosures so that people are not losing their homes because of the virus. I know these are difficult times, but I remain very optimistic that we can rise to the occasion, and we need to act quickly and decisively. The best thing we can do for our economy right now is to stop the spread of the virus, and we each need to continue to do our part as individuals to protect everyone in our communities."
