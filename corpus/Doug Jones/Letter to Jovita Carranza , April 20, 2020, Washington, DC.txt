Letter to Jovita Carranza , Admin. of the Small Business Administration - Senator Jones Demands Immediate Assistance for Alabama Farmers & Producers


Dear Administrator Carranza:

As your agency implements the loan programs created in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, I urge you to make sure that the agricultural sector is not excluded from this relief. I want to reiterate the concerns raised by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle about the significant impacts COVID-19 has had on farmers. Alabama's farmers and producers have been particularly hit hard. My state is home to roughly 40,000 farms so it is essential that they have access to the new programs.  

In the CARES Act, Congress expanded eligibility for the new Paycheck Protection Program beyond the scope of section 7(a) of the Small Business Act to include any business, including agricultural businesses and farms, with no more than 500 employees. However, SBA's interim final rule for sole proprietors is linked to IRS Schedule C despite the fact that many farmers file an IRS Schedule F and other IRS forms. I request that you issue additional flexible guidance to ensure farmers and producers are included, as intended by Congress. 

The CARES Act also created new eligibility requirements for an Economic Industry Disaster Loan (EIDL) program as a result of COVID-19. Although farmers have not been allowed to access EIDL previously, Congress created a new definition of eligible entities that did not explicitly exclude farms. I urge you to adjust your guidance to allow agribusinesses and farms access to EIDL as well.

Thank you for considering my request to include farmers and producers to be included in both the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Industry Disaster Loan program. As Congress works to increase these funds, it is of upmost importance that farmers, producers, and agricultural businesses are provided this aid to ensure we have a stable food supply.

Sincerely,
