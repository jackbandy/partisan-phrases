Senator Doug Jones Statement on Iran War Powers Resolution Vote


U.S. Senator Doug Jones (D-Ala.) today voted in favor of S.J.Res.68, a resolution which directs the removal of United States military from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran that have not been authorized by Congress. Senator Jones is a cosponsor of the legislation and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. After the vote, Senator Jones released the following statement:

"Before a President can lead us into war, he or she must first earn the support of the American people and also fulfill their solemn constitutional obligation to seek approval from Congress. While the President has the power to protect Americans in the case of an imminent attack, that authority does not extend to committing our service members to long-term hostilities unilaterally. This resolution sends a strong message that we will follow the Constitution and we will not send our troops into harm's way without the serious consideration and consent of the Congress."
