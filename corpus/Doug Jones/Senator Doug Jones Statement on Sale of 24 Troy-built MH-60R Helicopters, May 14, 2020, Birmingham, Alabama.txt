Senator Doug Jones Statement on Sale of 24 Troy-built MH-60R Helicopters


U.S. Senator Doug Jones (D-Ala.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today applauded the news that India will purchase 21 MH-60R Seahawk helicopters, built in Troy, Alabama at the Lockheed-owned Sikorsky manufacturing facility. The U.S. Navy will also purchase three additional helicopters. The MH-60R is the world's most advanced maritime helicopter, equipped for multiple missions including anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, special operations, surveillance, and search and rescue. Senator Jones issued the following statement on the sale:  

"This is great news for Alabama and Sikorsky's Troy-based workforce, especially in light of today's historic unemployment levels. Since 2006, when Sikorsky made the decision to expand its operations in Alabama, MH-60R production has provided hundreds of jobs to our citizens. I applaud the approval of this sale, as it will protect over 200 jobs at the Troy facility, while providing improved capabilities to one of our partners. 

"I am proud to have Lockheed Martin, which now owns Sikorsky, in Alabama, and I thank both the company's leadership and its talented workforce for their extraordinary commitment and dedication to both our national security and to our communities during this difficult time. Lockheed has continued hiring additional employees and apprentices to accelerate and continue their critical defense contracting work, by providing financial and operational support to vulnerable businesses in the supply chain, by providing personal protective equipment (PPE) and transport for COVID-19 responders, and by delivering meals to those suffering from hunger during this crisis."
