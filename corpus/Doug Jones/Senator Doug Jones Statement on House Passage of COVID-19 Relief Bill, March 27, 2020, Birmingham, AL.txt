Senator Doug Jones Statement on House Passage of COVID-19 Relief Bill


U.S. Senator Doug Jones (D-Ala.) has released the following statement on the news that the House of Representatives has passed the COVID-19 economic relief bill that the Senate passed earlier this week:

"I'm glad the House moved quickly to pass this economic relief bill and that President Trump will sign it in to law today. We need to make sure that folks can get the benefits that we fought so hard to include -- like direct payments for workers, relief for small businesses, and billions of dollars to shore up our hospital and support our front-line health care workers -- as quickly as possible. This will certainly not be the last step we take, though. While I am working to make sure Alabamians are getting these resources without delay, I'm already working to identify priorities for the next package we'll take up."
