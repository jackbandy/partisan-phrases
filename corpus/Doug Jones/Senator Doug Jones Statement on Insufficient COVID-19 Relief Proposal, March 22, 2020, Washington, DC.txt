Senator Doug Jones Statement on Insufficient COVID-19 Relief Proposal


U.S. Senator Doug Jones (D-Ala.) released the following statement on his vote against a procedural motion to advance the third installment of a coronavirus response package, citing its lack of assistance for working people and those who need relief the most:

"We need a strong, bipartisan package that directly assists our workers, our health care providers, and vulnerable folks who need it most. We have no time to waste, so I am hopeful that this failed vote reiterates the message to Leader McConnell that the time for games is over and we need to move tonight to a bill that can receive broad support from the Senate and also pass in the House. We've got more work to do on this bill to make sure we're not leaving working families behind."
