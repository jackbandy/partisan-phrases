Senate Unanimously Passes Collins-Jones Resolution Designating May as "Older Americans Month"


The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution introduced by U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Doug Jones (D-AL) designating the month of May as "Older Americans Month."  The resolution recognizes the success of older Americans and the important role they have in our society.  Senator Collins is the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee and Senator Jones is a member of the committee.

 

"Every day, millions of older Americans enrich our society by sharing their wisdom, experience, and skills with their families and communities," said Senator Collins.  "This resolution recognizes seniors' many contributions that benefit and strengthen our country and calls on all Americans to support policies that encourage older individuals' ongoing leadership and participation."

 

"Through hard work, wisdom, and sacrifice, older Americans have shaped our communities and been integral to our country's success and progress.  I'm proud to cosponsor this resolution, which celebrates our country's seniors and recognizes the vital role they continue to play in our society," said Senator Jones.

 More than 55 million people over the age of 65 live in the United States, accounting for 16.7 percent of the total population. In 2019, more than 9 million veterans were 65 years old or older. 

 Senators Collins and Jones' resolution was cosponsored by all members of the Aging Committee including Tim Scott (R-SC), Bob Casey (D-PA), Richard Burr (R-NC), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Martha McSally (R-AZ), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Josh Hawley(R-MO), Kyrsten Sinema (R-AZ), Mike Braun (R-IN), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Rick Scott (R-FL), as well as Chuck Grassley (R-IA).
