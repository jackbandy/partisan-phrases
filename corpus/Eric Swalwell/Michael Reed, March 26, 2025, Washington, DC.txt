Michael Reed, Dedicated Public Servant

Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my former chief of  staff, Michael Reed, who will leave the House after many years of  service.

From 2019 to 2021, he served my office. Every Member of this Chamber  would be lucky to have Michael serving them. He is a mentor to any  staff who work under him. He is a lover of the institution and the  rules that guide us, and he is a believer that this is still the best  place for us to resolve our disputes.

He led us particularly during COVID and January 6. On January 6, I  remember Michael finding every vending machine he could in the building  to bring food to the Members at the evacuation site where we huddled,  and then he counseled our staff who were waiting to know what would  happen next. He predicted to me, stick around in this room because  Speaker Pelosi would later gavel us in. He was right, and she was right  to hire him a few months later from my staff to work for her.

We will miss Michael and his service, but he never could have done it  without his partner, his wife, also a former chief of staff, Keenan.  The two of them will continue to serve in other ways, but this House  will miss Michael Reed.
