Troops in Los Angeles

Mr. SWALWELL. The President has our troops sleeping in squalor, not  on the battlefields of Afghanistan or Iraq, but in Los Angeles. I guess  this is what you would expect from somebody who has described our brave  war dead as suckers and losers.

We were promised that the immigration policy would deport the most  violent criminals. That is something I support. That is something  everyone here supports. Instead, it has deported a 4-year-old American  citizen battling cancer. It detained a U.S. marshal over the weekend.  Nobody is asking for this. Our troops deserve much better.

The cost of this is $134 million of your hard-earned tax dollars,  $134 million.

Mr. President, take the troops out of Los Angeles and get back to a  sane immigration policy that only deports the most violent in our  community and addresses the real workforce crisis in agriculture,  hospitality, childcare. We can do better.
