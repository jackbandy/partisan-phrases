No Funding for Ice

Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump promised that he would cut  prices. Instead, his administration is killing people.

No Democrat should vote to give ICE another penny for public  executions. ICE started by chasing people through the fields and  factories where they work, then deporting U.S. kids with stage IV  cancer, pulling women by their hair down the street, and now just  murdering citizens in daylight. We have an unqualified, masked militia  eager to escalate.

One lady who I met recently in San Jose asked me: We have only been  through 1 year of this. How will we survive 4 years?

We won't. Not until we do the right thing. No other policy matters if  we can't protect our people.

Today, let's send a message. That is why I voted to shut down their  funding so that we never again see the murder of a nurse named Pretti  or a mom named Good.
