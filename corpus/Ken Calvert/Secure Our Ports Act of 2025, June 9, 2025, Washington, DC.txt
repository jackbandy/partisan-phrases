Secure Our Ports Act of 2025

Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  approve my bipartisan legislation, H.R. 252, the Secure Our Ports Act.

This bill is designed to strengthen our national security by  prohibiting foreign adversaries from owning and operating critical  infrastructure in the United States.

China's influence and access to critical infrastructure around the  world continues to grow. Some reports indicate China owns or operates  ports and terminals at nearly 100 locations in over 50 countries.

Last year, the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party issued  a report highlighting its national security concerns over the influence  of critical port infrastructure by Chinese-owned enterprise.

More recently, the Defense Department included a number of Chinese  shipping firms to a list of companies it identifies as military in  nature.

America's ports are essential gateways for trade and commerce which  provide the foundation of our economy as well as our national security.  Allowing foreign adversaries like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran  to own and operate port infrastructure would threaten that very  foundation and creates a serious liability. Congress must take action  and protect this vital infrastructure by passing the Secure Our Ports  Act.

In closing, I thank my California colleague,   John Garamendi, for  cosponsoring this bill and making the bipartisan effort as well as  Carlos Gimenez of Florida.

I also thank the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee, my friend Sam Graves, for steering this bill through the  Committee.

America's ports are vital to our economic and national security, and  I urge all my colleagues to approve this bill.
