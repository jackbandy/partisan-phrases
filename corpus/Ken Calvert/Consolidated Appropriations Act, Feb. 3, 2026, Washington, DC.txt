Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Oklahoma,  Chairman   Tom Cole, for a job well done.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Senate amendment  to H.R. 7148, which includes my bill, the Department of Defense  Appropriations Act, 2026. This legislation was a true bipartisan effort  by all four corners of the Defense Subcommittee of the Committee on  Appropriations.

The world is more dangerous than ever. China continues its rapid  military expansion. Russia and Iran remain persistent threats. Illicit  drugs continue to harm Americans here at home. This bill answers that  challenge.

It provides $839.2 billion to strengthen deterrence, support the  administration's America First defense agenda, and modernize our force.

It invests in next-generation aircraft, the nuclear triad, critical  munitions, missile defense, and naval power, funding 17 new ships and  sustaining fleet readiness.

The bill also drives innovation and efficiency, delivers a 3.8  percent pay raise for our servicemembers, strengthens counterdrug  efforts, and invests in our defense industrial base and infrastructure.

Madam Speaker, these are strategic investments to protect the  American people and to project strength abroad, and I urge all of my  colleagues to support this bill.
