Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, the sudden passing of our close friend and  colleague, Doug LaMalfa, has caused both shock and sadness throughout  the entire House of Representatives. We lost a friend and a colleague.  His northern Californian constituents lost their tireless advocate in  the House.

Most tragically, his family lost a husband, a father, and a  grandfather.

Doug was a proud family man. He and his wife, Jill, have four  beautiful children. He just recently became a grandfather.

Doug was a fourth-generation rice farmer and a contributor to our  State's important role of producing the food that sustains America. His  experience as a farmer provided the foundation for his future as a  legislator, both in Sacramento and here in Washington, D.C.

Mr. Speaker, it comes as no surprise that in 2024, Doug was  unanimously elected to serve as the chairman of the Congressional  Western Caucus, one of the largest congressional membership groups on  Capitol Hill, focusing on rural policy and issues that affect the West  and beyond.

Doug left an indelible mark on this institution and the people whom  he got to know along the way. For those who knew him, they understood  his unique love of nicknames, movie quotes, and NASCAR. They understood  his dislike of food waste, smartphones, and ketchup on hot dogs.

Doug's sense of humor, collegial manner, and expertise will be sorely  missed. While he is no longer with us, Doug's significant contributions  to agricultural and rural policies will endure long after his passing.

I will very much miss my friend and my colleague. My thoughts and  prayers are with his wife, Jill; the entire LaMalfa family; his  friends; and his staff.

God bless you, Doug.
