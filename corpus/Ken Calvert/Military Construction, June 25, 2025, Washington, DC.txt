Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding  me time.

Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2026 Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations  Act. It is fitting that the appropriations bill to come to the House  floor this year is one that fulfills our highest priorities, honoring  our commitments to those who have served and are currently serving in  the United States military.

This bill delivers on our promises by fully funding veterans'  healthcare programs and fully funding veterans' benefits and VA  programs.

This bill addresses critical infrastructure needs for our men and  women in uniform. To address deficiencies in military barracks  identified by GAO and others, the bill includes a $75 million increase.  There is also a $75 million increase for child development centers on  military bases to improve the quality of life of many military  families.

In closing, I thank my colleague Judge Carter for crafting a bill  that keeps our promises to the veterans and our troops.

Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  bill.

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Escobar), a new member of the  Appropriations Committee.
