Mr. COLLINS. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to speak for consideration of  H.R. 3679, the Small Business Artificial Intelligence Advancement Act.

America has seen great innovation in its 250 years, from the  lightbulb to the internet and now artificial intelligence. The benefits  of AI must be made available for more than big corporations. They must  reach every facet of our economy.

Small businesses are the backbone of the United States economy,  representing nearly 43 percent of the U.S. GDP and employing 46 percent  of the workforce. These are our neighbors, our friends, and our  families. They are the heart of Main Street USA.

As AI and industries advance, we must ensure that they are not left  behind. Too often, small businesses lack the technical know-how or  financial resources to adopt AI, which is putting them at a growing  disadvantage.

That is why I introduced H.R. 3679. This bipartisan legislation  directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop  resources to voluntarily educate small businesses on best practices  when integrating AI into their businesses.

Through this legislation, we will level the playing field. We will  ensure small businesses have the ability to modernize and remain  competitive against their larger counterparts. Main Street is what  keeps the American spirit alive. With this bill, we will ensure that  Main Street is safe for generations to come.
