One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. COLLINS. Mr. Speaker, campaign promises made and soon to be  campaign promises kept.

I spent my entire career in the private sector. I know what those  Trump tax policies did for me and for my business, my community, my  State, and my country.

Now, with this bill, we are going to bring inflation under control,  have energy dominance, make sure that small businesses have certainty  with our tax policies out there. Also, Mr. Speaker, we are going to  bring these Federal agencies under control by deregulation.

If we do that, we will unleash the American entrepreneurial spirit  out there. This is a big day for Main Street. Wall Street has had their  time.

I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill, and let's get this  thing to the President's desk.
