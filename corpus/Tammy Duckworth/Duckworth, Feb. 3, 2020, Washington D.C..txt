Duckworth, Durbin Announce Over $80,000 for Rural Development in Southern Illinois


U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) announced $84,000 in federal funding today to help the City of Grayville address health and sanitation concerns after record rainfall last summer led to flooded water wells, contaminating the city's water supply. This funding comes from the Emergency Community Water Assistance Grants program within the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Office of Rural Development.

"Investments like these help rural communities in Southern Illinois recover from severe flooding damage," Duckworth said. "I will continue working with Senator Durbin to make sure hardworking Illinoisans receive the federal support they deserve to improve infrastructure and keep families healthy and safe."

"This funding is an investment in Grayville's infrastructure, economy, and public health," Durbin said. "Senator Duckworth and I will continue working to ensure that our state's rural communities have access to these important federal resources."

Under this announcement, the City of Grayville will receive funding to help test, treat and clean its wells for bacteria and provide safe drinking water to its 1,666 residents.

USDA Rural Development invests in infrastructure projects across the country through loans and grants to underserved rural communities. These resources help provide much-needed infrastructure improvements that help public safety, healthcare, business development, homeownership, community services and access to high-speed internet.
