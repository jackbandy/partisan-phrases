Duckworth Meets With John A. Logan College Trustees to Discuss Higher Education Issues


U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today met with two members of the John A. Logan College Board of Trustees--Mandy Little and Aaron Smith--to discuss the importance of making higher education more affordable and investing in Veteran and servicemember education. Little and Smith are in Washington, D.C., attending the Association of Community College Trustees' (ACCT) national legislative summit. A photo of the meeting is available here.

"Those of us who weren't always sure we'd be able to go to college understand the power of a diploma," Duckworth said. "I'm proud to support community colleges like John A. Logan that help expand educational opportunity in Southern Illinois and all across our state. I'll keep working to make higher education more affordable so that every American has the opportunity to enroll in college and complete a degree."

Duckworth is working to include two of her bills--the Community College to Career Fund (CC2C) Act and the Expanding On-Campus Child Care to Help Student Parents Succeed Act--in the next Higher Education Act (HEA) Reauthorization. The CC2C Act would make higher education more affordable for students pursuing degrees in high-skill industries by helping businesses fill vacant, good-paying positions with qualified candidates while the Expanding On-Campus Child Care to Help Student Parents Succeed Act would increase access to on-campus child care for low-income student parents and ensure the U.S. Department of Education is meeting the needs of our student parent populations. Duckworth also helped re-introduce legislation last March to allow Americans with outstanding student loan debt to refinance their loans at more affordable interest rates, potentially saving thousands of dollars.
