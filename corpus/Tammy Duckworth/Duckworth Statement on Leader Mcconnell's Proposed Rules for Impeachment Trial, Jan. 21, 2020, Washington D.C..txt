Duckworth Statement on Leader Mcconnell's Proposed Rules for Impeachment Trial


U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) issued the following statement after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-KY) proposed rules for the upcoming impeachment trial of President Trump:

"Mitch McConnell has already admitted he's working hand-in-hand with Trump on the impeachment trial and violating his oath to be impartial, but his proposed rules for the trial--including holding the trial at 1:00 in the morning--are yet more evidence that he's helping the White House perpetrate a cover-up. The oath I took to be impartial means something to me, and I hope it does to at least four of my Republican colleagues as well--they may be our last chance for getting anything close to a fair trial."
