Durbin, Duckworth Meet With Chicago Mayor Lightfoot


Today, U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) met with Chicago Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot to discuss Chicago priorities and how they can assist her in the Senate.  Durbin, Duckworth, and Lightfoot talked about reducing gun violence, the Chicago HEAL Initiative, the 2020 Census, public housing, transportation infrastructure funding, and cannabis.  Durbin and Duckworth hosted Mayor Lightfoot, along with nine other mayors from across Illinois who are in Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

"It was great to sit down with Mayor Lightfoot and discuss some of the critical issues facing Chicago.  Mayor Lightfoot has been a tremendous leader for the city and I reiterated that Senator Duckworth and I stand read to help her achieve the goals she has set," Durbin said.

"I had a productive discussion with Mayor Lightfoot and Senator Durbin today about ensuring that Chicago has the resources it needs to remain a world-class city," said Duckworth. "It's critical that Congress continues to support new investments in our nation's infrastructure, and we'll keep working to advocate for Chicago and bring federal dollars back to the city."

"I was proud to join Senator Durbin and Senator Duckworth, along with other mayors from across Illinois, for a productive discussion around some of the most critical issues facing Chicago and our entire state," said Lightfoot. "None of us can advance our priorities or achieve our goals alone, and for the good of all our residents, we need strong partnerships at the federal level. Illinois is incredibly fortunate to have public servants like Senators Durbin and Duckworth standing up and fighting for us in our nation's capital, and I am grateful for the work they do every day."
