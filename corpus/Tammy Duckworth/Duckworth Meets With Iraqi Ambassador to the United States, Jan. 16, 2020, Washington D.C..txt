Duckworth Meets With Iraqi Ambassador to the United States


U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today met with Iraq's Ambassador to the United States, Fareed Yasseen, today in her Capitol Hill Office. Following the Trump Administration's erratic actions in Iraq, Duckworth and Yasseen discussed the impact these actions have had on regional stability and the U.S. - Iraqi partnership. Duckworth also asked Yasseen what she and her Senate colleagues can do to help repair any damage that has been done to this partnership over the past few weeks. Photos of the meeting are available here.

"Ambassador Yasseen and I had a productive discussion today about the relationship between our two nations, the status of ISIS forces in Iraq and the future of U.S. engagement in the region," Duckworth said. "It is my hope that Iraq will be an independent, sovereign nation and a close ally of the United States for many years to come. I look forward to working with Ambassador Yasseen to maintain our alliance, promote economic opportunity and enhance regional stability."

Last April, Duckworth led a bipartisan congressional delegation to Iraq, which also marked her first return to the country since being shot down in 2004. U.S. Senators Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Angus King (I-ME) joined her on the official trip, where the Senators met with Iraq's top leaders and received operational and intelligence updates from American diplomats and military commanders in the region.
