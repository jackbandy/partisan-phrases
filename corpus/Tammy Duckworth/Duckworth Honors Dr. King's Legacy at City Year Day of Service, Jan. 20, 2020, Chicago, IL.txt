Duckworth Honors Dr. King's Legacy at City Year Day of Service, Rainbow Push Scholarship Breakfast


U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) commemorated Martin Luther King Jr. Day today by joining local leaders and speaking about the value of service at Robert Nathaniel Dett Elementary School, as part of City Year Chicago's annual MLK Day of Service. The Senator, who has made community service a hallmark of her public life and has consistently volunteered to improve her community, supported City Year and community volunteers working to help improve Dett Elementary. Duckworth also joined local leaders at the Rainbow PUSH Excel 30th Annual MLK Scholarship Breakfast this morning to support the organization's efforts to ensure equal opportunity for education among Chicago's youth.

"Today I had the privilege of honoring Dr. King's legacy by joining local leaders dedicated to education opportunities for our youth and civically engaged volunteers on this National Day of Service," Duckworth said. "America's greatest strength is rooted in the diversity of our people, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service is a good opportunity to give back and contribute to bringing the society Dr. King dreamed of closer to reality. It is our responsibility to Dr. King -- who gave his life to make this country more free and just -- to go into our communities and make a difference. It is up to us to work hard for the future of our country and to preserve the values of equality and inclusion."

As a champion for civilian national service in Congress, Duckworth introduced the America's Call To Improve Opportunities Now (ACTION) for National Service Act which builds on her 21st Century American Service Act, in 2019 to help young Americans strengthen their communities and our nation through service while reducing their student debt burden.
