Durbin, Duckworth Announce $25 Million In Federal Funding To Help Illinois Health Centers Expand COVID-19 Testing


U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today announced that Illinois will receive $25,226,505 in federal grants to support expanded COVID-19 testing at 45 Community Health Centers (CHCs) across the state. This funding comes from the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which was signed into law on April 24th. Congressional Democrats fought to ensure that this legislation included a total of $25 billion in new funding to help improve our nation's coronavirus testing capabilities, which will be necessary for any safe reopening of our economy.

 

"Community Health Centers are a critical resource for millions of Americans -- particularly in racially diverse and medically underserved communities that have been disproportionately devastated by this pandemic," Durbin said. "I'm pleased this federal funding will help Illinois health centers increase testing capabilities and respond to the needs of their patients. Senator Duckworth and I will continue to fight for additional funding to support CHCs and improved testing during this unprecedented public health pandemic."

 

"Lives are at stake across Illinois and our entire country because of COVID-19, and Community Health Centers are on the front lines," Duckworth said. "I'm proud to join Senator Durbin in announcing this infusion of federal funding to help our state work towards widespread testing and enable community health centers to continue serving their communities during this public health crisis."

 

Health centers will use this funding to expand the range of testing and testing-related activities to best address the needs of their local communities, including the purchase of personal protective equipment; training for staff, outreach, procurement and administration of tests; laboratory services; notifying identified contacts of infected health center patients of their exposure to COVID-19; and the expansion of walk-up or drive-up testing capabilities.
