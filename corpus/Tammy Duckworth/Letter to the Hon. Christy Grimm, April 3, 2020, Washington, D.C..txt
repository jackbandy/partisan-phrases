Letter to the Hon. Christy Grimm, Principal Deputy Inspector General of the Office of Inspector General - Warren Joins Duckworth to Call For Investigation into Suspicious Deletion of Online Information on the Strategic National Stockpile


United States Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) joined Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) along with Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), and Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawai'i) in demanding an immediate independent investigation into potential improper political interference in the management of the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). 

 

The senators' letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) comes as a response to reports that the SNS website was altered to reflect controversial remarks made by Jared Kushner that the stockpile does not support state and local supplies during public health emergencies.

 

The senators wrote: "This inaccurate deletion distorts the public's understanding of the purpose of the Strategic National Stockpile and violates principles of good and honest government, including transparency, faithful execution of the agency's mission and most importantly, advancing the public interest."
