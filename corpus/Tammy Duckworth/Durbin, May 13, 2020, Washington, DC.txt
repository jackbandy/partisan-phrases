Durbin, Duckworth Join Colleagues To Introduce VoteSafe Act


U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) joined Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) and U.S. Representatives James Clyburn (D-SC-6) and Marcia Fudge (D-OH-11) to introduce the VoteSafe Act, legislation to expand voting options and improve the safety and accessibility of polling places across the country during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Voting is foundational to our democracy, and during an election year, the coronavirus pandemic has created additional obstacles to reaching the ballot box," said Durbin.  "Rather than asking Americans to risk their own health to exercise their right to vote or furthering voter disenfranchisement, we should be instituting forms of voting that are both safe and accessible, including vote by mail and early voting, to every community.  I'm proud to help introduce the VoteSafe Act because every American deserves a voice through their vote."

"COVID19's persistence, and the possibility of a fall resurgence, have made it abundantly clear that we must prepare for an Election Day that does not resemble those of the past," Duckworth said.  "It's our responsibility as a nation to ensure that everyone who is eligible to vote can do so in a way that's secure, accessible and safe.  I'm proud to help Senator Harris introduce the VoteSafe Act today, which would help fulfill that responsibility by expanding access to vote by mail and early voting to every community during this pandemic."

The VoteSafe Act would:

-Require states to provide no-excuse mail-in absentee voting for the 2020 elections and guarantee minimum due process protections for these voters;-Require states to maintain an early in-person voting period of at least 20 days for the 2020 elections;-Authorize $2.5 billion for states to meet their obligations to offer no-excuse absentee voting and early in-person voting; and-Provide $2.5 billion in additional discretionary grant funding for states to further improve the safety and accessibility of voting options during the pandemic, including:   -Ensuring that elections are accessible to individuals with disabilities.   -Ensuring adequate protections for language minority voters.   -Ensuring voting access for American Indian, Alaska Native, and rural voters.   -Implementing and promoting curbside voting.   -Implementing and meeting a maximum wait time standard or publishing current wait times for voters.   -Providing for the training and recruitment of poll workers.   -Improving access to voter registration.
