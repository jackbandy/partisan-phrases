Duckworth, Durbin Announce More Than $13 Million for Chicago Area Head Start Programs


U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) today announced more than $13 million in federal funding to help children in the Chicago-area access Head Start and Early Head Start programs. This funding comes through the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that allocates funding, provides technical assistance, and helps build strategic partnerships in order to promote the social and economic well-being of children and families.

"In the aftermath of the COVID-19 public health and economic crisis, programs like Head Start and Early Head Start will be critical to giving kids throughout Illinois the tools they need to succeed both inside and outside of the classroom," said Duckworth. "Investments in early childhood education and parental support programs go a long way towards helping all children access their full potential and I'm proud to continue supporting this program."

"Head Start and Early Head Start programs are sources of countless success stories in our state and remain crucial for the healthy development of young children," Durbin said. "Many of the families served by these programs live in communities that have been disproportionately devastated by the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This federal funding will help level the playing field by supporting early learning and family well-being."  

The following Chicago-area organizations have been awarded funding:
