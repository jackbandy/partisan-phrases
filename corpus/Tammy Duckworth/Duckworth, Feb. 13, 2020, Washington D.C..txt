Duckworth, Durbin Announce More Than $74 Million to Support Public Housing in Chicagoland Area


U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) today announced $74,763,733 in federal funding to public housing authorities throughout the Chicagoland area for development, financing and modernization of public housing properties. This funding was allocated though the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Public Housing Capital Fund program.

"Children and families in need across Chicagoland rely on investments like these that help improve housing conditions and reduce homelessness," Duckworth said. "Along with Senator Durbin, I'm proud to advocate for federal funding to support programs that foster safe communities and help ensure all Illinoisans have access to the affordable housing they need to get ahead."

"This federal funding gives local agencies in the Chicagoland region the ability to offer safe and affordable housing to those who need it most. In addition, the local economy stands to benefit from this investment in infrastructure projects that will bring safety and modernization to the area's public housing," Durbin said. "I will continue to fight alongside Senator Duckworth to support safe and affordable housing options for Illinoisans."
