Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025


Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1274 and ask  that it be reported by number.

Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, what Trump and Musk have done to our  veterans in just 8 weeks since Trump has been back in office amounts to  a total betrayal. He has already fired more veterans than any other  President in modern history--6,000 and counting--for no apparent  reason, forcing the bravest people you and I could ever meet to have to  worry about how they are going to put food on their family's table next  week or keep a roof over their heads next month.

These are folks who did one, two, six, seven tours and then came home  and chose to continue serving their Nation by joining Federal service.  These are heroes who deserve our utmost gratitude. Instead, Trump and  Musk are giving them the middle finger.

Cadet Bone Spurs may like to wrap himself in the flag with one hand,  but with the other, he is signing off on the orders that sell out our  veterans to line billionaires' pockets, and our warriors deserve  better.

That is one reason I am urging my colleagues to vote yes on my  Protect Veteran Jobs Act--a simple amendment that would reinstate every  veteran who has been fired because of Trump and Musk's betrayal.

If Republicans actually care about our veterans like they claim to on  FOX News--

Ms. DUCKWORTH.--then they will vote yes on this bill and help give  our veterans their jobs back. Otherwise, they are making it clear that  they would rather bow down at the altar of Donald Trump than stand up  for our heroes.
