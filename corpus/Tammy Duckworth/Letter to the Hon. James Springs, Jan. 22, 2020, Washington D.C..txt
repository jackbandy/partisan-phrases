Letter to the Hon. James Springs, National Archives and Records Administration Inspector General - Senator Duckworth Requests Inspector General Investigate the National Archives and Records Administration's Alteration of a Photo Criticizing Donald Trump


Dear Inspector General Springs:I am writing to request that the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Officeof lnspector General (OIG) launch a comprehensive independent investigation into NARA'sdisturbing decision to alter a photographic Getty image NARA featured in the agency's publicexhibition, "Rightfully Hers: American Women and the Vote."Conducting an independent investigation will advance the NARA OIG mission to prevent waste,fraud, abuse and mismanagement, while bringing particularly serious problems, abuses ordeficiencies to the immediate attention of Congress. A NARA OIG investigation is necessary toinform the public and Congress about precisely why this alteration was made and to determinewhether the censorship was an isolated incident or part of a broader pattern by NARA under theTrump administration to alter records for politically-motivated or propaganda purposes. TheNARA OIG investigation should also produce recommendations that include corrective actionsto guard against future editorial abuse by NARA.NARA publicly acknowledged that its manipulation of the photograph to censor material criticalof the President of the United States was wrong. NARA deserves credit for promptly apologizingfor its error and committing to preventing future mistakes. However, given the significance ofNARA' s violation of professional standards and the high risk oflosing public trust, it is vital thatan independent investigative entity - NARA OIG - conduct a thorough investigation into this actof censorship. Thank you in advance for your consideration of my urgent request.
