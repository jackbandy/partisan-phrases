Duckworth Statement on Bipartisan Agreement to Provide Additional Support for Small Businesses, Hospitals and Health Care Workers


U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) released the following statement today after the Senate passed a nearly $500 billion package to provide funding for small businesses, hospitals and health care workers:

 

"After a week of stonewalling, I'm glad Republicans finally came to their senses and joined Democrats to support emergency funding for our hospitals and health care workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic in addition to struggling small businesses. Democrats worked hard to make sure this round of funding included those heroic workers risking their health and lives every day to save their fellow Americans. Along with providing for health care workers and hospitals, this bill also replenishes the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses across the country access the funding they need to weather this storm. Though I wish Republicans had been willing to put more money into this program, as a member of the Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, I will continue working to add billions of dollars in additional funding for PPP forgivable loans, since this replenishment may run out in a few days.

 

"However, I am extremely disappointed that this bill fails to help local and state governments that are facing unprecedented budget crises as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's absolutely critical they are included in the next package and that we provide them--and the first responders who we all rely on that they fund--with the supplies and resources they need to protect our communities during this public crisis."
