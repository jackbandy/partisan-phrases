Duckworth, Durbin, Bustos Announce More Than $2.6 Million for Chicago Rockford International Airport


U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and U.S. Representative Cheri Bustos (D-IL-17) today announced $2,699,192 in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) grant funding to reconstruct a deicing containment facility at Chicago Rockford International Airport in Rockford.

"Federal investments have helped improve operations at Chicago Rockford International Airport, and today's funding will ensure the deicing facility can be upgraded.  I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Duckworth and Congresswoman Bustos to bring these federal investments to Rockford," Durbin said.

"RFD is an important economic engine for the Rockford region and today's funding will help the airport continue growing and improving," Duckworth said. "This funding will help make the airport even safer and more reliable, and I'll keep working with Senator Durbin and Congresswoman Bustos to make sure RFD receives important federal resources that allow it to continue expanding passenger and cargo service while supporting good-paying jobs for hardworking Illinoisans."

"Chicago Rockford International Airport contributes a great deal to the economic strength of our region. That's why I'm pleased to join Senators Durbin and Duckworth to announce this federal investment that will allow RFD to build upon their growing successes. I'll continue to fight for upgrades like these in our communities," Bustos said.

Since 2015, Durbin, Duckworth, and Bustos have secured more than $44 million in federal funds for Rockford Airport for its ongoing expansions, including $5 million for the construction of a 30,000 square yard cargo apron to provide additional aircraft parking.
