Duckworth Visits Over the Rainbow's Midtown Crossing Apartments, Discusses Affordable Housing for People With Disabilities


U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today visited the Over the Rainbow Association's 100 percent barrier-free independent living housing for low income adults in Des Plaines, the Midtown Crossing Apartments. While at Midtown Crossing, Duckworth met with Over the Rainbow Executive Director Eric Huffman and Chief Financial Officer Les Russo to discuss affordable housing for individuals with disabilities and the work Over the Rainbow does with the disability community in Illinois. Photos from today's meeting and tour are available here.

"Expanding access to affordable housing is crucial to helping some of the most vulnerable residents and families across Illinois secure financial stability, and that's true for individuals with disabilities as well," Duckworth said. "It was a pleasure to meet with Over the Rainbow Association and learn more about their mission to help increase affordable independent housing, and I'll keep doing what I can to support the work organizations like theirs do."

As a U.S. Senator, Duckworth has advocated for expanded disability rights and led efforts to protect the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Duckworth gathered 42 of her colleagues to oppose the ADA Education and Reform Act, a Republican-led bill that would reward businesses for failing to make their facilities accessible to people with disabilities, enough to block the bill from being passed. Duckworth has also worked to improve access to low-income and affordable housing options. Last year, Duckworth and Durbin introduced the Averting Crises in Housing Assistance (ACHA) Act, which would invest $70 billion in HUD's Public Housing Capital Fund and improve public housing outcomes for residents.
