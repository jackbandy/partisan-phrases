Durbin, Duckworth Announce More Than $52 Million In Federal Funding To Help Illinois Health Centers Respond To COVID-19


U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today announced that Illinois will receive a total of $52,697,049 in federal grants to support 45 Community Health Centers (CHCs) in their COVID-19 response efforts. This funding comes from the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act that both Durbin and Duckworth voted for to help increase COVID-19 screening and testing needs, acquire medical supplies and protective equipment, and boost telehealth capacity.

"The CARES Act is historic in its scope and size, and will thankfully provide much-needed aid to health centers around our state," Durbin said. "Senator Duckworth and I made it a priority to include increased support for Community Health Centers the CARES Act, but we must continue to build on these efforts in the next coronavirus stimulus package.  Our work is not done." 

"Lives are at stake across Illinois and our entire country because of COVID-19, and Community Health Centers are on the front lines," Duckworth said. "I'm proud to join Senator Durbin in announcing this infusion of federal funding to help our state's health centers continue to serve their communities during this public health crisis."
