Duckworth Provisions to Support Servicemembers and Enhance Military Modernization Efforts Included in Committee-Passed 2021 Defense Bills


Combat Veteran and U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), a Purple Heart recipient and one of the first handful of Army women to fly combat missions during Operation Iraqi Freedom, highlighted several key priorities she authored and successfully included in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that passed the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) on a bipartisan vote of 25-2 this week. The NDAA, which is now set to be considered by the full U.S. Senate, authorizes funding for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), sets our nation's defense policy and ensures that our servicemembers have the tools they need to defend our nation. Duckworth's priorities in the Committee-passed version of the FY2021 NDAA include provisions to bolster transportation infrastructure and logistics systems, accelerate rotary wing modernization efforts, invest more DoD resources into emerging regions like Southeast Asia and make sure our female servicemembers are properly equipped for combat. The Committee-passed NDAA also includes a 3% pay raise for our troops.

"The brave men and women in uniform who are deployed across the globe deserve to know that our country stands behind them as they risk their lives to defend our country and our Constitution--especially during volatile times like these when their fellow servicemembers are being so blatantly politicized by their own Commander in Chief," Duckworth said. "Though several provisions in this compromise are not ones I support, I'm proud that a well-deserved pay raise for our troops and several of my provisions were included in this version to support our servicemembers and military families, enhance our military's transportation and logistics systems and invest in emerging regions like Southeast Asia. I'm also pleased that the Committee included Senator Warren's amendment to help our nation heal by removing all Confederate monuments from DoD assets. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue improving the NDAA and ensure Congress sends a message that we have our troops' backs."

Duckworth is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and an Iraq War Veteran who served in the Reserved Forces for 23 years before retiring from military service in 2014 at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. She served on the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) during her four years serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, where she authored numerous provisions aimed at improving servicemember quality of life, reducing government waste and promoting job creation. Last year, Duckworth also authored several amendments that were included in the FY2020 NDAA to help protect servicemembers from toxic chemicals, support IL jobs and shield Veterans from deportation.

Key Duckworth provisions included in this year's NDAA would:

Better Support Military Personnel, Families and Retirees:A Duckworth-authored provision to make it easier for DoD and the National Guard to begin clean-up of PFAS based on the drinking water standards set in each state, providing states and DoD the flexibility they need to create an action plan.A provision based on an amendment authored by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and cosponsored by Senator Duckworth to direct the removal of all confederate names, symbols, monuments, displays and paraphernalia from DoD assets, including installations within three years of enactment. Donald Trump's White House later threatened to veto this critical defense legislation if it included provisions such as this, leading Senator Duckworth to issue the following statement."It would be shameful enough for the current occupant of the Oval Office to refuse to even consider having the U.S. Military stop honoring traitors who took up arms against America to defend their ability to own, sell and kill Black Americans," said Duckworth. "But for the Trump White House to threaten vetoing a pay raise for our troops over this is downright despicable."A provision authored by Senator Ernst and Senator Duckworth to include the Ernst-Duckworth Female Body Armor Modernization Act, which would ensure proper-fitting body armor and protective equipment is available for female Servicemembers."When I was serving overseas, I experienced firsthand how our military's body armor and protective equipment hasn't always been constructed with the health and comfort of female servicemembers in mind," Duckworth said regarding this provision. "That's one reason why I'm proud my bill to enhance troop readiness by helping make sure our female servicemembers are properly equipped for combat was included in this committee-passed version, and I'll keep working to make sure it becomes law."A Duckworth-authored amendment to include her Equality in Leadership and Inclusion in Top Elements (ELITE) Act, which would require an independent study identifying barriers to minority participation in the military's accession, assessment and training process.
