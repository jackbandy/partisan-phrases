Mr. VASQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the Isleta Police  Department and local law enforcement for their commitment to protecting  New Mexico's communities. On November 17, 2025, the U.S. Department of  the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs reported a major drug  bust on the Isleta Pueblo.

In coordination with the Bureau of Indian Affairs Division of Drug  Enforcement and a Homeland Security Task Force, local officers from the  Isleta Police Department seized over 37,000 fentanyl pills, which were  valued at nearly 1.5 million dollars, and nearly $38,000 dollars in  cash.

Those deadly pills would have devastated countless lives in our  community, but today the Isleta Pueblo and New Mexico's communities are  safer because of our law enforcement's hard work and dedication. Thanks  to our officers' intelligence and tireless work, more New Mexican  families will remain intact.

On behalf of the people of New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District, I  would like to extend my deepest appreciation to the Isleta Police  Department and local law enforcement for their nonstop efforts to  protect our communities. We appreciate their dedication to public  service and pray for their continued safety. I look forward to our  continued partnership as we work to keep drugs off our streets and hold  bad actors seeking to prey on our communities accountable.
