National Police Week


Mr. VASQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week to  honor the courageous law enforcement officers from New Mexico who have  made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our communities.

Every day across our country and in my home State, law enforcement  officers wake up, put on the badge, and commit themselves to protecting  our neighbors. It is a calling that demands bravery, sacrifice, and  unwavering dedication.

This week, we remember those who answered the call and never returned  home.

This year, three officers from New Mexico are being added to the  National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial wall here in Washington:  Corrections Officer Roberto Rodriguez of Dona Ana County, Patrol  Officer Jonah Hernandez of the Las Cruces Police Department, and  Patrolman Justin C. Hare of the New Mexico State Police.

I also want to honor those who recently did not have the opportunity  to come home: Las Cruces Police Officer  J.R. Stewart, Albuquerque Police Officer Bianca Quintana, Alamogordo  Police Officer Anthony ``Tony'' Ferguson, Alamogordo Patrolman James M.  Sides, New Mexico State Police Officer Darian Jarrott, and Curry County  Sheriff Michael Reeves.

To their friends, families, and colleagues: Know that your loved ones  are not forgotten. We grieve with you.

As we reflect on their sacrifice, we must also recommit ourselves to  doing more for those who wear the badge today. That means investing in  officer safety, mental health, and wellness. It means supporting their  families, and it means ensuring they have the tools and resources to  serve our communities with dignity and professionalism. Choosing a life  of service and law enforcement is not easy. It comes with risks that  most of us will never know, but because of officers like Roberto,  Jonah, and Justin, our communities are safer, and our values of justice  and service endure.

On behalf of all New Mexicans, I offer my deepest gratitude. May  their memories be a blessing, and may we continue to honor them with  action, compassion, and resolve.                        Recognizing Chief Jeremy Story

Mr. VASQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional  public servant from my district, Chief Jeremy Story.

Chief Story is from the Las Cruces Police Department, my hometown,  and he is someone I was proud to serve with in local government. Chief  Story has spent over 18 years in service to Las Cruces, rising through  the ranks from cadet to chief of police. He is a U.S. Marine Corps  veteran, a graduate of New Mexico State University, and a man deeply  rooted in the values of duty, accountability, and community.

Earlier this year, our community faced a horrific mass shooting, an  act of senseless violence that shook Las Cruces to its core. In the  face of this tragedy, Chief Story responded swiftly and with  compassion. His leadership was grounded in facts, calm under pressure,  and, most importantly, rooted in empathy for the victims, their  families, and all of those affected.

At a time when our community needed strength and clarity, Chief Story  was there, not only with answers, but with presence. He brought  together law enforcement, emergency responders, and community leaders,  not just to respond, but to begin the healing of our community.

In May of this year, he was named Citizen of the Year by the Greater  Las Cruces Chamber of Commerce. That recognition was well-earned.  Today, I want to make sure that his dedication is honored here on the  floor of the House of Representatives.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all New Mexicans, I thank Chief Jeremy  Story for his continued leadership and unwavering commitment to the  people of Las Cruces.
