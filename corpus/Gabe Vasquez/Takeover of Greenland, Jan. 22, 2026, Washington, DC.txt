Takeover of Greenland


Mr. VASQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my Republican  colleagues to reject the President's proposed takeover of Greenland.

As we celebrate Dr. King's legacy, I am reminded of his belief that  the ultimate measure of a person is not where they stand in moments of  comfort and convenience but where they stand at times of challenge and  controversy.

This is one of the most turbulent and divided times in our Nation's  history. As a governing body and as a nation, our individual and  collective character is being measured and tested. We must not fail  that test.

America must show the world that we truly are a nation built not on  hostility but on reasoned diplomacy and the deeper values of freedom  and liberty that our forefathers fought for.

I come from a State with a long and proud history of military  service, brave  men and women who stood up courageously to tyranny, fighting for  liberation, strengthening world peace, upholding law, and reflecting  the patriotic values that we claim to defend.

The time is now in which our true character is being tested, and my  Republican colleagues must decide if we will honor those who have gone  before us or betray their legacy and our deepest values.

I implore this body to act with courage and moral character and  reject any future proposals from the President to take over Greenland.
