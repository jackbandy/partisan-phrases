Highlighting the Lapse in Secure Rural Schools Funding

Mr. VASQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, on behalf New Mexico's Second District, I  rise to highlight the dire financial situation many rural communities  face because of the lapse in Secure Rural Schools funding.

For over 20 years, Congress has used SRS to support rural areas where  national forests limit the local tax revenue. This funding has been a  vital lifeline, helping rural communities pay for essential services  like schools and roads.

Since SRS funding expired in 2024, these areas now face impossible  choices like laying off beloved teachers, cutting back to 4-day school  weeks, and deferring critical road maintenance that emergency  responders rely on.

Last year, New Mexico lost $9 million alone. I just met with a  bipartisan group of county officials and educators back home. Their  message was clear. Without this funding, rural communities are in  crisis. We must act now.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Secure Rural Schools  Reauthorization Act so that rural communities in New Mexico and across  the country are not forgotten and left behind without access to basic  needs.
