Ensuring Veterans Receive Care They Earned


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688352/ensuring-veterans-receive-care-they-earned


Mr. VASQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of the men  and women who have served this Nation and defended our freedoms. They  now face unnecessary obstacles in accessing the care and support that  they have earned.

New Mexico is home to a strong and proud veteran community with a  deep military tradition, spanning from Holloman Air Force Base to White  Sands Missile Range and from Kirtland Air Force Base to Cannon Air  Force Base.

We owe it to those who have served to ensure that they can access  healthcare, reliable transportation, and opportunities to succeed in  civilian life.

That is why I am introducing a package of bills focused on real  solutions: expanding healthcare access, improving transportation, and  easing financial burdens for veterans pursuing an education.

No one understands these challenges better than my guest for the  joint address, Master Sergeant Roland L. Cooper. Roland, known to many  back home as ``Coopdawg,'' has spent years fighting for veterans in New  Mexico.

As chairman of the Lincoln/Otero County Veterans Leadership Council,  he has seen firsthand the barriers that rural veterans face: long  travel times for medical care, unreliable transportation, and a system  that too often overlooks them.

His advocacy directly shaped my New Mexico Rural Veteran Health Care  Access Act, which will redraw the Veterans Integrated Service Network  lines. This change will allow veterans in Otero County and Eddy County  to receive care at a closer VA facility in El Paso rather than have to  travel 4 hours to Albuquerque.

Access to care means little if veterans can't get there. That is why  I am also introducing the Rural Veterans Transportation to Care Act,  which expands transportation options for rural veterans so that no one  has to miss an appointment simply because they can't afford the trip.

In rural communities across New Mexico and beyond, lack of  transportation remains one of the greatest barriers to accessing  healthcare. We also need to support veterans transitioning into  civilian life. Education is a key part of that transition for many, but  rising costs are making it harder.

The GI Bill book and supply stipend has remained at $1,000 since  2008, even as the cost of textbooks has skyrocketed. My Veteran  Education Assistance Adjustment Act will increase that stipend to  $1,400, ensuring that no veteran is forced to choose between buying  books or paying their utilities or rent.

These bills were written with input from veterans who have lived  these challenges. Even as we work to strengthen these resources, recent  job cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs are making access even  harder.

Already, 2,400 VA employees have been dismissed. Another 1,400 were  fired after them. These cuts include doctors, mental health  professionals, and benefits processors. These are critical roles that  veterans rely on. Behind these numbers are real people, real  consequences, and real veterans waiting longer for care.

VA employees have come forward anonymously, warning that these job  cuts are affecting veterans' care and leading to many errors. Some of  the people let go were even working on the veterans suicide crisis  hotline.

VA services are already stretched thin. These job losses are making  it worse. That is why I am proud to introduce these crucial bills and  to host Roland ``Coopdawg'' Cooper today.

This is about the veterans in Otero County and Eddy County and all  rural veterans who shouldn't have to choose between buying textbooks  and paying rent or spending half a day on the road just to see a doctor  for 20 minutes. It is about every veteran who has served this Nation  with honor and deserves a government that stands with them, not one  that makes them fight for the benefits that they have already earned.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these bills. Let's  ensure that veterans in my district and other rural districts across  the Nation receive the care, benefits, and opportunities that they have  earned because it should mean something when we say: ``Thank you for  your service.'' It is our duty to back that up here in Congress.
