Mr. VASQUEZ. Madam Chair, I thought Republicans' plans were to make  Americans' lives better. I thought we were supposed to lower the cost  of goods. I thought we were supposed to make healthcare more affordable  for Americans.

Well, let me tell you this: When you strip healthcare away from  290,000 New Mexicans, many of which are in my district, including  132,000 children and 26,000 seniors, can anybody on the other side of  the aisle tell me how is that making life better for my constituents  and for New Mexicans?

Well, it is not going to.

In fact, this Republican budget is going to raise healthcare premiums  by nearly $1,000 a year for 20,000 people in my district. It could  force a 60-year-old couple to pay over $16,000 more annually for  coverage.

Now, in my district and in my State, we have some of the best service  records of veterans in this entire country. In fact, we are home to the  Code Talkers. We are home to folks who have served our country with  pride and with dignity for so many years that when I look at the cuts  that are being made to the VA healthcare system, I am ashamed of what  this body is doing. I am ashamed of what my colleagues across the aisle  are doing.

When I go home and I talk to a working mother, a person who wakes up  at 7 in the morning and works two jobs every day and has to send her  kid to school and relies on the food programs just to keep her family  healthy, just to have something in the stomach of that 7-year-old who  is going to first grade, and to know that their food assistance  programs could get taken away, we are doing the exact opposite of what  Republicans promised that they would do for this country.

This budget is a statement of where we are at as a country, and this  is the wrong statement that we are making.
