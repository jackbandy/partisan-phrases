Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Comer and the free State  of Florida's next Governor, Byron Donalds, for introducing this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4922, the D.C. CRIMES Act,  which is sponsored by Congressman Donalds. This critical legislation is  a direct response to the failed pro-crime policies that have turned our  Nation's Capital into a war zone.

Under failing leftist policies, Washington, D.C., has seen an  epidemic of violence: carjackings surging 300 percent, homicides  ravaging communities, and young thugs, some as old as 24, treated as  juveniles, slapped with lenient sentences below mandatory minimums.

It endangers young families and small businesses struggling in this  crime-ridden city. Innocent residents live in fear, while criminals  roam free, mocking the rule of law.

H.R. 4922 cuts through this madness. It ensures adults face adult  consequences. It repeals judges' abilities to dodge mandatory minimums  for youth crimes. Crucially, it blocks the D.C. Council from gutting  sentencing laws, reclaiming Congress' constitutional oversight over  this Federal District, as it should be.

As President Trump declared in his March 2025 executive order, if  D.C. won't act, we must, restoring order, beauty, and safety to our  Capital.

This bill isn't about politics. It is about protecting lives.  Republicans are delivering real reform, tougher accountability,  transparent juvenile crime data via a public website, and a safer D.C.  for all.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us and pass H.R. 4922 now  to make America and this District safe again.
