Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2026


Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of two of my  amendments that are included in H.R. 4016. It will address the fentanyl  crisis devastating our Nation, which has claimed hundreds of thousands  of lives, including thousands in my home State of Colorado.

My amendments redirect vital resources to strengthen our fight  against transnational criminal organizations and the deadly flow of  illicit fentanyl.

My first amendment redirects $2 million to bolster the National Guard  Counterdrug Program. This funding will enhance training and equipment  for our servicemembers, empowering them to disrupt the cartels and  criminal networks fueling this epidemic.

The National Guard is on the front lines of protecting our  communities, and this investment will ensure they have the tools to  stop these lethal drugs before they reach our streets.

My second amendment redirects $2 million of wasteful spending to  increase further funding for counternarcotic support within the  Department of Defense. This will strengthen the DOD's critical role in  intercepting fentanyl and synthetic opioids, saving countless lives.  This is something that is extremely critical in fighting this  devastating epidemic that we are facing.

The fentanyl crisis has torn families apart and left communities in  mourning. These amendments are a targeted, urgent response to fight  back against this deadly drug.

Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support both of my amendments, to  stand with our servicemembers, and to protect the lives of Americans  across this great Nation.
