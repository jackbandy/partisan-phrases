No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025


Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the No Rogue Rulings  Act, a bold and necessary step to rein in activist judges who have made  it their sole mission to obstruct the agenda of President Donald J.  Trump.

Let's be clear about what is at stake. In November 2024, the American  people gave President Trump a mandate to secure our borders, shrink a  bloated Federal bureaucracy, and put America first. He has acted  swiftly, with over 100 executive orders in just 3 months, to deliver on  those promises that he made to the American people.

Yet, what have we seen? Unelected judges have issued sweeping  nationwide injunctions to stop him at every turn. There have been 53  lawsuits already halting deportations of dangerous criminal aliens,  blocking cuts to wasteful spending, and tying the hands of a President  doing his best to protect America.

This isn't justice. It is judicial tyranny. The No Rogue Rulings Act  says that enough is enough. It is a simple, commonsense fix. No single  district judge should have the power to grind the entire Nation to a  halt with one rogue ruling.

Why should a single unelected judge override the votes of 80 million  Americans? This is not how our Constitution was designed. The Founding  Fathers gave Congress the power to check the courts, and it is time we  began using it.

Take Judge James Boasberg's ruling last month halting deportations of  Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act. President Trump  invoked a law from 1798 to protect our streets, and one judge decided  that he knows better than the Commander in Chief.

Mr. Speaker, it is time to take our government back from the black- robed bureaucrats. I support this bill, and I thank the gentleman from  California (Mr. Issa) for introducing it.
