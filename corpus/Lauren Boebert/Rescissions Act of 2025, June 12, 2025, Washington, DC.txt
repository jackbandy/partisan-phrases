Rescissions Act of 2025

Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for yielding me time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support today of H.R. 4, President Trump's  big, beautiful rescissions package.

This bill slashes radical foreign aid at the State Department, USAID,  and the U.S. Institute of Peace for woke gender ideology and equity  nonsense that mocks American values. Why are we bankrolling wokeism  abroad when ranchers and small business owners in my district are  struggling?

H.R. 4 defunds PBS and NPR's biased media circus. For years,  taxpayers have been forced to subsidize a public media system that is  less about informing and more about indoctrinating.

To my friends across the aisle, I know you love your globalist pet  projects, but the American people are fed up. The voters that sent us  here are watching, and they are done seeing their dollars shipped  overseas and funneled into biased media.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4 is a victory for taxpayers, and I urge its  adoption.
