Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, this year, the First Baptist Church of Biloxi  celebrates 150 incredible years of ministry and service.

Since 1875, this church has stood as a beacon of faith, hope, and  love--guiding generations through times of challenge and celebration.  Their commitment to spreading the Gospel, serving the Gulf Coast  community, and nurturing spiritual growth has made a lasting impact.

This milestone is not just about looking back--it's a powerful  reminder of the faithfulness of God and the strength of a community  rooted in Him.

I thank Pastor Gibson, the leadership team, and every member of this  congregation for their dedication, their prayers, and their service.  May God continue to bless them as they move forward into the next  chapter of this remarkable journey.

Congratulations, and happy 150th anniversary.
