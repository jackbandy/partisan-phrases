Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1071, the National Defense  Authorization Act of 2026.

This bipartisan legislation includes the Coast Guard Authorization  Act of 2025. This bill supports the efforts of the Coast Guard to  protect American waters, interdict drugs, stop human trafficking,  promote maritime safety, and save lives at sea.

The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2025 authorizes funding for the  Coast Guard through fiscal year 2027 and makes critical investments to  enable the service to meet its growing mission demands.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work of Chairman Graves on this  legislation, along with Ranking Member Larsen and Coast Guard and  Maritime Transportation Subcommittee Ranking Member Carbajal.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
