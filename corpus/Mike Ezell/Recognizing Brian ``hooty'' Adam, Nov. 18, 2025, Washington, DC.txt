Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a distinguished  public servant from Hancock County, Mississippi, Brian ``Hooty'' Adam,  who will retire on December 21, 2025, after more than four decades of  serving his community.

Hooty began his career in 1985 as a firefighter, answering the call  when his neighbors needed him most. In 2003, he became director of  Hancock Emergency Management Agency, a role he has carried with steady  leadership for 22 years.

During that time, he guided the county through countless emergencies;  destructive storms; and, most notably, the unimaginable challenges of  Hurricane Katrina. Through every crisis, Hooty was a source of  strength--calm, prepared, and fully committed to protecting the people  of Hancock County, Mississippi. His leadership saved lives,  strengthened emergency response across our region, and set a standard  of service that we should all admire.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Hooty Adam  for his extraordinary dedication and in wishing him the very best in  his well-earned retirement.
