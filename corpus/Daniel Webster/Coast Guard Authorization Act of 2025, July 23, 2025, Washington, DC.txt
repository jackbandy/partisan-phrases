Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2025


Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to support  H.R. 4275 to ensure that the Coast Guard has the authorities and  resources needed to meet the vital missions that they have.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides the Coast Guard a much-needed  and historic downpayment of $24 billion for new operational assets and  systems.

This bill is still needed to support the important work of the Coast  Guard, which does protect our waters through drug interdiction, stops  human trafficking, and promotes maritime safety.

It also establishes a Secretary of the Coast Guard, an important step  in the right direction to ensure that the Coast Guard men and women  remain a priority for many administrations to come.

The other armed services have this position, and they also do much  better and they have a better track record in getting the assets  necessary to carry out their missions.

I am thrilled that President Trump and Secretary Noem have focused on  the Coast Guard, and I am hopeful that this year the Senate also will  move to pass this important legislation.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
