Recognizing the 100th Anniversary of the City of Fruitland Park, Florida


Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and  celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the City of Fruitland Park, Florida.  Known fondly as ``The Friendly City'', Fruitland Park is a historic and  thriving community in Lake County, Florida.

On December 14, 1925, residents of the area gathered at the Casino  building in Fruitland Park for the purpose of organizing a municipal  government. With a shared vision for the future, the citizens voted to  incorporate their town and officially adopted the name Fruitland Park.  Less than two years later, in May of 1927, the city was formally  chartered.

In 1925, Fruitland Park was home to just 417 residents, spread across  a modest 3-square-mile area. As of May 2025, the city has grown to  serve a population of roughly 9,015 across more than 7 square miles.

Today, Fruitland Park provides a full range of municipal services,  including public safety through police and fire departments, essential  infrastructure support via a robust public works department, access to  clean water and sanitation utilities, and vibrant recreational and  library services. These offerings reflect the city's deep commitment to  enhancing quality of life for its residents.

Fruitland Park's natural beauty, small-town charm, and strong civic  infrastructure make it a desirable location for retirees and families  alike. Its development in recent years has been extraordinary, and its  future continues to look bright with anticipated progress over the  coming decade.

It is my privilege to honor and celebrate the City of Fruitland Park  on the occasion of its centennial anniversary. May the next 100 years  be as vibrant and prosperous as the first.
