Recognizing the 150th Anniversary of the Leesburg Fire Department


Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to recognize  and celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the Leesburg Fire Department in  the city of Leesburg, Florida.

Since its founding in 1875, the Leesburg Fire Department has been a  steadfast symbol of courage, dedication, and selfess public service.  For a century and a half, the department has served the people of  Leesburg with the same commitment and bravery that defined its earliest  days.

As we commemorate this remarkable milestone, we not only honor the  department's rich history, but also pay tribute to the men and women,  past and present, who have answered the call to protect life and  property in times of need.

Congratulations to the Leesburg Fire Department on 150 years of  outstanding service. I am proud to join the community in expressing our  deepest gratitude and appreciation for their enduring contributions to  the safety and well-being of Leesburg.
