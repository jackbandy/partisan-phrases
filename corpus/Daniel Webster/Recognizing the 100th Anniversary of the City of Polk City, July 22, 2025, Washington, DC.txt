Recognizing the 100th Anniversary of the City of Polk City, Florida


Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and  celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the City of Polk City, Florida.

Polk City, known locally as the Gateway to the Green Swamp, is in the  northern part of Polk County, Florida. The city officially received its  charter on April 3, 1925, thus marking the beginning of its formal  governance and development.

Polk City was first settled in 1922 when Mr. Isaac Van Horn was  traveling through Polk County and believed oil fields waited to be  exploited. Mr. Van Horn was responsible for naming the town after  President James K. Polk and increasing the population with new  construction of oil rigs.

Today, Polk City is home to approximately 2,000 residents and remains  a vibrant small town with a strong sense community and rural charm. It  is known for the General James. A. Van Fleet Trail and beautiful lakes.  As we commemorate this centennial milestone, we honor the generations  who have shaped Polk City's legacy as a city built on resilience,  agriculture, and a deep sense of community.

Happy Centennial, Polk City.
