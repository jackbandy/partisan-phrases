Recognizing Sylvia Marie Thornton on Her 98th Birthday


Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to extend  warm congratulations to Sylvia Marie Thornton on the occasion of her  98th birthday. Sylvia was born in Bainbridge, Georgia, on November 29,  1927, and this momentous milestone will be joyfully celebrated with her  family and friends in Umatilla, Florida, on December 6, 2025.

It is my pleasure to join her loved ones in honoring Sylvia's long  and admirable life and in reflecting on the profound impact she has  made on all who know her. For Decades, Sylvia has exemplified steadfast  dedication to her family, her community, and her church.

In 1945, Sylvia married the love of her life, Charles Howard  Thornton, and embraced her calling as a pastor's wife. Together, she  and Charles raised six children. She served faithfully in teaching,  serving, and leading the women of the church with grace and devotion.  Guided by an unwavering faith, she made it her mission to instill Godly  values in her children and to encourage them to accept Christ at an  early age. Her legacy continues through her son who now pastors his own  church, carrying on the important work begun by his father. Today, her  children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren honor and love her  deeply as she remains faithful to God.

I congratulate Sylvia on reaching this remarkable milestone. May God  continue to pour out His abundant blessings upon her and her family. It  is my honor to serve her in the United States House of Representatives.
