Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize  and celebrate the 100 Year Anniversary of the City of Ocoee, Florida.  Ocoee officially became a municipality in 1923 and was incorporated as  a city in May 1925. The City of Ocoee will host their Centennial  Celebration on Friday, May 9, 2025.

Ocoee was first settled in the mid-1800s, near Starke Lake, southeast  of Lake Apopka. In 1886, Dr. H.K. Clarke, Charles J. Chunn, and R.B.F.  Roper developed the Town of Ocoee subdivision, naming it after the  Ocoee River in Tennessee. The name ``Ocoee'' comes from the Cherokee  word for ``apricot vine,'' which is what inspired the city's logo now  referred to as the passion flower.

Over the past century, the City of Ocoee has become steeped in rich  history made up of significant moments and milestones. Generations have  come and gone, each adding their own story to the fabric of Ocoee.  Today, with a growing population, over 50,000 people currently call  Ocoee home. The City of Ocoee prides itself on the quality of life it  provides its citizens. Ocoee's unique location in the heart of Central  Florida makes it a wonderful place to live, work and play.

The City of Ocoee will host their Centennial Celebration on Friday,  May 9, 2025. I join our community in celebrating this momentous  occasion. Happy Centennial, Ocoee.
