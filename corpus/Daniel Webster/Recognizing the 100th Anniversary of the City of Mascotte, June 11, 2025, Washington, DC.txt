Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 100th  Anniversary of the City of Mascotte, Florida. Officially incorporated  on November 23, 1925, Mascotte has grown, flourished over the past  century, and this year, the city will mark this historic milestone with  a Centennial Celebration on Saturday, June 21, 2025.

The roots of Mascotte trace back to around 1885, when founder J.W.  Payne first settled the area. The city takes its name from the  Mascotte, a ship owned by Tampa civic leader Henry B. Plant. The  vessel, which played a role in transporting tobacco from Cuba during  the Spanish-American War, is proudly on the city's official seal.

Located in the southwestern portion of Lake County, the City of  Mascotte today is a thriving and diverse community providing a full  range of essential municipal services to its residents. Now home to  over 9,000 residents, Mascotte continues to grow while preserving the  small-town charm and close-knit community spirit that has defined it  for generations. Mascotte is a place where families raise their  children, businesses find opportunity, and neighbors support one  another.

It is my privilege to honor and celebrate the City of Mascotte on the  occasion of its centennial anniversary. May the next 100 years be as  vibrant and prosperous as the first.
