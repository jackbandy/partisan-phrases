Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, we are on the brink of a historic moment. This is a day  I have worked toward for a long time. Throughout my time here, I have  fought for legislative reforms that will restore a Member-driven  process. This is the most Member-driven, principled process in Congress  in my time here.

I ran for office pledging to restore fiscal responsibility and  Congress is embracing it.

For years, I have urged my colleagues to reject the Washington  presumption that nothing can be cut from the budget in order to fund  priorities without increasing the deficit.

Mr. Speaker, by the end of this week, Congress will have passed 12  individual appropriation bills that both fund critical priorities while  also reducing spending. This is a great moment.
