Recognizing Earl Brigham

Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my friend,  Earl Brigham, as he celebrates 50 years of dedicated service as a  barber in Downtown Winter Garden

Earl lost his hearing at around two years of age. When he was ten,  his parents enrolled him in the Florida School for the Deaf and the  Blind in St. Augustine. There, he mastered American Sign Language,  excelled in sports, and graduated in 1966. Following graduation, he was  encouraged to learn a trade and immediately entered barber school,  beginning a career that would span decades and impact generations.

For 50 years, Earl has faithfully served customers at his barber shop  on Plant Street in Winter Garden. What started as a profession quickly  became a ministry of connection. His shop is more than a place for  haircuts, it is a place of laughter, friendship, and community.

Along the way, Earl built a beautiful family. He and his wife, Robin,  raised seven children and are now proud grandparents of nineteen  grandchildren. They raised their children to be bilingual, fluent in  both English and American Sign Language, reflecting Earl's lifelong  role as a bridge between the deaf and hearing worlds.

In addition to his work as a barber, Earl has faithfully served the  Lord. For more than 35 years, he has served as a pastor to the deaf  community, including the past 17 years at West Orlando Baptist Church.  Through both his ministry and profession, he has strengthened families,  encouraged faith, and brought people together.

I join his family, friends, the City of Winter Garden, and his many  local customers in celebrating 50 years of faithful service. Earl's  steadfast faith, joyful spirit, and commitment to others make him a  true pillar of our community. I am grateful to call him my barber and  even more grateful to call him my friend.
