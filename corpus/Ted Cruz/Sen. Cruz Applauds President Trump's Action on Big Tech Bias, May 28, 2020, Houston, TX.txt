Sen. Cruz Applauds President Trump's Action on Big Tech Bias


U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on The Constitution, today issued the following statement commending President Trump's action to rein in Big Tech immunity and bias:

"This executive order is an important acknowledgement that we can no longer afford to let Big Tech go unchecked. For too long, social media platforms like Twitter have hid behind their opaque algorithms and Section 230 immunity to target speech with which they disagree and advance their own political agendas. This doesn't just stifle Americans' free speech; it shapes what Americans see, hear, and ultimately think about the major issues facing our country, including how those issues should be addressed and who should be elected to address them.

"I have long warned that, left unchecked, Big Tech is the greatest threat facing our democracy, and I have led the fight in the Senate to expose Big Tech's pattern of political bias and hold these companies accountable to the American people. I will continue to work with my colleagues and the Trump administration to do just that."

As Sen. Cruz said in a statement yesterday condemning Twitter's continued actions to influence political discourse:

"We know in 2016 social media companies had an outsized role in influencing our presidential election. It is terrifying that a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires have no accountability and the ability with the click of a mouse to censor, to deceive, and to manipulate votes - all without consequence. With another presidential election months away, we need to take action now to curtail that influence, protect free speech, and preserve the integrity of our elections."
