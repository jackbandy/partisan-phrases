Sen. Cruz Comments on Passage of Legislation to Provide Additional COVID-19 Relief


U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today issued a statement following the Senate's passage of additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP):

"The Paycheck Protection Program has provided significant relief to American small businesses and hardworking men and women who are hurting badly as a result of this unprecedented economic devastation.

"But since Thursday, the program has been unable to provide this relief, because Speaker Pelosi and Sen. Schumer cynically blocked the funding. Make no mistake: Democrats' petty partisan games threw millions of struggling employers and workers under the bus and made it harder for them to recover. With each day that passed, more small businesses were forced to file bankruptcy and more Americans were forced to file for unemployment.

"I'm glad Democrats finally came to their senses and stopped their mindless obstruction. But as we've seen - no amount of relief can fully counteract the devastating effects of this economic crisis. That's why, as we continue efforts to curb the spread of this pandemic, we must focus on getting our economy back on its feet and helping the American people safely return to work. I'll be working with my colleagues on commonsense tax and regulatory reforms so that once the economy is re-opened, businesses will be able to succeed and our booming, blue-collar economy will be able to roar back."

For the past two weeks, Sen. Cruz has heard directly from Texas communities on the frontlines of these crises - including business leaders, job creators, and Chambers of Commerce - on the importance of the replenishing the PPP during his virtual statewide tele-tour.

Earlier this week, Sen. Cruz sent a letter to Jovita Carranza, Administrator for the Small Business Administration (SBA), requesting access for Chambers of Commerce and other 501(c)(6) organizations to the PPP.
