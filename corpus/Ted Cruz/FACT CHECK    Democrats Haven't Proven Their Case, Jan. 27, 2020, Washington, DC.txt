FACT CHECK // Democrats Haven't Proven Their Case, Only Aim to Remove Trump From 2020 Ballot


Today, Democrats and the mainstream media have pounced on the leak of former National Security Advisor John Bolton's manuscript. But they're refusing to acknowledge the serious evidence of corruption concerning Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, which had Hunter Biden on its board.

Why?

Because, for them, this is all about undoing the results of the 2016 election and undermining the 2020 election.

As Sen. Cruz noted on the Mark Levin Show:

"[Democrats] are trying to overturn two elections at once. Number one, they want to overturn the 2016 election. They want to take out the democratically elected President of the United States because they're mad at the voters for electing him.

"But number two, they're trying to take Trump off the ballot for 2020 because they think if he's on the ballot, if the American people are choosing, they can't win."

Democrats have admitted their political aim all along.

The latest admission came from Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) who, during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, said there is "a tremendous fear" that President Trump might get re-elected if he's acquitted.

Sen. Hirono isn't alone. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) earlier this month vowed on MSNBC that Democrats "will not stop" attempting to remove President Trump from office.
