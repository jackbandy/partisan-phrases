Sen. Cruz Pushes to Expand Emergency Relief for U.S. Chambers of Commerce


With more than 30 million Americans unemployed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, now more than ever, it's important that small businesses are best equipped to jumpstart the economy. Chambers of commerce provide valuable support to job creators and businesses, which is why U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today announced his intention to introduce legislation to ensure chambers have access to emergency relief funding provided under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP continues to be extremely successful in Texas, with roughly 134,000 different loans approved since the program was enacted, totaling nearly $29 billion.

Upon announcing the bill, Sen. Cruz said:

"As small businesses work to re-open their doors, they'll need access to the resources and tools offered by U.S. Chambers of Commerce. Nearly half of small businesses in Texas are a member of their local chamber. They'll be looking to their chambers for guidance and support as we work to jumpstart the economy and get people back to work. We simply cannot allow these Chambers to go under at a time when they're needed most."
