Sen. Cruz Issues Statement on Elimination of Iran Terror Chief


U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement in response to reports that the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF), Qasem Soleimani, was killed in an airstrike ordered by President Trump:

"The end of Qasem Soleimani is welcome and long-overdue justice for the thousands of Americans killed or wounded by his Iranian-controlled forces across the Middle East, and for the hundreds of thousands of Syrians and Iraqi Sunnis ethnically cleansed by his militias. It is also long-overdue justice for our Israeli allies who have suffered decades of terrorism at the hands of Hezbollah terrorists commanded by his IRGC Quds Force. The message to all those who mean harm to America is loud and clear."
