Rep. Cheney, Sens. Cruz, Graham, Cotton Applaud Trump Administration For Increasing Pressure On Iran, Call For Rescinding Remaining Nuclear Waivers


Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), and Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) today applauded the Trump administration for recent pressure in response to Iranian malign activity and called for the administration to use an upcoming deadline to end remaining civil waivers stemming from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), after Iran's recent announcement that it will no longer be bound by the terms of the deal:

"The catastrophic Obama-Iran nuclear deal was designed to allow Iran to cheat. Certain activities were all but undetectable by inspectors and the deal entangled the international community in Iran's economy and civil nuclear program, with the aim of making it diplomatically impossible to hold the Ayatollahs accountable for whatever violations were discovered. The United States issued waivers allowing those activities, including civil-nuclear waivers.

"We now know from the Nuclear Archive seized by Israel that the regime never gave up its plans to create nuclear weapons. Man-made uranium particles were recently found at an undisclosed Iranian site according to the United Nations, and in recent weeks, Iran announced it will no longer adhere to any of the limits in the deal. In the coming days, the Trump administration will again have to make a decision whether or not to extend civil-nuclear waivers. We applaud President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the Trump administration for the pressure they have imposed in response to past violations, and call on the administration to rescind the remaining waivers in light of Iranian officials' definitive statements abandoning the deal. Enough is enough."
