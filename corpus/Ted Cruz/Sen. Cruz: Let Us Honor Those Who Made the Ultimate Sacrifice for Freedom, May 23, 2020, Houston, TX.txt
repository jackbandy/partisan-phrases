Sen. Cruz: Let Us Honor Those Who Made the Ultimate Sacrifice for Freedom


U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today issued the following statement in advance of Memorial Day:

"This weekend, across Texas and the United States, Americans pause to honor the patriots who gave their last full measure for our liberty. As we honor our friends and loved ones who made the ultimate sacrifice to keep us free, let us also honor the unnamed heroes who lay at rest in our military cemeteries. Although they are gone, they will never be forgotten. Let us never take for granted their unwavering commitment to our country. May God continue to bless our men and women in uniform and may He continue to bless our great nation."
