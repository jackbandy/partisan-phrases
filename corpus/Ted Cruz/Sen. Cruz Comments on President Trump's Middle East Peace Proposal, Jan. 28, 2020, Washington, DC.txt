Sen. Cruz Comments on President Trump's Middle East Peace Proposal


U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today joined President Donald Trump at a White House ceremony, where the President unveiled his Middle East peace proposal.

Following the ceremony, Sen. Cruz issued the following statement:

"Today's plan marks another important step by the Trump administration to undo the sad legacy of the Obama administration, specifically by rendering United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 null and void, and in doing so advances the cause of peace in the Middle East.

"UNSCR 2234 shamefully denied Israel's sovereignty over its territories, including the Jewish Quarter and Old City of Jerusalem, and called on all U.N. states to do the same. This plan represents a clear statement that the United States does not recognize the legitimacy of that resolution. This follows the Trump Administration's recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, moving our embassy to Jerusalem, and establishing that we do not believe Israeli communities beyond the 1967 lines violate international law.

"To have the public support of both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival Benny Gantz is significant, as are the early signs of support from the Arab world. Hopefully, the Palestinian Authority will come to the table and try to secure a lasting peace.

"By standing with our Israeli allies in this way, the Trump administration has also done much to advance the cause of peace. There is a virtue to clarity and to standing unshakably with our friends, which in turn will push our allies in the region closer together economically and diplomatically."
