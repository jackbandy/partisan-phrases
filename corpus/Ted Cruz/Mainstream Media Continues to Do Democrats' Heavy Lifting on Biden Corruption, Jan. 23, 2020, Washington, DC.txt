Mainstream Media Continues to Do Democrats' Heavy Lifting on Biden Corruption


Members of mainstream media are continuing to do the Democrats' heavy lifting: dismissing the credible evidence of real corruption concerning Ukraine and Hunter Biden.

MSNBC contributor and Rachael Maddow Show producer Steve Benen today wrote:

"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) added on Twitter yesterday afternoon: "A reminder of what this is all about: any president - any administration - is justified in investigating corruption." Trump helped promote the missive soon after.

"Do we really have to do this again? Hasn't the argument already been discredited enough?"

Apparently we do.

As Sen. Cruz has repeatedly said, there is very significant evidence of corruption.

How else do the Democrats explain why the son of the then-sitting Vice President, Hunter Biden, was being paid $83,000/month, a million dollars a year? Especially considering he had no background in oil and gas?

Despite the mainstream media's attempt to dismiss the corruption concerning Hunter Biden and Burisma, the House Managers made a very serious strategic error.

As Sen. Cruz said yesterday:

"If the House Manager's case is based on the allegations of corruption concerning Hunter Biden and Joe Biden being a sham, then it is directly relevant. And I got to say, the need for the Senate to hear the testimony of Hunter Biden and the need for the Senate to grant the White House lawyers the ability to take that testimony has become all the more relevant."

Boy haven't we come a long way from 1999. Democrats and their friends have done a complete 180 on impeachment.

BOTTOM LINE: These Articles of Impeachment are driven by politically motivated hatred of President Trump.
