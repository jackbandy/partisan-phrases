Fact Check // Mainstream Media Despises the American People Who Voted for President Trump


On Saturday, CNN's Don Lemon and his guests Rick Wilson and Wajahat Ali made clear what we have known all along: the Democrats and the mainstream media despise the American people who elected President Trump.

As Rick Wilson said:

"Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter "u' and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it. He knows that this is a, you know, an administration defined by ignorance of the world. And so that's partly him playing to their base and playing to their audience, you know, the credulous boomer rube demo that backs Donald Trump - that wants to think that [does impersonation] "Donald Trump's the smart one, and y'all - y'all elitists are dumb!'"

Let's be very clear - this impeachment inquiry isn't about Ukraine. It's about undoing the results of the 2016 election. Democrats and members of the mainstream media are angry at President Trump and angry at the American people for electing him over Hillary Clinton.

As Sen. Cruz has repeatedly explained:

"[Democrats] number one want to overturn the 2016 election and remove the President from office because they're mad that the American people voted for Trump over Hillary.

"But number two, this is about the 2020 election. They want to take Donald Trump off the ballot. They want to prevent the American people from voting for him because they're afraid that if given the choice that the American people are going to vote for free enterprise over socialism. That we're going to vote for jobs over poverty, that we're going to vote for securing the border versus open borders.

"This is politics. This is warfare by another means, which is abusing the Constitution. That's what the congressional Democrats are doing. They're abusing the Constitution to carry out their political and partisan hatred."
