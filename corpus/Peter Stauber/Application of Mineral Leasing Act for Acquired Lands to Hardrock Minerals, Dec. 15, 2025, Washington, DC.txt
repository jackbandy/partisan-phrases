Mr. STAUBER.  3872, the bill now under  consideration.

Mr. STAUBER.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3872, which would amend  the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands, clarifying that all lands  acquired by the Federal Government are eligible to be considered for  hardrock mineral leasing.

I thank my colleague Representative Fallon for his work on the  bipartisan piece of legislation.

Acquired lands comprise 10 percent of the Nation's Federal lands, or  64 million acres. The Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands governs  mineral leasing for a wide range of resources on these lands. However,  the existing statute leaves out hardrock minerals. As a result,  acquired Federal lands holding key critical minerals have effectively  been locked up. This includes vast deposits in the Smackover Formation,  which spans across the southeastern United States and hosts some of  America's best lithium reserves.

Specifically, in northeast Texas, the Bureau of Land Management is  currently unable to even consider hardrock mineral leasing for a  lithium-rich portion of the Smackover Formation because it is located  on land acquired by the Federal Government more than 80 years ago under  a statute that does not explicitly allow hardrock mineral leasing.

H.R. 3872 would address this issue by providing a much-needed  technical fix to the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands, giving the  Secretary of the Interior the authority to tap into our vast mineral  wealth across all types of acquired lands.

As we seek to reshore our mineral supply chains, we must ensure that  no stone gets left unturned. By allowing greater access to tens of  millions of acres of acquired lands, this legislation would help to  break our reliance on adversarial nations like China.

Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Fallon, for his work on  this commonsense bill.

Mr. Speaker, this is a great bill that would provide a much-needed  technical fix to the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands. I again  thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Fallon) for his work on this  bipartisan piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
