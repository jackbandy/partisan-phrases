Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, this week started off very difficult with  losing Representative LaMalfa. I had the privilege of serving with him  for 7 years on the Natural Resources Committee. He also chaired the  Western Caucus this past year. He did a wonderful job.

He was that gentle giant, Mr. Speaker, that you could always count  on. He was a person of reason, but as you got to know Doug, Mr.  Speaker, he was an even better person. He was a humble, Christian,  faithful person.

Mr. Speaker, we need more of that in this body, especially now.

We know that Doug is with his Savior. We know that his Savior chose  this time earlier this week, but Doug is resting in eternity with  Almighty God, his Savior, Jesus Christ.

To his wife, Jill, I thank her for allowing him to serve not only in  the California Legislature but here in this body. I thank her for  allowing him to travel, as Mr. Garamendi just said, all that way to and  from the great State of California. After those long trips, he would  come in, and you knew on Monday or Tuesday nights, the start of the  session, when he would come in here wearing some tattered clothes. He  was a little bit disheveled, but he had had a long day.

He was here for the people of his district, and he left a legacy that  we all should cherish, honor, and remember.

That is why we are here today, Mr. Speaker. We are honoring Doug. He  always had a nickname for every one of us.

Doug, I know you are resting in peace for eternity, but I thank you  for serving this great Nation. I thank you for serving the great State  of California in the way you did. You left a legacy. You helped all of  us become better Representatives.

To Jill, our thoughts and prayers are with her and her four children.  God bless you and take care of your family.
