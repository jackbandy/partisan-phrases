Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1098) to reauthorize the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and  Design Program Act of 1994, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                      H.R. 1098

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REAUTHORIZATION OF JUNIOR DUCK STAMP CONSERVATION                     AND DESIGN PROGRAM ACT OF 1994.

(a) Definition of State.--Section 5 of the Junior Duck       Stamp Conservation and Design Program Act of 1994 (16 U.S.C.       719b-1) is amended--

(1) by inserting ``and'' after ``Guam,''; and

(2) by striking ``, and any other territory or possession''       after ``Virgin Islands''.

(b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 6 of the       Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program Act of 1994       (16 U.S.C. 719c) is amended--

(1) in subsection (a), by striking ``2006 through 2010''       and inserting ``2025 through 2031''; and

(2) by adding at the end the following:

``(c) No Additional Funds Authorized.--Funds authorized       under subsection (a) may, as provided in appropriations Acts,       only come from within amounts authorized to be appropriated       to the Secretary to carry out the duties of the Federal Duck       Stamp Office.''.

Mr. STAUBER.  1098, the bill now under  consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1098 to reauthorize the Junior  Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program Act of 1994, sponsored by  Representative Scholten from Michigan.

Participants in the Junior Duck Stamp program take part in a  waterfowl-themed art competition, and the winning artwork is  transformed into collectible stamps. The proceeds from these stamps  support efforts to connect the next generation of Americans to the  outdoors.

The legislation before us would reauthorize the program through  fiscal year 2031. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, this bill reauthorizes an important program  that invests in the next generation and encourages them to continue our  country's great outdoor and sporting legacy. I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
