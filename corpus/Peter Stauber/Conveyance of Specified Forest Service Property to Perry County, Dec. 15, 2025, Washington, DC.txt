Mr. STAUBER.  3187, the bill now under  consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3187, led by my  friend and colleague from Arkansas, Representative Hill.

This legislation directs the Secretary of Agriculture to convey a  vacant Forest Service building and less than 1 acre of surrounding land  in Perryville, Arkansas, to Perry County.

This property has sat vacant for years, and the Forest Service has no  plans for its use. In the meantime, the building has been damaged by  weather and continues to decline structurally. Every year, it stays  vacant, resulting in higher repair costs and increased liability for  the Federal Government and taxpayers. Instead of watching this asset  deteriorate, we have the chance to put it to productive use for the  local community.

For more than a decade, Perry County sought to acquire this site to  meet pressing needs in education, conservation, and youth development.  The county intends to renovate and repurpose the building to provide a  permanent home for the University of Arkansas Extension Program, the  Perry County Conservation District, and 4-H youth programs. Having a  dedicated facility will allow these organizations to expand their  services and better support the people of Perry County.

This bill is also fiscally responsible. It will eliminate the Federal  cost of maintaining an idle, deteriorating building. By transferring  the site, we stop wasting resources and empower local leaders to  transform a declining Federal property into a hub for education,  conservation, and youth programs.

H.R. 3187 is a commonsense solution. It cuts costs, eliminates waste,  and supports youth engagement in conservation. I commend Representative  Hill for his championing this thoughtful legislation which will support  community development in a rural county with limited resources.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.

Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 3187 is about turning a  Federal liability into a community asset. Right now, taxpayers are  stuck with the cost of a vacant building that continues to deteriorate.  With this bill, we can remove that burden, transfer the property to  Perry County, Arkansas, and allow local leaders to put it to work  serving their community.

This legislation will provide a permanent home for programs that  strengthen conservation, support farmers and landowners, and create new  opportunities for young people through 4-H extension services.

It is a practical, cost-effective solution that delivers real value.  I, once again, thank Representative Hill for his hard work on this  bill.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill today,  and I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
