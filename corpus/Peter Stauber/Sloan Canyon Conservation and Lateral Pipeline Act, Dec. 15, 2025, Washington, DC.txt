Mr. STAUBER.  972, the bill now under  consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 972, the Sloan Canyon  Conservation and Lateral Pipeline Act, introduced by Representative  Titus.

Southern Nevada is one of the fastest growing regions in the country,  and with growth comes increased demand for critical resources like  drinking water.

Right now, nearly 40 percent of the Las Vegas Valley's water is  carried through a single pipeline that was built in the 1990s. That is  a huge vulnerability. If that line goes down, whether for repairs or  due to an outage, the entire region could face a water supply crisis.

The Southern Nevada Water Authority has done its homework. After  years of study and work with local stakeholders, it has proposed the  Horizon Lateral pipeline to ensure a resilient and reliable water  supply for families and businesses across the Las Vegas Valley. The  preferred southern route of this pipeline passes under the Sloan Canyon  National Conservation Area. Compared to other alternatives, this  alignment minimizes impacts on neighborhoods and is estimated to save  taxpayers nearly $200 million.

H.R. 972 authorizes the preferred route for this pipeline through the  national conservation area. This bill also expands the Sloan Canyon  National Conservation Area by more than 9,000 acres. The Bureau of Land  Management already manages these lands, so the expansion would not add  to the Federal estate.

The bill also allows materials excavated from the tunneling to be  reused for infrastructure and public improvements.

This legislation is about balance. It provides the infrastructure  southern Nevada needs to keep pace with growth and ensure reliable  water deliveries without compromising conservation. That is the kind of  practical, forward-looking management we need more of.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 972, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  am prepared to close. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 972 will ensure that the people of  southern Nevada have a more reliable water supply with fewer risks of  disruption. This legislation shows we can meet the needs of growing  communities while being good stewards of America's public lands.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
