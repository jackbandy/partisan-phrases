Delegation Applauds HHS For Awarding Over $326.5 Million in Coronavirus Assistance to Arkansas Health Care Providers


U.S. Senators John Boozman and Tom Cotton--along with Congressmen Rick Crawford, French Hill, Steve Womack and Bruce Westerman--applauded the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for awarding federal funds to hospitals and health care providers across Arkansas to help facilitate the coronavirus response in our communities.  

The grants--totaling $326,536,043--wereawarded to 2,905 health care providers in Arkansas. The funding comes from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act,which recently became law with the support of the Arkansas delegation. It will support healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to coronavirus and ensure uninsured Americans can get the testing and treatment they need without receiving a surprise bill from a provider.

This is the first wave of funding awarded to health care providers from the $100 billion appropriated by the CARES Act. It is being distributed immediately proportionate to providers' share of Medicare fee-for-service reimbursements in 2019. This quick dispersal of funds will provide relief to both providers in coronavirus hotspot areas and those providers who are struggling to keep their doors open due to cancelled elective services.

"Not only are these hospitals and providers on the frontline of the coronavirus fight, but they are struggling like any other business as a result of the pandemic. We are grateful that Secretary Alex Azar recognizes the need to get these funds out swiftly so that these critical facilities can remain operating when our communities need them most," the delegation said.
