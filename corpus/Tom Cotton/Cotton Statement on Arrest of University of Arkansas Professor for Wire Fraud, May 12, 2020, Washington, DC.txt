Cotton Statement on Arrest of University of Arkansas Professor for Wire Fraud


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today released the following statement on the arrest of the University of Arkansas Professor Simon Saw-Teong Ang on charges of wire fraud for failing to disclose his ties to the Chinese government and Chinese companies:

"For years, the Chinese Communist Party has bribed some of our top researchers and stolen from our best labs and universities. Yet China's campaign of economic espionage is largely permissible under our laws, so spies like Simon Ang at University of Arkansas and Charles Lieber at Harvard typically face process crimes like wire fraud or misrepresentations on federal forms. This has to change. I will introduce legislation to prohibit federally funded researchers from accepting Chinese money. We must protect our great universities and our national security from Chinese espionage."
