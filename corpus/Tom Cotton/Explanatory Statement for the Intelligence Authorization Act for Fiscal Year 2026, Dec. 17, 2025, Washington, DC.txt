https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698262/explanatory-statement-for-the-intelligence-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2026


Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, this explanation reflects the status of  negotiations and disposition of issues  reached between the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the  House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence for the Intelligence  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026.

The explanation shall have the same effect with respect to the  implementation of this act as if it were a joint explanatory statement  of a conference committee.

The       Explanatory Statement reflects the result of negotiations       between the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (together,       ``the Committees''). The Explanatory Statement shall have the       same effect with respect to the implementation of the Act as       if it were a joint explanatory statement of a conference       committee.

The classified nature of U.S. intelligence activities       prevents the Committees from publicly disclosing many details       concerning their final decisions regarding funding levels and       policy direction. Therefore, the Committees have prepared a       classified annex--referred to here and within the annex       itself as ``the Agreement''--that contains a classified       Schedule of Authorizations and describes in detail the scope       and intent of the Committees' actions.

The Agreement authorizes the Intelligence Community to       obligate and expend funds as requested in the President's       budget and as modified by the classified Schedule of       Authorizations, subject to applicable reprogramming       procedures.

The classified Schedule of Authorizations is incorporated       into the Act pursuant to Section 6102 of the Act. It has the       status of law. The Agreement supplements and adds detail to       clarify the authorization levels found in the Act and in the       classified Schedule of Authorizations.

This Explanatory Statement incorporates by reference, and       the Executive Branch shall comply with, all direction       contained in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence       Report to accompany the Intelligence Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2026 (S. Rept. 119-51) and in the House Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence Report to accompany the       InteIligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026 (H. Rept.       119-389). The Agreement supersedes all classified direction       in the classified annexes to accompany S. Rept. 119-51 and H.       Rept. 119-389 related to programs and activities authorized       by the Schedule of Authorizations.

The Executive Branch is further directed as follows:   Counterintelligence Support for Department of the Treasury Networks and                                  Systems

The Committees direct that the head of the Office of       Counterintelligence of the Office of Intelligence and       Analysis of the Department of the Treasury shall implement       policies and procedures that ensure counterintelligence       support to all entities of the Department of the Treasury       responsible for safeguarding networks and systems and for       coordinating between counterintelligence threat mitigation       activities and cyber network and system defense efforts. The       Committees further direct that, not later than 270 days after       the date of enactment of the Act, the head of the Office of       Counterintelligence shall submit a report to the Committees       on the status of the implementation of such policies.                    Report on Director's Initiatives Group

The Committees direct that, not later than 30 days after       the date of enactment of the Act, the Director of National       Intelligence shall provide to the Committees a briefing on       personnel matters of the Director's Initiatives Group, which       shall include: (1) a list of personnel of such group from the       date of the creation of the group; and (2) funding sources       for personnel of such group.       Report on Secure Mobile Communications Systems Used To Transmit                           ClassifIed Information

The Committees direct that, not later than 90 days after       the date of enactment of the Acts each Intelligence Community       program head shall submit to the Committees a report on the       secure mobile communications systems used for transmission of       classified information (excluding systems used for purposes       of clandestine or covert communications) and available to       employees and officers of the Intelligence Community. The       report should include the following information: (1) the       name, description, and date of purchase or development of       each system; (2) the number of employees using each system;       (3) the cost of development and operations of each system;       (4) a list of the capabilities and the level of       classification of each system; (5) identification of any       existing service agreements with other elements of the       Intelligence Community for use of a system; and (6)       identification, description, and deployment timeline of any       secure mobile communications systems that are in development.       For purposes of this report, the term ``mobile communications       systems'' means any portable wireless telecommunications       equipment utilized for the transmission or reception of       classified information.                    Ukraine Lessons Learned Working Group

Section 6413 of the Fiscal Year 2025 Intelligence       Authorization Act (P.L. 118-159) required the Director of       National Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense to jointly       establish a working group to identify and share lessons       learned from the Ukraine conflict in order to strengthen       United States national security. Despite the critical       importance of this mandate, the Committees note with concern       that the working group has not been established and that the       Intelligence Community has been unresponsive to repeated       congressional inquiries on this matter.

The Committees recognize that various efforts are underway       across the Executive Branch that may support the objectives       envisioned for the working group. However, the Committees       underscore the importance of adhering to statutory       requirements and ensuring that lessons from Russia's invasion       of Ukraine are systematically identified, coordinated, and       applied.

Accordingly, the Committees direct the Director of National       Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense to stand up the       Ukraine Lessons Learned Working Group, in compliance with the       law, not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of       the Act, and to provide a joint briefing to the Committees on       the status, scope, and initial findings of the working group       not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of the       Act.            Department of State Information Technology Management

The Committees continue to be concerned with the management       of the Department of State's information technology networks       and believe the existing management structure for the       networks may no longer meet the requirements to support a       global diplomatic presence. The Committees therefore direct       the Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and       Research, in coordination with any other bureau or office the       Assistant Secretary determines appropriate, to explore       optimized reorganization of management of the entirety of the       Department's information technology networks and to provide a       briefing to the Committees, not later than 180 days after the       date of enactment of the Act, on potential concepts of       realignment.   Artificial Intelligence Development and Usage by Intelligence Community

Section 6602 of the Act requires the Chief Information       Officer of the Intelligence Community to identify commonly       used artificial intelligence systems or functions that have       the greatest potential for re-use without significant       modification by Intelligence Community elements. The       Committees direct that, in identifying such systems, the       Chief Information Officer of the Intelligence Community       shall, in addition to coordinating with the Chief Artificial       Intelligence Officer of the Intelligence Community,       coordinate with such officials of the Department of Defense,       as identified by the Under Secretary of Defense for       Intelligence and Security, for any systems used by an       Intelligence Community element of the Department of Defense.

Section 6602 also requires the head of each Intelligence       Community element to track and evaluate the performance of       procured and element-developed artificial intelligence. The       Committees are of the view that tracking and evaluating       should at a minimum include--

1. Documenting, to the extent information is readily       available, the provenance of data used to train, fine-tune,       or operate the artificial intelligence system, such as       included in industry-standard Model Cards to the extent       practicable.

2. Conducting ongoing testing and evaluation on artificial       intelligence system performance, the effectiveness of vendor       artificial intelligence offerings, and associated risk       management measures, including by testing in real-world       conditions.

3. The stipulation of conditions for retraining or       decommissioning artificial intelligence capabilities.

4. Requiring sufficient post-award monitoring and       evaluation for effectiveness of the artificial intelligence       system in achieving documented mission outcomes, where       appropriate in the context of the product or service       acquired.    Study on Threats Posed by Unmanned Aerial Systems At or Near the Land                 and Maritime Borders of the United States

The Committees are concerned that hundreds of encounters       with unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are annually recorded at       or near the land and maritime borders of the United States,       which present a vulnerability in national security. With the       proliferation of affordable drones, a wide range of       groups, including malign actors, have sought to make use       of this capability. It is critical that the U.S.       Government has full situational awareness of the threats       these systems pose to U.S. military personnel, other       Federal personnel, and civilians.

The Committees therefore direct that, not later than 180       days after the date of enactment of the Act, the Director of       National Intelligence, in coordination with the       Undersecretary for Intelligence and Analysis of the       Department of Homeland Security and the heads of any other       elements of the Intelligence Community the Director considers       appropriate, shall submit to the Committees a study on the       threat posed by UAS at or near the land and maritime borders       of the United States.

The study shall include the following:

1. An identification of the malign actors operating UAS at       or near the borders, including malign actors who cross such       borders.

2. The information collected by operators of UAS at or near       the borders, and a description of how such data is used by       malign actors.

3. The tactics, techniques, and procedures used by malign       actors operating UAS at or near the borders, including how       such actors acquire, modify, and utilize UAS to conduct       malicious activities, including attacks, surveillance,       conveyance of contraband, and other forms of threats.

4. A description of how a threat is identified and assessed       at or near the borders, including a description of the       capabilities of the United States Government to detect and       identify UAS operated by, or on behalf of, malign actors.

5. The adequacy of United States technology used to detect,       identify, track, monitor, and mitigate threats posed by UAS       operated by malign actors at or near the borders.

6. The guidance, policies, and procedures that address the       privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of persons who       lawfully operate UAS at or near the borders.

7. Current authorities of the United States Government to       counter the use of UAS by malign actors at or near the       borders, including an accounting of the delineated       responsibilities of Federal agencies to counter, contain,       trace, or defeat unmanned aircraft systems at or near the       borders.   Counterintelligence Threats to United States Civil and Commercial Space                                 Interests

The Committees are concerned with counterintelligence       threats to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration       (NASA) and commercial spaceports. Therefore, the Committees       direct that, not later than 90 days after the date of       enactment of the Act, the Director of National Intelligence,       in consultation with the Director of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation (FBI), shall submit to the Committees an       assessment of the counterintelligence vulnerabilities of       NASA, if any.

The assessment shall include the following:

1. An assessment of the vulnerability of the security       practices and facilities of NASA to efforts by nation-state       and non-nation-state actors to acquire United States space       technology.

2. An assessment of the counterintelligence threat posed to       NASA centers by nationals of the Russian Federation and the       People's Republic of China.

3. Recommendations for how NASA can mitigate any       counterintelligence gaps identified under paragraphs (1) and       (2).

4. A description of efforts by NASA to respond to the       efforts of nation-state and non-nation-state actors to       illicitly acquire United States satellites and related items       as described in reports submitted by the Director of National       Intelligence pursuant to section 1261(e) of the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (P.L. 112-      239), along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of these       efforts.

Further, the Committees direct that, not later than 60 days       after the date of enactment of the Act, the head of the       Counterintelligence Division of the FBI, in coordination with       the head of the Office of Private Sector of the FBI, and in       coordination with the Office of Commercial Space       Transportation within the Department of Transportation, shall       develop an assessment of the counterintelligence risks, if       any, to commercial spaceports and distribute the assessment       to each FBI field office in an area of responsibility which       includes a federally-licensed commercial spaceport and the       leadership of each federally-licensed commercial spaceport,       in coordination with the Office of Commercial Space       Transportation.       Protection of Classified Information Related to Budget Functions

The Committees remain concerned with protecting classified       information used in the Intelligence Community's budget-      related activities. Therefore, the Committees direct that,       not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the       Act, the Director of National Intelligence, in coordination       with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Treasury,       and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget,       shall submit to the Committees a study, with a classified       annex, outlining the feasibility of and cost associated with       the department or agency of (1) the Secretary of Treasury;       (2) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; (3)       each head of an element of the Intelligence Community; or (4)       any other head of a department or agency of the Federal       Government carrying out a function specified below, using       secure systems that meet the requirements to protect       classified information, including with respect to the       location at which the system is located or accessed, to carry       out any of the following activities:

1. Formulating, developing, and submitting the budget of       the department or agency (including the budget justification       materials submitted to Congress) under the National       Intelligence Program;

2. Apportioning, allotting, and issuing warrants for the       disbursement of, and obligating and expending funds under the       National Intelligence Program; and

3. Carrying out Federal financial management service       functions or related activities of the Intelligence       Community.      Evaluation of Training Data Pertaining to Artificial Intelligence                                  Systems

It is the sense of the Committees that the Intelligence       Community should seek to evaluate training data, methods of       labeling data, and model weights pertaining to artificial       intelligence systems being considered for use, procurement,       or adoption by an element of the Intelligence Community to       enable such element to make informed decisions regarding the       fitness and reliability of the system and that each element       of the Intelligence Community should, to the greatest extent       practicable, avoid use of any publicly available artificial       intelligence model found to contain information on United       States persons that has been obtained unlawfully by the       vendor of the model.    Annual Survey of Analytic Objectivity Among Officers and Employees of                   Elements of the Intelligence Community

Section 6305 requires the head of certain elements of the       Intelligence Community to conduct a survey of analytic       objectivity among officers and employees of such element who       are involved in the production of intelligence products. The       Committees direct the head of each element to submit to the       Committees a report on the findings of the most recently       completed survey.    Plan To Enhance Intelligence Community Counternarcotics Collaboration                                with Mexico

Section 6717 requires each element of the Intelligence       Community, not later than 60 days after the date of enactment       of the Act, to submit to the Director of National       Intelligence a report on that element's relationship with the       Government of Mexico, if any, as it relates to       counternarcotics collaboration, coordination, and       cooperation, including a strategy to enhance such cooperation       and recommendations regarding the resources required to       effectively implement that strategy. The Committees direct       each element head to simultaneously submit to the Committees       the same report submitted to the Director, along with any       recommendations or requests for changes in authorities or       resources to effectuate the element's strategy.    Efforts by Director of Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence       at Department of Energy to Mitigate Counterintelligence Risks

The Committees are concerned by the counterintelligence       risks posed by Department of Energy employees' travel to       certain countries. Therefore, the Committees direct the       Director of the Office of Intelligence and       Counterintelligence at the Department of Energy to develop       and implement mechanisms for all personnel of the Department       to (1) report to the Office any personal or official travel       to a ``country of risk,'' as defined by section 6432 of the       Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (P.L.       118-159), or to any other country the Director considers       appropriate prior to beginning such travel; (2) at the       request of personnel of the Office, receive briefings with       respect to travel to such country prior to beginning such       travel; and (3) at the request of personnel of the Office,       participate in debriefings after travel to such country.    Notification of Material Changes to Policies or Procedures Governing      Terrorist Watchlist and Transnational Organized Crime Watchlist

Section 6522 requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation to submit to the appropriate congressional       committees notice of any material change to a policy or       procedure relating to the terrorist watchlist or the       transnational organized crime watchlist within 30 days of the       date on which the material change takes effect. This section       separately requires the Director, within 30 days of a request       by an appropriate congressional committee, to submit to that       committee all watchlisting guidance in effect as of the date       of the request that applies to or governs the use of the       terrorist watchlist or the transnational organized crime       watchlist. The Committees emphasize that the term ``material       change to a policy or procedure relating to the terrorist       watchlist or the transnational organized crime watchlist''       includes any change to the watchlisting guidance itself.

National Security Harm Prevented by Prepublication Review

The Committees direct the Director of National       Intelligence, the Director of the Central Intelligence       Agency, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and       the Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and       Research to each submit to the Committees, not later than       April 30, 2026, a report that describes the five items most       harmful to United States national security identified within       the last five years by such element during prepublication       review, as determined by the head of such element or their       designee.                   Reforms to Inactive Security Clearances

Section 6310 of the Act directs the Director of National       Intelligence to review and evaluate whether former       Intelligence Community personnel who departed federal service       within the past five years and previously held a       security clearance could retain access to classified       information if they continue to meet applicable standards.       The section also requires the Director to assess the       feasibility and advisability of applying continuous vetting       to inactive clearances and to report the findings to the       appropriate congressional committees within 120 days of the       date of enactment of the Act. Section 1626 of the Fiscal Year       2026 National Defense Authorization Act contains a similar       requirement for the Under Secretary of Defense for       Intelligence and Security, in coordination with the Director       of National Intelligence, to review the feasibility and       advisability of extending the period during which former       Department of Defense personnel may maintain an inactive       security clearance. The Committees strongly support these       complementary efforts and direct the Director of National       Intelligence and the Under Secretary of Defense for       Intelligence and Security to closely coordinate their reviews       to ensure consistency, share findings as appropriate, and       avoid duplication.
