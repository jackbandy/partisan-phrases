Cotton Calls for FCC Ban on China Telecom


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the following statement after several executive branch agencies recommended that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revoke and terminate China Telecom (Americas) Corp.'s authority to provide telecommunications services to and from the United States.

 

"China Telecom has operated freely in the United States for years, despite being caught hijacking U.S. Internet traffic and misdirecting it through China. Allowing Chinese firms to access our telecommunications network is a threat to Americans' ability to communicate freely and securely. I urge the FCC to heed the unanimous recommendation of six U.S. agencies that China Telecom be banned from operating in the United States."

 

Background:

 

China Telecom is the U.S. subsidiary of a People's Republic of China (PRC) state-owned telecommunications company. The company has a history of rerouting U.S. data through China.
