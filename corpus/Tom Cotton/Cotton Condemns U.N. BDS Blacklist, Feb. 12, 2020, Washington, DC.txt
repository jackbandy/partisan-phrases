Cotton Condemns U.N. BDS Blacklist


U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) released the following statement after the United Nations Human Rights Council issued a BDS blacklist designed to punish certain companies that do business with Israel:

 

"The UN Human Rights Council persecutes Israel while it protects the world's worst tyrants. It ought to investigate the crimes of its own members instead of obsessing over the Jewish State. U.S. federal and state governments should fully enforce existing anti-boycott laws to punish entities that comply with this blacklist."
