Cotton Slams Chinese Retribution Against Australia's Call for Coronavirus Investigation


China has suspended beef imports from Australia's largest meat processors after Australia called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus last month. Following the suspension, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the statement below:

"The Chinese Communist Party is waging economic warfare on our closest allies for daring to call for an investigation into the origins of the Wuhan virus. The CCP would rather cut off trade than allow a simple independent inquiry, a telling reaction. But the United States and our allies won't yield to Beijing's threats as we continue to demand answers from China on the origins of a virus it unleashed on the world."
