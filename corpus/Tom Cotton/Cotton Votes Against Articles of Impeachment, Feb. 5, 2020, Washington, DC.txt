Cotton Votes Against Articles of Impeachment


Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) released the following statement after voting against both articles of impeachment:

 

"The Democrats wanted to use impeachment to cast a cloud of suspicion over the president in an election year. Their purpose was not to seek the truth but to punish a president whom Democrats loathe. Now the impeachment spectacle is over, and the Senate can attend to the real threats facing our country, such as the deadly coronavirus already inside our borders."
