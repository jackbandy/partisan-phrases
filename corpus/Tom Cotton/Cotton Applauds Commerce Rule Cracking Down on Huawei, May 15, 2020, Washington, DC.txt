Cotton Applauds Commerce Rule Cracking Down on Huawei


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today released the following statement on the Commerce Department's new rule blocking Huawei from obtaining semiconductors made with U.S. technology:

"Chinese spy companies like Huawei undermine our export-control rules in order to access advanced computer chips made with American software and technology. I commend the administration for strengthening these rules. The U.S government and responsible industry leaders must take strong action to cut off the Chinese Communist Party's access to technology that it uses to build a network of surveillance and repression around the world."
