Cotton Statement on Iranian Strikes Against Iraqi Bases


Following Iranian strikes against two Iraqi bases housing U.S. forces last night and President Trump's remarks today, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the following statement:

"As I've said all along, if Iran wants to start a fight, the United States will end it. I suspect that Iran's weak attacks on sand dunes at two of our bases in Iraq are a signal that the fight ended when we killed Qassem Soleimani, and that the mullahs are running scared. A leopard can't change its spots, and Tehran won't change course overnight. They'll continue using proxies to fight their battles. But they can't hide--we know who their proxies are, and the United States will remain vigilant in the defense of our citizens and allies in the region."
