Cotton Applauds China Travel Restrictions, Urges Additional Steps


Following an announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar that the United States would deny entry into the country to any foreign national who poses a risk of transmitting coronavirus, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the following statement:

 

"By imposing temporary travel restrictions on China, the president has taken decisive action to protect Americans against the Wuhan coronavirus. I commend the administration for taking the situation seriously and erring on the side of caution. Now it's time to get diagnostic tests out to the front lines, aggressively monitor and track the disease on our soil, and start a Manhattan Project-level effort to develop a vaccine."

 

Background: 

Earlier this week, Senator Cotton sent a letter to Secretary Azar and other members of the administration urging a targeted travel restriction on commercial flights between the U.S. and China.
