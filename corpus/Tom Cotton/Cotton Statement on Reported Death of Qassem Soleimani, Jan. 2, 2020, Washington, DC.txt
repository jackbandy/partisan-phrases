Cotton Statement on Reported Death of Qassem Soleimani


Following reports of a strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, an Iranian Major General in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the commander of its Quds Force, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the following statement:

"Qassem Soleimani masterminded Iran's reign of terror for decades, including the deaths of hundreds of Americans. Tonight, he got what he richly deserved, and all those American soldiers who died by his hand also got what they deserved: justice. America is safer now after Soleimani's demise."
