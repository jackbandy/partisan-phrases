Cotton Statement on Limiting Chinese State Media in U.S.


Following reports that the State Department has announced a personnel cap on four Chinese media companies in retaliation for restrictions on American news outlets in China, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the statement below:

 

"The Chinese Communist Party kicked out real journalists because their publication reported the facts. Today, the administration took justified, retaliatory action by restricting the number of Chinese propagandists in the U.S. This is a good start, but propaganda outlets like China Daily are political tools of the CCP and they should be investigated for violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA)."

 

Background:

 

On February 7th, Senator Cotton sent a letter urging the Department of Justice to investigate China Daily for potential FARA violations. The letter highlights the political activities of China Daily and the Chinese Communist Party's financial support of the publication.
