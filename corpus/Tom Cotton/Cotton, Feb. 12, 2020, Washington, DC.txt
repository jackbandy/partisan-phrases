Cotton, Blackburn, Colleagues Introduce Bicameral Bill to Stop Greenlighting Driver Licenses for Illegal Immigrants


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today joined Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee) in introducing legislation that delivers tough financial consequences to states that flout federal immigration enforcement and harm public safety and national security. Senators Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), Shelley Moore Capito (R-West Virginia), Kelly Loeffler (R-Georgia), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), and Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota) are cosponsoring the legislation, and Congressman Ken Buck (Colorado-04) is leading twenty-one House members in introducing companion legislation.

The Stop Greenlighting Driver Licenses for Illegal Immigrants Act blocks certain federal funds to sanctuary states, including states that defy federal immigration enforcement or that allow illegal aliens to get driver licenses without proof of lawful presence.

"We shouldn't legitimize those who break our immigration laws by giving them driver licenses. Unfortunately, states like California give illegal immigrants driver licenses and help them hide from federal law," said Senator Cotton. "Our bill will make sure that federal grants will only go to states who uphold our rule of law."

"Tennesseans know all too well what can happen when illegal immigrants are granted driver licenses," said Senator Blackburn. "While Tennessee and many other states prohibit driver licenses for illegal aliens, a growing number of states are moving in the opposite direction and unleashing dangerous open borders policies. Immigrants must follow the proper federal process and obtain citizenship or lawful status before obtaining a state driver license. In America, no one is above the law."
