Cotton FORCE Act Surges $43 Billion to Thwart Chinese Military Aspirations in Indo-Pacific


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) has introduced a bill that would dramatically increase investment--$43 billion in total--for military infrastructure, weapons, and other assets in the Indo-Pacific region.

The Forging Operational Resistance to Chinese Expansion (FORCE) Act is a critical investment in the United States' ability to compete with China. The bill will help thwart the Chinese Communist Party's main geopolitical aim in the wake of the China virus: pushing the United States out of the Western Pacific, intimidating its neighbors, and achieving cross-strait unification with Taiwan via military force.

 

The bill also shields the U.S. defense-industrial base--especially small suppliers and manufacturers--from the China virus's economic fallout.
