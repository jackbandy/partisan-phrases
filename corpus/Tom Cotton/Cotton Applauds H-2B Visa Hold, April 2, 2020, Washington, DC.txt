Cotton Applauds H-2B Visa Hold


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the following statement after the Department of Homeland Security announced that no additional H-2B visas will be released until further notice.

 

"With record numbers of Americans filing for unemployment, our focus should be getting Americans back to work, not bringing in additional foreign labor. The Department of Homeland Security should continue the hold on additional H-2B visas until we know that Americans have the jobs they need."
