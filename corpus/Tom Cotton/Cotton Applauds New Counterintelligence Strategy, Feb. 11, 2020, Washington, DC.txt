Cotton Applauds New Counterintelligence Strategy


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the following statement on the Trump administration's new counterintelligence strategy:

 

"The updated counterintelligence strategy rightly broadens its focus to the pervasive economic threats we face. Our adversaries don't differentiate between government and commercial targets, and we shouldn't either. Those who steal intellectual property shouldn't be allowed access to any free market."
