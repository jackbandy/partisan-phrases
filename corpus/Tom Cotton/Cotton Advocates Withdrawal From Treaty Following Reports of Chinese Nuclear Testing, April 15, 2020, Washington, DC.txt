Cotton Advocates Withdrawal From Treaty Following Reports of Chinese Nuclear Testing


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the statement below following reports that China has recently conducted yield-producing nuclear tests:

 

"It's foolish to trust anything the Chinese Communist Party says, especially when it comes to grave matters like nuclear testing. Beijing is modernizing its nuclear arsenal while the United States handcuffs itself with one-sided arms-control restrictions. China has proven it can't work with us honestly and transparently. We ought to unsign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty," said Cotton.
