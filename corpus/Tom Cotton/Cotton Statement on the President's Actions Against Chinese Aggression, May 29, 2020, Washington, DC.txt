Cotton Statement on the President's Actions Against Chinese Aggression


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the statement below after the president's announcement of several actions against Chinese Communist aggression, including denying visas to Chinese students affiliated with the People's Liberation Army, withdrawing from the World Health Organization, removing special privileges afforded to Hong Kong that had enriched the Chinese Communist Party, and protecting American investors from lawless Chinese companies. Senator Cotton has long advocated for visa restrictions, withdrawing from the WHO, and protecting American investors from rule-breaking Chinese firms.    "I applaud the administration for its vigilance against the Chinese Communist threat. In particular, I'm pleased the administration will be adopting policies similar to my PLA Visa Security Act. America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines shouldn't have to face Chinese weapons systems designed by individuals trained in the United States, incorporating technology stolen from the U.S. military. I look forward to working with the administration to implement further measures to combat the Chinese Communist Party's aggression."
