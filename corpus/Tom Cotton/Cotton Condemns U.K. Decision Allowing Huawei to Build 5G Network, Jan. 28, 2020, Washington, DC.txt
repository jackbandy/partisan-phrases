Cotton Condemns U.K. Decision Allowing Huawei to Build 5G Network


Following the United Kingdom's announcement that it will allow Chinese-owned Huawei to build parts of its 5G internet network, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the following statement:

 

"This decision is deeply disappointing for American supporters of the Special Relationship. I fear London has freed itself from Brussels only to cede sovereignty to Beijing. Allowing Huawei to build the U.K.'s 5G networks today is like allowing the KGB to build its telephone network during the Cold War. The Chinese Communist Party will now have a foothold to conduct pervasive espionage on British society and has increased economic and political leverage over the United Kingdom. The short-term savings aren't worth the long-term costs. In light of this decision, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence should conduct a thorough review of U.S.-U.K. intelligence-sharing."
