Cotton Statement on State of the Union


Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) released the following statement after President Trump's third State of the Union address:

 

"Tonight, the president outlined an agenda that will continue to build on the achievements of the last three years. I share his commitment to building a strong economy that helps American workers and a strong military that keeps us safe from threats like China and Iran. Our efforts implementing this ambitious agenda must begin now, especially protecting Americans from the Wuhan coronavirus and dangerous sanctuary city policies."
