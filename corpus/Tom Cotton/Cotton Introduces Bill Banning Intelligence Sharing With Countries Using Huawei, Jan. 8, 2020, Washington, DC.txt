Cotton Introduces Bill Banning Intelligence Sharing With Countries Using Huawei


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today introduced a bill that would prohibit the United States from sharing intelligence with countries that allow Huawei to operate their 5G networks:

"The United States shouldn't be sharing valuable intelligence information with countries that allow an intelligence-gathering arm of the Chinese Communist Party to operate freely within their borders. I urge our allies around the world to carefully consider the consequences of dealing with Huawei to their national interests."
