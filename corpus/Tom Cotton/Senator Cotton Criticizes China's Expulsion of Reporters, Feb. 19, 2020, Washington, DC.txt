Senator Cotton Criticizes China's Expulsion of Reporters


Senator Cotton released the following statement after reports that China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters in reaction to the paper's publication of a column by Walter Russell Mead.

 

"The Chinese Communist Party is complaining about newspaper headlines while the Chinese people suffer and die from coronavirus. Walter Russell Mead speaks more truth in one column than the CCP does in a year. Its dishonesty caused this outbreak to spiral out of control. Now the Party has chosen dishonesty yet again by kicking out foreign journalists over a fake provocation."
