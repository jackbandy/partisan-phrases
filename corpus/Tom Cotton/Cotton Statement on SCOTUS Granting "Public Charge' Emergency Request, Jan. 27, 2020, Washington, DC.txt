Cotton Statement on SCOTUS Granting "Public Charge' Emergency Request


Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) today released the following statement after the Supreme Court granted an emergency request to allow the Trump administration to begin enforcing its new "public charge' rule:

"The "public charge' rule is based on the commonsense principle that immigration ought to benefit, not burden, the United States. Allowing this reform to move forward is important for fixing our immigration system and showing activist judges that politically-motivated injunctions won't be tolerated."
