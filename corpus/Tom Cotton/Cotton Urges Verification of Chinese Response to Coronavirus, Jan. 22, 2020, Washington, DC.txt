Cotton Urges Verification of Chinese Response to Coronavirus


Earlier today, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar noting that efforts to protect the American people from the coronavirus may include restrictions on travel from China to the United States. His letter also urged careful verification of any information from the Chinese government about the spread of the coronavirus.

 

Given the Chinese Communist Party's history of lying and suppressing information about diseases, Cotton requested that HHS notify Congress if it believes any  Chinese government information about the virus is false or misleading.
