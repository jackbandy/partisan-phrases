Cotton Applauds U.K.'s Hong Kong Announcement


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) tonight released the following statement after the United Kingdom announced it would allow three million people from Hong Kong to live and work in Britain in response to China's National Security law:

"I applaud the U.K.'s decision to open its arms to Hong Kongers fleeing the tyrannical regime in Beijing. Hong Kongers shouldn't be left to fend for themselves as the Communist Party destroys the city's freedoms."
