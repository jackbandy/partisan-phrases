Cotton Introduces the No Bailouts for Illegal Aliens Act


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) will today introduce the No Bailouts for Illegal Aliens Act, which amends the CARES Act to prohibit sending future funds to states or municipalities until they certify they aren't issuing stimulus checks or other payments to those in the United States illegally.

"Congress passed the CARES Act to help workers impacted by the China virus pandemic, not to give a handout to those who broke our immigration laws. The federal government shouldn't be subsidizing states' efforts to send cash to illegal aliens," said Cotton.
