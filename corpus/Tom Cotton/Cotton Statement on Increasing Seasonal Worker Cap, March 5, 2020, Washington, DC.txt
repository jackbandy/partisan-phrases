Cotton Statement on Increasing Seasonal Worker Cap


U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the following statement on the Department of Homeland Security's decision to allow 35,000 additional seasonal workers into the United States through the H-2B visa program:

 

"Raising the limit of H-2B visas means prioritizing cheap foreign labor over paying better wages for American workers to do the same jobs. Congress needs to seriously reform the H-2B visa program so it supports wage growth and employment for Americans instead of encouraging a race to the bottom by importing too much low-cost labor."

 

Background:

 

Earlier this year, Senator Cotton sent a letter asking DHS not to increase the H-2B visa cap without first reforming the program to cut down on waste, fraud, abuse, and human trafficking.
