Cotton Statement on DOJ Sanctuary Cities Lawsuits


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) tonight released the following statement after the Department of Justice filed lawsuits against California, New Jersey, and King County, Washington for their sanctuary cities policies:

"American cities should be sanctuaries for U.S. citizens, not criminal aliens. I applaud the Justice Department for taking steps to enforce our immigration laws, despite resistance from local officials who value liberal immigration practices over the safety of their own citizens."
