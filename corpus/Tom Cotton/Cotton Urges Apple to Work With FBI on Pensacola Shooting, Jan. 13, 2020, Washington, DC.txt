Cotton Urges Apple to Work With FBI on Pensacola Shooting


U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) released the following statement after Attorney General William Barr requested that Apple open encrypted iPhones belonging to the gunman who opened fire last month at the Pensacola Naval Air Station:

"Companies shouldn't be allowed to shield criminals and terrorists from lawful efforts to solve crimes and protect our citizens. Apple has a notorious history of siding with terrorists over law enforcement. I hope in this case they'll change course and actually work with the FBI to seek justice for the victims of the terrorist attack on the Pensacola Naval Air Station."
