Cotton Statement on FCC Challenge to Chinese Telecoms


Earlier today, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issed directives against four Chinese telecommunications companies. The directives asked the companies to explain why the FCC should not revoke their authorizations to operate in the United States considering that they're owned and ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.

 

After the announcement, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the following statement:

 

"No matter their cries to the contrary, these firms are beholden to the Chinese Communist Party, and their operation in the United States will continue to pose a threat to our critical networks as long as it continues. Chairman Pai has rightly identified the magnitude of the Chinese telecom contamination, and the FCC is taking strong steps towards eliminating it," said Cotton.

Background:

 

Earlier this month, Senator Cotton asked the FCC to revoke and terminate China Telecom (Americas) Corp.'s authority to provide telecommunications services to and from the United States.
