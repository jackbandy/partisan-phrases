Cotton Condemns DoD Decision Allowing Sales to Huawei


Following reports that the Department of Defense has blocked proposed regulations from the Department of Commerce that would largely prevent U.S. companies from selling to Chinese-owned Huawei Technologies, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the following statement:

"I'm deeply troubled by reports that the Department of Defense blocked regulations to blacklist Huawei, an intelligence-gathering arm of the Chinese Communist Party. It's bad enough when capitalists are willing to sell the rope that will be used to hang us, but worse still when our military acts as their lobbyist. I intend to get to the bottom of this ill-considered decision."
