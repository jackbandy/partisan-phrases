Cotton Statement on Increased Violence Against Police


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the following statement after reports of violence increased in American cities overnight, especially attacks on police officers:

"Violent anarchists and insurrectionists were once again allowed to rule the streets last night in too many cities. In places like St. Louis, they responded by shooting, beating, and running over police officers who weren't given the support they deserve to restore order. In Las Vegas, an officer was shot in the head. The only way to end this insurrection is the overwhelming display of force."
