Cotton Statement on Senate Passage of USMCA


Following a Senate vote earlier today to approve the United States--Mexico--Canada Agreement (USMCA), Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) released the statement below. An Arkansas fact sheet for the USMCA from the Office of the United States Trade Representative may be found here.

 

"The USMCA doesn't just improve market access for our state's agricultural producers and small businesses--it also makes Arkansas workers more competitive with their Canadian and Mexican counterparts. Once Canada signs the agreement, the president's efforts to replace the outdated NAFTA will be complete."
