Cotton Supports Emergency Funding to Combat Coronavirus


Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today released the following statement after the Senate passed emergency funding to help combat the coronavirus:

"Today the Senate voted to provide additional support to federal, state, and local governments in their fight against the coronavirus. This bill contains funding to expand testing across the country, develop therapeutic drugs, and speed development of a vaccine. This emergency funding-combined with the January travel restrictions for which I advocated-should give the administration the initial tools they need to protect Arkansans and our nation from this virus."
