Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 67 lives that we lost on  January 29, 2025. After months of investigative work, the NTSB  uncovered systemic failures that culminated in the fateful midair  collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger  aircraft.

The flight originated from my hometown of Wichita, Kansas. Our  community was shocked by the tragedy, and I am heartbroken that several  Kansans were among the victims. No family should ever have to endure  that heartbreak.

It is imperative that we work in Congress to ensure tragedies like  this never happen again and that our skies are the safest in the world.  We must build back the layers of safety that failed that night.

I am grateful for the work of the NTSB and the Senate, and I realize  there is always more that can and should be done to enhance aviation  safety. I look forward to continuing this important work that honors  their lives and makes our skies safer. Flying in the United States is  the safest of anywhere in the world, but we must continue to identify  and implement ways to make it safer.
