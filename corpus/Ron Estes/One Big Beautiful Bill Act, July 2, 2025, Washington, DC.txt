One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the Kansas  families, workers, and small businesses who will benefit from the One  Big Beautiful Bill Act.

By extending and improving the TCJA, working-class families in my  district will pay $10,900 less in taxes and see increased wages of  $7,200 on average. It contains my bipartisan legislation to make  research and development expensing permanent, a jobs provision ensuring  America continues to lead the world entirely on innovation. It  eliminates fraud and waste in ObamaCare, and it builds on President  Trump's successes at securing the border.

Despite the misleading spin from my colleagues on the left, this bill  delivers on what Americans voted for in November. It is time to pass  the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
