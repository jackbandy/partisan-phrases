Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the exceptional  service of Kansan Carl Harris, the 2024 chairman of the National  Association of Home Builders.

For more than four decades, Carl has made an outsized impact on the  residential construction industry and communities across Kansas through  his work as cofounder and president of the Carl Harris Company and  managing partner of Harris Homes.

Most recently, he completed his term as the 2024 chairman of the  National Association of Home Builders, where he has been relentless in  advocating for policies that strengthen the construction workforce and  help make homeownership, a key tenet of the American Dream, possible.

Generous in sharing his time and talent, Carl served as president of  the Wichita Area Builders Association and the Kansas Building Industry  Association and in numerous roles in local governments in Newton. In  addition, he has promoted workforce development initiatives and  outreach to high schoolers to introduce them to opportunities in the  construction trades.

It is my honor to thank Carl for his dedicated career and wish him  all the best with his next step.
