Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of advancing  President Trump's America First agenda.

It was less than 2 months ago that I stood on this House floor as  Republicans passed our budget resolution, putting a marker in the  ground to restore and secure our country both physically and  financially.

While I don't think this resolution goes far enough, the resolution  that we are about to pass today is a positive step forward, and it is  what Americans demanded 5 months ago.

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to talk directly with President  Trump in the West Wing. He is asking Republicans to support this budget  resolution to move the process forward. This resolution is only one  more step in the process to obtain these positive results.

Voting ``yes'' means voting for a secure border and economic growth.  By voting ``yes,'' we are voting for a path to make the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act permanent. It means making economic growth provisions like  research and development, the small business passthrough, interest  deductibility, and immediate expensing permanent parts of our tax code.  A ``yes'' vote prevents the largest tax increase for Americans in  history.

As a fiscal hawk who will continue to work with the administration to  rein in reckless spending, I am voting ``yes'' for the American people.
