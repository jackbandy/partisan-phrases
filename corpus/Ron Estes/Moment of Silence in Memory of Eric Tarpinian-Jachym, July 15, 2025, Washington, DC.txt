Moment of Silence in Memory of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym


Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and celebrate the life of  Eric Tarpinian-Jachym of Granby, Massachusetts, who was an intern in my  office.

Eric's life was tragically cut short by a senseless act of violence  in our Nation's Capital. Eric was an innocent bystander who was gunned  down as he walked down the street less than one mile from the White  House.

I offer my prayers and condolences to Eric's family, friends, and  loved ones.

Eric was a rising senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  who came to Washington to participate in our government. He was a kind  and friendly presence in my office, greeting everyone who came through  the door with a smile.

The loss of Eric will be felt for a long time. We will never forget  his presence and kindness in my office. Those he met in his short time  in my office will not forget him either.

Eric Tarpinian-Jachym was a dedicated, thoughtful, and kind person  who loved our country, and he gave his life in service to others. I  thank him for his service and for the impact he made on our lives. May  he rest in peace.

Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House observe a moment of  silence to remember Eric Jachym.
