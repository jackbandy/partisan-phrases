Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for yielding time to  me on this important topic.

It is important to be here today to express my support for S. 269,  the Ending Improper Payments to Deceased People Act. It is commonsense  legislation that taxpayers should not be footing the bill for people  who are deceased.

The purpose of this legislation is to permanently authorize the  Social Security Administration to share its full Death Master File with  the Treasury's Do Not Pay service. The Death Master File that is  generated by Social Security is the best, if not the only national file  that identifies the death of individuals throughout the country. This  access will allow Federal agencies to have the updated, complete death  data necessary to verify benefit eligibility and prevent erroneous  overpayments.

We are well aware that the Federal Government has a major spending  problem, and we face a massive problem continuing to pay people for all  sorts of Federal programs, including Social Security, who have passed  away. In FY 2024 alone, Federal agencies reported over $162 billion in  improper payments. By making this data exchange permanent, the Bureau  of Fiscal Service projects that we will save $330 million across the  Federal Government by December of 2026.

As the chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee, I am committed  to enforcing this legislation and protecting the integrity of our  programs for the American taxpayer.
