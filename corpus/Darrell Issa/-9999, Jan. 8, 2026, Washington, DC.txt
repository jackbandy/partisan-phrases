Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, a lot can be said about my friend and  colleague, my Western Caucus chair, but today was a special day for us.  We had lunch today as California members, and Doug paid for it because  every week somebody sponsors it. His death was so sudden that it  literally had been prepaid. It arrived, and we sat there thinking of  the person who had the best joke every week, who had a constant,  positive sense of humor, even about dire times.

We talked not long ago about how much he got done during the shutdown  and what it was like to actually meet with his constituents multiple  days in a row, day after day. That was Doug LaMalfa--a farmer, a family  man, but most importantly, somebody that could always find the positive  and the funny about whatever we were doing.

We are a body of 431 right now. At our best, we are a body of 435. It  is the one that we are missing that can make a difference, and that was  Doug. He will be missed for a very long time by all of us.
