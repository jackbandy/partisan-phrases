Welcoming Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, His All-Holiness Bartholomew's 2025 Visit to the United States


Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend a warm welcome to the  Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, His All-Holiness Bartholomew,  the spiritual leader and ``First Among Equals'' of more than 300  million Orthodox Christians worldwide. During this historic visit to  the United States, His All-Holiness will receive the Templeton Prize-- the world's most prestigious award in Religion and Science.

Patriarch Bartholomew's efforts to promote religious freedom and  human rights and his initiatives to advance religious tolerance among  the world's religions, together with his work toward international  peace and environmental protection, have justly placed him at the  forefront of global visionaries as an apostle of love, peace, and  reconciliation.

We are privileged to host the longest-serving Archbishop of  Constantinople in history here in our Nation's Capital, as he meets  with the President, Secretary of State, and Congress. His visit to the  United States serves as a testament to his unwavering commitment to  fostering mutual respect and religious tolerance on a global level.

I look forward to the opportunity to welcome His All-Holiness and  express our collective gratitude for his continued leadership and  dedication to the cause of peace and religious liberty. In the words of  His All-Holiness: ``If our age will be remembered, it may be for those  who dedicated themselves to the cause of peace.''
