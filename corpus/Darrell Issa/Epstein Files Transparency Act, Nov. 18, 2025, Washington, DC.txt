Epstein Files Transparency Act

Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, a minute and a half or an hour, the words  would still have to be the same. We have all said that this will pass  the House, perhaps unanimously, today.

I think all of us who have looked at the details of this particular  bill know that it is flawed and that before it goes to the President's  desk it has to be amended, as it can be amended in the Senate. We call  on the Senate to amend it so that we protect the innocent, so that we  have the provisions that were intended, perhaps, to be in this bill but  are not properly written.

With that, President Trump has said get it to his desk, and he will  sign it. President Trump has said he will do it. However, I am going to  say to all of us: It is also important that we remember that Epstein is  dead, but people live on, people who were innocent, people who, in  fact, should not be named.

We are not talking about the rich and the powerful. We are talking  about the very victims. That is what we need to make sure is amended  before it goes to the President's desk.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his time. I think no more needs  to be said. This body will vote for it all. But let's not kid  ourselves, it has to be changed so that it properly protects both the  tradition of the grand jury and, clearly, those innocent people that  would otherwise be swept up.
