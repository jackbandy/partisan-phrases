Recognizing Lieutenant Kurt Delong


Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant Kurt  Delong of Westfield, Indiana who for his 25 years of service as a  reserve officer to the Hamilton County Indiana Sheriff's Department,  where he has served with distinction. Lieutenant Delong had a very  strong religious upbringing, while stating numerous times to his  colleagues that he is a ``Missionary disguised as a police officer.''

During his time with the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office, Lieutenant  Delong has obtained numerous awards, including being named ``Reserve  Deputy of the Year,'' ``Sergeant of the Year,'' and ``Lieutenant of the  Year.'' Additionally, he was named a Pistol Expert, and ``Life Saving  Award'' recipient.

Lieutenant Delong also served as a trainer for Hamilton County  Sheriff's Office new Reserve Deputies, and he was a Board Member for  the Community Foundation's ``Christmas Express Volunteer and Shop for  Kids'' drive. Lieutenant Delong, in his 25 years of service, provided a  strong foundation for safety, training, and growth for the citizens of  Hamilton County.

Outside of his law enforcement duties, Lieutenant Delong operates a  small landscaping business. Lieutenant Delong is an avid fan of both  high school and college wrestling, and he loves boating and travelling.

While Lieutenant Delong will be retiring as a reserve officer on  March 28, 2025, he will continue to serve the Hamilton County Sheriff's  Office in a civilian capacity. My fellow Hoosiers and I appreciate  Kurt's dedication and contribution to our community.
