Congratulating Mr. Bronice Odell Bradley


Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Bronice Odell  Bradley of Carmel, Indiana who will turn 100 years old on April 9,  2025.

At 18 years old, Mr. Bradley enlisted in the U.S. Army and was  assigned to Company A 394th Infantry, which was a tank division under  General George Patton. He endured subzero weather at the Battle of the  Bulge. While operating a machine gun on his tank, he was struck by  shrapnel and later hospitalized for 13 months. Private First Class  Bradley was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army on December 7,  1945.

After retiring from the military, Mr. Bradley and his wife bought a  small distribution business, which they operated for 44 years.

My fellow Hoosiers and I wish Mr. Bradley a happy birthday and send  him our deepest appreciation for his service to our country during his  long and productive life.
