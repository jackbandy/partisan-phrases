Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of my  friend Doug LaMalfa, whom I would refer to as the gentle giant.

Doug was known by all for his love of agriculture and the great  outdoors. As chairman of the Western Caucus and as a California  Republican, he was a rare breed on Capitol Hill. His time will always  be remembered for his love of this great Republic, a government that he  believed in, the Founding Fathers, and the principles of government of  the  people, by the people, and for the people.

Mr. Speaker, I believe that there is a Scripture in the Old Testament  that captures the impact that Doug had on the lives of his friends and  colleagues. It is Proverbs 27:17. It says: ``As iron sharpens iron, so  one man sharpens another.''

Doug made all those who knew him better people, and his impact will  live on long after his passing. I know he will be missed by all, and my  prayers are with his family and friends.
