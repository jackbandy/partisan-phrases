Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the importance of  small-town business owners and the impact they have on local  communities and to honor the Bailey family and their locally-run  Telephone business.

In 1945, newlyweds William D. ``Bill'' Bailey and Louise Robinson  Bailey returned to Bill's hometown of Decatur and purchased the Decatur  Telephone Company. For eighty years Decatur Telephone Company has  served the East Mississippi community with connectivity. They have gone  from the original 7 individual phones in 1945 to laying fiber-optic  cable today for a fully digitalized system privately owned in rural  Mississippi. The Baileys have made a massive impact on their local  community through their active participation in local groups, their  church, and their support for their employees, Mr. Bailey passed away  in 2015, and Mrs. Bailey continued in daily assistance of the operation  of the company until her passing in 2018.

Today, their daughter Dr. Esther Bailey Smith keeps the Decatur  Telephone Company  tradition of service alive. Her dedication to the family legacy ensures  continued service for many years to come. I am proud to represent  Decatur Telephone Company in my Congressional District.
