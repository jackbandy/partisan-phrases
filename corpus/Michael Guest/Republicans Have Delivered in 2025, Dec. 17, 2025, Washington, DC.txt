Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, the Christmas story as recorded in Luke  Chapter 2.

``And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree  from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.''

``And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. And Joseph  also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea,  unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of  the house and lineage of David:) to be taxed with Mary his espoused  wife, being great with child. And so it was, that, while they were  there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she  brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes,  and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the  inn.

``And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,  keeping watch over their flock by night.''

``And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the  Lord shone round about them: and they were so afraid. And the angel  said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of  great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day  in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the King. And this shall  be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling  clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a  multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God  in the highest, and on Earth peace, good will toward men.''
