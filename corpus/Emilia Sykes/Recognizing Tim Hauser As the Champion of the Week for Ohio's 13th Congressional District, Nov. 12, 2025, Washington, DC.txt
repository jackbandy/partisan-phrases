Recognizing Tim Hauser As the Champion of the Week for Ohio's 13th Congressional District


Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tim Hauser as the  Champion of the Week for Ohio's 13th Congressional District.

Tim was recently named the Veteran of the Year by the Veterans  Service Commission of Summit County. He is a Gulf War veteran and  founder of the Veterans Assurance Network, which provides advocacy,  support, education, services, and resources to veterans and their  families.

In 1982, Tim joined the U.S. Air Force, where he was deployed to  Saudi Arabia during Desert Storm. There, he was exposed to toxic burn  pits and oil well fires purposely set by Iraqi forces.

The Department of Defense estimates 3.5 million service members were  exposed to toxic burn pits during their time serving abroad. Exposure  to burn pits and other toxic airborne substances has been linked to  serious health effects, including certain cancers.

Tim worked closely with federal lawmakers to help get the PACT Act  signed into law. This landmark law expands VA health care and benefits  for veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic  substances.

Tim is also passionate about veteran suicide prevention, and even  helped advocate for September 22 to be recognized as Veteran Suicide  Awareness and Prevention Day in Ohio.

With this award, and all the hard work that came before it, Tim is a  shining example of why Ohio's 13th Congressional District is known as  the ``Birthplace of Champions.'' He has certainly made our community  proud.
