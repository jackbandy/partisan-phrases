Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Mr. Paul Tazewell  as Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champion of the Week for winning  an Academy Award for his costume design work in the movie ``Wicked.''

Paul's first Academy Award will join a crowded trophy case that  contains an American Cinematheque Award and a British Academy Film  Award, both for his costume design in ``Wicked.'' He also won Critics  Choice and Costume Designers Guild Awards for his work on the film.

While this is Paul's first win at the Oscars, he was also nominated  for costume design in the 2022 film adaptation of the ``West Side  Story.''

Paul, a 1982 Buchtel High School graduate, proudly acknowledged  during his acceptance speech that he is the first Black man to win an  Oscar for costume design, to a resounding crowd and a standing ovation.  I don't know if he could hear us while he was up on stage, but our  entire community in Akron was standing up and cheering him on when we  heard his name called.

He later shared, ``I have evolved into that inspiring figure that I  had been longing to emulate as a developing designer. I receive this  beautiful recognition with immense pride and I dedicate it to everyone  who has the dream to fly.''

Mr. Speaker, I, again, congratulate Paul Tazewell on this amazing  accomplishment. He has certainly made our community proud, and he is a  shining example of why Ohio's 13th Congressional District is the  birthplace of champions.
