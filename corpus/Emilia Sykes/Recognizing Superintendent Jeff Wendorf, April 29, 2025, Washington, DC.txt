Recognizing Superintendent Jeff Wendorf


Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate and announce as  our champion of the week North Canton City Schools Superintendent Jeff  Wendorf on his retirement after a 40-year career serving the students  of North Canton as a teacher, coach, and administrator.

Since he began serving as the superintendent in 2016, North Canton  has consistently been ranked as one of the top school districts not  just in Stark County but throughout the State of Ohio.

Just last year, the district received a 5-star rating, the highest,  on its school report card from the Ohio Department of Education for the  2023-2024 school year.

Throughout his career, Superintendent Wendorf has led by example,  demonstrating perseverance, compassion, and dedication for his  community, all while supporting strong public schools.

For his outstanding devotion, he earned the respect and esteem of  many students and educators alike. While his character and decisive  leadership will be sorely missed, I am confident that his numerous  contributions will serve as an inspiration for everyone in the wake of  his departure.

Congratulations again to Superintendent Jeff Wendorf on his well- deserved retirement. He is a shining example of why this community is  known as the ``Birthplace of Champions,'' and I wish him many more  years of happiness and prosperity.
