Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Daniela Scheffler  for winning the 3,200 meter race at the Ohio Division I Track and Field  Championships, earning her first State title, and recognizing her as  Ohio's 13th Congressional District's Champion of the Week.

As a senior at Lake High School in Uniontown, Ohio, Daniela ended an  exceptional high school track career, setting records and winning  several awards along the way. On the road to her first State title last  month, Daniela set the record for the 1,600 and 3,200 meters at the  Federal League Track and Field Championships, the State qualifier meet.

As a testament to her hard work and dedication on the track, Daniela  signed an offer with North Carolina State University, where she will be  continuing her track and field career.

We are proud of Daniela. Even though she will be far away from home  at college, we will be cheering her on as she finishes her career.

Again, I congratulate Daniela Scheffler for an accomplished high  school track career and on being named this week's Ohio-13 Champion of  the Week.
