Rising Healthcare Costs

Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today I rise because families in Ohio's 13th  Congressional District and across the country are already paying the  price for Republicans' inaction on healthcare. The enhanced ACA premium  tax credits expired December 31, 2025, and now health coverage is more  expensive and families are already feeling the impact.

In my district, 90 percent of the 32,000 people who get ACA coverage  rely on those subsidies. Four out of five were previously able to find  plans for $10 or less per month. That safety net is now gone. Families  are seeing premiums jump by hundreds of dollars a month or thousands of  dollars a year. Across the country, more than 4 million Americans have  already lost or are at risk of losing their healthcare coverage  entirely.

This isn't a theory. It is happening right now. In Canton, AultCare,  a regional insurer tied to Aultman Hospital, stopped offering some  individual family and small business ACA plans before December 31. That  affects 6,000 people in my district. These are working families and  small business employees losing coverage because Republicans refuse to  act.

I have fought to protect these credits by cosponsoring legislation to  extend them and by signing on to Leader Jeffries' discharge petition to  bring the issue to a vote on the House floor. Instead of acting,  Speaker Johnson and House Republicans chose to delay, and that action  is simply unacceptable.

Don't just take my word for it. Just a few weeks ago, Congressman  Mike Lawler called Speaker Johnson's refusal to allow a vote idiotic  and political malpractice, and I agree. What happened? Speaker Johnson  sent us home for the holidays while American families paid the price.

Republicans also pushed a partisan healthcare bill that would make  things much worse by increasing the number of uninsured people,  shifting costs onto working families, and weakening the protections  that so many Americans rely upon.

I offered an amendment to protect working families from losing health  coverage and to protect access to reproductive healthcare. But guess  what. Republicans blocked it. Once again, they chose politics over  people.

We cannot forget the real people caught in the middle of this. These  are families deciding between healthcare and groceries and between  medicine and rent. Access to healthcare should be a right, not a  gamble. At a time when we are talking about the horrors and tragic  costs of the drug trade and the impact it has on American people, let  us not forget how people get drug treatment. It is from the Medicaid  program that has already been cut by a trillion dollars and the ACA  marketplace health plans.

The Republicans' failure to act is literally going to kill people  across this country. They let deadlines pass, premiums rise, and  coverage disappear. That is not leadership. That is failure.

Mr. Speaker, the choice is clear. Congress can either act to restore  affordable healthcare or we can continue to let premiums sore, coverage  vanish, and families face financial ruin.

I know one thing is for certain, Mr. Speaker. I was brought to  Congress to work on behalf of the people of Ohio's 13th Congressional  District to lower costs, to keep them safe, and to make sure that they  had affordable, accessible healthcare coverage.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage every single Member of this Chamber to do  those things, not only for the people in my district but for the people  all across America who are asking and needing Congress to act.
