Champion of the Week: Reese Gallagher


Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Reese Gallagher  as the champion of the week for Ohio's 13th Congressional District.

Reese is a senior at Archbishop Hoban High School, and she was named  the Girls' Division III Player of the Year by the Ohio Scholastic  Soccer Coaches Association.

Reese has been described as an aggressive and ferocious player and is  heralded as the most prolific goal scorer in the Akron area.

This season, Reese scored an impressive 44 goals and 15 assists,  leading the Hoban Knights to the State semifinals.

This is Reese's fourth year on the varsity team, and over her  impressive soccer career, she has been recognized as a Division II all- Ohioan and an all-American. Not only is she a first-class athlete, she  is also a stellar and star student, carrying a 4.1 GPA.

Next year, she will represent us proudly on the women's soccer team  at the University of Dayton.

Go Flyers.

Mr. Speaker, Reese is a shining example of why Ohio's 13th  Congressional District is known as the birthplace of champions. I look  forward to seeing all that Reese accomplishes in her future.
