Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Addelynn Ferguson  as  Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champion of the Week.

Addelynn is a junior from Portage Lakes Career Center in Uniontown,  Ohio, and out of nearly 50 participants, she took home the first-place  prize for this year's Congressional Art Competition in Ohio's 13th  Congressional District.

I had the opportunity to see Addelynn's winning piece, as shown here,  and present her with the first-place prize at a community art show in  Akron last week. I can truly say that her piece titled ``Lollipop'' is  a captivating and creative portrait of Addelynn's beloved grandmother,  Annette.

I had the pleasure of meeting Addelynn and Annette. As you can see,  Mr. Speaker, she uses bright, exciting colors that showcase her  grandmother's beauty and bright smile.

As the winner of our district's Congressional Art Competition,  Addelynn's artwork will be proudly displayed on the walls of the  Capitol where visitors from across the United States and the world can  see our community's artistic and creative talent.

I personally can't wait to see Annette's smiling face each time I  walk to vote on the House floor.

In addition to recognizing her exceptional artistic talent, I also  thank Amy Eibel, Addelynn's art teacher at Portage Lakes Career Center.

Art teachers like Amy inspire and support young students like  Addelynn each and every day, and we are grateful for their dedication  and hard work in the classroom.

I congratulate, again, Addelynn on being the winner of Ohio's 13th  Congressional District Art Competition and this week's Champion of the  Week. I look forward to seeing what Addelynn and the other talented  students in our district create next.
