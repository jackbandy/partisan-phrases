Recognizing Vince Marchetta As the Champion of the Week for Ohio's 13th Congressional District


Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Vince Marchetta as  the Champion of the Week for Ohio's 13th Congressional District.

Vince recently earned the State Lead Ambassador of the Year Award  from the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. This award  recognizes his efforts to help make cancer a national priority.

After losing his wife, Betsy, to metastatic cervical cancer, Vince  became dedicated to supporting families affected by cancer and fighting  for a cure. As an American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network  volunteer for the past six years, Vince has worked tirelessly alongside  some of the most dedicated and passionate advocates to ensure everyone  has a fair and just opportunity to prevent, detect, treat, and survive  cancer.

Specifically, he has worked to advocate for better screening to  prevent late-stage diagnosis, improving access to health care and  treatment, clinical trials, and funding for research for those battling  cancer. He is passionate about ensuring all Americans have access to  the medical care that could save their lives.

With this award, and all the hard work that came before it, Vince is  a shining example of why Ohio's 13th Congressional District is known as  the ``Birthplace of Champions.'' He has certainly made our community  proud.
