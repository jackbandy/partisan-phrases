Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Mira Cahalane,  who recently won best actress at the 10th annual Dazzle Awards, as this  week's Champion of the Week for Ohio's 13th Congressional District.

The Dazzle Awards honors high school musical theater students and  departments in Northeast Ohio for their outstanding performances and  productions.

At the awards, Mira received the best actress award for her  phenomenal performance of Hermes in ``Hadestown: Teen Edition'' at  Hudson High School and was awarded a $2,000 scholarship.

As a result of her win, this June, Mira will be representing  Northeast Ohio in the National High School Musical Theater Awards, also  known as the Jimmy Awards, held in New York.

At the Jimmy Awards, Mira will join top high school musical theater  students across the country to compete and showcase her extraordinary  talent on a national stage.

Again, I want to congratulate Mira Cahalane for her exceptional win  and on being named this week's Champion of the Week. I wish her the  best of luck as she prepares to compete in the Jimmy Awards, and know  she will represent Northeast Ohio well.
