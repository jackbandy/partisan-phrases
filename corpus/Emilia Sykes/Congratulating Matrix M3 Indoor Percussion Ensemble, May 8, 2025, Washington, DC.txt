Congratulating Matrix M3 Indoor Percussion Ensemble


Mrs. SYKES. Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Matrix M3  indoor percussion ensemble as Ohio's 13th Congressional District  Champions of the Week.

Last month, the M3 percussion ensemble performed at the WGI World  Championships. After their preliminary performance left them just two  points in the lead, M3 gave it their all in the finals, securing the  first place prize. They are now world champions in the Scholastic  Independent division after earning a final and near-perfect score.

The WGI Championship was the final competition in the Matrix M3  percussion ensemble's busy season, after competing in seven different  contests across the Midwest. The group is a perfect example of why  Ohio's 13th Congressional District is known as the birthplace of  champions. I look forward to seeing all that they accomplish in the  future.

Once again, I congratulate the Matrix M3 indoor percussion ensemble  for bringing home this gold medal. Our community is so very proud of  their hard work and incredible talent.
