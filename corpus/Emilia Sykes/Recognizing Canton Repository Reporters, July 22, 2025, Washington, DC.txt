Recognizing Canton Repository Reporters


Mrs. SYKES. Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize five exceptional  journalists from the Canton Repository, one of Ohio's most important  publications, as this Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champion of  the Week.

Grace Springer received second place in the Best Government/Political  Reporting category.

Charita Goshay received second place in the Best Religion Reporting  category.

Nancy Molnar received first place in the Justice Reporting category.

Finally, for the Best of Show in Ohio category, Tim Botos received  second place, and Kelli Weir took home first in this category.

I congratulate these outstanding journalists and thank them. I thank  them for keeping readers across Canton Ohio's 13th Congressional  District in northeast Ohio region informed.

These five journalists earned top honors in the 2025 Ohio's Best  Journalism contest sponsored by the Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati  chapters of the Society of Professional Journalists.

Their work at the Canton Repository is truly exceptional, and I am  proud to represent a district that is kept informed by their  outstanding reporting.

I hope all my colleagues will join me in saying congratulations to  our fourth branch of government and these exceptional reporters as we  recognize them as Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champion of the  Week.
