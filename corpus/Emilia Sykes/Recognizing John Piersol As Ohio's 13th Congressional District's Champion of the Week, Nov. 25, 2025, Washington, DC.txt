Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the City of  Green's 2025 Volunteer of the Year, John Piersol as Ohio's 13th  Congressional District's Champion of the Week.

For the last 30 years, as president of the Green Soccer Association,  John helped create opportunities for more than 600 youth players. Here,  his inspiring dedication to his community shines through his heartfelt  service and purposeful leadership.

John also led the GOAL soccer program, creating inclusive athletic  opportunities for disabled individuals ages 6 to 21.

Youth athletics are an essential environment for developing future  leaders, building resilience, and instilling the values of teamwork and  community. I would like to express my gratitude to John for bringing  these valuable opportunities to children in his community.

Unseen hours of sacrifice and countless hours behind the scenes are  what distinguishes service from other kinds of work. John's story is a  shining example of everyday people rolling up their sleeves and  answering the quiet call of community service. I'm pleased today to  praise one of these unsung heroes.

Embodying the spirit of self-sacrifice and dedication, John continues  to enrich his community through the powerful forces of inclusion and  friendly competition. He is a shining example of why our community is  known as the ``Birthplace of Champions.''
