Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Akron Rites of  Passage as the Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champions of the  Week.

Led by 13 elders in the community, AROPI, as it is also known, is an  African-centered organization established for the purpose of educating,  training, and empowering its participants in African-centered rites of  passage, process, rituals, customs, and practices.

Its further purpose is to promote all aspects of healthy growth and  development of individuals, families, and the community of African  descent in Akron, Summit County, and surrounding areas.

Five years ago, the Akron Rites of Passage Institute introduced a  community initiative called the Legacy Building Project to support the  ongoing growth, development, and long-term sustainability of the  African American community.

Terrence Shelton, a co-chair of the project, also served as the  copresident of the Akron's Rites of Passage Institute. Earlier this  month he laid out plans for a new African-American cultural center and  museum complex on behalf of the program. The building will house a  museum, a business incubator, and center to teach people about trading  and investing as a means to building economic wealth in the community.  He envisions museum exhibits highlighting Akron sports legends,  scientists, and artists like LeBron James, Gus Johnson, Rita Dove, and  Woodrow Nash.

He said this project is not just a project for Black people. This is  a project for the city of Akron. It is everyday citizens doing  remarkable things like this who help make our community the birthplace  of champions. Community members from the Akron Rites of Passage  Institute are certainly champions in their own right and have made  Akron and Ohio's 13th Congressional District proud.
