Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Black Chamber  of Commerce of Summit County and cofounders Robert DeJournett and Misty  Beasley as Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champions of the Week.

One year ago I had the honor of attending its kick-off event in  Akron, and I was truly inspired to see so many people support this  catalyst for change.

After an economic study was commissioned, it was determined that  Akron's Black population, who represents nearly one-third of the  region--yet, the report highlighted through the Elevate Akron report  that there was purposeful, intentional, and systemic exclusion from  economic growth and job opportunities for Black people in the region.

Left unaddressed, this gap has threatened innovation and prosperity  not just for Black Akronites but for the entire region.

Mr. DeJournett and Ms. Beasley created the Black Chamber of Commerce  of Summit County to reverse that trend, enabling Black businessowners  to take their rightful place in the economic ecosystem with the right  support, connections, and capital to allow Black businesses to survive  and thrive.

In the first year, the chamber has counseled dozens of small  businesses on finances and website development, helped them compete for  natural resources, and connected local leaders to maximize growth.

Congratulations to Robert DeJournett, Misty Beasley, and the entire  membership of the Black Chamber of Commerce of Summit County on a  successful first year and being named the 13th Congressional District  champion of the week.
