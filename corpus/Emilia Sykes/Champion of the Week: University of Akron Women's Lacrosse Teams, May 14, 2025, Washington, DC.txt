Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the University of  Akron Zips Women's Lacrosse team and their coach, Elaine Jones, as  Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champions of the Week.

For the first time ever, this lacrosse team won the Mid-American  Conference Lacrosse Championship when they took down Robert Morris  University in an overtime thriller to secure their first ever  championship.

With just 14 seconds left during overtime, a golden goal from Jaelyn  Clinkscales propelled the Akron Zips Women's lacrosse team to victory.

The odds were stacked against this team as they were picked to finish  last this season in the MAC Preseason Coaches Poll, but they persevered  and beat the odds coming in as the champions.

This historic season was led by Coach Elaine Jones, who also won the  MAC Coach of the Year Award.

Congratulations again to the Akron Zips Women's lacrosse team for  this outstanding victory. This team is a shining example of why this  community is known as the birthplace of champions. I look forward to  cheering them on next season.

Go Zips.
