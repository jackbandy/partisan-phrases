Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this terrible bill  that is a bad deal for Ohio, the residents of Ohio's 13th Congressional  District, and the people of the United States of America.

When I was first elected, I told the people of Ohio's 13th  Congressional District that it may be my name on the ballot, but when I  win, we are all going to Washington together. I made that promise  because, as a Representative of my district, it is my responsibility to  make sure that my constituents' needs are being addressed here in  Washington.

The people in Ohio's 13th Congressional District need lower costs.  The people in Ohio's 13th Congressional District need access to care.  The people in Ohio's 13th District need opportunity, opportunity to  work, to buy a house, and to live their American Dream. Yet, this bill  does none of that.

Instead, it kicks 17 million people off their healthcare and makes  life more expensive. People don't have extra money to pay for  billionaires' yachts and monthslong vacations.

This bill takes money away from hardworking Americans and gives it to  the rich. It takes food away from children, making their bellies  hungry.

In my district, Mr. Speaker, 30,000 jobs are in jeopardy. I don't  want to hear another word from Republicans about people not wanting to  work when they are sending them to the unemployment line.

Mr. Speaker, this is a bad bill. Do not allow the people in my  district to be unemployed, hungry, and without the ability to live  their American Dream.
