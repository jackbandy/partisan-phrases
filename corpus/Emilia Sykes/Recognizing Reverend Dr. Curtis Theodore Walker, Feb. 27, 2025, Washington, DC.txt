Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Reverend Dr.  Curtis Theodore Walker, Sr. as Ohio's 13th Congressional District  Champion of the Week for his 50-year career in ministry.

Reverend Walker has served as a minister and pastor at multiple  African Methodist Episcopal Zion Churches in New York, Connecticut,  North Carolina, and Alabama. In 1992 he became the senior pastor at the  Wesley Temple Church in Akron, which is Akron's oldest Black  congregation.

Reverend Dr. Walker has been a faithful servant of God, the African  Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and the Beth-El AME Zion Church where  he currently serves as pastor.

Not only is he serving his ministry, he serves the countless  individuals and families he has pastored throughout his 50 years of  service.

The understanding and compassion that he demonstrates has served to  benefit not only his congregation but also society as a whole as his  congregation is made up of dedicated members of our community who work  to spread the Lord's message of good deeds.

Throughout his 50 years of Christian ministry, Reverend Dr. Walker  has displayed a solemn commitment to the Lord which encourages all who  have known him to have faith and do all things for the glory of God.

Congratulations again to Reverend Dr. Curtis Theodore Walker, Sr., on  this remarkable milestone. I thank him for all he does for our  community. I wish him many more years of continued success and  dedication to the ministry and to our entire community.
