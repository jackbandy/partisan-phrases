Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Conrad Piero as  Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champion of the Week.

On December 18, Conrad, a loss prevention specialist at a Walmart in  Canton, Ohio, was working in the store when a man being held for  allegedly shoplifting pulled a gun on a Canton police officer who was  present and attempting to question and detain the suspect.

The man pointed the gun at the officer and pulled the trigger, but  thankfully, the weapon malfunctioned and did not discharge. In a  remarkable act of bravery, Conrad immediately stepped in to pull the  gun away from the suspect as he tried to point and shoot at the officer  for a second time.

Both the Canton Police Department and Walmart said that Conrad went  above and beyond in his service to our community, and I could not agree  more.

What could have been a terrible and tragic situation went without  anyone being harmed through his remarkable act of courage. It is  average citizens doing remarkable things just like this that help make  our community the birthplace of champions. Conrad is certainly a  champion in his own right, and he has made Canton and Ohio's 13th  Congressional District proud.

Mr. Speaker, I extend my sincere gratitude to Conrad Piero for his  heroic actions and congratulate him on being named champion of the  week.
