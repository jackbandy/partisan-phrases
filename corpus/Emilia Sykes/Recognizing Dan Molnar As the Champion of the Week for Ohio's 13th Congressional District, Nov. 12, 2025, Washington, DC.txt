Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dan Molnar as the  Champion of the Week for Ohio's 13th Congressional District.

This year during the Akron Marathon, Dan, a local nurse practitioner,  was cheering his fiancee on when a runner collapsed due to experiencing  cardiac arrest. Dan hurdled a barricade, and joined other medical  personnel to help.

He immediately began CPR on the runner for roughly five minutes. His  quick response helped the runner regain a pulse, ultimately saving his  life.

During the emotional ordeal, Dan missed seeing his fiancee cross the  finish line, but he told a local news outlet that if he had to do it  all over again, he would still jump in to help.

For his heroic actions, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Dan  and members of the Akron Fire Department for answering the call to help  a neighbor in need. Dan is a shining example of why Ohio's 13th  Congressional District is known as the ``Birthplace of Champions.''
