Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Akron Fire  Department Lieutenant Dave Ewers, retired Akron Firefighter Mark  Harper, and Lynx EMS worker Dominic Bagnoli as Ohio's 13th  Congressional District champions of the week.

Late last year, a man went into cardiac arrest at a roller skating  rink in Jackson Township, Ohio. While not on the job and simply  enjoying the rink, Lieutenant Ewers, retired Firefighter Harper, and  Mr. Bagnoli leapt into action, giving the man CPR and other lifesaving  support until Jackson Township EMS arrived.

Due to their quick response and effective CPR, the man made a full  recovery and even started skating again this past weekend.

The three were recognized this week by Jackson Township with the EMS  Excellence Award for their quick response during the incident.

Lieutenant Ewers and retired Firefighter Harper, both avid skaters  themselves, said they have come to know a lot of the regulars at the  roller rink, including the man who went into cardiac arrest. They said  their fellow skaters are like family, so they were glad to be able to  help one of their own.

Again, I extend my sincere gratitude to Akron Fire Department  Lieutenant Dave Ewers, retired Akron Firefighter Mark Harper, and Lynx  EMS worker  Dominic Bagnoli for their heroic actions and for stepping in to help a  neighbor in need. They are just one more reason as to why Ohio's 13th  Congressional District is the Birthplace of Champions.
