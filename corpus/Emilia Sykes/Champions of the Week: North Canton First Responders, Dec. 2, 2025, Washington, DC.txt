Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize several North  Canton first responders as Ohio's 13th Congressional District's  champions of the week.

In the early hours of October 9, Sergeant Cody Dollinger, Officer  Adam  Knam, Officer Michael Foltz, and firefighter-paramedic Eli Bosler of  the North Canton Police and Fire Departments responded to reports of  gunfire and injuries at a local apartment complex.

In a remarkable act of bravery, Sergeant Dollinger and his team  successfully rescued a wounded woman from the window of her apartment  and brought her to the safety of medical professionals, all while the  alleged assailant continued to fire shots from inside the apartment  building.

In the end, without discharging their firearms, the Canton Regional  SWAT Team successfully apprehended the suspected shooter.

Mr. Speaker, on October 9, before many of us had left the comfort of  our homes or checked our emails or even had a cup of coffee, Sergeant  Dollinger, Officer Knam, Officer Foltz, and firefighter-paramedic  Bosler accomplished an incredible feat of bravery and heroism,  reminding us how important they are for the safety and security of our  communities.

Mr. Speaker, I, again, extend my sincere gratitude to Sergeant  Dollinger and his entire team, as well as our North Canton and Canton  First Responders who risk their lives every day to stop and battle  evils only they can stop.
