Boozman Supports Second Coronavirus Response Package


U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) voted in support of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, emergency funding legislation to provide aid to families affected by the coronavirus outbreak. He released the following statement:

"We are facing an unprecedented public health challenge. We must deliver necessary resources to combat the coronavirus and support hardworking Americans and families who are facing financial challenges due to this outbreak. Preventing the spread of this disease remains a priority and we know there is more that needs to be done. In the coming days the Senate will be taking further action to craft and pass a comprehensive bill to provide additional assistance directly to the American people and stabilize the economy," Boozman said. 

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act was approved by the House of Representatives last week. It now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law.
