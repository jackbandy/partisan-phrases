Delegation Applauds Department of Education for Awarding Over $128 Million in Coronavirus Assistance for Arkansas K-12 Students


U.S. Senators John Boozman and Tom Cotton--along with Congressmen Rick Crawford, French Hill, Steve Womack and Bruce Westerman--applauded the U.S. Department of Education for awarding emergency relief funds to support continued learning for K-12 students in Arkansas whose educations have been disrupted by the coronavirus crisis.  

The funding--totaling $128,758,638--will be released to the Arkansas Department of Education.  

It is part of a nationwide disbursement of more than $13.2 billion in emergency funds allocated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act,which recently became law with the support of the Arkansas delegation.  

In total, the CARES Actallocates nearly $31 billion to the Department to Education to distribute to students, K-12 schools and higher education institutions. 

Education leaders will have the flexibility to use this money for immediate needs, such as tools and resources for distance education, ensuring student health and safety, and developing and implementing plans for the next school year.

"The closure of all public schools in Arkansas for the remainder of the school year is one of the biggest disruptions to everyday life the coronavirus crisis has brought upon families in our state. This funding from the CARES Actwill help the state overcome some of the challenges our educators, students and parents are facing as a result," the delegation said.
