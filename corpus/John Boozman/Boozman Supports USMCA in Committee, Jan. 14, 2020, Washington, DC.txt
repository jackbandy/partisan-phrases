Boozman Supports USMCA in Committee


U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR), a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), voted to advance the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to the Senate floor. The trade deal had strong bipartisan support and now moves one step closer to a vote by the full Senate. 

"The USMCA modernizes trade policy with Canada and Mexico -- Arkansas's top two trading partners. This agreement will provide our state's agricultural producers, workers and businesses with much needed certainty, so they can continue to be competitive well into the future. I'm pleased to support this agreement and look forward to its approval by the full Senate soon,"Boozman said. 

Boozman has been pushing for approval of USMCA. Last month he delivered a floor speech calling for passageof this critical trade agreement. As part of his annual Ag Tour, Boozman promoted the benefits of this agreement with Arkansas farmers and ranchers.

The House of Representatives passed the USMCA at the end of 2019. The trade agreement was referred to seven Senate committees for review.
