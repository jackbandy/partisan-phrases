Boozman Praises Arkansas Agriculture Community for "Rising to the Occasion"


U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR)--a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry--praised the work of the Arkansas agricultural industry as farmers and ranchers continue to provide a safe and abundant supply of food despite challenges facing the industry.

"Americans depend on our nation's farmers to grow the food, fuel and fiber we depend on daily. That need becomes much more pronounced in times of crisis which creates additional strain on those who provide the goods and supplies necessary for everyday life," Boozman wrote in a blog post.

The senator honored the Arkansas agricultural heroes who are "rising to the occasion" in a video message.

Boozman is also applauding the critical work of individuals keeping the supply chain running including truckers and grocers. The senator shared his support for these critical workers in a conversation with President Trump who tweeted his thanks and offered praise for the vital role these men and women play at his April 4, 2020 press conference. 

In support of the agricultural community, Boozman joined a bipartisan group of senators pressing the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help ensure the continuity of our country's food supply and support for rural communities.
