Boozman, Cotton Sponsor Resolution Praising Successful Mission to Eliminate Qasem Soleimani


U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) joined Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to introduce a resolution honoring the members of the military and intelligence community who carried out the successful mission that killed Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) and a designated terrorist.

The resolution is modeled on a resolution unanimously supported by the U.S. Senate in 2011, after American forces killed Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden.

"Qasem Soleimani was a terrorist mastermind directly responsible for the deaths of American service members and innocent civilians. The men and women of our nation's military and intelligence services who helped bring him to justice once again proved why they are the finest the world has to offer," the senators said. "We applaud their dedication and superb skill in carrying out this operation that ultimately makes the United States and the world a safer place."

Boozman, Cotton and Cruz were joined by 40 original cosponsors: Sens. Martha McSally (R-AZ), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), John Barrasso (R-WY), Marco Rubio (R-FL), John Cornyn (R-TX), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Joni Ernst (R-IA), John Hoeven (R-ND), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Rick Scott (R-FL), Steve Daines (R-MT), Mike Braun (R-IN), Josh Hawley (R-MO), John Kennedy (R-LA), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), David Perdue (R-GA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Rob Portman (R-OH), Jim Risch (R-ID), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Mike Rounds (R-SD), James Lankford (R-OK), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Tim Scott (R-SC), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Cory Gardner (R-CO).
