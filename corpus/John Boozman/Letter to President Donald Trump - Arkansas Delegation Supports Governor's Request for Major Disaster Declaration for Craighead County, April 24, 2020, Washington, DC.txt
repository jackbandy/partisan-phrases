Letter to President Donald Trump - Arkansas Delegation Supports Governor's Request for Major Disaster Declaration for Craighead County


Dear Mr. President:

On behalf of the State of Arkansas, we are writing to support Governor Asa Hutchinson's request to declare a major disaster, pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act, as a result of severe storms and tornados which took place on March 28, 2020. 

As Governor Hutchinson noted in his request, the residents of Jonesboro experienced substantial damages. According to Preliminary Damage Assessments (PDAs), the City of Jonesboro had 163 homes that were destroyed or sustained major damage. In total, 672 homes sustained damage in Craighead County. Out of the homes assessed, an estimated 54% are uninsured. It is further estimated that 21% of those individuals are low income creating an additional hardship for individuals striving to repair their property during an already challenging time due to the national health emergency. Preliminary damage estimates show an impact to local jurisdictions with damages as high as $81.54 per resident in Craighead County.

As you know, maintaining critical infrastructure is also vitally important in the recovery and sustainability of a community. Unfortunately, the Jonesboro Airport sustained damage to several hangers, the terminal, office buildings and fencing. The damage total is estimated at nearly $17 million with insurance only covering $10 million, leaving a grand total of $7 million in uninsured damages. That estimate does not include the necessary clean up and temporary repairs. The airport currently only has one runway open with no functioning lights.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, infrastructure recovery is not going to follow the normal recovery process. The delays, additional costs, and lack of resources associated with recovering during this pandemic are going to take a toll on the State of Arkansas, and specifically the citizens of Craighead County. 

Unfortunately, Arkansas was in the midst of recovering from multiple disasters before COVID-19. Since January 2018, the state of Arkansans has had 12 Gubernatorial Declared disasters and 4 federally declared disasters.

The state of Arkansas has already been dealing with financial hardships due to extensive damages from previous extreme weather events and COVID-19, hurting local businesses and agricultural enterprises.

This, coupled with damages from the severe storms and tornados of March 28, have created an intense economic impact that has, and will continue to have, a significant effect on the region's tax base.  

We are eager to assist in any way possible to ensure expedited evaluation of this request. Please do not hesitate to contact our offices with any questions. We thank you for the support you have already offered, and respectfully ask for your continued attention and assistance in providing the resources necessary to ensure the safety of Arkansans.

Sincerely,
