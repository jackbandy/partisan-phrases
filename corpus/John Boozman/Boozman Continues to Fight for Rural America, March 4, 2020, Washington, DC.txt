Boozman Continues to Fight for Rural America


U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR), a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, pushed for full funding of transportation programs important to rural Arkansas.

During a subcommittee hearing that featured testimony from Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, Boozman urged support for the contract tower and the Essential Air Service (EAS) programs. 

"The contract tower program has been a great public-private partnership and has been so successful," Boozman told the secretary.

The contract tower program provides high quality, cost-effective, and critical air traffic control services to more than 250 smaller airports throughout the country, including five in Arkansas: Fayetteville, Springdale, Rogers, Bentonville and Texarkana. This assistance enhances safety, improves air traffic control services and delivers significant Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cost savings. 

The Essential Air Service (EAS) program connects small communities and keeps rural economies moving forward. Four Arkansas airports participate in the program: Harrison, Hot Springs, El Dorado and Jonesboro.  

The administration's budget proposal would reduce discretionary spending for the program. Boozman is working to prevent those cuts. He has consistently voted in support of the program and fought for funding. 

"We understand how important it is," Secretary Chao said. "During my tenure I've consistently fought for Essential Air Service." 

Boozman and members of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee were reviewing the Fiscal Year 2021 funding request and budget justification for the U.S. Department of Transportation.
