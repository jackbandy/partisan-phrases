Boozman, Cotton Applaud Nomination of Gregory Tabor to Serve as U.S. Marshal


U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) announced that Gregory Tabor has been nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as U.S. Marshal for the Western District of Arkansas.

"Greg is an excellent selection to serve as U.S. Marshal for the Western District of Arkansas. The skills he honed during his 35-plus years in law enforcement will be an enormous asset to the U.S. Marshals Service. His leadership at the Fayetteville Police Department over the course of his tenure as chief earned Greg well-deserved accolades. Senator Cotton and I will work with our colleagues to get Greg's nomination swiftly confirmed by the Senate so he can continue the U.S. Marshals' long and storied history in our state," Boozman said.

"Greg Tabor will serve the people of Arkansas the same way that he served the citizens of Fayetteville--with honor and distinction. I support his nomination by the president, and I look forward to his confirmation in the Senate," Cotton said.

Tabor is currently the Chief of Police at the Northwest Arkansas National Airport. He previously served for 34 years with the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas Police Department, beginning in 1985 until he retired as the Chief of Police in 2019. In addition to serving in the police department, Tabor was the Chairman of the Board for the Fourth Judicial District Drug Task Force. He earned his Police Officer Certificate from the Arkansas Law Enforcement Training Academy.
