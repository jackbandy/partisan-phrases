Boozman Secures Expanded Conservation of Waterfowl Habitat in Southern Arkansas


U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR), a member of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, championed federal funding for the conservation of additional waterfowl habitat at the Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge in Ashley and Union Counties. 

"Arkansas's world-class duck hunting tradition is only enhanced when we preserve wildlife habitat. The expansion of the Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge will allow for responsible conservation efforts to ensure future generations of outdoor enthusiasts can continue participating in and building on one of our state's favorite pastimes that also drives significant economic activity," Boozman sad. 

The Migratory Bird Conservation Commission is responsible for directing funds raised by the sale of the Duck Stamp to waterfowl habitat and hunting conservation. Earlier this month, commission members approved more than $18.4 million to conserve 9,276 acres adjacent to the existing refuge land to protect and restore habitat for wintering waterfowl.

The commission approved six Migratory Bird Conservation Act proposals and the slate of North American Wetlands Conservation Act Standard Grant proposals in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Boozman has been a member since 2018.
