Boozman Statement on Arrest of University of Arkansas Professor


U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) released the following statement regarding the arrest of University of Arkansas Professor Simon Saw-Teong Ang for charges of wire fraud after failing to disclose ties to the Chinese government and Chinese companies in order to receive federal grant money. 

"China's communist regime cheats, steals and manipulates. Its practices threaten our national security as well as the security and intellectual property of American businesses. The FBI and Department of Justice have been vigilant in identifying bad actors intent on stealing trade secrets, and I support their ongoing efforts to protect American institutions and interests from China's predatory activities. The arrest of Simon Ang is the latest action to prevent this abuse from continuing."
