Boozman Statement on President's Speech on Iran


U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) released this statementfollowing President Trump's remarks on Iran: 

"President Trump's measured response to the dangerous escalations by Iran should send a clear message to the regime that its continued hostile actions will no longer be tolerated. With the support of our allies, we must reject Iran's aggressive conduct and continue to oppose its grip on the Middle East. By imposing additional economic sanctions, the president has again demonstrated our commitment to firmly countering the regime's destructive, destabilizing behavior while encouraging peace. It is in Iran's best interest to de-escalate the tensions, abandon its nuclear ambitions and stop sponsoring terror."
