Time to Deliver Results for American People

Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, Americans expect Congress to complete the  basic work of government before leaving town for recess, not the least  of which is passing the 12 funding bills for fiscal year 2026. Having  passed only two bills, it is absurd that Republicans have decided to  pack it up early.

Meanwhile, millions fear what Republican cuts to Medicaid will mean  for their families. Shoppers are tightening their belts because of  record prices for chicken and beef. Businesses are stymied by President  Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs. ``Taco or not taco'' is the  question they are asking.

Why are Republicans rushing to take the break when so many Americans  can't even catch a break? Simply put, Republicans are running scared of  a titanic Presidential temper tantrum over releasing the Epstein files.

My Democratic colleagues and I are here to work to lower costs and  grow our economy, to build healthier and safer communities, and to  ensure strong national security and national defense.

I implore my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us.  Let's get back to work and deliver the results that the American people  sent us here to achieve.
