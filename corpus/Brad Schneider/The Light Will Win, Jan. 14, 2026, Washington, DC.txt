The Light Will Win

Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, last week, the bipartisan House Abraham  Accords Caucus was privileged to host Rabbi Yehoram Ulman and Ahmed al- Ahmed, of Sydney, Australia, and survivors of the terrorist attack at  Bondi Beach last month.

When a father-and-son pair of ISIS-inspired gunmen began massacring  Jews during a Hanukkah celebration on the beach--murdering 15 people,  including Rabbi Ulman's son-in-law--Ahmed, a Muslim who was at the  event by serendipity, rushed for cover. As one of the terrorists  approached his position, Ahmed heroically rose to the moment, charged,  and single-handedly disarmed the attacker, saving countless lives.

On behalf of the entire Abraham Accords Caucus, I thank Rabbi Ulman  and Mr. al-Ahmed for traveling here and passionately sharing their  stories. I also thank my many colleagues for joining us to honor these  two great men.

The Abraham Accords Caucus was formed after the accords were signed  five years ago on a simple belief: Jews and Arabs belong to the same  land, and elevating the people will elevate the land and bring peace to  everyone in the region.

Yesterday, Rabbi Ulman and Ahmed al-Ahmed showed that this spirit  extends far beyond the Middle East. Their shared humanity and embrace  of each other reflects our hope for the future, a future in which  people see the dignity and grace in one another and have the strength  to stand up and confront hatred and evil.

As I told Ahmed, he is a hero to us all. He teaches us that love of  the stranger can lift us all and defeat hatred. Or, as Rabbi Ulman and  Mr. al-Ahmed have titled their visit around the world, ``The Light Will  Win.''
