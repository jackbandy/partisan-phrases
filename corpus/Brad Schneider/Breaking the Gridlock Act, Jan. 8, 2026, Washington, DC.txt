Breaking the Gridlock Act

Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly and proudly  support Leader Jeffries' discharge petition to extend the ACA premium  subsidies.

Just 8 days ago, President Trump and the Republican Congress let the  ACA subsidies expire. Consequently, rather than working on their new  year's resolution, 22 million hardworking Americans are forced to  decide what sacrifices they need to make to afford their insurance or  whether they need to sacrifice their families' healthcare.

That is why today is a happy day. We are one step closer to helping  millions of Americans afford healthcare. Getting to this day wasn't  easy, but Democrats stayed united and stood firm. After fighting for  months, we are joined by Republican colleagues who recognize that we  have a responsibility to help ensure Americans can afford to provide  healthcare for their families.

Mr. Speaker, it is our job to bring down the cost for Americans. It  is our job to make life better for Americans. It is our job to ensure  that every family has access to affordable and quality care. Let's do  our job. Let's extend the ACA credits. I urge my colleagues to support  the discharge petition.
