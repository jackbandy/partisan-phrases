Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act

Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues are saying we  are seeing inflation. Inflation in healthcare has been going on for  generations. In fact, during the years of the George W. Bush  administration, premiums increased 118 percent.

The Republican-led legislation they are presenting to us today is  barely even a concept of a healthcare plan. After 15 years of efforts,  they should be embarrassed by this slapdash effort.

Not only does the bill not address the expiring tax credits, it hurts  patients, it hurts families, and it hurts women and seniors.

I want to be very clear. My Republican colleagues are taking zero  action to extend the tax subsidies that help American families provide  insurance to their families.

We need to do better. We can vote today on a clean 3-year extension  because we have Republicans who have joined Democrats to call for that.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 3-year extension.
