Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record links to three  articles. The first is: The American College of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists. ``Issue Brief: Crisis Pregnancy Centers.'' https:// schneider.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/schneider.house.gov/files/evo- media-document/crisis-pregnancy-centers-rep-schneider.pdf.

The second is from the AMA Journal of Ethics: ``Why Crisis Pregnancy  Centers Are Legal but Unethical.'' https://schneider.house.gov/sites/ evo-subsites/schneider.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/why-crisis- pregnancy-cen ters-are-legal-but-unethical-rep-schnei der_0.pdf.

The third is an article by a number of doctors from Women's Health  Reports: ``Truth and Transparency in Crisis Pregnancy Centers.''  https://schneider.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/schneider.house.gov/ files/evo-media-document/truth-and-transparency-in-crisis-preg nancy- centers-rep-schneider.pdf.

Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I think it is shameful that my Republican  colleagues have brought this bill to the floor to funnel money to so- called crisis pregnancy centers and away from programs that truly help  families in need.

My Republican colleagues are saying that these centers help women. In  reality, too many of these centers trick women before they even walk in  the door.

They advertise themselves as real medical clinics. They are not. They  might look like a normal doctor's office with ultrasound machines and  employees wearing lab coats, but the coats are for show, and the  employees are not medical professionals.

Mr. Speaker, don't be fooled. The primary purpose of these centers is  to deceive women, and the organizations promoting these centers are the  same organizations advocating for a national abortion ban.

Here is what should concern us all: These centers routinely spread  medical misinformation and intentionally cause delays in accessing  legitimate healthcare. Their theory is delay long enough and women in  crisis are effectively forced to continue their pregnancies.

Now, Mr. Speaker, you will hear my Republican colleagues tout that  these centers offer maternal care. They don't. Real maternal care  requires real medical professionals who offer real, ethical, and  comprehensive health services, who are licensed and regulated, and who  don't have a personal bias counter to their patients' medical interest  or decisions.

Yet, my Republican colleagues want to divert Federal TANF funding  away from families in need and to these clinics instead. This is a  disgraceful diversion. If my Republican colleagues were serious about  helping children and families in need, let them speak out against this  administration's illegal payment freeze for childcare and child welfare  funding.

Right now, as we debate this bill on eligibility for TANF spending,  the Trump administration is illegally holding up more than $10 billion  in Federal funding for childcare and family assistance funding,  including TANF funds, to States, including my own of Illinois, as well  as California, New York, Colorado, and Minnesota.

The administration is illegally withholding payments to States for  childcare, foster care, child protective services, and cash assistance  to low-income families.

Mr. SCHNEIDER. They are hiding behind false claims and unauthorized  administrative barriers in order to inflict pain on States that the  President dislikes.

Let me be clear. These payments are legally required under the law,  and this freeze is unlawful.

The administration needs to pay the States what they are owed.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the bill.
