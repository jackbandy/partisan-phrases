Recognizing Emma Weir


Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to recognize and  express my deep appreciation and gratitude to Emma Weir, who served as  Communications Director and Senior Advisor for the New Democrat  Coalition over the past 4 years.

Emma has been an extraordinary part of our team--bringing not only  her sharp communication skills and strategic insight but also her  kindness, dedication, and unwavering passion for public service. Her  excellent work has helped shape our message, build connections, grow  the New Dem brand, and advance the values we hold dear. As a  communicator, Emma is second to none.

As Chair of the New Democrat Coalition, and before that Vice Chair  for Communications, I have worked hand-in-hand with Emma to find new  ways to address the challenges facing our country, adapting to a  constantly evolving media environment to connect with the American  people and earn their trust. Emma's hard work has ensured every New Dem  Member and their staff has the tools, knowledge, and resources they  need to succeed. As she starts her next chapter, Emma should know she  has made an indelible mark on our Members and the Coalition.

While we will deeply miss her at New Dems, I am so proud and excited  to see her step into  a new opportunity with Chairman Pete Aguilar and the House Democratic  Caucus. I have no doubt Emma will bring the same compassion,  professionalism, and excellence to the House Democratic Caucus that  made her so effective with the New Dems.

Emma's tenure with the New Dems has been--by any measure--an immense  success. As she departs, Emma leaves behind a strong New Dem brand and  media presence that will continue to grow atop the foundations she  worked so hard to establish. Though we are sad to see her go, the  Coalition, our leadership team, and I, wish Emma all the best. We look  forward to working with her in her new capacity to move our country  forward and deliver results for the American people.
