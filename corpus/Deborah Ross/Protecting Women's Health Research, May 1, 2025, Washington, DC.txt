Protecting Women's Health Research


Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join millions of American  women in condemning Trump's attempt to gut funding for women's health  research.

The Trump administration has rescinded women's research projects at  an alarming rate. These projects include lifesaving research on early  breast cancer detection and so much more. Trump even shut down the  Women's Health Initiative, our Nation's largest and most consequential  women's health study.

Millions of women's lives are at stake. That is why I led my  Democratic Women's Caucus colleagues in demanding that Trump  immediately reverse course. I am relieved to announce that the  administration heeded our call and the heartfelt appeals of our  constituents and restored this crucial funding.

Mr. Speaker, this fight is far from over. The Trump administration is  waging a war on science and women. We must stay vigilant, and we will  fight back.
