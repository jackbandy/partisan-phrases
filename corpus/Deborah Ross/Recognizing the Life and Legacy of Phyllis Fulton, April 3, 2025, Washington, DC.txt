Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Phyllis B.  Fulton, who sadly passed away last week.

A native of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, Phyllis dedicated her  life to serving her community through her work as a social worker.  After graduating from North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State  University in 1969, she began her career with the Wayne County  Department of Social Services. While accompanying her husband on his  assignments as a U.S. Air Force officer, Phyllis continued her work as  a social worker around the world, helping foster kids, victims of child  abuse, and families with adoption.

After returning to North Carolina, Phyllis first worked at the Wake  County Department of Social Services before moving to the North  Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, where she was  promoted to Program Coordinator of Community Child Protection Teams  across the state. In this role, she traveled to all 100 of our state's  counties.

In 2013, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory awarded Phyllis with The  Order of the Long Leaf Pine, North Carolina's highest honor--an  accolade acknowledging her exemplary service to our state. She was  recognized for her contributions to making North Carolina a better  place for all of our people over the course of her more than 50-year  career in social work.

Phyllis was a beloved wife, mother, sister, grandmother, and friend.  She embodied the true meaning of public service and made a lasting  impact on her community and state. I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing the inspiring life and service of Phyllis Fulton.
