Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with grave concerns about Donald  Trump's proposal to eliminate FEMA.

In September 2024, western North Carolina was ravaged by Hurricane  Helene, the most devastating storm in our State's history. We lost over  100 lives, and countless communities were changed forever.

In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Helene, FEMA provided  indispensable support to save lives, clear debris, and house families  who lost everything.

As hurricane season begins, it is a disgrace that Donald Trump and  his administration are proposing the elimination of FEMA. This scheme  is nothing less than a slap in the face to the western North Carolina  communities that he pledged to support.

If Trump really cares about effectively managing disaster response,  then he should submit a funding request to Congress to replenish the  disaster fund. Eliminating FEMA is not the answer. It will put lives in  jeopardy across the United States and severely hamper ongoing disaster  efforts.
