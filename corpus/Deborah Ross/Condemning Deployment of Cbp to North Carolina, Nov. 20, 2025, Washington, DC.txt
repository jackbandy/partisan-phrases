Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the Trump  administration's deployment of CBP to North Carolina.

Since last weekend, North Carolinians watched in horror as masked  agents descended on our State, terrorizing communities, and abducting  people off the streets based on the color of their skin.

These immigration raids only serve one purpose: sowing fear and  intimidation.

If the Republicans cared about fixing our broken immigration system,  this wouldn't be the way to do it. If they did, they would work with  Democrats to ensure our border is secure, families stay together, and  our farms and businesses can get the workers they need. Instead, they  refuse to do anything to fix our immigration system for legal  immigration.

Mr. Speaker, Wake County and our State are welcoming, vibrant places,  made stronger by the hardworking immigrants who choose to call our  communities home. It is time for Federal immigration officers to go  home and stop attacking our people. They need to arrest real criminals.
