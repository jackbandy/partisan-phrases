Another Trove of Epstein Files

Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, after months of delays and distractions,  Trump's DOJ finally released another trove of documents from the  Epstein files.

The DOJ claims it is in full compliance with the Epstein Files  Transparency Act, but that is simply not true. It is just the latest in  a long line of lies and excuses from this administration.

To date, the DOJ has only released half of the files, in direct  violation of Federal law.

The survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse have already endured  unimaginable pain. They deserve truth and accountability.

However, in this latest release, some of the survivors' names and  images were exposed while the men who abused them remained redacted.

What is DOJ hiding? Who are they protecting?

Here is the bottom line: Anything short of full compliance amounts to  a coverup.
