Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of a Federal  scientist who was fired by President Trump and Elon Musk.

In their own words, this researcher wrote:

I was a biologist with USDA's Animal and Plant Health       Inspection Service. I worked to mitigate human-wildlife       conflict and protect American agriculture. As a Wildlife       Services biologist, I was also designated as an emergency       response official and was preparing to deploy to help the       efforts combating the avian influenza epidemic.

Bird flu cases are popping up across the country, including in my  district, yet Trump is firing the public servants who are responsible  for fighting the disease.

Donald Trump is not only jeopardizing the livelihoods of thousands of  Federal employees and their communities, but he is recklessly firing  scientists and endangering the health and safety of every American. His  actions are dangerous and cruel.
