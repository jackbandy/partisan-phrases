Ice Raids in North Carolina

Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, in November, my home State of North Carolina  watched in horror as Federal immigration agents descended on our State  and terrorized our communities.

During these raids, my constituent Fatima Velasquez-Antonio, was  detained. She has work authorization, no criminal record, and is  allowed to legally remain in this country while her asylum case is  pending.

Yet despite all of this, she was taken into custody and ripped away  from her family for weeks. Thankfully, after an outpouring of public  anger and criticism, the Trump administration finally released Fatima a  few days before Christmas.

Fatima is one of countless hardworking immigrants who have been  unlawfully or unjustly detained across the country. People like Fatima  with deep ties to our community are being targeted instead of a focus  on apprehending violent criminals.

We cannot allow the Trump administration to continue violating the  rights that all individuals in this country are guaranteed.
