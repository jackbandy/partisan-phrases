Healthcare Crisis in North Carolina


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698079/healthcare-crisis-in-north-carolina


Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, we have reached the precipice of a full-blown  healthcare crisis in North Carolina and this country. ACA tax credits  are only weeks away from expiring. Unless Congress acts, an estimated  157,000 North Carolinians will lose their coverage.

This week, I led my North Carolina colleagues in demanding actions  from Speaker Johnson. What is his strategy? Where is the plan?

I am the proud cosponsor of a bipartisan solution to this crisis, but  Speaker Johnson refuses to put any bill on the floor for a vote. Next  week is our last legislative week of the year and our last chance to  preserve access to lifesaving care for our constituents.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of North Carolina, I am pleading  with my Republican colleagues to join Democrats in saving healthcare  for millions of Americans.
