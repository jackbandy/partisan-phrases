Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, next week we will recognize the 1-year  anniversary since Hurricane Helene plowed a path of destruction across  western North Carolina.

In August, I had the chance to visit and hear directly from several  affected communities. Time and time again, I heard the same thing. They  need more Federal support, and they need it faster.

We are lucky to have the steady leadership of Governor Stein guiding  the recovery effort, but the Federal Government needs to do its part,  too.

Unfortunately, the Trump administration continues to slow down the  Federal relief process. That is why I am calling on the President to  slash the red tape that is holding back critical assistance that was  appropriated last year for our State.

Mr. Speaker, Congress also has a critical role to play. We need to  replenish the disaster relief fund and immediately pass Governor  Stein's request for additional Helene recovery funding. We can't  abandon western North Carolina.
