Threats to Social Security


Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with grave concern about the  threat that the Trump administration poses to Social Security.

In February, Elon Musk called the program the biggest Ponzi scheme of  all time. Then a few weeks later, he referred to Social Security as the  big one to eliminate

These are not empty comments. They are real threats. Under this  administration, we are seeing mass firings at Social Security offices,  hours-long wait times, delayed checks, websites crashing, and field  offices closing.

My district office in Raleigh, North Carolina, has received panicked  calls from seniors whose checks didn't arrive on time for the first  time ever.

Seniors' benefits are under attack, and Donald Trump is to blame. We  will not be silent while Trump and his cronies try to slash the  benefits that our seniors have earned over a lifetime of hard work.
