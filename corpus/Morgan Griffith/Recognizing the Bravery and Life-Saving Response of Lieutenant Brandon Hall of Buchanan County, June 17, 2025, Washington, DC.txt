Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exceptional  courage and service of Lieutenant Brandon Hall of Buchanan County,  Virginia.

On May 1st, Lieutenant Hall responded to an emergency in which a  camper had filled with dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. Inside the  camper were two adults and a child, all unconscious. When faced with an  invisible but deadly threat, Lieutenant Hall entered the camper,  removed the victims, and quickly administered critical first aid.

In a moment of crisis, Lieutenant Hall was among the first to arrive,  and when faced with danger, he did not pause. Lieutenant Hall's bravery  and quick thinking saved these lives and stand as a testament to the  selfless courage of the public servants in Virginia's Ninth  Congressional District.

Today, we recognize Lieutenant Hall for his swift and courageous  response. The strength and skill he demonstrated in a time of  emergency, reflect the very best of Southwest Virginia. We thank him  for his service and are deeply grateful for his dedication.
