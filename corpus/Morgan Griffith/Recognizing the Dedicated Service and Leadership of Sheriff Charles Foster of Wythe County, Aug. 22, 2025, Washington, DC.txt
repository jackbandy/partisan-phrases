Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the exceptional  dedication and service of Sheriff Charles Foster of Wythe County,  Virginia, who retired on August 1 after a 38-year career in law  enforcement.

Through nearly four decades, Sheriff Foster has served Wythe County  Sheriff's Office with the integrity and devotion of a true public  servant.

Hired at the age of 18 as a dispatcher, Sheriff Foster developed  strong ties to those he worked with early in his career and earned high  marks from his community.

After more than 30 years serving the Sheriff's Office, Mr. Foster ran  for Wythe County Sheriff in 2021. Given community support of his law  enforcement experience and credentials, it was no surprise that he won  the election, unopposed.

In 2023, Wythe County reaffirmed their trust in Sheriff Foster by re- electing him Sheriff. For the past four years in the role, Sheriff  Foster led his department with humility, professionalism, and a  profound sense of duty to his community.

My office appreciated working with Sheriff Foster during his tenure.  Thanks to his help and the Wythe County Sheriff's Office, they provide  a room for my staff to hold traveling staff office hours and provide  services to constituents.

Southwest Virginia communities are served and represented by  dedicated law enforcement professionals like Sheriff Foster. Aspiring  officers and fellow law enforcement groups should be inspired by his  legacy, defined by a deep personal calling to protect and serve. As  Sheriff Foster begins this next chapter, we offer him our heartfelt  thanks for his decades of service and his unwavering protection of his  fellow Southwest Virginians.
