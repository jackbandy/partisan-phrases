Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate a landmark  moment in both American aviation history and rural health care  innovation: the 10th anniversary of the first Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA)-approved drone delivery, which took place in Wise  County, Virginia, on July 17, 2015.

This groundbreaking event marked the first official drone package  delivery in this country. It was the first time in our Nation's history  that medical supplies were delivered to patients via Unmanned Aerial  Vehicle (UAV), setting a global precedent for how drone technology can  serve humanity.

The drone delivery was made possible through an extraordinary  collaboration among several visionary partners:

Flirtey, a pioneering startup in commercial drone delivery (including  co-founder and chief executive officer Matthew Sweeny; co-founder and  chief operations officer Tom Bass; advisory board member Shyam  Chidamber);

Health Wagon, a nonprofit health care organization that has served  the medically underserved in Central Appalachia for over four decades  (including chief executive officer, Dr. Teresa Gardner Tyson, DNP;  clinical director, Dr. Paula Meade Collins, DNP);

Remote Area Medical (RAM), which organizes annual pop-up clinics  providing free medical, dental, and vision care (including president,  Stan Brock);

NASA Langley Research Center, which offered critical technical  support and expertise (including director David E. Bowles; Frank Jones;  John Foggia);

Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership (MAAP) at Virginia Tech, an  official FAA-designated UAS test site (including director, Jon Greene;  president, Timothy D. Sands);

Virginia Center for Innovative Technology, which facilitated public- private collaboration and integration;

Appalachian College of Pharmacy, which played a key role in preparing  and ensuring the safe dispensing of the prescription medications  delivered by drone (including adjunct associate professor of pharmacy,  Dr. Shamly Abdelfattah); and

Jack Kennedy, Clerk of the Wise County Circuit Court, who was  instrumental in pioneering and championing the concept of using drones  for rural medical delivery in the Appalachian region.

Other Notable Partners: Shelcy Mullins, Sr. Fairgrounds; Lonesome  Pine Airport manager, Jarrod Powers; RX Partnership executive director  Amy Yarcich; Ryan Media Lab chief executive officer Mark A. Ryan and  partner Kyle Mark Ryan; and Wise County UAS event coordinator,  Andrianah Kilgore.

At that time, delivering medical supplies to rural sites like the RAM  Wise County clinic event often required extensive hours of travel that  could take hours or days of travel across rugged, mountainous terrain.  But on that historic day, a drone carried the same supplies in just  minutes--safely and efficiently delivering pharmaceuticals and medical  supplies to patients.

This was more than a demonstration of technical prowess--it was a  transformative moment for underserved communities. It showed how  cutting-edge innovation could eliminate barriers to health care, reduce  delays in treatment, and save lives in areas long overlooked by  traditional infrastructure.

The implications extended far beyond Southwest Virginia. This mission  laid the groundwork for nationwide drone delivery applications and  inspired regulatory advancements by the FAA. It served as a springboard  for companies to explore widespread drone delivery as a viable,  scalable solution.

Mr. Speaker, as we reflect on the 10th anniversary of this historic  achievement, we honor all those who made it possible. Their collective  vision, determination, and compassion gave rise to a new frontier of  health care access, born in the mountains of Central Appalachian  Virginia but felt across the globe.

The first FAA-approved drone delivery was not merely a feat of  aviation--it was a profound act of compassion. It marked a turning  point in how we approach health care access for those living in rural  communities. For areas long burdened by limited infrastructure and  geographic barriers, this moment offered something far greater than  innovation--it delivered dignity and hope. It was, in every sense, the  ``Kitty Hawk moment'' for the drone delivery industry and the future of  rural health care delivery.
