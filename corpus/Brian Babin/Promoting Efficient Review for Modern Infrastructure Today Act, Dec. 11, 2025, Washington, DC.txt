Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act

Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chair, pipelines and energy infrastructure are the  backbone of American energy dominance, yet section 401 of the Clean  Water Act, designed to protect our water quality, has too often become  a roadblock for critical projects.

Too many States are using this authority to block interstate natural  gas pipelines, transmission lines, and other federally approved  projects for reasons that have nothing whatsoever to do with water  quality. These projects are routinely certified by the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission as being in the national interest, yet they are  never built because a single State can withhold or delay a 401  certification.

We have all seen the consequences: delays that stretch on for years,  procedural roadblocks that force applicants to withdraw and to resubmit  just to restart the process, and legal hurdles so steep that a single  denial can derail an entire multistate project or kill it altogether.

Meanwhile, these very same States continue benefiting from the  affordable, reliable energy produced in other parts of the country,  even as they obstruct the pipelines needed for our Nation's  development, economic security, and long-term competitiveness.

This amendment tackles that problem head-on. It establishes expedited  judicial review for major energy infrastructure projects, ensuring that  the courts reach timely decisions.

It also limits standing to the applicant or those who face direct or  irreparable harm, preventing activist groups from weaponizing the  process to stall projects that are essential to our power grid,  economy, and, most importantly, national security.

Mr. Chair, we cannot meet growing energy demand, power our data  centers, or lead the world in AI without the infrastructure to move  American energy. It is impossible. This amendment is a targeted,  responsible solution, and a crucial step toward restoring America's  energy dominance.

Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman and understand her  opposition, but her reasons for opposing this amendment are the very  reasons that we need this amendment.

We have a situation that has been weaponized, that has held up and  killed many good projects that would lead to our energy independence  and to those very States that she is talking about.

Mr. Chair, I urge support of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.

Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.

Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).

Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chair, I reiterate exactly what we said in my opening  statement and what Mr. Rouzer has stated. Many times, the opposition  has nothing to do with clean water whatsoever. It has been weaponized.  We need to expedite this, as Mr. Rouzer, my friend, said.

Mr. Chair, this is extremely good for the environment, and I would  still urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  amendment.

Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
