Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for the time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1949, the  Unlocking our Domestic LNG Potential Act of 2025. I am proud to be an  original cosponsor of this very important legislation.

The United States is already the world's leading producer of oil and  natural gas and also the top exporter of LNG. A whole lot of that  energy comes straight out of my district in the great State of Texas.

That is why it is long past time that we repeal the harmful,  politically motivated Biden-era restrictions that have shackled and  locked down our LNG industry. These restrictions did nothing but  threaten American jobs, drive away investment, and undermine the energy  security of our own allies and friends.

H.R. 1949, led by my friend Representative August Pfluger from Texas,  fixes this. It lifts restrictions on the import and export of natural  gas and allows American LNG to flourish once again.

Mr. Speaker, America should never ever voluntarily surrender its  energy advantages, not when our production strengthens families, their  paychecks, and communities, and certainly not when Texas and our Gulf  Coast stand ready to supply LNG to the world safely, cleanly, and  reliably. Energy security is national security. We must never forget  this.

I am proud to support this bill. It is a wise, good bill that will  strengthen America. I urge my colleagues to join me in unlocking  America's full LNG potential to achieve world energy dominance.
