Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann),  my good friend, for holding this session for such a great and worthy  cause.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solemn remembrance of the lives lost in  the tragic crashes of American Eagle Flight 5342 and PAT 25.

To the families, friends, and loved ones of the 67 victims, we offer  our very deepest condolences. No words can ever ease the pain of such a  devastating loss, but we stand with them. We stand with every one of  these folks in mourning and in the pursuit of answers in this tragic  accident.

This tragedy demands a full and thorough investigation to ensure that  no family endures this kind of heartbreak again. The safety of our  skies and the trust of the American people depend on accountability,  transparency, and action.

Mr. Speaker, let us honor the memory of those we lost by ensuring  that such a catastrophe never happens again. I urge my colleagues to  support H. Res. 153.
