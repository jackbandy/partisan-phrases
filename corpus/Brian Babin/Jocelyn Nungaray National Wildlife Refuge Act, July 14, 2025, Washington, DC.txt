Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Westerman, my good friend  and classmate, for his services here.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1596 to rename the Anahuac  National Wildlife Refuge located in the State of Texas and in my  district as the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge to forever  commemorate the life of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, who was  tragically killed on June 17, 2024.

Jocelyn was brutally murdered in Houston, Texas, last summer. Two  illegal Venezuelan aliens, both reported members of Tren de Aragua, the  gang notoriously known around the country, have been charged in her  killing.

Naming the refuge after Jocelyn is a very fitting way to honor her  love for animals and to preserve her spirit within the very landscape  that she called home.

I thank Chairman Westerman and Senator Cornyn for their leadership  and support on these efforts. I also thank my Democratic colleague  across the way for her support.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this very  commonsense legislation. We can never bring back Jocelyn, but we can  commemorate and memorialize her for the love of animals that she had,  and her wonderful family, and have that as a fitting testimony to her  short life.
