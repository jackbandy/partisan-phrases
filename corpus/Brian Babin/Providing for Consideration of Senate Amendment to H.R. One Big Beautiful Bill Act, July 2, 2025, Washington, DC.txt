Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of H.R.  1, President Trump's one big, beautiful bill.

Here we are, despite months of our Democratic colleagues' best  efforts to delay, fearmonger, and mislead the public about this bill,  and we are ready to deliver for the American people.

Here is the thing about fear-mongering. You can only say ``the sky is  falling'' so many times before folks start waking up and seeing for  themselves exactly what is going on.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act secures our border. It prevents the  single largest tax increase in American history and refocuses safety  net programs for those who truly need them, not the ones shamming.  Then, it reinvigorates our Armed Forces, where we saw a diminution for  4 long years under the Biden administration.

Mr. Speaker, it is high time that we deliver this to the President's  desk for a signature. This is promises made and promises kept, and I am  very proud to support this bill.
