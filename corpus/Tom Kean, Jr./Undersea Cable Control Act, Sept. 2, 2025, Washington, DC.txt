Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2503, the Undersea  Cable Control Act.

Undersea cables have long been an integral part of America's  transcontinental communication and data transmission. The Undersea  Cable Control Act is a crucial, bipartisan piece of legislation  designed to protect U.S. national security and ensure continued U.S.  technological leadership.

By limiting our foreign adversaries' access to undersea cabling  infrastructure, we can protect U.S. leadership from the influence of  adversarial governments, like the Chinese Communist Party.

I think we can all agree, regardless of which side of the aisle we  stand on, that there is a need to ensure technologies critical to  America's telecommunications infrastructure do not end up in the wrong  hands.

Undersea cables carry approximately 99 percent of transoceanic  digital traffic, enabling $10 trillion in daily financial transactions  and contributing hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. economy  every year.

Mr. Speaker, undersea cable infrastructure has become the digital  background for the modern global economy. Recent attacks on the  transcontinental cable have exposed vulnerabilities in the framework.

However, this bill directs Congress and the State Department to  develop a strategy to eliminate adversarial access to the key  technologies used in undersea cables. This strengthens our export  controls, requires transparency and public reporting, and promotes  collaboration with our allies abroad to ensure our standards and  infrastructure are secure.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Mast of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee for authoring this bill during the 118th Congress. I am  honored to continue the legacy he began.
