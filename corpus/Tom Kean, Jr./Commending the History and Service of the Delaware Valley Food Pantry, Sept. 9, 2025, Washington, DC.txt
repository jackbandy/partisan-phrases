Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the remarkable history  and service of the Delaware Valley Food Pantry in Lambertville,  Hunterdon County.

For 70 years, this pantry has been a lifeline for families  experiencing food insecurity in the Lambertville and New Hope  communities. Since 1955, its dedicated volunteers have ensured that  everyone who walks through its  doors feels welcomed, supported, and part of a caring community. An  entirely volunteer-run organization, the pantry serves more than 1,000  individuals each month, generously giving their time to meet the needs  of their neighbors.

As we celebrate seven decades of service, I ask my colleagues to join  me in honoring the volunteers and community members whose dedication  has made the Delaware Valley Food Pantry a lasting success and will  continue to keep families fed for many years to come.
