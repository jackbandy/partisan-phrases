Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1765, the Promoting  United States Wireless Leadership Act.

The United States has long been a leader in the development and  deployment of the wireless infrastructure that connects Americans and  the world.

America led the way in the development and the deployment of 5G, an  important tool in our communications arsenal that connects millions to  everyday needs, emergency services when needed, and to one another.

Make no mistake, our adversaries are aggressively working to exert  their own influence, their own values, and their own interests on the  global wireless stage. As the next generation of wireless technologies  take shape, it is critical that America leads and does not follow.

This bipartisan bill will cement our continued leadership by  directing the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration, or NTIA, to encourage participation by trusted  stakeholders in the international standards-setting bodies, like 3GP  and IEEE, that develop technical standards for 5G and next-generation  wireless.

Through this bill, NTIA will partner with these trusted stakeholders,  representing companies, engineers, and policymakers from America and  our allies, to offer technical expertise to American-led innovators.

By ensuring that our companies, engineers, and policymakers have a  seat at the table, we can promote fair competition, protect our  national security, and prevent our adversaries, like China, from  shaping the future of global communications to their advantage and to  our detriment.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the partnership of Representatives Dingell,  Walberg, and Clarke, as well as the work of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, on this matter.
