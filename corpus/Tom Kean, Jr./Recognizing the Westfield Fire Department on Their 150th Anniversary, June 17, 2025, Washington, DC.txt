Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Westfield Fire  Department as they celebrate 150 years of service to our community.  Since its founding as a volunteer fire department in 1875, the WFD has  grown into a career department, providing essential fire protection  services to the residents of Westfield and the surrounding area. Over  the past 150 years, they have answered the call in times of need--often  under dangerous and demanding conditions--a true testament to the  courage, duty, and selflessness that embody the very best of New  Jersey's first responders. I extend my deepest congratulations to the  Westfield Fire Department on this milestone anniversary and look  forward to their continued growth and commitment to public safety for  many years to come.
