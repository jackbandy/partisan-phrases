Recognizing the West Amwell Volunteer Fire Department on Their 75th Anniversary


Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the West Amwell  Volunteer Fire Department as they celebrate 75 years of service to our  community. Since its founding in 1949, the department has provided  essential fire protection and rescue services to the residents of West  Amwell Township. Their commitment to answering the call in times of  need, often under dangerous and demanding conditions, is a testament to  the sense of courage, duty, and selflessness embodying the very best of  New Jersey's first responders. As June 14th approaches, the community  comes together to reflect on this special milestone and honor the  dedication of the men and women who have spent decades working to keep  West Amwell safe.

As the West Amwell Volunteer Fire Department celebrates 75 years of  distinguished service, I look forward to seeing their continued growth  and commitment to public safety for years to come.
