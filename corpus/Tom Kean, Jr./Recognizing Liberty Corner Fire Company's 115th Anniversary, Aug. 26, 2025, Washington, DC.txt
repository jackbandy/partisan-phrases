Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Liberty Corner  Fire Company, an essential part of Bernards Township, Somerset County,  for its steadfast and selfless service to our community for 115 years.  Since 1910, the Liberty Corner Fire Company's enduring strength has  been built not only on the courage of its members but also on the  support of the community it serves. Comprised of more than 65  volunteers, the Liberty Corner Fire Company is responsible for  providing fire and rescue service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to  the Liberty Corner section of Bernards Township. Through community  fundraising events and donations, residents ensure that these  volunteers have the equipment, training, and protective gear needed to  continue their mission safely and effectively. Generations of families  in Bernards Township have worn the uniform of Liberty Corner Fire  Company, making it both a proud tradition and a vital lifeline.

Mr. Speaker, as Bernards Township hosts its upcoming First Responders  Appreciation Night, I am especially proud to commend Liberty Corner  Fire Company for its unwavering commitment and remarkable legacy of  more than a century of service to our community. I invite my colleagues  to join me in honoring these extraordinary volunteers, whose dedication  to protecting our neighbors is a shining example of community spirit  and sacrifice.
