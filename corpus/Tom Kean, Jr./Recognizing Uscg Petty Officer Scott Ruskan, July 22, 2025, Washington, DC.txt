Recognizing Uscg Petty Officer Scott Ruskan


Mr. KEAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor U.S. Coast Guard Petty  Officer Scott Ruskan, a native of Oxford, New Jersey, who displayed  extraordinary bravery during the devastating flooding in Kerr County,  Texas.

On his very first rescue mission, Petty Officer Ruskan saved 165  people, many of them children, including campers and staff from Camp  Mystic. Serving as the only triage coordinator on the scene, he played  a critical role in one of the largest rescue efforts in recent Coast  Guard history.

Scott grew up in Warren County, attended Rider University, and  answered the call to serve by enlisting in the U.S. Coast Guard, where  he trained as a rescue swimmer before deploying into action with  courage far beyond his experience.

I am grateful to the first responders and to volunteers, especially  heroes like Petty Officer Ruskan, who risk their lives to protect  others in need. I thank them for their service and for their sacrifice.
