Senator Braun's statement in support of coronavirus assistance Phase III


Today, U.S. Senator Mike Braun (R-IN) released the following statement regarding his intention to vote in support of Phase III of the coronavirus assistance package.

"The coronavirus impacts our health and our economy, and I will be supporting this assistance package which provides massive assistance for our hospitals and those on the frontlines fighting this virus, reaches out to directly help workers keep their jobs and provide immediate help to those who have lost their jobs, and provides the single largest Main Street assistance program in history for small business owners to keep their doors open, which I was personally involved with securing.

"While it's shameful that Congress wasted so much time bickering over this desperately-needed relief, now we must work together as one country to flatten the coronavirus curve so we do not flatten our economy.

"Indiana should be incredibly proud that so many Hoosiers including Vice President Mike Pence, HHS Secretary Alex Azar, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, and CMS Administrator Seema Verma have been helping President Trump steer our country through these unprecedented times."
