Senator Braun supports McConnell decision to keep Senate in session


U.S. Senator Mike Braun released the following statement regarding Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's decision to cancel the March district work period so that Congress can address the coronavirus:

"As a Main Street entrepreneur, I know firsthand that when a crisis arrives you roll up your sleeves and work around the clock until the problem is solved and I support Leader Mitch McConnell's decision. While it's important that Congress moves quickly to help families and small business owners address the coronavirus, it also can't be rushed in such a manner that repeats the mistakes of previous corporate bailouts and failed stimulus packages."
