"Democrats' hypocrisy is on full display": Senator Braun on Pelosi sending Articles of Impeachment


Today, U.S. Senator Mike Braun (R-IN) released the following statement on Speaker Pelosi transmitting articles of impeachment to the Senate:

"Finally, Speaker Pelosi has decided to stop her senseless delay and deliver the partisan articles of impeachment for a trial in the Senate. 

"President Trump will for the first time in this sham process have a chance to fully exonerate himself. Pelosi, Schumer and Schiff spent weeks in a failed attempt to control the Senate trial because they know their case is weak. 

"Now the Democrats' hypocrisy is on full display: they call for new witnesses they hope will strengthen their weak case, but seek to prevent President Trump from calling witnesses essential to his defense. Fair is fair: If we have witnesses, then President Trump should have the right to call Hunter Biden and his father Joe Biden regarding their involvement with a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch. 

"It's my hope that we have a fair and quick trial so that we can get back to work on delivering results for Hoosiers."
