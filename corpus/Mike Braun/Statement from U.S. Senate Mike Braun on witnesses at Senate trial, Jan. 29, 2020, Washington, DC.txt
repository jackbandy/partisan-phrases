Statement from U.S. Senate Mike Braun on witnesses at Senate trial


U.S. Senator Mike Braun (R-Indiana) made the following statement today:

"After watching the House cobble together a flimsy case and listening to all of the arguments from both sides, I do not believe we need additional testimony to prolong this trial.

"For those who agonize over hypothetical situations, let me tell you what the reality is: at this time Democrat Leader Chuck Schumer does not have the votes to call any witnesses, and if we go down that path it will be evenhanded.  While Democrats have their wish list, the first names I would call for are Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, because their activities in Ukraine are absolutely material to this case. 

"Nearly every Democrat has had their mind made up about removing Donald Trump before he took the oath of office, let's vote to convict or acquit and let the country move forward."
