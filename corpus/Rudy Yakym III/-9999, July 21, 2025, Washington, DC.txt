Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an outstanding American  success story, LeMaster Steel Erectors of Elkhart, Indiana, as they  celebrate their 50th anniversary in business.

Founded in 1975, LeMaster Steel Erectors began as a family-run  operation in Elkhart and has since grown into a regional leader in  steel erection, proudly serving not only Indiana but also throughout  the Midwest.

Over the past five decades, the company has completed countless high- quality metal building projects, as well as specialty installations,  demonstrating excellence and innovation at every turn.

LeMaster's growth is a testament to their hard work, skill, and  dedication to its workforce: expert supervisors, veteran foremen, and  hardworking crews whose craftsmanship and professionalism have earned  the respect of clients across Indiana and beyond.

Beyond their business success, LeMaster Steel Erectors has become a  pillar of the local economy. With offices in Elkhart and Noblesville,  they provide stable employment, support local suppliers, and are a  pillar in their communities.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating LeMaster Steel Erectors  on this remarkable milestone. For 50 years, they have built more than  steel structures; they've built the foundation of stronger communities  across Indiana. May they continue to have success across Indiana and  beyond for years to come.
