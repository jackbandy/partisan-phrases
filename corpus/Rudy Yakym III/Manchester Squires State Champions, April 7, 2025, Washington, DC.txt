https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689630/manchester-squires-state-champions


Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride to recognize  and congratulate the Manchester Squires on an extraordinary  achievement: winning the Class 2A basketball State championship this  past weekend.

This victory marks a historic milestone because it was the first  boys' basketball State championship title in the school's history.

The journey to a championship is never easy. It requires months, if  not years, of dedication, sacrifice, and relentless effort. The  championship win is not just about the trophy or the title. It is about  the countless hours of practice, the late nights and early mornings,  and the unwavering belief in one another.

It is about the community that stood behind them: the fans who filled  the stands, families who provided constant support, and coaches who  guided them every step of the way.

I especially congratulate Coach Henson for his leadership.

I also congratulate the players, specifically Gavin Betten and Ethan  Hendrix, who scored 21 points apiece. The players all made their  school, their families, and their entire community incredibly proud.

The encouragement of the families, fans, and support staff was  invaluable to this accomplishment. Their legacy as the first State  champions in Manchester boys' basketball history will inspire future  generations of Squires.

This victory is not just for the team, but for Wabash as a whole.  They should enjoy this moment. They have earned it. I congratulate them  once again.               South Bend Saint Joseph Huskies State Champions

Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the  South Bend Saint Joseph Huskies on their remarkable triumph in the  Class 3A State basketball championship this past weekend.

The Huskies made history with this win, the first-ever boys'  basketball State championship. Winning a State title is an achievement  that only a select few teams get to experience. Yet, for the Huskies,  this championship was even more meaningful as it came just 1 year after  the heartbreaking loss in last year's State championship.

Coming back just 1 year later, rising to the challenge, coming back,  and securing the ultimate victory speaks volumes about the character  and the commitment of this team.

The road to a championship is never guaranteed. It is earned through  hard work in the gym, trust in one another, and the ability to rise to  the occasion when it matters most. The Huskies did just that.

I congratulate Coach Eric Gaff for his leadership. I also  congratulate the players, whose determination and refusal to give up  have written a new chapter in Saint Joseph's history.

I saw the putback dunk made by Chase Konieczny.

The unwavering encouragement of the families, fans, and support staff  helped fuel this team.

The South Bend community celebrates this moment with the Huskies, and  their victory will serve as an inspiration for years to come.

I congratulate the Huskies. This is an accomplishment that will never  be forgotten.
