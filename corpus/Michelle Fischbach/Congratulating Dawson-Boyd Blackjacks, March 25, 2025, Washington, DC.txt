Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Dawson- Boyd Blackjacks on defeating the defending champs to claim their first- ever title 1A championship.

It has been 34 years since the Blackjacks have been to the State  tournament, and their hard work paid off. With what felt like the  entire town in Williams Arena, this game was a dream come true.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Blackjacks on their victory. They  have made all of their families, community, and the Seventh District  proud.              Congratulating Albany Huskies on Undefeated Season

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Albany  Huskies on their undefeated season, closing it out with a win over  Waseca in the Class 2A championship last weekend.

These players were unshakable, even when the score was tied up. They  knew their mission and executed, and they have made their families, the  Albany community, and the entire Seventh District proud.             Congratulating Alexandria Cardinals on Championship

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Alexandria  Cardinals basketball team on defeating Mankato East for their first- ever 3A Boys championship title.

The senior co-captains, Sam Hagstrom and Chase Thompson, were  especially excited, saying: ``It has been a fun ride,'' and, ``We ended  things with a bang and left our mark,'' after their big win.

This is a closely bonded group of young men, and their teamwork  certainly paid off.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Cardinals on their win and for making  their families, community, and the entire Seventh District proud.                   Congratulating West Central Area Knights

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the West Central  Area girls' basketball team, the Knights, on their first-ever State  championship in any sport for their school.

As the fourth seed in a season full of upsets, I know this was a  hard-fought victory. They should all be so proud of everything they  have accomplished this year. They have certainly made their families,  community, and the entire Seventh District proud.                          Congratulating Ron Mergen

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Ron Mergen on 37  years of service to the city of Paynesville.

A beloved and respected member of the community, unsurprisingly, last  year, he was voted Boss of the Year. I know his coworkers are sad to  see him go, but I also know he won't be a stranger. He has been named  the grand marshal of this year's Paynesville Town and Country Days  parade.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Ron so much for his service to the community and  congratulate him on a well-earned retirement.
