Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the  distinguished career of Mary Krinkie.

For 25 years, Mary has served as the vice president of government  relations at the Minnesota Hospital Association. She is widely regarded  as one of the most persuasive voices for Minnesota's healthcare systems  and patient care.

I have had the honor to work with her on various issues, both here in  Congress and in the Minnesota State Senate. Her dedication to the  healthcare community has left a permanent mark on Minnesota.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mary for her decades of service, and I wish her  a long, happy, and well-deserved retirement.                      Recognizing Richard ``Dick'' Pesek

I congratulate Dick Pesek of Taunton, Minnesota, who has been named  the Minnesota 2025 Cattleman of the Year. This honor is well-deserved  recognition for his decades of hard work, dedication to the livestock  industry, and deep commitment to his community.

We commend Mr. Pesek for upholding the best traditions of American  agriculture.              Recognizing Jilian Schoenfeld and Brayden VanDyke
