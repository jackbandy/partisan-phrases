Paying Respects to Senator Bruce Anderson


Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I am sad to say that I rise today to pay  respects to my friend, a colleague, a man I served with for many years  in the Minnesota legislature, and a kind and good man, Senator Bruce  Anderson.

He passed away unexpectedly leaving Minnesota and his family to mourn  the loss of a great man.

A Navy veteran of the Vietnam war, he was an advocate for veterans  and for rural communities and a man I was honored to serve with. He  will be deeply missed by so many of us, and I send my deepest  condolences to his family and all of those who knew him. I will keep  them all and him in my prayers.               extending sympathy to the welu family of milroy

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to extend my sympathy to the Welu  family of Milroy following the tragic loss of Melvin in a farming  accident.

Melvin was born and raised in Milroy, a third-generation farmer, a  lifelong active member of St. Michael's Catholic Church, and an amateur  historian. He loved his Milroy community, reviving the Milroy Fun Fest  and following the local sports teams closely.

He loved spending time with his children and taking his grandchildren  on tractor rides around the farm. He loved his wife, Bev, and their  Saturday night dates.

I send my deepest condolences to the Welu family as they navigate  through this difficult time. I will be keeping Melvin, his family, and  the community of Milroy in my prayers.
