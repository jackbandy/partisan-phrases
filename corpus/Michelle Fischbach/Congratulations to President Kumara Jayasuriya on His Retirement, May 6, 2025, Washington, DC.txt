Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Kumara  Jayasuriya on his remarkable tenure as the president of Southwest  Minnesota State University.

Under President Jayasuriya's leadership, SMSU thrived. In a period  where most Minnesota schools saw an enrollment drop, SMSU's rose by  nearly 20 percent.

Just last year, the university recorded its highest enrollment in 14  years, and I am incredibly grateful for what he has done to improve  higher education in western Minnesota and to protect the legacy of a  respected institution.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate President Jayasuriya on his retirement  and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors. It has been an  absolute pleasure to work with him to advance SMSU.
