Congratulating Ellen Lampton


Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ellen  Lampton of Perham on her National Service Honor award. This prestigious  award, presented by Helper Helper, is reserved for individuals who  embody the very best of civic responsibility.

Since 2022 alone, Ellen has dedicated over 1,000 hours of service  across nearly 300 separate volunteer commitments.

Whether she is volunteering at the Perham Living gift shop, assisting  with local bake sales, or spending countless hours calling bingo games  for residents, Ellen's presence is a constant source of joy and  stability.

Ellen's service goes far beyond mere numbers. It is defined by what  her neighbors describe as a spirit of generosity, leadership, and deep  compassion.

Mr. Speaker, as her colleagues at Perham Health and Perham Living can  attest, volunteers like Ellen are the heartbeat of our rural  communities. Her dedication reminds us all of the difference one person  can make when they lead with heart and faith.                           Honoring Dave Blanchard

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding  educator and mentor, Dave Blanchard, who was recently honored by the  Prairie Conference for 27 years of dedicated service to the Long  Prairie-Grey Eagle School community.

For nearly three decades, Dave has been the definition of stepping up  whenever needed. In addition to being a cornerstone of LPGE's English  department, he has served as a coach for football, volleyball, and  baseball, and as the National Honor Society and One Act Play adviser.

As the LPGE director recently noted, Dave's positive presence and  willingness to serve have made a lasting impact on generations of  students and staff. He is a reminder that the success of our school  depends not just on what happens in the classroom but on the selfless  dedication of those who support our students in every area of their  lives.                         Congratulating Brock Nelson

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Brock  Nelson from Warroad, Minnesota, on his selection to the 2026 U.S.  Olympic men's ice hockey team.

Throughout his career, Brock has defined himself through quiet  leadership  and an unwavering work ethic. Whether on the ice for the Avalanche or  representing the Stars and Stripes, he carries the spirit of the state  of hockey with him.

Mr. Speaker, the Nation, and especially the folks back home in  Warroad, are rooting for him. We look forward to watching him lead Team  USA to victory.
