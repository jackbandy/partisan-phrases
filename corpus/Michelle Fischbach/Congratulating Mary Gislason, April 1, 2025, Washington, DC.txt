Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Mary Gislason on  43 years of service to the people of Lyon County.

As a dispatcher for the sheriff's office, Mary provided crucial  support, connecting those in need with emergency responders. Mary's  colleagues praised her ability to remain calm despite the severity and  stress of the job.

After 43 years of serving the people, some of them on the worst day  of their lives, and being a lifeline to those in the field, I  congratulate Mary on a well-deserved retirement. I wish her the best as  she begins the next chapter of her life.                              Congratulating Dave Preisler

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Mr. Dave Preisler  on receiving the Minnesota Pork Board's Distinguished Service Award.

From a childhood in 4-H and FFA to a 28-year career in the pork  industry, Dave has dedicated his life to Minnesota agriculture. His  expertise, compassion, and ability to lead in times of crisis have  allowed him to leave a lasting impact on the industry and those who  rely on it.

I congratulate Dave on this tremendous honor. We are all grateful so  much for his service.
