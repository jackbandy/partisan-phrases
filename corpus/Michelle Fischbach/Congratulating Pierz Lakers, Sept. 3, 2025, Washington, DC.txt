Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Pierz Lakers  in winning the Minnesota Baseball Association's amateur State  championship.

The Lakers fought valiantly through the Class C tournament, defeating  the Le Sueur Braves 11-1 to win their first-ever State championship.

It is great to see the tradition of town ball alive and well in  Minnesota.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Pierz Lakers on their victory.
