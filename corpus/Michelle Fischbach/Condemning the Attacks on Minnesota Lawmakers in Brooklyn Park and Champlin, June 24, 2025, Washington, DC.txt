Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Comer for yielding me the  time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 519.

The events of June 14 were truly horrifying. Those events shocked  Minnesota, and they shocked the country.

We mourn the loss of Minnesota Speaker Melissa Hortman and her  husband, Mark. We pray for the swift recovery of my friend, Senator  John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette. I was honored to serve with both of  them in the Minnesota Legislature.

We are still processing this senseless act, and I stand with my  colleagues today as we say that there is no place for politically  motivated violence in this country.

These victims committed themselves to public service and believed  that they were working to make their State a better place. There is no  scenario in which that dedication to public service should have cost  them their lives.

We stand with John and Yvette and their family as they continue to  recover from the horrible attack.

I know that the friends and family of Mark and Melissa are proud of  the legacy they left, and they have left a strong legacy for all of us.  I hope their friends and family know that the Minnesota community is  here for them.

Finally, I thank the men and women of law enforcement who worked  tirelessly to apprehend this deranged killer and bring the episode to a  close.
