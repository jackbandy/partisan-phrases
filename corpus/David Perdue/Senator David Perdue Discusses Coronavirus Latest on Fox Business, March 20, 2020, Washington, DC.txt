Highlights:

Coronavirus Relief Package: "This is a big government solution versus a free market solution. There are several things we need to do here. We need to make sure that the employer and employee can maintain their relationship. We already passed two different phases of help -- one for the medical community and one for American families--and now we are looking at how to get the economy stabilized."

Necessary Next Steps: "I believe there are several things we need to do. Number one, we need to expand our testing, like South Korea. Second, we need to isolate the really at-risk population, like Australia. Third, we need to get out a vaccine. We were told if we did that we could turn this around fairly quickly."

Prevent Insolvency Crisis: "We've got to get through this interim period in the next 6 to 8 weeks and stabilize the relationship between our companies and our employees. We cannot let a temporary period of illiquidity cause an insolvency crisis."

Support To Small Business: "This bill that we're working on in the Senate, into the weekend, is so critical to stabilizing the immediate panic with small and mid-size businesses in regards to keeping the relationship with their employees."

Response To False Reports: "Over the last five years, I have had an outside professional manage my personal finances and I'm not involved in the day-to-day decisions. We've complied with all the rules of the Senate. If you look over the five-year period, you'll see I have a good record of obeying the rules."
