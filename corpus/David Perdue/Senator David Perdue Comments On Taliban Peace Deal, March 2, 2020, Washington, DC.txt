Senator David Perdue Comments On Taliban Peace Deal


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, today commented on the U.S.--Taliban peace deal that could lead to the phased-drawdown of American troops in Afghanistan.

"President Trump is serious about finding a peaceful conclusion to our military engagement in Afghanistan. While this agreement is an important first step toward peace, its ultimate success falls upon the Taliban upholding the commitments it has made to the United States, our allies, and the Afghan government. Our top priority remains ensuring Afghanistan is never again used as a haven for terrorist groups that seek to threaten the United States or our allies."
