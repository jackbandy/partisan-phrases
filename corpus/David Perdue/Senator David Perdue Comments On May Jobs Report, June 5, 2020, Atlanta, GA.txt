Senator David Perdue Comments On May Jobs Report


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA), a member of President Trump's Taskforce on Economic Recovery, comments on the May jobs report released this morning:

"It's encouraging to see so many Americans heading back to work," said Senator Perdue. "While we still have more work to do, it's clear that President Trump's strong action to support American workers and small businesses throughout the COVID-19 crisis paid off. Today's jobs report shows the U.S. economy added more than 2.5 million jobs in May and is growing stronger every day. This great news reaffirms that the Paycheck Protection Program is working and that we're making great strides to safely rebuild the economy as our country recovers from this crisis."
