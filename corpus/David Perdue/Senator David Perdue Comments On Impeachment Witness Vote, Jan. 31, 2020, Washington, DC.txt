Senator David Perdue Comments On Impeachment Witness Vote


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) today joined a majority of the U.S. Senate in opposing a motion to invite additional witnesses and evidence in the impeachment proceedings:

"The Founders were crystal clear: the U.S. Senate is charged to rule on articles of impeachment, not to continue the U.S. House's investigations. The burden of proof falls solely on the House Managers. After six days of presentation from both sides and 180 questions asked over two days from all U.S. Senators, it's clear House Democrats failed to make a compelling case for either article of impeachment. They based this entire impeachment on their own opinions about President Trump, without material facts. Furthermore, none of the evidence presented comes close to rising to the level of impeachment. Inviting new witnesses will not change the outcome of this trial whatsoever. It's not the Senate's job to clean up the illegitimate case presented by House Democrats. It's our job to adjudicate and get back to work for the American people."
