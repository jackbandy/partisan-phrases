Senator David Perdue: President Trump's First Term Will Be Defined By Economic Success


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) responds to President Donald J. Trump's third State of the Union address to the nation:

"While Democrats have spent the last three years investigating and denying the results of the 2016 election, President Trump has led the greatest economic turnaround in U.S. history. President Trump's first term will be defined by record low unemployment, over 7 million new jobs, and the highest middle-class income this country has seen. Right now, African-American, Asian-American, and Hispanic unemployment is the lowest ever measured. Two and a half million Americans have pulled themselves out of poverty since President Trump took office. We have new trade agreements with South Korea, Japan, Canada and Mexico, and China that will support our workers, farmers, and manufacturers. Americans from all walks of life are thriving because of this President's agenda, and we've only begun to see the results.

"Tonight, the President laid out an optimistic vision for our country that continues to build on the successes of the past three years. We will continue working together to find solutions for our country's biggest challenges: immigration, infrastructure, the opioid epidemic, the human trafficking crisis, and prescription drug pricing. I believe in the President's agenda, and I'm committed to helping him deliver even more results for Georgians and the American people."
