Senator David Perdue: Speaker Pelosi Is Wasting The American People's Time


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA), U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), and 22 other senators introduced a resolution demanding that the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives immediately transmit the two Articles of Impeachment against President Trump to the U.S. Senate.

"Speaker Pelosi is wasting the American people's time," said Senator Perdue. "Clearly, the sham impeachment process in the U.S. House of Representatives was nothing more than a partisan show trial. By refusing to send the articles of impeachment to the U.S. Senate, Speaker Pelosi is just playing more political games. President Trump deserves his day in court, and the Senate is fully prepared to conduct a fair trial and then get back to work for the American people."

This resolution criticizes Speaker Nancy Pelosi for claiming "the power to effectively veto a resolution passed by a duly elected majority of the House of Representatives" and notes that the refusal to forward the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is a "gross infringement on the constitutional authority of the Senate to try impeachment."
