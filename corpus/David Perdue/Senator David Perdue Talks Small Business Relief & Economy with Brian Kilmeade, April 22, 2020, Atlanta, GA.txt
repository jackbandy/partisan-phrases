Senator David Perdue Talks Small Business Relief & Economy with Brian Kilmeade


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) joined The Brian Kilmeade Show on FOX News Radio to discuss the Senate's passage of additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, plans to gradually reopen the economy, and the national debt crisis.

Highlights: 

Phased Approach: "There's a human cost to keeping the economy shut down long-term. Sooner or later, we're going to have to reopen this economy. We have to do it in measured ways. I think the President has laid out a phased approach that will allow us to find a balance without having a resurgence of this virus." 

Banks Stepping Up: "In 13 days, we had 5,000 banks approve $349 billion of loans to small businesses. About 1.6 million businesses have already been approved under the Paycheck Protection Program. This is a heroic thing that just happened."

Phase 3.5: "This bill is $484 billion, $310billion goes immediately into the Paycheck Protection Program. Many of those loans have already been approved, so that money will flow very quickly. I give a lot of credit to Steve Mnuchin and the Treasury Department for crafting this program."

Relief for Small Businesses: "We have 30 million small businesses in the country. Half of the people who work in America work for companies with 500 employees or fewer. We need to make sure that these people get this funding quickly. Time is of the essence."

Wake-Up Call on Debt Crisis: "We're adding almost $1.5 trillion to our federal debt. Sooner or later we're going to get to the point where we can't just throw money at problems like this. We have to use this crisis as a wake-up call that we need to save Social Security and Medicare, and fix mandatory spending, so we have the reserve and wherewithal to do what we just did."
