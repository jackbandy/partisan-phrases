Senators Perdue & Loeffler Update Georgians On Coronavirus Response


U.S. Senators David Perdue (R-GA) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) update Georgians on the government's coronavirus response and provide guidance for staying healthy and safe:

"President Trump and Vice President Pence are taking the coronavirus seriously and launched a Task Force to safeguard the health and safety of all Americans," said Senator Perdue. "In Atlanta, we're fortunate to have the best and brightest at the CDC working to prepare the country. My team and I will continue to stay in regular contact with the White House, Governor Kemp's team, and the CDC to ensure Georgians have all the information they need to stay safe."

"My number one priority is to protect the people of Georgia and keep them informed," said Senator Loeffler. "I am in close communication with the White House and the agencies coordinating our response, including the State Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Atlanta-based CDC. As a member of the Senate HELP Committee, I will continue to work with my colleagues to bring to bear the full expertise, weight and resources of the federal government to protect Georgians in the wake of this global outbreak."

As the situation has evolved, Perdue and Loeffler have attended regular congressional briefings led by the Coronavirus Task Force.
