Senator David Perdue: Jobs Report Shows PPP Is Working


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) joined Charles Payne on Fox New Channel's Cavuto Live to discuss the May jobs report, success of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), and the U.S. economy's rebound.

Highlights:

Encouraging Report: "I think the jobs report is very encouraging. We thought it might show as many as 8 million jobs lost and instead there were about 2.5 million new jobs created. The PPP is working. There's a pent-up demand out here, and I really think people want to get back to work."

Community Banks Are Heroes: "Community banks are the real heroes of the PPP. It took several months to get relief out there during the Great Recession. We passed a bipartisan bill in 2018 that saved community banks. Prior to that, Dodd-Frank killed 4,000 community banks. Now, we went from 800 SBA-approved lenders to well over 5,000 in a matter of a few weeks and they put out almost 5 million loans averaging $113,000."

Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility: "We may have to pump up the PPP program a little bit if we have some future need. We've extended the time that businesses can use it from 8 weeks to 24 weeks and the time to pay it back from 2 years to 5 years. It's much more flexible now."

Reopen The Economy: "People are ready to get this economy open, and we can do it if we protect the most vulnerable and follow the protocols that have been laid out and that our essential workers have been following all along."

Fiscal Responsibility: "The thing that separates Republicans from Democrats is the sense of fiscal responsibility. Even before COVID-19, we had $23 trillion of debt. We have well over a trillion dollar shortfall every year in our mandatory expenses. Our trust funds are in danger of becoming totally insolvent. These are responsibilities we need to be very careful with."
