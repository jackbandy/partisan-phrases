Senator David Perdue Stands For Life


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA), U.S. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), and colleagues introduced a bill to prevent the tax deductibility of abortions.

Currently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) categorizes abortion as "medical care" and allows taxpayers to include abortions as qualifying out-of-pocket medical expenses on their tax returns.

"It is absurd that current law allows tax deductions for abortion procedures," said Senator Perdue, a member of the Senate Pro-Life Caucus. "Ending this loophole is an important step toward promoting a culture that values life. As a father and grandfather, I believe every child is a blessing and will continue fighting to protect the unborn."

Specifically, the Abortion Is Not Healthcare Act would amend Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit abortion expenses from being considered as eligible for a medical expense deduction.
