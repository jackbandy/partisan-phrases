Senator David Perdue On U.S.-China Trade Agreement


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) applauds President Trump for signing the historic Phase One trade agreement between the United States and China:

"President Trump's trade strategy is clearly producing positive results. We already have new historic trade agreements with South Korea and Japan, as well as Mexico and Canada. Now, this Phase One agreement with China will help American workers, farmers, and businesses gain equal access to Chinese markets and will keep up momentum as further negotiations continue. I applaud the President for continuing to fight for a level playing field, and congratulate negotiators and leadership in both the U.S. and China on this progress. While there is much left to do, this is a very encouraging first step in rebalancing our trade relationship with China."
