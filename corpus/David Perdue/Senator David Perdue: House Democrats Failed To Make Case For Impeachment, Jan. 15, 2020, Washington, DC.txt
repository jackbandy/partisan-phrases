Senator David Perdue: House Democrats Failed To Make Case For Impeachment


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) comments on the U.S. House of Representatives formally sending Articles of Impeachment to the U.S. Senate:

"Democrats have politicized impeachment and denied President Trump his fundamental right to due process. It's clear Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives failed to make their case. While these two articles are totally illegitimate, Leader McConnell is prepared to conduct a fair trial in the U.S. Senate and get back to work for the American people. Ultimately, our goal is to handle this as quickly as possible. We cannot afford to waste another day dragging out this sham of a process."
