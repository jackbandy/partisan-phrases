Senator David Perdue Votes To Acquit President Trump


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) today voted to acquit President Trump and end the Senate impeachment trial:

"In America, we believe in the rule of law, due process, and innocent until proven guilty. Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives violated every single one of those precepts by using impeachment as a partisan political weapon, which Alexander Hamilton warned against. For Democrats, this impeachment process was never about finding the truth or protecting the republic. It was only about overturning the 2016 election and impacting the 2020 election. The United States Senate acquitted President Trump today because the two articles presented were illegitimate, inappropriate, and did not rise to the level of impeachment. Additionally, there was zero evidence of any wrongdoing. Even with 17 fact witnesses in the U.S. House, 193 videos of testimony, and over 28,000 pages of documents, the House Managers failed to make a compelling case for either article of impeachment. It's time to put this dark chapter behind us and get back to work to deliver even more results for the American people."
