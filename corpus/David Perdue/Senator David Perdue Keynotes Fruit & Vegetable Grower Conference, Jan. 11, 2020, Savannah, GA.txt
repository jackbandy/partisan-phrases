Senator David Perdue Keynotes Fruit & Vegetable Grower Conference


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) gave keynote remarks at the Southeast Regional Fruit and Vegetable Conference's 2020 Awards Breakfast in Savannah.

"The agriculture community is the backbone of this country," said Senator Perdue. "I'm proud of the work our fruit and vegetable growers do to feed America and the world. We're fortunate to have Georgians like Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue leading the way toward a safer, stronger, and more abundant agricultural industry. Senator Loeffler and I will continue working closely with Georgia's farmers and producers to ensure their voices are heard in the United States Senate."
