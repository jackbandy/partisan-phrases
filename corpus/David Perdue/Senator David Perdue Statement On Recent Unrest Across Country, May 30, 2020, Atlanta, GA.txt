Senator David Perdue Statement On Recent Unrest Across Country


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) issued the following statement regarding recent unrest in Atlanta, Georgia and cities across the country:

"Over the past few weeks, we've seen deeply disturbing events play out in our communities, from the killing of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia to George Floyd in Minnesota," said Senator Perdue. "These tragedies have shaken us to the core and require thorough investigations to get answers for the victims and their families. However, violence is never the solution and will not serve to heal our country. We cannot continue on this destructive path and I urge Georgians to pull together and rise above."
