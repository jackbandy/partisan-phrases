Senator David Perdue To Serve On President's Economic Task Force


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA), a former Fortune 500 CEO, today was selected as a member of President Trump's Congressional Economic Task Force. The Senator joins a number of bipartisan, bicameral congressional leaders who will provide direct counsel to President Trump on the re-opening of America in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.

"President Trump's agenda created the greatest economic turnaround in U.S. history. However, the COVID-19 crisis and the resulting shutdown of much of our country has taken a serious toll on our economy. Many Americans are not only worried about their health, but also whether they can keep their jobs, run their businesses, and provide for their families," said Senator Perdue. "Even while we are still fighting this virus, we need to begin thinking about how to reopen our economy. Going forward, our objective should be to find a balance between keeping people healthy while protecting jobs and the economy long-term. While still focused on protecting human life in this crisis, President Trump worked with Congress to enact and sign into law the CARES Act to provide a bridge for businesses to keep people employed. As a former business CEO, I'm humbled to be named to the Task Force and look forward to helping get us all back to work."

Senator Perdue is a political outsider who was involved in successful turnarounds of major American companies during his business career. Senator Perdue has been an advisor to President Trump and the White House in crafting and implementing policies that led to the U.S. economic turnaround prior to COVID-19.

As we purpose to reopen our economy, Senator Perdue will work to find a balance between fighting the virus and getting our economy going again.
