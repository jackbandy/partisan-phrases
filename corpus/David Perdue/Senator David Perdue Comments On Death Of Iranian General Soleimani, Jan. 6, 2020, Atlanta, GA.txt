Senator David Perdue Comments On Death Of Iranian General Soleimani


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA), a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, comments on the United States airstrike that killed General Qassem Soleimani, leader of Iran's Quds Force and a designated terrorist:

"President Trump has been clear that when American lives are threatened, he will not hesitate to act with strength. For decades, Iranian General Soleimani and his terrorist Quds Force have orchestrated the deaths of countless Americans, including the recent murder of an American in Iraq. After demonstrating restraint to Iran's persistent attacks, President Trump acted decisively to bring Soleimani to justice. The world is safer today thanks to the service members who carried out this mission."
