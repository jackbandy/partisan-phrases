Senator David Perdue: Iran War Powers Resolution Is Reckless, Dangerous


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA), a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, today opposed a dangerous War Powers Resolution that would hinder the United States' ability to counter threats from Iran:   

"With evolving threats across the world today, any Commander in Chief must have the latitude to defend the country, just like President Obama did. The original War Powers Resolution was designed to facilitate consultation with Congress. It was never intended to constrain the President's constitutional powers, as some are attempting to do now. Over the past year, Iran's nefarious aggression has known no bounds. In recent months, Iranian-backed militias murdered an American contractor, and Tehran launched ballistic missiles at American servicemembers. Now, at a time when tensions with Iran have never been higher, this shortsighted resolution serves only to embolden Iran and increase the likelihood of further attacks. Make no mistake: handcuffing President Trump's ability to defend our country from attack is not just reckless, it is downright dangerous."

Ahead of the final vote, Senator Perdue led an effort to amend the resolution and prevent any potential long-term impact on a U.S. President's ability to protect the country. Click here for text of the amendment.
