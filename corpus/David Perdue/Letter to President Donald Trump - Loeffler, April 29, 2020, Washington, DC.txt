Letter to President Donald Trump - Loeffler, Perdue, Graves Urge Trump to Provide Federal Emergency Resources Following Deadly Storm


We respectfully request that you declare a major disaster for the State of Georgia pursuant to your authority under the Stafford Act for the damage caused by the severe storms and tornadoes, particularly in the northwest part of our state, on April 12-13, 2020.   On April 22, 2020, Governor Brian Kemp submitted a formal request for a disaster declaration and for individual assistance to be made available under the Stafford Act. We urge you to act quickly in granting this disaster declaration. The state suffered eight fatalities as a result of at least twenty-one tornadoes as well as severe property damage to more than 750 homes, including more than 500 in Catoosa, Dade, and Murray counties.   We commend the efforts of the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and local churches to support the more than 170 people displaced by the storms. However, this event was particularly damaging considering our state resources are already challenged by the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic and the other recent disasters our state has suffered. These additional circumstances will further harm our ability to recover from these disasters and underscores the need for federal individual assistance to those who have been affected by this event.   Thank you for your consideration of this request and for your leadership of our country during this challenging time. We stand ready to support and assist in your efforts to help our citizens recover from this disaster in our state.
