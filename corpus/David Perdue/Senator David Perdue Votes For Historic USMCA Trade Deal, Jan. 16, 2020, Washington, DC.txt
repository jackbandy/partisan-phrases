Senator David Perdue Votes For Historic USMCA Trade Deal


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) comments on the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement passing the Senate by a vote of 89-10:

"Once again, President Trump is delivering on his promise to negotiate better trade deals and fight for American workers, farmers, and manufacturers. USMCA is a groundbreaking trade deal that will create nearly 180,000 new jobs and increase U.S. GDP by more than $68 billion. Not only will the USMCA continue our country's historic economic turnaround, but it will also give the Trump Administration negotiating power as they begin the second phase of trade talks with China. After more than a year of partisan delays in the U.S. House of Representatives, I'm proud the U.S. Senate was able help the President deliver this huge win for Georgia and the entire country."
