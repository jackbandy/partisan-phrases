Senator David Perdue Supports Improvements To FISA Process


U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) votes to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which is used to protect the homeland from terrorists and counter foreign intelligence activities on American soil:

"Today, the world is more dangerous than any time in my lifetime. America's intelligence professionals are on the front lines of our national security and work every day to protect the country from evolving threats at home and abroad. This bill includes significant updates to the FISA process that will improve accountability across our intelligence agencies and address the abuses seen during the 2016 election. It is critical that we balance the needs of our intelligence community, while preserving the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans."

Senator Perdue supported the Lee-Leahy amendment to the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act, which will better protect civil liberties in the FISA process. The amendment ensures additional protections for American citizens subjected to FISA court inquiries and that the government proves its case before a warrant for surveillance is approved.
