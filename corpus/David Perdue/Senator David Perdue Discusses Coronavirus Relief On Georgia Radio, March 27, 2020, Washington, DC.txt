Highlights: 

All About Employees: "This is not a stimulus bill; it's a relief bill. It's built around bridge loans to employers to help keep employees employed. This is all about employees."

Providing Liquidity: "We didn't want to kill the economy while we try to kill this virus. The only way to do that is to help businesses, small businesses in particular, keep their employees. This is certainly not a bailout. Most of this money will get paid back. We could not let a liquidity crisis turn into an insolvency crisis."

Striking The Right Balance: "This is serious. I want everybody to understand that. At the same time though, there's a balance we have to find between protecting those who are vulnerable, isolating and treating those who are sick, and protecting the economy."

Keeping Communities Healthy: "Americans need to take responsibility not just for ourselves, but for how we can impact those around us. You may have the virus and not have any symptoms at all, but you could infect somebody else where it could be serious. That's why we have to be responsible and practice social distancing."

Working Remotely: "We're all teleworking right now. My staff is working today; I'm working today, but we're doing it remotely. We should all be thanking the people who don't have that luxury -- delivery people, warehouse workers, grocery store workers, pharmacy workers, doctors and nurses, custodians in hospitals."
