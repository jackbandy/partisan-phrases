Wicker Votes for Coronavirus Relief Package


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today voted for bipartisan legislation to support American families, workers, and businesses through the economic fallout created by the coronavirus pandemic. The legislation is an update of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was introduced last week.

"This bipartisan legislation will bring urgently needed financial relief directly to the American people," Wicker said. "In order to help workers, we are providing assistance to prevent layoffs and keep businesses from shutting down. For those who have already lost their job, we are significantly increasing unemployment checks."

"This plan will also help contain the virus by supporting hospitals and giving Americans certainty as they comply with public health guidelines. The House of Representatives should act without delay, because the American people need support now."

As chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Wicker helped write the original CARES Act and negotiate the final package along with other congressional leaders and Trump administration officials.

Specifically, Wicker helped negotiate provisions to:

Provide loans to save the domestic airline industry, a critical component of the American economy that employs hundreds of thousands of people;Support other distressed businesses to prevent closures and keep millions of workers on private-sector payrolls; andSafeguard taxpayer dollars through oversight, transparency, and accountability.
