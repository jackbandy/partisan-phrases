Wicker Praises $6.72M Award for Expanded Coronavirus Testing in Mississippi


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today praised the award of $6,724,130 to 20 community health centers to support expanded coronavirus testing in Mississippi. Wicker has been a strong proponent for expanded testing to allow health-care professionals to diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients and allow non-infected residents to return to work.

"Reopening our economy does not mean ignoring the coronavirus. We can, and must, continue to be smart about the pandemic while getting back to work," Wicker said. "These grants will enable Mississippi's community health centers to expand testing for COVID-19, which will be necessary for our state to recover from this unprecedented public health challenge."
