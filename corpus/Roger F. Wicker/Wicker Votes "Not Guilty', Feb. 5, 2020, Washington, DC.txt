Wicker Votes "Not Guilty'


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today voted to acquit President Donald J. Trump on both articles of impeachment passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. Wicker issued the following statement:

"The founders of our nation gave Congress the power to remove a president from office in extreme circumstances, with overwhelming evidence, and with broad support. The House impeachment managers failed to meet this high standard in every respect."

"From the beginning, the effort to impeach President Trump was a partisan exercise with a predetermined outcome. The articles passed by the House did not allege a crime, let alone the "high crimes and misdemeanors' required by the Constitution. The House managers have contradicted themselves time and again by claiming their case is proved "beyond any doubt,' while simultaneously admitting their case is incomplete by requesting additional witnesses and evidence. With only unsubstantiated accusations of actions that do not constitute crimes, there is no reasonable argument for removing this duly-elected president from office."

"The events that brought us to this point are an indication of America's real and unfortunate political divisions. But today's vote is also a testament to the wisdom and endurance of our system of government. The checks and balances afforded to Congress cannot be abused for partisan gain or to deny the will of voters by overturning an election."

"I hope Americans can put this episode behind us, and that Congress can now return to the work of the people."
