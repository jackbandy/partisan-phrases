Wicker Celebrates Senate Passage of USMCA


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today released the following statement following Senate passage of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act, which defines the trade relationship between the three North American nations.

"Passing this agreement is a huge win for our nation's businesses, workers, and farmers," Wicker said. "Ratifying the USMCA paves the way for free and fair trade with our neighbors, supporting tens of billions of dollars in economic growth. This deal is a signature accomplishment for President Trump and this Congress."

USMCA is a much-needed update to the Clinton-era North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It was negotiated by President Donald Trump in 2018 and was recently approved by the U.S. House of Representatives after a significant delay. Now that the agreement has been approved by the Senate, the final text will go to the President's desk to be signed into law.
