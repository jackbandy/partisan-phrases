Air Carriers Accept $25 Billion in Payroll Assistance


U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today released the following statement after the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that most of the major passenger air carriers have agreed in concept to the payroll support section in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The CARES Act includes a total of $25 billion in payroll support for passenger air carriers to maintain employment and avoid job cuts. Wicker played a key role in drafting the section of the CARES Act that provides assistance to the airlines.   

"It is welcome news that most of the nation's largest passenger air carriers have indicated that they will accept the payroll assistance included in the CARES Act," said Wicker. "This assistance will help keep pilots, flight attendants, gate agents, and mechanics in their jobs during the tremendously difficult time for the air transportation industry, and it will provide vital relief until demand for air travel returns."

Final negotiations between individual airlines and the Department of the Treasury on the specific terms and conditions of the assistance are in process.
