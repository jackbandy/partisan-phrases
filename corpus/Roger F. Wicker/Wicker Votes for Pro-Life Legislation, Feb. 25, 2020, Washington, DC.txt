Wicker Votes for Pro-Life Legislation


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today voted for a pair of bills to advance pro-life protections. The Pain Capable Unborn Child Act would prohibit abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, when a child is able to feel pain. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would make it a crime for health care providers to kill or neglect an infant who survives an attempted abortion. Both bills failed to reach the 60-vote threshold required to advance legislation in the Senate.

"Unborn children who can feel pain should be protected, and children should be cared for after they are born," Wicker said. "These should not be controversial concepts. It is disappointing that Senate Democrats blocked two bills that reflect these widely shared values, which are backed by scientific evidence. I will continue to be an advocate for these and other pro-life bills to support the most vulnerable members of our society."
