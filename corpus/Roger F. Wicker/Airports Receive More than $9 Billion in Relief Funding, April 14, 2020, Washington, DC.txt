Airports Receive More than $9 Billion in Relief Funding


U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today released the following statement after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allocated more than $9 billion in airport assistance funding to facilities in every U.S. state and territory. This funding was made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020, which was recently signed into law by President Donald Trump. Wicker was responsible for negotiating many of the transportation-related provisions in the CARES Act legislation, including support for airports and air carriers.

"I am pleased that airports nationwide are receiving the help they need to weather the devastating effects of the coronavirus pandemic," Wicker said. "A strong air transportation industry is essential to our economy. Airports of all sizes can use these funds to maintain their employees, continue operations, and to remain ready to serve airlines and passengers."

The Commerce Committee exercises jurisdiction over the FAA.
