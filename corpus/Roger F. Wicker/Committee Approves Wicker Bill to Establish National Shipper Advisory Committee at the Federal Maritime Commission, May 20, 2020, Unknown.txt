Committee Approves Wicker Bill to Establish National Shipper Advisory Committee at the Federal Maritime Commission


U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today released the following statement after the committee approved S. 2894, the Federal Maritime Commission National Shipper Advisory Committee Act of 2019. The legislation would establish a committee to advise the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) on policies related to the competitiveness, reliability, integrity, and fairness of the international ocean freight delivery system.

"I am pleased that my legislation to establish a National Shipper Advisory Committee at the FMC is headed to the full Senate for consideration," said Wicker. "I was glad to work with Commissioner Rebecca Dye toward establishing this committee to ensure that our maritime transportation system remains competitive."

The FMC is an independent federal agency charged with ensuring a competitive and reliable international ocean transportation system to support the U.S. economy and protect the public from unfair and deceptive practices.

The Federal Maritime Commission National Shipper Advisory Committee Act would:

-Establish an advisory committee consisting of 24 members appointed by the FMC with expertise relating to the competitiveness, reliability, integrity, and fairness of the international ocean freight delivery system. Twelve members shall represent entities who import cargo to the United States using ocean common carriers.
