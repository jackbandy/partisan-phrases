Wicker Votes to Conclude Impeachment Trial


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today voted to conclude the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald J. Trump and move to closing arguments. A minority of Senators sought to extend the trial by calling witnesses and evidence not considered before the House of Representatives voted to impeach the President.

"The articles of impeachment passed by the House do not allege a crime or any offense that warrants the removal of a duly-elected president," Wicker said. "We have heard arguments from both sides through a fair process. It is now time to conclude this trial and get back to work for the American people."

During the trial, Senators have received more than 28,000 pages of documents from the House investigation, seen 192 video clips of 13 different witnesses, heard 48 hours of arguments, and questioned the House managers and the President's defense attorneys for 16 hours.
