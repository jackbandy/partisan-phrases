Wicker Statement on Death of Qasem Soleimani


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today issued the following statement after the U.S. Department of Defense confirmed the death of Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force:

"Qasem Soleimani was a terrorist responsible for attacks that killed hundreds of American troops in Iraq and caused chaos across the Middle East. The President's action makes clear the United States will not tolerate attacks against our nation, such as the Iranian-organized assault against our embassy in Baghdad this week. Yesterday's successful operation also demonstrated the skill and power of America's men and women in uniform. I am grateful for their commitment and service."
