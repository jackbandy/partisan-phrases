You can read a transcript of his remarks as delivered below.

Hello, I'm U.S. Senator Roger Wicker.

Tonight President Trump presented a strong message of growth and opportunity for Americans.

Over the past three years, we've supported American workers by cutting taxes and creating new jobs. We're investing in the future workforce, and promoting development in areas that need it. We've unleashed America's energy production potential and rolled back scores of unnecessary regulations. Unemployment rates are near record lows and wages continue to grow.

Just last week, I was at the White House when the President signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. This signature accomplishment promises to boost trade with our largest trading partners and support billions of dollars in economic growth. It is a signal of better trade deals yet to come.

And let's not forget that we are rebuilding our military and we've transformed our nation's courts for a generation.

It's time to move on and get back to work for the American people.
