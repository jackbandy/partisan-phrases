Wicker Statement on U.S.-China Trade Agreement


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today released the following statement after the U.S. and China signed a "Phase One" trade agreement that includes significant reforms to the two nations' trade relationship.

"The first phase of President Trump's trade deal with China is a big step forward for commerce between our nations. Our farmers can expect fewer barriers to exports, and our businesses have won important protections for their intellectual property. I hope we can continue to build on this progress," Wicker said.

Among other reforms, the agreement includes provisions to end the forced transfer of American intellectual property and remove structural barriers that have limited U.S. food and agricultural exports to China.

 As a part of the new agreement, China has pledged to increase imports of American goods and services by at least $200 billion, including between $40 and $50 billion in American agricultural goods each year for two years.
