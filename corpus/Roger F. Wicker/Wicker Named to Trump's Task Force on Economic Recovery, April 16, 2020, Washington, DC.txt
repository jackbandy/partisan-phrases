Wicker Named to Trump's Task Force on Economic Recovery


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today was named as a member of President Donald J. Trump's task force on economic recovery. The task force, comprised of members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, will provide counsel to the President as he works to re-open America in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.

"I am grateful for the opportunity to advise the President on policies to get Americans back to work," Wicker said. "President Trump's bold actions to slow the spread of the coronavirus are working and have saved countless lives. Now we need to plan how to re-open the economy without sacrificing the hard-fought gains we have made against the virus. I look forward to working toward this important goal with my colleagues on the task force."

Wicker serves as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
