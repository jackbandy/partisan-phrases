Wicker Votes for FISA Reauthorization


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today issued the following statement after voting in favor of the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act, which includes provisions to reform and extend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for three years.

"At a time of increasing threats to our nation, giving our security services the tools they need to keep us safe is of paramount importance. I am glad the Senate has acted in a bipartisan fashion to pass legislation that will extend the FISA program and make important reforms to ensure American citizens' civil liberties are protected. Further lapses in this critical program would be extremely dangerous for our national security. I hope the House can pass this legislation without delay."
