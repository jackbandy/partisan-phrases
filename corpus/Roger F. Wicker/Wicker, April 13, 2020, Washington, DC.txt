Wicker, Hyde-Smith Laud $108 Million Special Ops Contract to Gulfport Shipbuilder


U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today lauded the award of a $108 million defense contract to United States Marine, Inc. (USMI) of Gulfport to produce vessels for the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).

"This is excellent news for the talented craftsmen at USMI," Wicker said. "This Mississippi-based company has grown to be one of the premier suppliers of special warfare boats to our nation's military, and the Combatant Craft Assault continues that legacy. Mississippians can be proud of their contributions to our national security."

"This contract is very good news for the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  United States Marine, Inc. has earned a solid reputation in support of our national defense, and this award will allow it to continue that important mission," Hyde-Smith said.

USMI will use the five-year, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contact to build combatant craft assault vessels to support the USSOCOM missions around the world.

USMI Chief Executive Office Barry Dreyfus, Jr., indicated the contract would allow the company to retain and possibly expand its workforce.

"USMI looks forward to continuing our work on behalf of the warfighter and we appreciate the confidence the United States Special Operations Command continues to have in us.  We are also proud to work with the tremendous members and Staff of the Mississippi delegation.  They are instrumental in ensuring that our military has what it needs and that the defense industrial base in Mississippi is protected.  We appreciate their leadership in these uncertain times," Dreyfus said.
