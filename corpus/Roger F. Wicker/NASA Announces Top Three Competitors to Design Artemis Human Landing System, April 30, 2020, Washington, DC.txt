NASA Announces Top Three Competitors to Design Artemis Human Landing System


U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today released the following statement after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced the selection of three from among five bidders to study and design the Artemis Human Landing System (HLS). These U.S. companies will produce a design, mission concept, and plan for the Artemis HLS, two of which NASA will eventually select for production.

"The Apollo Program was possible only because of public investments in spacefaring technologies," said Wicker. "Making good use of commercial partnerships lowers the long-term cost of space exploration, and it allows the American aerospace industry to do what it does best -- innovate. These competitors' designs will play a major role in producing a brand-new human lander that will enable our astronauts to access important areas of the Moon's surface and sustain our nation's deep space exploration efforts."

In November 2019, the NASA Authorization Act was reported favorably by the Committee. The bill broadly supports and authorizes funding for NASA's Artemis program and a commercial services acquisition strategy for lunar landers.  

The Commerce Committee exercises jurisdiction over NASA.
