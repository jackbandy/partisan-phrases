Wicker Votes for Funding to Fight Coronavirus


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today voted for a supplemental funding package requested by President Donald J. Trump to combat the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. The legislation will provide additional resources at the federal, state, and local levels to prepare for a potential outbreak in the United States. The bill will also support the expedited approval and production of effective tests, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19.

"President Trump and Congress are working with health professionals on necessary precautions to contain the spread of the coronavirus and minimize the risks to our country," Wicker said. "The additional resources the Senate approved today will boost the effective measures already in place to help keep the American people healthy and safe."

The funding package includes a provision championed by Wicker to waive restrictions on telehealth for Medicare beneficiaries. This measure will allow older Americans to receive the care they need at home without additional burdens or risks.
