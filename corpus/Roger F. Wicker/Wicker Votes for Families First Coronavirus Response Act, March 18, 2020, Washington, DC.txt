Wicker Votes for Families First Coronavirus Response Act


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today voted for H.R. 6201, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. The legislation will support families, workers, and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Americans are in the midst of an economic crisis through no fault of their own," Wicker said. "This emergency legislation was written in close consultation with small businesses to provide the support workers, parents, and employers need now. President Trump is right in asking Congress to pass this bill because the coronavirus pandemic is a once in a lifetime crisis that requires an extraordinary response. I am working with my colleagues in the Senate to craft the next phase of relief to get our economy back on track."

H.R. 6201 was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and will now go to the President to be signed into law.

The Senate is expected to consider another economic relief package to provide additional support to businesses and individuals affected by the coronavirus.
