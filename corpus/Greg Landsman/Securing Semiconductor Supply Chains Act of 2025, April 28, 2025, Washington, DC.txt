Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act of 2025


Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Pallone for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, the Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act, as has  been said, is a very straightforward, commonsense bill. It will help  strengthen our domestic semiconductor industry and grow U.S.  manufacturing.

Semiconductors are the foundation of modern technology and core to  our national security. They power everything from our cell phones,  laptops, cars, medical devices, and critical infrastructure. They are  key to the way in which we live our lives, and they are, in fact, very  important in terms of national security.

The more we can build these semiconductors here the better. That  means we don't rely on other countries.

What this bill does is it directs the Department of Commerce to work  with State economic development agencies to better understand how to  attract not just American investment but foreign investment into  America's semiconductor industry.

It will help identify the gaps, barriers, and opportunities to bring  these new investments and then inform Congress so that we can boost  investments from our allies and partners.

There is way too much uncertainty in our economy right now. This bill  is smart, bipartisan, and a good way to protect and grow our supply  chains.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
