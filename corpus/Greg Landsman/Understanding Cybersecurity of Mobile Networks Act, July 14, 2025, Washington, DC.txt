Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Latta)  and Mr. Pallone.

This is, I think, a really important bipartisan piece of legislation.  It is a very simple and straightforward bill. It is simpler than the  name itself. H.R. 1709, the Understanding Cybersecurity of Mobile  Networks Act, is a mouthful, but the bill is really quite simple, as  Mr. Latta and Mr. Pallone described.

We have foreign adversaries like Russia and China that are attempting  to get our data. There have been breaches, including our own personal  data and personal devices, and so the goal of this bill is to require  an interagency group to build out all the information we need to ensure  that we understand where all of our vulnerabilities are and that we are  dealing with those vulnerabilities--where are the gaps, how our foreign  adversaries are accessing data, how could they be accessing our data,  and how to further our ability to stop our enemies from attacking our  individual devices.

This is an important step toward understanding and improving our  cybersecurity for the safety and protection of all Americans. It passed  overwhelmingly in the Energy and Commerce Committee. This is a  bipartisan bill. I thank the staff on both sides of the Energy and  Commerce Committee, Republican and Democratic, for helping us put this  together.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support it today.
