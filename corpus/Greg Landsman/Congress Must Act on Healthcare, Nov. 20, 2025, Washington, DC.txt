Congress Must Act on Healthcare


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697053/congress-must-act-on-healthcare


Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for a vote on the  extension of the Affordable Care Act subsidies that help 22 million  Americans afford their healthcare.

As you all know, they expire at the end of the year. If Congress does  nothing, costs will skyrocket, and people will lose their healthcare.

In my district alone, 32,000 people will see their costs skyrocket,  and 14,000 people will lose their healthcare entirely. This means that  people will be unable to afford their medicine, kids will miss critical  treatment, and people with serious conditions will lose access to care  overnight.

There is still no commitment from the Speaker to extend these credits  and no plan to prevent the healthcare crisis we know is coming.

There is a bipartisan effort and bipartisan support to extend these  credits, and I urge my colleagues to join these efforts in getting this  done and getting it done now.
