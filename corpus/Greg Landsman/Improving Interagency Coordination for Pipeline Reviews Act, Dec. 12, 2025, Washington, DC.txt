Improving Interagency Coordination for Pipeline Reviews Act


Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding  time.

Mr. Speaker, it is simple. The bill weakens States' rights and their  ability to manage clean water. It essentially says: Look, we will send  these pipelines through our communities and through our States. We  don't want to hear anything from these communities. We don't want them  to raise objections, even if it is around the quality of water and the  quality of air.

It is also true that it doesn't fundamentally address the larger  issue, or a big issue, of the rising costs of energy and the impact  that the global trade wars that this administration has pursued has had  on the rising costs of utility bills.

For this reason, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill back to committee. If the House rules had permitted,  I would have offered an amendment to this bill, requiring the  Department of Energy to tell the American people in a report how this  administration's illegal tariffs, these trade wars, have raised prices  on electricity and gas.

The Joint Economic Committee estimates that families have already  paid $1,200 more this year because of the tariffs. The tariffs and the  trade wars have jacked up prices, and that includes energy prices. We  need accountability. The American people deserve to know how much this  is costing them so that they can push on us to end these trade wars and  the high cost of living, including energy costs.

Mr. SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Ohio?

Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in  voting for the motion to recommit.

Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.

Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
