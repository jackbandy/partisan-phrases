Making It Harder for U.S. Citizens to Vote

Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the House just voted  on the SAVE America Act, which will make it harder for tens of millions  of Americans to vote, not noncitizens. Noncitizens can't vote. They  can't register to vote. If they do, they will be deported.

American citizens are being denied their right to vote by requiring,  in this bill, all kinds of paperwork to register, all kinds of  paperwork to vote.

Three examples: For married women, there are 70 million women with an  ID that does not match their birth certificate. It will be harder for  them to register to vote. Seniors, especially those who have been  voting by mail, it will be harder for them to vote. College students  and those who serve our country abroad would have to come home in order  to register to vote.

This is a terrible, un-American, undemocratic, honestly insane bill  that the Senate should not take up.
