Cuts to Healthcare and Food Assistance


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692006/cuts-to-healthcare-and-food-assistance


Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my constituents  and the thousands of folks that have called our office begging Congress  not to cut their healthcare or their food assistance all to pay for tax  cuts for the wealthy.

One of the calls came from a single mother who just moved to  Cincinnati to escape domestic violence. She is raising a daughter with  disabilities and relies on Medicaid and food assistance. She relies on  both to survive.

There is a 62-year-old woman on a fixed income. Food assistance is  the only way she has enough food.

These stories matter because Trump and congressional Republicans are  pushing this bill that cuts $300 billion from food assistance and over  $1 trillion from healthcare. Mr. Speaker, 16 million Americans will  lose their healthcare. Why? To pay for tax cuts for the superwealthy  and big corporate investors.

It is a terrible bill. It is deeply unpopular. It will cost people  their lives. Kill the bill. Save Americans.
