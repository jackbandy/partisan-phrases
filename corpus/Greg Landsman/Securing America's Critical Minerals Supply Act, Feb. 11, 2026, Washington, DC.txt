Securing America's Critical Minerals Supply Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699995/securing-americas-critical-minerals-supply-act


Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, America has become unaffordable for so  many Americans. Many families, if not most families, are now struggling  to pay their bills, including their electric bills. Congress should be  focused entirely on lowering costs.

The bill does not do that, unfortunately. It is not about securing  critical minerals. It gives the Department of Energy broad, open-ended,  authority that this administration has already used to roll back  environmental protections, cancel energy projects, and drive costs up.

The bill would be a win for coal and natural gas, not American  ratepayers. For this reason, at the appropriate time, I will offer a  motion to recommit this bill back to committee. If the House rules  permitted, I would have offered that motion with an important  amendment.

My amendment is straightforward. The bill would not take effect until  at least the Secretary of Energy certifies that the tariffs imposed  after January 20 are not increasing costs and not disrupting the supply  chain for critical minerals while, unfortunately, they, of course, are  doing both those things.

Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the motion  to recommit.

Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.

Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
