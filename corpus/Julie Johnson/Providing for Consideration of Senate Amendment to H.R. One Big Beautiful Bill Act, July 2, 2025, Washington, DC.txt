Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to this  debate, and I am struck by the appalling ability of the Members of the  other side who are so afraid of this President. They are willing to lie  to the American people because they fear the tweet of a President more  than they fear the wrath of the voters at the ballot box. This will  come home to roost because 17 million people are going to lose their  healthcare.

In Texas, we are one of the largest creators of clean energy jobs.  Texas is the energy State. I am proud to be an energy State. We have  vast amounts of oil and gas jobs, but we also are the largest creator  of clean energy jobs. We will lose millions of jobs in our State  because Republicans of this delegation are going to vote for this bill.

In response to Representative Nehls, I am a proud graduate of the  University of Texas. I think Texas A&M and our elite University of  Texas deserve to have the funding in our universities.

With this bill, we must vote it down. I condemn the Republicans in  the State of Texas who are going to harm our State with their support  of this bill.
