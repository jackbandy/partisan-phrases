Jeffrey Epstein's Abuse

Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, for decades, Jeffrey Epstein's  abuse was an open secret powerful people knew. Agencies knew. Some in  government knew. Yet, year after year, he continued to operate in  trafficking, exploiting, and destroying the lives of children and young  women.

This was not only sexual violence. There were financial crimes.  Epstein's empire was built on money, blackmail, and connections, and  those connections reached into the highest halls of power.

What makes this scandal unbearable is not just Epstein's evil but the  way institutions, Republican and Democratic administrations alike,  looked away. No administration, past or present, has fully stepped up  to bring the truth to light. The very agencies charged with protecting  the vulnerable, instead, protected the powerful.

Now, under Donald Trump, that coverup has gone from negligence to  active obstruction. Trump promised to release the files. He promised  the American people transparency. Instead, he and his handpicked  lieutenants have buried the truth under a mountain of lies and  contradictions.

Let's review the record. In June of 2024, Trump said he would  declassify the Epstein files. His campaign even celebrated that promise  online. On January 30, Trump's FBI Director, Kash Patel, vowed to  release everything. On February 21, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the  client list was literally on her desk. As of today, none of that has  materialized.

However, when Bondi told Trump in May that his own name appeared in  those files, everything changed. Suddenly, the files were too dangerous  to release. Then the Department of Justice claimed there was no client  list at all. Trump went from promising full transparency to calling the  files boring, then a hoax, then a dead issue. This is not transparency.  This is a coverup.

Madam Speaker, when leaders abuse their office to shield predators,  that is corruption of the highest order. When hundreds of survivors are  denied justice to protect one man's reputation, that is a crime against  the very idea of democracy.

The majority often speaks about morality. We are told about  protecting children, about being pro-life, and standing up against  human trafficking. So I ask my colleagues on the other side: Where is  the outrage now? Where is that moral clarity when the lives of  trafficked and abused girls demand your courage?

This is not about partisanship. This is about whether the United  States Congress will side with survivors or with abusers. Will we  protect the powerful or will we protect the powerless?

Trump threatens Republican Members who demand justice in this matter.  Like Epstein survivors, the majority are now terrorized by men in power  to stay silent. I know that many aspects of this criminally corrupt  scandal are horrible to look at and think about, but we don't have to  be divided. Together, we can be the solution and send a message that we  will not let this happen again.

Here is my demand: Release the files, every name, every deposition,  every page, unredacted, except to protect the survivors. No more  excuses. No more delays, and no more hiding.

Madam Speaker, sunlight is the oldest disinfectant. It is the only  way to end the rot of corruption that let Epstein thrive, and it is the  only way to give survivors the justice they deserve.

Right now, there is a bipartisan effort in this House to force a vote  on releasing the files. We need only two more Republicans to join us,  two Members who believe their oath to the truth is stronger than their  loyalty to Donald Trump. We need two Members who are willing to live up  to the words they so often speak about morality, family, and protecting  children.

Let me say this: Americans are divided on so much today, but on this  demand for justice, transparency, and accountability, we are united.  Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Americans across every community  want this coverup to end. At a time when our country desperately needs  something to unite around, this could be it.

The American people have waited long enough. The survivors have  waited long enough. If our justice system means anything, it must mean  justice for the vulnerable human beings that powerful men thought they  could use and throw away. No more secrecy, no more corruption, no more  protection for predators.

Madam Speaker, history will remember what we do in this moment. Here  is the truth: If we in Congress cannot unify to defy the most well- connected predator of our time, what good are we?
