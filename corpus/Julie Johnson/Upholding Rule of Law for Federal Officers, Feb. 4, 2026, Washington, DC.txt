Upholding Rule of Law for Federal Officers

Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the  Qualified Immunity Accountability Act because no one is above the law  or the Constitution.

Across this country, we are witnessing a dangerous pattern: Federal  law enforcement officers--specifically, ICE agents--operating with near  total impunity. We have seen constitutional rights violated, and we  have seen communities terrorized. We have seen American citizens harmed  and, tragically, killed without meaningful accountability and reform.

Time and again, the Department of Homeland Security has failed to act  or rein in its agents. That is not how we uphold the rule of law in  this country.

Qualified immunity protects government officials, including police  officers, from being held liable in civil lawsuits. Qualified immunity  was meant to be a good faith protection to protect good faith officers  from frivolous lawsuits, but that is not how it functions today. In  practice, qualified immunity has become a get-out-of-jail-free card, a  legal shield that blocks accountability even when an officer violates  someone's constitutional rights or uses excessive force when none was  needed. I know this because, as an attorney, I have tried these exact  cases in court.

My bill changes that. The Qualified Immunity Accountability Act  lowers the standard for prosecution so Federal law enforcement officers  can be held accountable when they violate an individual's civil rights.  It makes clear that no Federal agent, ICE included, is above the  Constitution, and when rights are violated, there will be real  consequences.

This bill simply reaffirms what is in the Constitution. It protects  law enforcement who act in good faith, while ensuring that those who  abuse their power cannot hide behind a doctrine that was never intended  to excuse misconduct.

Accountability strengthens public safety. It builds trust between  communities and police. Proper accountability does not weaken this.  There are so many brave law enforcement officers who do their jobs and  serve their communities with honor and distinction. Unfortunately, we  have had some bad apples who are spoiling the bunch, and in doing so,  are actually making it unsafe for law enforcement to do their jobs.

Across the country, ICE agents have conducted raids without warrants,  detained U.S. citizens, used excessive force, and torn families apart,  often with little oversight and no consequences. Communities are left  traumatized, afraid to report crimes, afraid to seek medical care, and  afraid to leave their homes to live their daily lives. This is not  public safety. This is government-sanctioned fear.

When an agency can violate the Constitution and face no  accountability at all, that agency is not enforcing the law, it is  undermining it. The Constitution guarantees due process. It guarantees  equal protection. It guarantees freedom from unreasonable searches and  seizures. Those rights are not optional, and they are not  discretionary. They are not suggestions. They do not disappear because  someone wears a badge.

This bill sends a simple message. If you violate someone's civil  rights, you will be held accountable, no matter who you are.

I originally submitted this bill as an amendment to the ICE funding  bill that was voted on yesterday, but Republicans in this House refused  to have any amendments on this important issue even considered.

It is clear that they want to continue to give Kristi Noem and Donald  Trump the green light to continue terrorizing our communities and have  untrained ICE agents run rogue, killing American citizens.

This is not how trust is rebuilt. This is not how we restore faith in  the rule of law. This is not how we honor the oath that every public  servant takes to support and defend the Constitution.

Justice can never be conditional, and accountability can never be  optional.

I urge my colleagues to support the Qualified Immunity Accountability  Act, pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, and stand on the  side of the Constitution, the rule of law, and the basic principle that  justice must apply equally to everyone.
