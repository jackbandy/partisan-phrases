Sounding the Alarm on A Crisis Threatening America's Future

Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound an alarm on  a crisis threatening America's future. I am talking about the Trump  brain drain.

Donald Trump and Republicans in this House are launching a full scale  assault on our Nation's ability to think, learn, and to innovate.

Let's look at the facts. Trump's budget cuts funding for the National  Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, STEM education, and  even basic K-12 public schools. He has tried to crush public service  loan forgiveness and gut Head Start, all while trying to give tax  breaks to those who don't need them.

This isn't cost savings. It is self-sabotage.

In Dallas, we are home to UT Southwestern Medical Center, one of the  top research institutions in this country. We have innovators, world- class hospitals, biotech startups, and students  ready to change the world. They can't do that when Federal research  funding is drying up and educational support is being pulled out from  under them.

Dallas ISD alone has over 150,000 students, many from middle-class  families. Cuts to programs like Head Start, Title I, and after-school  STEM enrichment don't just hurt, they derail students' futures.

Texas colleges and universities share one of the largest enrollments  compared to almost any other State. Yet, under Trump's budget, millions  of them would lose access to workstudy jobs and to affordable student  loans. That is not just an educational crisis, it is an economic time  bomb attacking our workforce development.

This country has long been a magnet for global talent. Engineers,  scientists, and doctors come here to help build our future, but Trump's  anti-immigrant crusade is scaring them off. Whether it is blocking  student visas, slashing green cards, or denying people their due  process, he is slamming the door on the very people who fuel our  economy.

Dr. Kseniia Petrova, a brilliant Harvard scientist whose research  could lead to breakthroughs in early cancer detection, was charged with  a felony by the Trump administration for failing to declare preserved  frog samples at customs, which is normally a very minor infraction  handled by a mere warning.

Instead, she is locked up in an ICE detention center in Louisiana,  facing possible deportation to Russia. This isn't just cruel, it sends  a chilling message to scientists and international students around the  world: Come to America, and you may be imprisoned instead of empowered.

Then there is Ardem Patapoutian, who came to the U.S. from war-torn  Lebanon at 18. He worked nights delivering pizza to become eligible for  the University of California. Years later, with the help of an NIH  research grant, he launched a lab making groundbreaking discoveries on  how humans sense touch and went on to win the Nobel Prize in 2021.

However, thanks to Trump's cuts to science funding, his Federal grant  has been frozen. Just like that, China offered to fund his lab for the  next 20 years in any city, any university, anywhere he wants. China is  winning this war.

That is what countries like China are doing. They are investing in  students, in science, and in research because they want to win the  future while Trump wants to only tweet about the past and harm American  innovation.

We should be doubling down on education and innovation. We should be  building labs and funding scholarships, not building walls.

Here is the truth: You don't make America great again by making  Americans dumber. You don't build up the economy by draining it of  talent and opportunity. This is not just about spreadsheets and budget  lines. It is about real people: students trying to become the first in  their family to graduate, young scientists working on the next  breakthrough, and teachers trying to give every child a chance.

Trump's budget doesn't just threaten programs. It threatens progress.  We must fight back.

Let's protect our students, support our researchers, and defend the  right for everyone to dream big and achieve greatness in the United  States of America.
