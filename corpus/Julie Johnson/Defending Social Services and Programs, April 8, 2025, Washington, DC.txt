Defending Social Services and Programs


Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding and hosting this important Special Order hour on a topic that  impacts many of my constituents in north Texas.

Since day one, the Trump administration has targeted essential social  services that make government unreliable for all Americans: veterans,  people with disabilities, seniors, and our children. All of these  people and more rely on government to survive and all President Trump  wants to do is cut, cut, and cut.

Let's call it what it is: It is a full on assault of the most  essential lifelines millions of Americans count on, especially Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. They are right in the crosshairs of  this administration.

The Trump administration and Republicans in this House are pushing  cuts to the programs that Texans rely on every day. These aren't just  numbers in a budget; they are difference between stability and  catastrophe for hundreds of thousands of my constituents.

In Texas alone, more than 4 million people rely on Medicaid for  healthcare, including half of the children in our State. Let me remind  you, this is a State of 32 million people. Half of the children in our  State rely on Medicaid, one out of every two kids in Texas.

When Trump proposes gutting it, he is not just slashing spending, he  is taking away critical healthcare from children, from seniors in  nursing homes, and people with disabilities who depend on it to  survive.

Today, in the Capitol, one of my dear friends is here visiting who  runs a hospice company. They provide dignity of care to people at the  end of their life. They provide necessary comfort for families as they  are trying to deal with these situations. End of life care is the most  expensive part of our healthcare system. Companies like hospice  companies provide a necessary but much more affordable access to the  end of life with dignity for families, and they rely on Medicaid. They  rely on Medicare to stay in business to help families and so many  people in need.

We still have to talk about Social Security. Over 4 million Texans,  retirees, veterans, widows, and people with disabilities rely on Social  Security to keep the lights on, keep food on the table, and pay their  bills. It is not a luxury; it is a promise this country made to working  people. If you pay in, you can retire with dignity, but Trump's budget  says otherwise.

He is talking about entitlement reform. That is Washington speak for  cuts. Cuts that would hit rural communities, communities of color, and  low-income seniors the hardest.

Let me be crystal clear: Texas already ranks 43rd in the Nation in  access to healthcare. It is a statistic I am not proud of from my  State. We lead  the Nation in uninsured adults. We also lead the Nation in maternal  mortality and infant mortality, two statistics the Republicans in our  State should be embarrassed of.

Now, Trump and Republicans want to make it worse. It is cruel, it is  reckless, and it is dead wrong.

This isn't about balancing a budget; it is about priorities. Donald  Trump's priorities are tax breaks for his buddies while working  families are told to tighten their belts. We should be expanding care,  not slashing it. We should be protecting retirement security, not  playing games with the futures of people who worked their entire lives.

Texas families are watching and we will not let this administration  destroy the programs that protect our health, our security, and our  basic dignity. I urge my colleagues, especially my Republican  colleagues, you represent the same people I do, hardworking folks  trying to make ends meet, trying to provide a life for their kids.

If you went to your townhalls, you would see people standing up,  speaking out. They don't want this. The people in this country don't  want this. My message to you is that Democrats are standing up. We are  doing everything we can to protect you, your family, and your kids in  the right for safety, justice, and your right to pursue the American  Dream.

Mr. Speaker, Texans and all Americans deserve better.
