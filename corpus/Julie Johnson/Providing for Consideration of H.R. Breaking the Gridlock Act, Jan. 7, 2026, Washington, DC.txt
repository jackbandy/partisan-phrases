Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  this legislation to extend the Affordable Care Act and the tax credits.

In my district alone, nearly 100,000 people rely on these tax credits  to afford coverage, and because Republicans let them expire, many of  them are starting off the year without access to care.

I hear from families all across north Texas every day begging for  help. One constituent in Dallas, a small business owner with a child  who has type 1 diabetes, told me plainly: ``I need these tax credits so  my baby can survive.''

This is life or death for so many families in our communities. Yet,  Republicans have refused to extend these tax credits, making healthcare  unaffordable for millions of people.

I refuse to accept Republicans governing in the currency of cruelty.  It is critical that we restore these credits and put the money back in  the pockets of the people who need it the most.

I urge every Member of this body, Democrat and Republican alike, to  support this bill and stand up for the American people. We deserve  better. I will never stop fighting to protect the basic necessities  that every family needs to survive.
