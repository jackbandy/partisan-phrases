Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  Department of Homeland Security funding bill. I cannot support funding  for a Department that has shown repeated disregard for the  Constitution, the rule of law, and the safety of the people it is  supposed to protect.

Mr. Speaker, I remind the American people and this body: Every Member  of Congress has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution. That means  all aspects of it--the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the  rights of due process, and the rights of unwarranted search and  seizure. Yet, we are failing at this moment because ICE is terrorizing  the American people and violating constitutional rights every single  day.

We have seen ICE agents and the Department of Homeland Security  detain and arrest American citizens without any justification, enter  homes without warrants, use excessive force when it wasn't required,  and ignore constitutional rights.

They are even weaponizing children in this country, kidnapping them  from schools and using them as weapons against their parents. It is  morally wrong, outrageous, and not who we are as a common people.

This is a Department that is out of control, going rogue, and needs  to be reined in. These are not isolated incidents. They are the result  of unchecked power and a complete lack of accountability.

Last night, I offered commonsense amendments to impose basic  constitutional guardrails: accountability for abuse, due process  protections, and civil recourse when rights are violated. Republicans  refused to even consider them.

Without these amendments, this bill gives DHS and ICE free rein to  operate unchecked and unaccountable while Republicans in this body  continue to look the other way.

The American people deserve better. They deserve safety without fear,  enforcement without lawlessness, and a government that follows the  Constitution.

Mr. Speaker, until the Department of Homeland Security is willing to  operate within the rule of law, I cannot  support continued funding without meaningful reform. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no.''
