Supporting Healthcare Apprenticeships

Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce the  introduction of my bipartisan Fast Track Healthcare Apprenticeships  Act, alongside my friend, Congressman  Mike Kennedy from Utah.

Across the country, and especially in Texas, families are feeling the  strain of a healthcare system that simply does not have enough trained  professionals. Longer wait times, higher costs, and fewer options for  care are symptoms of a workforce that is stretched far beyond its  limits.

Our bill takes a commonsense approach to address the shortage. It  streamlines and modernizes the healthcare apprenticeship approval  process, requiring Federal and State labor agencies to act on the  application within 45 days, and directs the Department of Labor to  digitize and update  the apprenticeship agreement forms to make them more accessible.

These changes will help aspiring health workers get trained faster  and step into good-paying, stable jobs. It will reduce barriers for  employers, strengthen our workforce pipeline, and expand access to care  in communities that desperately need it.

Our bipartisan bill supports workers and providers and helps ensure  that every family can rely on a healthcare system that is accessible,  affordable, and built to meet their needs.

I urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill.
