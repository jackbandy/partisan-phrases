Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate Tracy Eubanks on his extraordinary leadership and decades  of experience to Metrocrest Services.

For more than 40 years, Metrocrest has been a lifeline for families  across Addison, Coppell, Carrollton, Farmers Branch, and Dallas,  providing food security, housing stability, workforce support, and  compassionate care in moments of crisis.

For the past 13 years, Tracy has guided this organization with  vision, integrity, and a deep commitment to uplifting every member of  our community.

Under Tracy's leadership, Metrocrest Services opened its new, state- of-the-art community center, an investment that will serve north Texas  families for generations. He has strengthened partnerships, expanded  critical programs, and ensured that every person who walked through  Metrocrest's doors was met with dignity and hope.

As Tracy prepares for his retirement in 2026, we honor not just his  accomplishments, but the countless lives he has touched. North Texas is  stronger, more resilient, and more compassionate because of his  service.

I thank Tracy for his leadership, his heart, and his unwavering  commitment to the people of our community.                           Honoring Pauline Medrano

Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor County  Treasurer Pauline Medrano for her extraordinary dedication to public  service in her newly elected role as president of the County  Treasurers' Association of Texas.

Treasurer Medrano has spent more than a decade in elected office,  always putting the people of Dallas County first. Her leadership has  helped to strengthen public institutions, increase transparency, and  build a culture of accountability and service that has positively  impacted countless residents.

Her election as president of the County Treasurers' Association of  Texas is a testament to the respect she has earned across our State. It  reflects her deep experience, her unwavering commitment to excellence,  and a belief that government works best when it works for everyone.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Treasurer Medrano for her years  of leadership, her community involvement, and her tireless dedication  to the people who she serves. Her willingness to answer the call of  public service embodies the very, very best of civic leadership.

I wish her the best of luck as she takes on this new role on behalf  of our community. I commend Treasurer Medrano for her invaluable  contributions to Dallas County and to the State of Texas.                                Brazen Payoff

Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the House voted last week on a  bill to reopen the government, but tucked away in the fine print of  that bill was something very disturbing and troubling: a very brazen  payoff of millions of taxpayer dollars that could quietly be  transferred to the personal bank accounts of eight Republican Senators.  These are Senators who may have had knowledge or even participated in  efforts to overturn the 2020 Presidential election.

At a time when Americans are struggling to get ahead, Republicans in  both the House and the Senate signed off on a deal that lines the  pockets of the very people who wrote it.

In every corner of my district, families are doing everything they  can to make ends meet. They are juggling rising grocery costs, higher  rents, and healthcare bills that seem to grow every single month. They  expect this Congress to meet the moment with integrity, responsibility,  and the basic respect for the people who we serve. What Republicans did  was an insult to every hardworking taxpayer who plays by the rules and  expects honesty from their government.

Republicans could have voted it down. They could have passed an  amendment to remove that provision from the bill. Despite being given  the opportunity to do so, House Republicans let it pass.

Now I am grateful that the House voted just last night to pass a bill  to take this away, but there is no guarantee that the Senate will  actually do that.

The American people deserve better than these corrupt, backroom  deals. They deserve better than legislation crafted to enrich the few  at the expense of the many, and they certainly deserve better than a  governing philosophy that treats cruelty as strength and corruption as  strategy.

The contrast before us could not be clearer.

On one side, we see a Republican majority operating in the currency  of cruelty and corruption, willing to hold working families hostage,  willing to cut healthcare, and willing to undermine transparency, all  to score political points and reward political friends.

On the other side, Democrats are fighting with courage and  compassion. We are fighting to protect the Affordable Care Act and to  keep healthcare accessible for millions of Americans. We are fighting  to lower costs for families and restore trust in a government that  should be working for the people.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject this  corrupt bargain and pass our bill that takes away this unethical and  corrupt payout and to stand with the families who sent us here. These  are families who deserve a government as honest, hardworking, and  committed as they are.
