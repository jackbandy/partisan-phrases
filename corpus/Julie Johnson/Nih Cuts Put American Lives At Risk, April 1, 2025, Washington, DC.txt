Nih Cuts Put American Lives At Risk


Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak out  against another outrageous move by Donald Trump: his attack on the  National Institutes of Health.

The NIH is not just another governmental agency, it is the foundation  of America's medical research. It funds lifesaving breakthroughs that  doctors and scientists rely on to treat and cure diseases. It supports  the work that helps us fight cancer, Alzheimer's, heart disease,  diabetes, and rare genetic disorders. It fuels innovation that leads to  better treatment, more effective medications, and new medical  technologies. Yet, Donald Trump and the Republicans in this building  want to gut it.

Trump has proposed slashing billions of dollars from the NIH budget,  which would cripple research, stall medical progress, and put American  lives at risk. These cuts would mean fewer clinical trials, new  treatments and advances in the fights against the diseases that impact  millions of Americans. Every person in this country, every patient  battling illness, every doctor searching for answers, and every family  hoping for a cure would feel the consequences of these disastrous cuts.

Let's be clear about what is at stake. The NIH funds over 300,000  researchers across the country, supporting studies that have led to  some of the most important medical breakthroughs in history. This  funding helped develop treatments that have increased cancer survival  rates, improved heart disease prevention, and even led to vaccines that  protect us from deadly viruses. It is responsible for nearly every  major medical advancement of the last century.

These cuts are not just numbers on a spreadsheet. They are a direct  threat to American lives and health. If Trump and Republicans succeed  in slashing NIH funding, it means that crucial research into diseases  like Parkinson's, ALS, and multiple sclerosis will be delayed or  abandoned altogether. It means that hospitals and research centers will  struggle to continue their work. It means that the next big  breakthrough, the next cure, the next lifesaving drug, the next medical  innovation that can save each one of our families and your family could  be lost forever.

For Texas, the consequences would be severe. In 2023 alone, the NIH  invested over $1.5 billion into Texas research institutions. This  funding supports critical work at UT Southwestern in Dallas, where  scientists are pioneering new cancer treatments; at Baylor College of  Medicine in Houston, where researchers are leading the fight against  Alzheimer's and heart disease; and at the University of Texas at Austin  and Texas A&M, where cutting-edge biomedical research is shaping the  future of medicine. If Trump's cuts go through, these institutions will  lose the funding they need to continue their vital work.

This attack on the NIH is part of a larger pattern. This is the same  Donald Trump leading an administration that rejects science. He is  threatening all of our health. He downplayed COVID-19, costing hundreds  of thousands of American lives. He ignored public health experts and  spread antiscience conspiracy theories while hospitals were overrun  with dying patients. Trump already tried to cut NIH funding before,  only to be stopped by a Democratic Congress. This time he is taking  direct aim at the very institution that helps doctors and scientists  find cures, save lives, and protect public health.

We cannot afford to let this happen. We must fight back. If we care  about our families, health, and future, we must reject these reckless  cuts and demand more funding for NIH, not less. The research being  conducted today will determine the treatments available tomorrow, and  the investment we make in science now will save lives for generations  to come.

This is not a partisan issue. Well, rather, it should not be a  partisan issue. Disease does not care whether you are a Republican or a  Democrat. Cancer doesn't check your voter registration. Alzheimer's  doesn't ask where you fall on the ideological spectrum. This is about  protecting the health of every single American.

I urge my colleagues in Congress and every American listening to  stand up for science, stand up for medical research, stand up for the  NIH. The health of all of our families could depend on it.
