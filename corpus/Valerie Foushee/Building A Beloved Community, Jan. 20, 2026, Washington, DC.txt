Building A Beloved Community

Mrs. FOUSHEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for organizing  this Special Order hour and for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in reflecting on the  life, legacy, and enduring moral leadership of the great Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr., whose vision of justice and equality continues to  shape our Nation's conscience.

Dr. King's work reminds us that progress in this country has never  been inevitable and that the rights and freedoms that we cherish have  always required vigilance, courage, and sustained commitment. Today,  that lesson is as urgent as ever. Across our country, communities are  feeling the weight of an administration that governs through extremism,  division, punishment, and exclusion.

We see it in attacks on our voting rights, in efforts to criminalize  protests, in targeting immigrants and asylum seekers, in the rollback  of civil rights protections, and in policies that deepen economic  inequality while shielding the powerful from accountability.

Dr. King did not believe justice was self-executed. He understood  that progress is never handed down. It is demanded. He warned us, as  you heard from our chairwoman, that our lives begin to end the day we  become silent about things that matter.

Silence, Mr. Speaker, is exactly what this moment does not allow.

Progress is never achieved without persistence, and justice is never  advanced without those willing to confront complacency and demand  accountability.

The Congressional Black Caucus will not be silent while families are  pushed deeper into poverty, while communities of color are targeted by  discriminatory policies, and while the promise of our democracy is  narrowed to serve the few instead of the many.

We refuse to accept the vision of America where cruelty is policy and  inequality is the goal. Instead, we stand in the tradition of Dr. King,  committed to dignity, equity, and justice for all. We will continue to  speak out, to act, and to fight until the promise of this Nation is  fully realized.
