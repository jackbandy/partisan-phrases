January 6 Attack


Mrs. FOUSHEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished leaders for this  opportunity.

Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago, our Nation witnessed an unthinkable assault  on American democracy when a violent crowd breached the U.S. Capitol  with one purpose: to overturn a lawful election and hold onto power by  force.

Law enforcement officers stood between that mob and the Constitution.  More than 140 brave officers were injured, and several lost their lives  defending this institution. Their courage deserves not just remembrance  but that we remain vigilant in upholding the rule of law.

The attack on January 6 was the result of a President who chose  division over truth, grievance over governance, and chaos over  accountability. That choice continues to threaten our democracy today,  as Donald Trump practices deliberate deception and escalating  extremism.

Democracy is fragile, and it demands our constant defense. It can  only survive when we act to protect it each and every day.
