Women Will Not Be Erased

Mrs. FOUSHEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Women's History  Month on this last day of March.

Every year during this month, we celebrate the countless  contributions that women have made throughout America's history. This  includes women of color, immigrant women, women with disabilities,  lesbian and trans women, and others, who have led the charge in pushing  America forward and advancing the ideals of equity and justice for all.

However, since Trump has taken office, women in my district and  across the country are being targeted by harmful orders and policies  and are feeling the direct impacts of this administration's extreme  actions.

Republicans also recently passed a budget which includes billions in  cuts for community projects in districts across the country, many of  which were intended for domestic violence shelters, youth community  centers, and childcare centers.

The same bill also directed that the Energy and Commerce Committee  make at least $880 billion in cuts. This would require deep cuts to  Medicaid specifically, which helps provide coverage for over 40 percent  of births in the United States.

This administration can try to erase the word ``women'' from  government, but it will not erase us.
