Good-Bye Michael Comer


Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, this week, we say good-bye to a longtime  member of Team Scalise, Michael Comer.

Before joining Team Scalise, Michael began his Hill career working  with the Education and Workforce Committee.

Michael has been a valuable member of my team for the past 7 years,  starting as my digital director before moving up to deputy  communications director.

From taking incredible videos and photos and designing eye-catching  graphics to teaching other Hill staffers how they can best produce  great content for Members of Congress, Michael's inspiring creativity  and work ethic have been a major contribution not only to my team but  to the entire Republican Conference as a whole.

As every Republican on Capitol Hill knows, Mr. Speaker, if you have a  question on how to use digital media equipment or just create something  that stands out, then you ask Michael Comer.

Many Members on the floor here today have taken pictures of his  slides during Conference or asked for a graphic or a video he put  together. He is an expert at conveying an important message in an  interesting, creative, and attention-grabbing way.

I appreciate everything he has done for my team and the House  Republican Conference. I know his experience and expertise will be a  major asset in his next chapter.

Mr. Speaker, I wish Michael Comer well, and I congratulate him.
