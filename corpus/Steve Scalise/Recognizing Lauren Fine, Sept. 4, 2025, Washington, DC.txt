https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694933/recognizing-lauren-fine


Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, this week, we say good-bye to a longtime  member of my staff, Lauren Fine.

Lauren began her career here on the Hill on the Senate side with  Senator Joni Ernst before coming over to the House and joining Team  Scalise, where she has worked with me for over the last 8 years.

Lauren started as my press secretary before serving as my  communications director for the last 6 years. I know many of you in the  press as well as communication staffers all over the Hill have gotten  to know Lauren well over these years.

Lauren has been an integral part of my team. No one knows what is  happening on the Hill or what the people are saying better than Lauren.  To say that she is plugged in would be an understatement.

From helping guide messaging on vital legislation and making sure  that the media is getting the real story to amplifying Members'  priorities and offering advice to aspiring communicators, I can  guarantee that almost all of your comms directors have worked with  Lauren at some point in time.

Lauren is the Hill's number one expert in communicating our  Republican message to the American people back home, as well as making  sure that the people's voice is always heard here in D.C. She has  served me as a trusted adviser and a dedicated conservative fighter.

I appreciate all of her hard work over the years for Team Scalise and  for the Republican Conference. While we are incredibly sad to see her  go, I know that her expertise and drive will make her shine in the next  chapter of her life where she will, once again, continue to thrive.

Mr. Speaker, we will miss her here, but I congratulate Lauren Fine  and wish her the best of luck in the next chapter of her life.
