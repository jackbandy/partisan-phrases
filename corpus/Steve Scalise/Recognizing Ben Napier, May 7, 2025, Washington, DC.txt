Recognizing Ben Napier

Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, this week, we say good-bye to a longtime  member of my staff and also a long-known face here on the floor of the  House, Ben Napier.

Ben started his career on the Rules Committee, and he has been a part  of Team Scalise for nearly a decade. Starting as floor assistant and  working his way all the way up to the position he serves today: floor  director of the House of Representatives for the last 6 years.

Nobody knows the ins and outs of floor procedure better than Ben, and  he is a trusted presence and a familiar face on the floor to all  Members. Ben has had a hand in every piece of legislation that has  crossed the floor in the last 9 years and has shepherded nearly every  House Republican through the process of getting bills to the floor.

Ben has been an integral part in setting and carrying out the House  agenda during our time in the majority and has overseen major  legislative wins, touching everything from tax reform to energy policy  to crypto modernization.

Ben has been a trusted adviser and a critical team player. His  departure will be felt by everyone on Capitol Hill, but I know he will  excel in his next chapter.

I thank Ben for his years of dedicated service to the Capitol family.

Thank you and congratulations, Ben.
