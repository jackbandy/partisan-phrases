Consequences of Delaying Coal Ash Cleanup

Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, in just 1 short year, our constituents have  already begun to suffer the consequences of the Trump administration's  agenda to undo lifesaving environmental protections.

The latest rollback is expected to target key parts of the EPA's 2015  and 2024 coal ash rules. Coal ash, a byproduct of coal combustion by  power  plants, contains hazardous heavy metals that if left unregulated can  pollute our land and our water.

The effects of these toxins on the human body include increased risk  of heart disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.

Certainly protections, like monitoring ground water and lining legacy  coal ash ponds to prevent contamination, are common sense, but these  requirements are at risk of being weakened. Delaying coal ash cleanup  puts public health in danger.

Make no mistake who those rollbacks are for: Polluters who would  rather poison ground water than pay a little bit more to protect the  public. We should be accelerating cleanup, not creating loopholes that  allow toxic waste to sit leaking and unregulated for years to come.

Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in speaking out against this  attack on the rules protecting us from coal ash.
