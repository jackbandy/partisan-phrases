Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the tremendous  contributions of Maggie Mancinelli-Cahill, Producing Artistic Director  of the Capital Repertory Theatre, as she retires from her storied  career bringing the joy of live theater to patrons across the capital  region and beyond.

Since 1995, Maggie has directed more than 125 productions, workshops,  and readings, helping to cement the repertory as a treasured  cornerstone of both the city of Albany and the wider theater community.  The warmth of her personality would always shine through as she  enthusiastically welcomed audiences at the start of so many shows.

Throughout her three decades at the repertory, Maggie nurtured local  artists and performers, while sharing her own illustrious talents and  creativity with a grateful audience.

Countless local organizations have recognized Maggie's abundance of  vision, resilience, and, yes, optimism. While the curtain is closing on  this act of Maggie's brilliant career, I know her theatrical artistry  will continue to inspire our community for years to come.

Bravo, Maggie, bravo. Congratulations.
