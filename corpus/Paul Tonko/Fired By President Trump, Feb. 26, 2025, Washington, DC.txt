Fired By President Trump


Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the story of a Federal  scientist who was fired by President Trump and Elon Musk.

In the employee's own words:

I was the quality manager for an FDA human and animal food       laboratory which tests foods for allergens, pesticides,       colors, and food additives, and microbial pathogens such as       E. coli and listeria. I was directly responsible for ensuring       that laboratory practices adhered to proper requirements.       Third-party lab accreditation provides confidence to the       public that testing is performed properly and results are       trustworthy.

Science, expertise, dedication, skill, and safety is what we lose  with these cruel and senseless firings.

They do not, as DOGE claims, boost efficiency. They remove the  experts who keep our communities safe. Without these public servants,  our health  and our well-being are at risk. I humbly respect our Federal workforce.
