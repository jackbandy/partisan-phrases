Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Abigail  Ross Hopper, who is retiring from her role as president and CEO of the  Solar Energy Industries Association.

For nearly a decade, Abby has led efforts to develop, to enact, and  defend policies to support solar energy and energy storage.

During this time, the solar industry has been massively successful.  Costs have come down dramatically. Some 250 gigawatts of installed  solar capacity nationwide now exist. That is enough to power 45 million  homes, making solar an important and rapidly growing part of our  electricity mix.

As of 2024, the industry employed 280,000 Americans across thousands  of companies including a recent boom in domestic manufacturing jobs.  One of the greatest developments over the past few years has been the  huge growth in American-made solar panels and components.

Thanks to policies championed by Abby and SEIA, the United States has  become the third largest solar module manufacturer in the world. While  I am saddened by Abby's departure, I am confident that because of her  leadership, the solar industry is well-positioned to continue playing a  leading role in delivering the affordable, reliable, and pollution-free  electricity that Americans are indeed counting on.
