Trump Immigration Policies

Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Takano for bringing us  together this evening for a very important discussion.

Kilmar, Andry, Jefferson, Kevin: a devoted father married to an  American citizen, a makeup artist who faced persecution in his home  country because he is gay, a man with a valid work authorization and  pending asylum hearing, and a son of a government worker attacked for  his opposition to a corrupt regime.

These are just a few of the hundreds of men who have been sent to a  foreign prison with conditions so inhumane that El Salvador's Justice  Minister has said that the only way out is in a coffin.

These men came to our country, in many cases through approved legal  pathways, seeking a better life for themselves and their families. In  response, we sent them to another country without any due process to be  abused and tortured, and we are paying that government $6 million to do  so.

These are not deportations, but they are government-enforced  disappearances. They are illegal. They are horrific. They are the  tactics of a dictatorship, not a democracy.

We cannot let them get away with this. This is the red line that they  cannot be allowed to cross.
