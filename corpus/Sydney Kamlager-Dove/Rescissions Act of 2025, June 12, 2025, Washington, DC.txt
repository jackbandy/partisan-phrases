Rescissions Act of 2025


Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  package. It is embarrassing. It is trifling. This is a funding package  that Republicans actually agreed to and voted on last Congress when  they were in the majority. Republicans must be missing Biden now  because they actually had more influence under him than under Trump.

Now, Republicans are going back on their own agreement and giving up  their own power with this package. The real question is, why show up  here if you have an orange daddy doing your work for you?

This vote actually puts every Republican on record as supporting  Elon's attack on democracy when even Steve Bannon said that Elon and  DOGE found no waste.

With this package, Republicans are one step closer to a country that  looks more like the adversaries we profess to oppose. Americans will be  left to clean up this mess, and we will have zero standing in the  international community and zero claim to global leadership while you  all have killed off Elmo.

I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this trash.
