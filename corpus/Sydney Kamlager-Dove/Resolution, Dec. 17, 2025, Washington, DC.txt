Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution  to stop the administration's illegal and ridiculous boat strikes. It is  hard to overstate how pointless and performative these strikes really  are.

The administration is trying to sell their military kill campaign by  saying they are targeting drug traffickers who are selling fentanyl and  hurting Americans.

Fact: Fentanyl and fentanyl precursors do not come to the United  States through Caribbean sea routes.

Fact: The drug boats that the administration is blowing up are mostly  carrying cocaine to Europe.

Fact: President Trump just pardoned a known Honduran cocaine kingpin.

Fact: Most smugglers that bring drugs into the country are U.S.  citizens.

Fact: The real national security threat is selling our AI chips to  China, not blowing up fishermen.

American taxpayers are spending millions of dollars to stop the  Europeans from partying. What is in it for us? Normalization of  extrajudicial killings, a total lack of due process, evidence, or  congressional authorization. We need to stop this madness.

I authorize and tell--just tell my colleagues to support this  resolution.
