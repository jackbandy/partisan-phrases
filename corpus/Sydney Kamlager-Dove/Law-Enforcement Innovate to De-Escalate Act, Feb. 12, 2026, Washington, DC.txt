Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to  H.R. 2189.

Let's get honest about what this bill does and doesn't do. It does  not require training. It does not set standards. It does not improve  accountability, and it does not apply only to law enforcement.

It does carve out a sweeping exemption in our Federal firearms laws  and makes it easier for dangerous people to access dangerous weapons  with fewer safeguards.

Supporters keep saying that this bill is about helping law  enforcement, but if that were true, the bill would mention law  enforcement. It doesn't. Law enforcement agencies already have the  ability to procure less-lethal tools and are already exempt from many  Federal firearm requirements.

Let's talk about who opposes this bill. It is opposed by Brady,  Everytown for Gun Safety, GIFFORDS, Newtown Action Alliance, Sandy Hook  Promise Action Fund, Jewish Women International, Catholics for Family  Peace Education and Research Initiative, Illinois Accountability  Initiative, Just Solutions, Legal Momentum, and the National Domestic  Violence Hotline.
