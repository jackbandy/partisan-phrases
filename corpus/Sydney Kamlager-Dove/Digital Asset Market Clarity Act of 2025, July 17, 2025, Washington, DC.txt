Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025

Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the so-called  CLARITY Act.

Let me be clear: I support the growth of digital assets, blockchain  innovation, and the promise that crypto holds for expanding financial  access and economic justice, but this bill is not clarity. It is  confusion cloaked in legislation. It picks winners and losers, and the  biggest winner is the President of the United States.

Why is that office exempt from all of the rules? It undermines the  SEC's ability to protect consumers and fast-tracks deregulatory  loopholes without addressing core issues like transparency, fraud  prevention, or equity and access. The SEC doesn't even like this bill.

We need comprehensive, thoughtful regulation, not rushed frameworks  driven by the people who will gain the most who ignore the voices of  everyday investors, builders, and communities left behind.

Crypto deserves rules that are smart, fair, and future-facing. The  CLARITY Act is none of these things because, if it was, Republicans  would have had the votes much earlier.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
