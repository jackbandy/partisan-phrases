Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Speaker, on October 7, my constituent, Vicente  Ventura Aguilar, was snatched off the street by Federal immigration  agents.

According to a friend who was detained alongside him, Vicente was  last seen on October 8 when he suffered a medical emergency and was  separated from the group to receive care. Today, he is nowhere to be  found. He has been missing for 8 weeks.

Homeland Security claims he was never in their custody despite  multiple credible eyewitnesses who say otherwise.

Mr. Speaker, Vicente has lived in the United States for 17 years. He  is not a criminal. He has a family that loves him and is now  desperately searching for answers about his well-being and whereabouts.  We should not have to chase down Homeland Security, call hospitals, or  even the morgue just to get them.

This is not about immigration status. This is about humanity. The  United States cannot simply disappear  people. If this can happen to Vicente Ventura Aguilar, it can happen to  anyone who calls this Nation home.

I demand answers on Vicente's disappearance, and I will not stop  until I get them.
