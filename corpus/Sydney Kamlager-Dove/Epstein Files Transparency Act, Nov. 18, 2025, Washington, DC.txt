Epstein Files Transparency Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696809/epstein-files-transparency-act


Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Speaker, one in three women and girls around  the world are physically and sexually assaulted each year. Of the 152  women in this body, that means 51 women. It includes your daughters,  your sisters, your nieces, your mothers.

With the Epstein files, we have a chance to change that. However,  real talk: The administration doesn't need a discharge petition. It has  not complied with the subpoena, and it has the power to release the  files today.

Instead, the man in the most powerful position in the world has used  the full weight of the government to block, obfuscate, and deflect the  full release of the files. It is the same person who intimidated female  Members of Congress to withdraw their names from the petition, who  responded ``Quiet, piggy'' to a female reporter who asked about the  files, and who nominated an alleged sexual predator to be our AG. It is  the same person whose name appears more than any other in the Epstein  emails.

In the pantheon of violence, a sexual predator is the worst of the  worst, so why protect him? It is also curious that the Judiciary  Committee is managing this debate and has not even had this come before  the committee. I wonder why. Release the files now.
