Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise a proud South Carolina State  University alumnus to congratulate its football team on their new  title, the 2025 HBCU national champions. The Bulldogs erased a 21-point  half-time deficit, scoring three touchdowns in the third quarter to win  the Cricket Celebration Bowl in a four-overtime thriller over Prairie  View A&M University. I offer my not-so-sincere apologies to my good  friend and colleague, Emanuel Cleaver.

The Bulldogs finished the season 10-3 and claimed their second  Celebration Bowl title and third appearance in the classic over the  past 5 years.

It was also a great honor for the city and county of Orangeburg. The  State of South Carolina showed its appreciation by flying the school's  flag over the Capitol dome yesterday as the Nation honored HBCU  graduate, Martin Luther King, Jr.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in  congratulating the South Carolina State University Bulldogs for their  exceptional season. This championship will be remembered not only for  the trophies earned and individual achievements but for the  sportsmanship of the Prairie View A&M Panthers.
