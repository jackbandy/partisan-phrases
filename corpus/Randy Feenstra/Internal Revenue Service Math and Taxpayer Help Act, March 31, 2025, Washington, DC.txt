Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, the IRS MATH  Act. I thank my friend from Illinois (Mr. Schneider) for working with  me on this commonsense legislation.

Mr. Speaker, if the IRS finds a mistake on a tax return, such as when  a taxpayer accidentally adds a zero to their reported income, the  agency should clearly indicate that error to the taxpayer and explain  why the refund is different than expected.

However, current notices do not explain or contain helpful  information, leaving millions of taxpayers confused about how and when  to rectify the issue with the IRS.

The IRS MATH Act ensures that the IRS clearly spells out errors on  tax forms and helps taxpayers not only understand the mistake but also  allows a challenge if they see fit.

Filing taxes is already burdensome and time consuming. We can improve  customer service by promoting open and transparent communication  between the IRS and the taxpayer when a tax error is identified.

Mr. Speaker, I will continue to work to simplify our tax filing  system and push for full reauthorization of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  so that our families, farmers, and small businesses can keep more of  their hard-earned money.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  thank Chairman Smith for allowing this bill to come to the floor.
