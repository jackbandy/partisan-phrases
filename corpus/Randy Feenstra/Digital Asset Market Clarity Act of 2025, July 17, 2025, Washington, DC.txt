Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thompson for bringing  this bill forward. It is an amazing bill.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the CLARITY Act. The  increasing adoption of digital assets and the use of blockchain  technologies can grow our economy and provide American families with a  new opportunity to grow wealth.

However, under President Biden, digital assets were attacked, which  crushed innovation and created uncertainty for businesses.

Fortunately, President Trump is working to make America the crypto  capital of the world. We want digital asset innovation to happen in  America and crypto jobs to be created in America without ceding ground  to foreign countries.

That is why we must pass the CLARITY Act, to spur innovation and  support economic growth by providing clear rules of the road for  digital assets in the United States.

This bill establishes clear roles for the SEC and CFTC, which  prevents agencies from overreach and confusion. It provides consumer  protections through greater transparency and accountability in the  marketplace. It fosters innovation by providing a pathway for digital  asset firms to operate legally and with confidence, encouraging digital  asset innovation to remain in the U.S. The CLARITY Act unlocks economic  growth, global competitiveness, and financial opportunity for all.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and put  America first in the race to lead the global digital asset marketplace  for our country.
