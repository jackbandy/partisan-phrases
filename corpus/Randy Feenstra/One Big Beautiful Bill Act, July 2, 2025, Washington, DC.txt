One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will  dramatically grow our economy and reduce our deficit. It is the largest  tax cut in American history for families, farmers, workers, and small  businesses.

This bill will help our Main Street businesses grow, invest, and  hire, and it will increase the exemption for the death tax, which will  help save 2 million family farms.

Additionally, this legislation formally funds the border wall, hires  more ICE and Border Patrol agents, and creates American energy  independence.

We must pass this bill to unleash economic growth and rural  prosperity. Let's make President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act the  law of the land.
