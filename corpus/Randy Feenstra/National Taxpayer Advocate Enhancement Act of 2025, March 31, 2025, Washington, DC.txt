Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, the National  Taxpayer Advocate Enhancement Act. I thank my colleague, the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Davis), for working with me on this initiative.

Since 2015, the IRS has prohibited the National Taxpayer Advocate  from hiring her own legal counsel, which undermines her ability to  provide insight, ensure fair treatment of taxpayers, and responsibly  work with the IRS caseworkers.

American taxpayers expect and deserve the best customer service and  case outcomes when filing their Federal taxes.

However, this outdated restriction on the National Taxpayer Advocate  prevents her from hiring the team she needs to do her job.

My bill clarifies it is within the purview of the National Taxpayer  Advocate to hire attorneys that report specifically to her. These  attorneys help conduct oversight, ensure taxpayers are being treated  fairly, and inform Congress of taxpayer challenges at the IRS.

This measure ensures we keep politics out of the IRS and solely focus  on outcomes for the taxpayer.

With this improvement, American families will benefit from fewer  headaches when dealing with the IRS and a more accountable government.

This bill itself is a recommendation from the National Taxpayer  Advocate Purple Book and has been a recommended policy change for quite  a few years.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith, again, for working with me to  make the IRS run smoother and to ensure taxpayers are being treated  fairly.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
