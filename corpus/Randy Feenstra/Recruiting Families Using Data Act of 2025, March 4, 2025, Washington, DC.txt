Recruiting Families Using Data Act of 2025


Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, as a father of four, I believe that every  child deserves a safe and loving home.

Unfortunately, many vulnerable children in our foster care system  lack a family that they can call their own due to the shortage of  foster families.

This must change, and that is what this bill does.

My bill, the Recruiting Families Using Data Act, would help States  uphold and strengthen their diligent recruitment plans by improving  their processes with concrete facts and information that identifies,  recruits, and retains qualified foster care homes.

If we are going to address the problems facing the foster care  system, we need better data on those that are having a problem. That is  why this bill is so important.

This legislation would also establish a family advisory board to  share best practices, highlight financial obstacles facing foster  families, and keep foster families at the center of the systematic  changes for improvement.

With the right tools and right resources, we can find a caring home  for every child in our foster care program. That is why this bill is so  important.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with me for foster  families, and support our children and vote for this wonderful bill.
