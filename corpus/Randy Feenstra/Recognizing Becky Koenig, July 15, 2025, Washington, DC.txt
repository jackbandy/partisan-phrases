Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Becky Koenig and  congratulate her on her retirement after nearly 40 years in education.

Since 1984, Becky has invested in the education of generations of  Iowans across the communities of Sumner, Forest City, Lake Park, and  Spencer. Her leadership and dedication to the classroom have left a  lasting impact on each student, teacher, and faculty member that has  had the pleasure of working, teaching, and learning alongside her.

In addition to teaching, Becky has spent 38 years as a speech coach,  guiding students in competition. As a head coach, she contributed to  Spencer High School's 50-year streak of sending at least one group to  the Iowa All-State Festival.

Outside of the classroom, Becky was known to be a tireless advocate  for her fellow educators and students, a true leader. As an  Instructional Mentor Coach, she formally mentored many teachers and  informally guided countless others with the years of experience and  wisdom she accrued.

Becky was one of those educators who had a lasting impact not just on  her students' education, but on their lives. Students from the past  still reach out to her to chat, grab lunch, and thank her for the role  she played in their formative years. She has inspired thousands of  Iowans with her work, leaving a legacy that colleagues will look fondly  back upon and future educators will look towards as a model for their  careers.

As she begins this next chapter in her life, I would like to thank  Becky for the incredible work she has done for the state of Iowa--and  our great Nation. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Becky  Koenig for a remarkable career and wishing her all the best in  retirement.
