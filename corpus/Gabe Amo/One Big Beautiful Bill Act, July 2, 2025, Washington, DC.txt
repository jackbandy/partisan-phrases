One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, budgets are a statement of values. Republicans  are showing they have none.

People will suffer. People will die. It will be at the hands of  Republicans who vote ``yes.''

The top 1 percent are salivating over getting an extra $300,000 a  year because of this dangerous bill. Billionaires win.

Mr. Speaker, 17 million Americans will lose their health insurance.  This is the largest healthcare cut ever.

Mr. Speaker, 42 million Americans are at risk of losing food  assistance. Children will go hungry.

Republicans claim to be the party of faith, patriotism, and families.  A ``yes'' vote supports none of these virtues.

This is shameful. I am a hell no.
