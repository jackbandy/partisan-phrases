Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of Spencer and Christine Lane  of Barrington, Rhode Island, whose lives were tragically taken on  January 29, 2025, in the midair collision that claimed 67 lives.

I have spoken with Doug Lane and other families who are mourning  their family members who passed away in this tragic incident. They  shared the pain that their families carry from this heartbreaking  event.

For years, there were warnings. Since 2008, the National  Transportation Safety Board has recommended requiring technology to  help pilots detect nearby aircraft in real time and avoid collisions.

The ROTOR Act finally acts on that recommendation by requiring  technology to help avoid collisions, aligning military and civilian  safety standards, strengthening coordination and closing dangerous gaps  in our aviation system. We must act now to make our skies safer.

For the Lane family, for the 67 lives lost and their families, for  every passenger and crew member in our skies, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
