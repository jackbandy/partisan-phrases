Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, today, alongside my partner in the Rhode Island  House delegation, Seth Magaziner, I rise to honor two students, Ella  Cook and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, whose lives were tragically ended in  the horrific mass shooting at Brown University this weekend. Nine other  students were injured in the shooting. Eight remain in the hospital.

Today, we hold in the light the victims, their families, Brown  University, and the broader Rhode Island communities.

I thank Mayor Brett Smiley of Providence, Governor Dan McKee, and  local leaders for their leadership in their ongoing response to this  senseless tragedy.

We are grateful to the first responders for their prompt action on  the scene and medical professionals for caring for the wounded.

As law enforcement continues their work, we thank them for their  efforts and wish them strength in their pursuit to bring to justice  whoever committed this horrific act.

For the extended Brown University, Providence and Rhode Island  communities, and everyone impacted around the country, we continue to  stand together and to heal and work together toward the safety we all  deserve.

I ask all of my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence.
