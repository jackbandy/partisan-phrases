Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions of  Rhode Island Manufacturers Association Executive Director David  Chenevert.

David is retiring after more than a decade, leaving our State's  leading manufacturing organization. For more than 40 years, David has  worked tirelessly to strengthen Rhode Island's manufacturing sector. He  hasn't just been the president. He has been a member. David built a  successful company providing precision components for multiple markets.

During his tenure at RIMA, he championed workforce development  through the expansion of career and technical education for our  students and helped countless small businesses transition to the  future.

At the height of COVID, he helped the Rhode Island Department of  Business Regulation create the pledge program to deliver personal  protective equipment to manufacturers so that they could remain open  and operate safely.

David's hard work and strategic vision leave a legacy of growth for  an essential part of Rhode Island's economy, our manufacturing  strength.

Mr. Speaker, we thank David for his efforts.
