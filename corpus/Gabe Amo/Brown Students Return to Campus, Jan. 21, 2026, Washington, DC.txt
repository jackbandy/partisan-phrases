Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, today, students returned to class at Brown  University to start a new semester after the mass shooting in December  that took the lives of Ella Cook and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov and  injured nine other students.

My thoughts remain with the victims, their loved ones, and our whole  community during what, I am sure, has been a difficult few days.

For the Brown students who returned to campus this week, I want them  to know we have their backs, and we are all thinking of them. If anyone  is struggling, they should reach out for help.

As Brown, Providence, and Rhode Island continue to heal, I join  countless others in making sure our community, our city, and our State  have all the support we need to recover. We are on a long journey, but  I know we are on it together.
