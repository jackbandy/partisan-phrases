Mr. AMO. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Connecticut for  yielding.

Donald Trump is breaking promises left and right to American workers.  His latest target is Revolution Wind. His stop work order is abusing  the definition of national security and hurting hundreds of union  workers in my home State of Rhode Island ready to finish this project  that is 80 percent complete.

We already have a permitting process that works. This amendment  perpetuates a false narrative that leaves thousands of family- sustaining union jobs at risk.

MR. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
