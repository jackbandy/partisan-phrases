Protect Head Start

Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, across the country, Head Start lives up to its  name. It provides quality early childhood education so that working- class families can get ahead. However, right now, Head Start is under  attack from Donald Trump and Republicans in this Chamber. They froze  program funds, closed regional offices, and forced mass layoffs of  those who administer Head Start. Worse still, Republican budget  proposals open the door to hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to  Head Start.

Recently, I visited a Head Start provider in Woonsocket, Rhode  Island, to hear from those who rely on the great program. I met with  Savanna, who told me that Head Start is how she provided her children  with safety, stability, and education after years of struggling. Head  Start helps families like Savanna's break the cycle of trauma,  fostering resilience and creating lasting change.

Mr. Speaker, let's choose a better path for our vulnerable neighbors.  Let's protect Head Start.
