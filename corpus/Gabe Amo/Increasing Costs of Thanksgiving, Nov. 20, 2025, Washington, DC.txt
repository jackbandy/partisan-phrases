Increasing Costs of Thanksgiving

Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, Thanksgiving is next week, and this year,  families are paying more because of the President.

The staple items for this classic American holiday cost, on average,  7 percent more than last year.

Take my favorite side, stuffing. A box of stuffing mix has soared by  double digits. The centerpiece of many tables, turkey, is up 7 percent.

It is not just Thanksgiving food. Grocery prices are up. Families of  four are spending more than $1,000 on groceries each month.

Americans simply cannot afford to live in Trump's economy--not my  constituents expecting their healthcare costs to more than double next  year, and not small business owners and consumers alike hit hard by  tariffs.

Americans are hurting because my colleagues across the aisle would  rather give tax breaks to billionaires than lower costs for working  families. Americans and their families deserve better.

Whether someone calls it stuffing or dressing, cranberry relish or  sauce, I will keep working for them to lower their costs and make life  affordable.
