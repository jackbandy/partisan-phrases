Snap Cuts in Rhode Island

Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, putting food on the table is about to get  exponentially harder thanks to the $187 billion Republicans cut from  SNAP in their big, ugly law.

These harmful cuts impact roughly 35,000 Rhode Islanders.

We saw the devastating consequences of SNAP uncertainty when  Republicans let funding for the program lapse during the government  shutdown. Demand at food pantries across my district shot up.

Thankfully, Rhode Islanders do what they always do and stepped up to  care for their neighbors. I have joined volunteers at the Mount Hope  Community Center in Providence, the ELISHA Project in Pawtucket, the  Milagros Project in Woonsocket, and St. Raymond's Church Food Pantry in  Providence.

I heard directly from Rhode Islanders about the pain of rising  grocery costs and their fears about losing SNAP.

Many will be working for months to recover from the hardship of just  1 month of late SNAP payments.
