Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, recently I was privileged to join members of  the United Steelworkers Local 1010 in Hammond, Indiana, to commemorate  Workers Memorial Day.

During the proceedings, I shared how when the steel and manufacturing  industries of northwest Indiana were beginning more than a century ago,  the workers labored in long hours and extremely dangerous conditions  and were regretfully considered expendable.

Today, through the power of collective bargaining, our workforce has  the ability to negotiate with management and enact workplace  protections that say we value labor and we value safety.

As a Federal legislator, I am committed to building on the progress  and am very concerned about proposals to cut back the ability of the  Department of Labor to implement Federal workplace protections. As a  member of the House Appropriations Committee, I will make every effort  to ensure that OSHA and the National Labor Relations Board have the  resources and direction they need to ensure that all  workers make it back home to their families and loved ones at the end  of the day.
