Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I recently had the privilege of sitting down  with a group of dedicated youth, who created and inspired the More  Action for Students organization in northwest Indiana.

I was greatly impressed with their knowledge of many important issues  and their sincere advocacy.

We discussed a variety of topics, including the significant cuts to  Federal Pell grants, the programs designed to help first-generation  college students.

They also shared their concern that Congress is not fulfilling its  constitutional responsibilities by allowing this administration to  rescind approved Federal funding for minority-serving institutions of  higher learning in Indiana's First Congressional District.

Since this administration is also rescinding Federal funds for  economic development projects that are approved and signed into law and  when the OMB is picking and choosing how appropriations laws are  implemented, they are right to be concerned.

This meeting has filled me with a renewed sense of optimism for the  days ahead, for it is clear that these young women and men are not  waiting for the future to arrive. They are shaping it. They labor to  build a society that is more just, more inclusive, and more responsive  to the needs of all people.

Let us take the inspiration from their dedication. The strength of  our Nation rests in the courage and the vision of its youth.
