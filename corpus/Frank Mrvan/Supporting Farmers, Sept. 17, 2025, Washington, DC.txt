Supporting Farmers

Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, when the cost of farming rises, it is not  just a challenge for our farmers, but it is a challenge to our Nation's  security because agriculture is the foundation of America's strength  and stability.

During the district work period, I visited the Herr Farm, a fifth- generation farm, and visited with the northwest Indiana farmers and  members of the Indiana Soybean Alliance and Indiana Corn Growers  Association.

At that time, they shared with me during harvest time their grave  concern for skyrocketing input costs, such as insecticides,  fertilizers, and nitrates. These rising costs of goods and services  driven by tariffs and the simultaneous loss of export markets caused by  those same tariffs are threatening our economic livelihood.

On top of this, challenges with access to workers through the H-2A  program leave them uncertain if they can sustain their operations at  all. These men and women feed our Nation and power our economy. Yet  today many do not know if they will be able to sustain their business  for tomorrow.

As we take up fiscal year 2026 appropriations and agriculture  legislation, I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to ensure all of our farmers get the support they need to  continue their essential work.
