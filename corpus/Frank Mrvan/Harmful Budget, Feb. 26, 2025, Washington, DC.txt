Harmful Budget


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688223/harmful-budget


Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my profound disappointment  in the House budget resolution and the severe potential harm it will  cause to those who rely on Medicaid benefits in northwest Indiana.

In Indiana's First Congressional District alone, it is a fact that  the overwhelming majority of Medicaid funding goes directly to senior  healthcare, individuals with disabilities, children, and senior long- term care.

Indiana is also one of the few trigger States in our Nation, which  means that Medicaid benefits will immediately cease for a large  percentage of our residents should the Federal proportion of assistance  fall below 90 percent.

I am a staunch supporter of creating efficiencies and eliminating  waste, fraud, and abuse. However, Mr. Speaker, make no mistake: Should  this legislative initiative be finalized, not only will benefits be  denied to those in need, but private health insurance costs will  skyrocket as hospitals seek to recoup that increased uncompensated care  from emergency room visits.

I will continue to speak out against and oppose all legislation that  takes real benefits from our seniors, the disabled, and our children to  pay for corporate welfare programs.
