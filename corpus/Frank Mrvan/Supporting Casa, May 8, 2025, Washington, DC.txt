Supporting Casa


Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the  Court-Appointed Special Advocates program, also known as the CASA  program, through the Department of Justice.

As a prior township trustee in northwest Indiana, I was involved in a  program that went into the schools to assist children who experienced  abuse and sexual harm. For survivors, having someone with CASA in their  corner became their lifeline through that painful experience.

A family friend became a survivor at just 4 years old. Today, as a  college student, she volunteers for CASA, driven by the advocates who  once stood by her. She is proof that hope creates change. She asked me  to fight.

It is a painful truth that the administration has moved to eliminate  funding for this critical program. As a member of the House  Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Justice, I  believe that our Nation's values and policies are shown by how we  direct funds. Turning our backs on children survivors in order to  justify massive tax cuts for the wealthy is both shameful and bad  policy.

Madam Speaker, I stand ready to work with all of my colleagues to  ensure that children and survivors in northwest Indiana and across our  Nation have access to resources and trusted advocates they need to lead  their best lives.
