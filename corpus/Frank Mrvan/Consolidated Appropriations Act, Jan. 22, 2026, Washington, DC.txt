Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for the time.

I rise today because I believe the Federal Government has a  responsibility to stand with all communities across northwest Indiana-- big cities, small towns, and neighborhoods--that are rolling up their  sleeves to rebuild and create work and wealth for their residents. I  want to thank the leaders, Chairman Cole and Ranking Member DeLauro and  the staff of the House Appropriations Committee for their hard work,  sacrifice, and also for including three community project funding  requests for Indiana's First Congressional District.

The funding for the Gary/Chicago International Airport is an  investment in jobs and economic growth for our region. The airport is a  vital economic hub for northwest Indiana. By expanding cargo  operations, attracting private investment, and supporting initiatives  pursued by the city of Gary and the State of Indiana, this funding will  help bring new businesses, create good-paying jobs, and open the door  to new passenger services for the residents.

I am also grateful for the HUD funding that will allow Gary and  Michigan City to tackle long-neglected vacant and unsafe properties.

This investment helps local leaders do what they already committed to  doing by clearing blight, stabilizing neighborhoods, and putting land  and buildings back to use. When we rebuild housing and commercial  corridors, we strengthen communities and restore local pride.

These are responsible investments that respect taxpayer dollars and  deliver real results for working families. I urge my colleagues to  support this measure.
