Protecting Federal Employee Unions

Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my profound  opposition and disappointment in the recent executive order that strips  away collective bargaining rights for Federal workers.

The foundation of the economic strength of Indiana's First  Congressional District is our labor workforce. It is only because of  the ability to collectively bargain and form unions that workers in our  Nation were able to make progress and have fair wages, safe working  environments, access to affordable healthcare plans, and secure  retirements.

I have spent my entire career as an elected official believing that  every worker should have the ability to form and join a union.

As a member of the Congressional Labor Caucus, I was proud to join my  colleagues in signing a letter to the administration on this matter  which states that this is the single most antiworker and anti-union  Presidential action since the firing of the striking air traffic  controllers in 1981.

I am committed to stand shoulder to shoulder with my colleagues to  swiftly reverse this unjust action and defend the fundamental rights of  every worker to bargain for an equitable future.
