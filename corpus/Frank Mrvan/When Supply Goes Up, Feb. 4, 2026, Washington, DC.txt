When Supply Goes Up, Prices Go Down


Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my deep frustration and  anger for the people of northwest Indiana's First Congressional  District as they open their heating bills that have skyrocketed this  winter.

Hoosiers understand that utility rates are regulated at the State  level, but they also understand, just as we do here, that Federal  policy plays a role in whether our Nation is increasing energy supply  or restricting it.

It is simple economics. When supply goes up, prices go down.  Unfortunately, recent actions by this administration have moved us in  the wrong direction.

In northwest Indiana, two major energy projects that would have  increased supply and lowered costs were canceled. An $8 billion  hydrogen project at the BP refinery in Whiting supported by labor,  industry, the State, higher education partners, and the Federal  Government were halted. An $18 million alternative aviation fuel  project in East Chicago was also canceled. These projects would have  strengthened our energy supply, created jobs, and supported our  regional economy for decades to come.

Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to find ways to increase the energy  supply so we can lower the costs in northwest Indiana.
