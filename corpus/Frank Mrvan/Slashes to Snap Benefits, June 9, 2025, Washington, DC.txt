Slashes to Snap Benefits

Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my profound  opposition to the unjust slashes to SNAP benefits included in the House  majority's reconciliation legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I have seen the tangible benefits of SNAP benefits in  northwest Indiana and how it is essential for many seniors, children,  and working families.

Throughout my career, I have worked to support all individuals when  they need emergency assistance, often through no fault of their own. I  also appreciate the longstanding relationship with the Food Bank of  Northwest Indiana and other organizations that are responsible for  distributing these essential food benefits.

These cuts are being pushed under the false pretense of targeting  waste, fraud, and abuse. If that were truly the case, they would be  part of the farm bill. Instead, this legislation rips food from the  tables of those in need to pay for tax breaks for the most wealthy.

I have seen the need firsthand: miles-long lines on 61st Avenue as  families wait for the food bank to open. My community is hurting, and  this cruel policy is a betrayal of our most vulnerable.

I urge my Senate colleagues to reject this harmful legislation.
