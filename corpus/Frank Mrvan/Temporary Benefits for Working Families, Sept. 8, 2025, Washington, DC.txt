Temporary Benefits for Working Families


Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I recently held community conversations  across Indiana's First Congressional District.

What I heard loud and clear was that families are struggling with  rising costs at the grocery store, skyrocketing utility bills, and  economic uncertainty that has been created by the chaos from this  administration.

My constituents know exactly that this economic pain and unfairness  stems from the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act. You can't fool  hardworking people. They see the truth as clear as day.

Yes, there are tax breaks on tips and overtime but only for 3 years.  This is at the same time that billionaires and those who can afford a  $1 million annual membership to Mar-a-Lago got tax breaks that are  permanent. Why is help for working families temporary but handouts for  the privileged permanent?

We won't be deceived. Communities in northwest Indiana are struggling  with increasing costs, and they know that the Republican bill is unfair  toward working families.

It is one of the many reasons that I opposed this unpopular  legislation and why I will continue to fight to make the current tax  benefits for working families permanent.
