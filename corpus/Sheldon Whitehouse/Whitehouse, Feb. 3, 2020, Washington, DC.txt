Whitehouse, Brown, Schatz and Dems Press Gses on Preparation for Climate Risks


U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Brian Schatz (D-HI) led Senate Democrats in pressing Fannie Mae CEO Hugh Frater and Freddie Mac CEO David Brickman for information on the steps that each of the GSEs are taking to assess and prepare for the effects of climate change on their business and on American communities, homeowners, and renters.

"It is critical that [Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae] is prepared for these increasing risks so it can continue fulfilling its Congressionally-directed mission to facilitate access to homeownership throughout the nation and its statutory obligations to serve underserved markets and low- and moderate-income homebuyers and renters," the Senators wrote in their letters to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.
