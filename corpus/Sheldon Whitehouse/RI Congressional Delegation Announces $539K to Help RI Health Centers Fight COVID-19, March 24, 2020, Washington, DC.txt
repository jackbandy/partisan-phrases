RI Congressional Delegation Announces $539K to Help RI Health Centers Fight COVID-19


U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse along with Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline today announced $539,250 in grant funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help eight Rhode Island health centers in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.  Health centers may immediately use the awards to address screening and testing needs, acquire medical supplies, and boost their telehealth capacity.

"Our trusted community health centers are well-positioned to be important assets in the fight against COVID-19," said the members of Rhode Island's congressional delegation in a joint statement.  "This federal funding will give neighborhood health centers the ability to test and treat patients with milder cases of respiratory illness, relieving some of the burden on our hospitals."

The Rhode Island health centers receiving funding are:

 - Blackstone Valley Community Health Care, Pawtucket -- $67,708 - Comprehensive Community Action, Cranston -- $63,233 - East Bay Community Action Program, Newport -- $58,034 - Northwest Community Health Care, Pascoag -- $61,222 - The Providence Community Health Centers, Providence -- 90,078 - Thundermist Health Center, Woonsocket -- $89,067 - Tri-County Community Action Agency, Johnston -- $55,132 - Wood River Health Services, Hope Valley -- $54,776 The funding awarded today is in addition to the $5.4 million Rhode Island has already received from the federal government to address the pandemic.  The health center awards were authorized by the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which Congress approved earlier this month to provide $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, including $100 million for Health Resources and Services Administration-funded health centers nationwide.
