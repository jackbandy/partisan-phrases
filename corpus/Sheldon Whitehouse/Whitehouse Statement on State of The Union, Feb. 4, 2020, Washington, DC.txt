Whitehouse Statement on State of The Union


U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) tonight released the following statement:

"The legacy of President Trump's term will include his quest to torpedo protections for people with pre-existing conditions, worsened wealth inequality, corruption on an unprecedented scale, and willful blindness to the climate crisis.  Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle must stand against the President's efforts to divide us and instead work together to make progress on the issues Americans care about."
