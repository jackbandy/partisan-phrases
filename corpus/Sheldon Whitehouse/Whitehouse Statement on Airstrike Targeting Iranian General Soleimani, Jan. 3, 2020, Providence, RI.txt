Whitehouse Statement on Airstrike Targeting Iranian General Soleimani


Senator Sheldon Whitehouse today issued the following statement regarding the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani:

"We have not yet been contacted by the administration with anything beyond the public explanation of this action.  It is hard to see how this contributes to the peace the President claims to want, without some exposition of our strategy or policy.  I hope there will be a briefing soon to explain both the policy and the factual predicates justifying the strike under international law."
