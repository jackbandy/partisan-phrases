Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693322/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund


Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Environment  and Public Works Committee, I wish to correct the record on one small  piece of the big, terrible bill that the Senate barely passed last week  and which the President signed into law on July 4. There are many  things to say about that legislation, and I will continue to daylight  concerning provisions buried in it over the coming weeks.

But today, I want to focus on section 60002 of the so-called ``One  Big Beautiful Bill Act,'' which repealed and rescinded all unobligated  funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. There has been some spin  put on this section, including in court filings. And so I aim to fix  some misconceptions, with the help of the Congressional Budget Office  and the relevant Republican House subcommittee chair.

I have spoken a lot about the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund over the  past several months, on the floor and in the Judiciary and Environment  and Public Works Committees. Most of the time, I have focused on the  many red flags raised by outrageous behavior of top DOJ and EPA  officials in their attempts to claw back nearly $20 billion in grant  funds that were awarded in April 2024 and fully dispersed into private  bank accounts by August. After terrorizing grantees with false  allegations of fraud and trying to open bogus criminal cases that went  nowhere, EPA froze and then announced the termination of these fully  obligated and dispersed grants. The grantees, rightfully, sued EPA for  these arbitrary and capricious actions. The dispute is being actively  litigated in the D.C. circuit.

The Justice Department continues its mischief. On July 3, 2025, DOJ  ran to the court with news of the repeal and rescission of unobligated  funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, claiming that this was  Congress rescinding a full $17 billion, including all of what EPA  claimed to terminate on March 11, 2025. That simply is not so. The DOJ  reads too much into the repeal of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund  language. Two pieces of evidence support my contention here.

First, when this provision came up through the Environment and Public  Works Committee, it was ``scored'' by the Congressional Budget Office.  That means the Congressional Budget Office provided an estimate of the  funds saved by rescinding unobligated funds. The CBO score for  rescinding all unobligated funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction  Fund, as provided to us by the majority on June 24, 2025, was $19  million. That is 19 with an m, not a b. CBO confirmed, further, that  the repeal of the program language did not create any additional  savings. The repeal and rescission together only saved the $19 million  EPA had remaining to oversee the program. All of the grant funding was  out the door, in private bank accounts, and in some cases, tied up in  firm legal commitments with third parties. At no point in our  discussions with the majority, directly or in our several conversations  with the Parliamentarian, was this score disputed.  The majority did express concern about EPA prevailing in litigation and  suddenly having nearly $20 billion back and, for this reason, pushed to  repeal the language. But the fact of the matter is, section 60002 only  rescinded EPA's administrative dollars and not a cent of the grant  funding.

Second, Republicans made clear that rescissions from environmental  grant programs only touched funding that had not yet gone out the door.  During the markup of the Energy and Commerce Committee title for the  House version of this bill, the chair of the Environment Subcommittee  Mr. Griffith of Virginia made the following statements:

On page 244, lines 5959-64:

I just want to point out that these provisions that we are       talking about only apply as far, as this bill is concerned,       to the unobligated balances. So if a grant was already given,       as far as this bill is concerned, then that would still be       going forward.

On page 244, lines 5968-70:

If the grant has already been granted and the money is       obligated, then this--then our language does not affect that.

On pages 247-48, lines 6055-57:

. . . [W]e can't rescind expenditures that have already       been obligated.

Neither CBO nor Republican Members understood the repeal and  rescission of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to save anything more  than EPA's unspent oversight dollars. Not a cent of the grant funding  was touched by section 60002. Wishful thinking on the part of DOJ does  not moot the ongoing litigation.

The committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:37 a.m. in Room       2123, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Brett Guthrie       [chair of the committee] presiding.

Present: Representatives Guthrie, Latta, Griffith,       Bilirakis, Hudson, Carter of Georgia, Palmer, Dunn, Joyce,       Weber, Allen, Balderson, Fulcher, Pfluger, Harshbarger,       Miller-Meeks, Cammack, Obernolte, James, Bentz, Houchin, Fry,       Lee, Langworthy, Kean, Rulli, Evans, Goldman, Fedorchak;       Pallone, DeGette, Schakowsky, Matsui, Castor, Tonko, Clarke,       Ruiz, Peters, Dingell, Veasey, Kelly, Barragan, Soto,       Schrier, Trahan, Fletcher, Ocasio-Cortez, Auchincloss, Carter       of Louisiana, Menendez, Mullin, Landsman, and McClellan.

The Chair. The committee will come to order.

The Chair. The gentleman yields back. Is there anyone       seeking recognition to speak on the amendment?

The gentleman from New Jersey seeks recognition. He is       recognized for five minutes to speak on the amendment.

Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Chairman, and I want to thank my       colleague Mr. Carter, for offering this amendment. You know,       often when we talk about environmental justice our friends       across the aisle roll their eyes. They scoff at the idea of       what is environmental injustice. It is not a thing. We don't       need to talk about it. So I want to just add a little context       to it.

Environmental justice initiatives are lifelines for       communities that are at a higher risk of adverse health       impacts from exposure to pollution and other environmental       challenges. So in my district the Ironbound section of       Newark, 25 percent of children living there suffer from       asthma. That is three times the state average.

And it isn't just their health that suffers. When we talk       about environmental justice, we are talking about children's       education. Asthma is the leading cause of absenteeism in       school-age children, which is why it is so obscene that today       Republicans want to cut funding that would address air       pollution at schools. I would just ask the American people,       like, what part of addressing air pollution at schools is       controversial? I don't think there is anything controversial       about.

And this is not just Democratic states or blue states. When       we talk about environmental justice, we are talking about       mining-related pollution in Appalachia. We are talking about       water crises in Alabama and Michigan. We are talking about       over-burdened communities that exist across the country and       across party lines.

So speaking about across party lines, another one of our       Republican colleagues from Oregon has a district that has       been awarded multiple grants at risk from this reconciliation       bill that would be saved by my amendment.

You are welcome.

First is the Columbia Gorge Early Learning and Resilience       Center, located right outside of Portland in a rural, low-      income community of The Dalles, Oregon. This grant-funded       project would renovate a 70-year-old school building into a       community center that protects public health and provides       valuable resources for local residents. That sounds like a       home run project to me. The center would provide childcare       for up to 200 children, create an on-site learning       laboratory, and provide vocational scholarships for students       to pursue careers in fields such as engineering or       agriculture. That is fantastic.

But the same party that claims to be the party of families       wants to shut down a grant that would help some of those       families with       child care. The irony is staggering. This is all while       also creating a renewable, energy-powered refuge that will       protect our most vulnerable residents during extreme       weather events like wildfires and winter storms. When the       lights go out and the community needs critical heat and       services, Republicans turn the other way, even at the risk       of their own constituents' lives. Unfortunately, the $20       million EPA grant to carry out this valuable mission was       unjustly and illegally terminated last month.

Similarly, another grant in Oregon, the Chiloquin Community       Resilience Hub and Municipal Center, would have remediated a       brownfield site into an emergency shelter, municipal space,       and community education center. We all sat here weeks ago and       touted the brownfields program as a bipartisan program, and       yet here we are trying to cut the funding for a brownfield       site that would serve as a critical community hub in a       Republican district. The center would also provide training       and education opportunities for a population that lives in a       rural and historically underserved area. The project was       awarded a $16.3 million EPA environmental justice grant--      great job getting that for your community--but it was also       illegally and arbitrarily canceled last month.

Now Republicans like that congressman from Oregon want to       get rid of the program entirely. To me, the conclusion is       clear. Republicans are willing to withhold nearly $40 million       from one congressional district alone, from his own       constituents, to give tax breaks to those who need them the       least.

So in addition to health care, we are not just talking       about Democratic environmental priorities. We are talking       about cutting funding for programs that will impact districts       across the country, and that is why everyone should support       this amendment to ensure that you bring those dollars home to       your district.

Thank you, and I yield back.

The Chair. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and I will       recognize myself to speak on the amendment, and yield to my       good friend from Virginia.

Mr. Griffith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to point       out that these provisions that we are talking about only       apply as far, as this bill is concerned, to the unobligated       balances. So if a grant was already given, as far as this       bill is concerned, then that would still be going forward.

The Chair. So would you yield back to me? So everyone that       was listed, if the grants had been awarded as projects or       not----

Mr. Griffith. If the grant has already been granted and the       money is obligated, then this--then our language does not       affect that.

Mrs. Fletcher. Will the gentleman yield?

The Chair. The--yes, it is my time. Yes, I will yield.

Mrs. Fletcher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

The Chair. Yes.

Mrs. Fletcher. I just want to clarify. I understand the       statement to be that this particular legislation doesn't deal       with the already-obligated funds. But isn't it true that the       administration is rescinding the grants and pulling back the       money from the projects like my colleague from New Jersey was       just explaining?

I know that there have been grants under various programs       in my community. One, for example, to help build sidewalks       and tree canopy. It is amazing to think about. In my district       there is a 17-degree difference in the temperature during the       summer between the poorest neighborhoods and the wealthiest.       And they have no trees, they have no tree canopy. There is       this great program to try to build sidewalks, put in trees,       and address some of these challenges that--it gets real hot       in Houston, and this is a really important program. But I       know the funds for that have been revoked.

And so is the statement that this won't do anything to       those, but there are still these grants being revoked? Or are       we trying to preserve those grants in this legislation and       just--the already-obligated funds, are we protecting those in       this?

The Chair. Well, this legislation does not take--does not       close the grants on any obligated funds, and that--the       executive actions----

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Will the gentleman yield? The       Chair. My understanding--and I will yield to my friend from       Virginia, if you would like to answer that.

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Will the gentleman yield?

Mr. Griffith. I am happy to say that I don't--The Chair.       Louisiana, my friend from Virginia, and then I will yield to       you.

Mr. Griffith. I don't know what the administration is       doing, per se, to the specific----

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. I can help----

Mr. Griffith. --grants that were mentioned, but I would say       that this amendment specifically talks about the unobligated       amounts, as well, so that whether it be the bill or the       amendment, this action that we take does not impact that       action that may or may not be going on in the administration.

I know it is confusing for folks back home, as well, to       understand that not--the administration does not always tell       us everything they are doing because they are doing so many       things.

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Will the gentleman yield briefly?

Mr. Griffith. And while I----

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. I will address that.

The Chair. I will yield to you in a second. Let him finish,       yes.

Mr. Griffith. I don't have the floor. I have been yielded       time, so I have to finish and then I yield back----

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Fair enough, sir.

Mr. Griffith. ----to the chair.

And so I can't speak for the administration on this. That       is a whole different ball game.

But what we are debating tonight is the bill in front of       us. And what we are debating right now is the amendment.       Neither the bill in front of us nor the amendment deal with       the issues that the gentleman previously raised. And so that       is why I ask folks to vote no on the amendment and yes on the       bill.

The Chair. Thank you.

The gentleman from Louisiana, I yield to you.

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. And I am happy to have an       opportunity to address that, because those comments are not       exactly correct.

If the Administrator Zeldin is successful in terminating       these critical grant programs in his misguided attempt to gut       the agency, these grants will be subject to rescission. It is       very clear. So the notion that it has been awarded, it is not       going to be impacted, that is a little disingenuous. So I       want to clear that up for the record.

I yield.

The Chair. Thank you. I yield, but--to the--back to the       gentleman from Virginia.

You want to--okay I will--do you want to speak, the       gentleman from Virginia? Go ahead.

Mr. Griffith. And what I would say, Mr. Chairman, is that       that may be true for a future rescission, but we can't       rescind expenditures that have already been obligated.

Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Oh----

Mr. Griffith. And for purposes of this reconciliation, we       can't look at the crystal ball and decide what might happen       in the future.
