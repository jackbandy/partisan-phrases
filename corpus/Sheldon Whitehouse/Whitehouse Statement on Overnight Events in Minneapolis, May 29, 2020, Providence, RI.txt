Whitehouse Statement on Overnight Events in Minneapolis


"A nation already grieving the tragic death of George Floyd woke up this morning to news of a black journalist arrested, a police station in embers, and a Commander in Chief who winks at white nationalism threatening black protestors with violence.  The President is on a mission to divide us, but we must not turn away from one another.  There is still a long way to go toward full equality and the end of racism in America.  Peaceful progress is the path to getting there."
