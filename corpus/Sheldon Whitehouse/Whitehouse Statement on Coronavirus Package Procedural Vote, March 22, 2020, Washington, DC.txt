Whitehouse Statement on Coronavirus Package Procedural Vote


U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) released the following statement after voting against a procedural vote to proceed to a third coronavirus legislative package:

"Americans are counting on Congress to act swiftly to protect workers from financial ruin and fortify our health system and other core sectors of our economy.  I voted against the Republican proposal because it did too much for corporations and not enough for our workforce and health care system.  I am still hopeful that we can pass a bipartisan agreement within the coming days."
