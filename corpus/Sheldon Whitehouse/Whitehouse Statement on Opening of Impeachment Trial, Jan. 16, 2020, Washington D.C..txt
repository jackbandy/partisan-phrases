Whitehouse Statement on Opening of Impeachment Trial


U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today issued the following statement regarding the opening of an impeachment trial in the Senate:

"Today is a solemn day, as the Senate prepares to carry out the serious duty that the Founding Fathers charged us with.  Every senator has just sworn an oath to "do impartial justice.'  That oath can only be upheld if the Senate allows the witnesses and evidence necessary to get to the truth about the acts charged in the impeachment."
