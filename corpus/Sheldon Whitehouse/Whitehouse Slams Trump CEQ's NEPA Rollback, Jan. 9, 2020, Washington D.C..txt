Whitehouse Slams Trump CEQ's NEPA Rollback


Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, released the following statement on the Trump Council on Environmental Quality's proposal to gut the National Environmental Policy Act.

"In her confirmation hearing, Chairman Neumayr agreed that climate change is real, that it's a major issue for coastal states like Rhode Island, and that some of our most important financial institutions are warning about the dire threats it poses.  Now, she's proposing to neuter the environmental law that ensures the government's most consequential decisions account for the effects of climate change.  We didn't need more proof that the fossil fuel industry has hardwired the Trump administration to deliver on its interests, but we got it anyway."
