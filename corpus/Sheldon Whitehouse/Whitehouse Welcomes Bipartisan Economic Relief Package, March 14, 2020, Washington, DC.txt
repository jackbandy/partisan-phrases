Whitehouse Welcomes Bipartisan Economic Relief Package


U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse applauded the bipartisan deal passed by the U.S. House of Representatives last night to put supports in place for American workers and make coronavirus testing free.  The measure would mandate paid medical and family leave, expand food security programs, and inject funding into state Medicaid programs.  By one estimate, the legislation could direct $150 million to Rhode Island's Medicaid program.

"Speaker Pelosi negotiated a good deal to provide some relief to the American workers who are most vulnerable to the immediate economic fallout from the coronavirus," said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Finance Committee.  "As Rhode Island ramps up preparations, our health care system will get an enormous lift from the Medicaid boost included in this package.  I look forward to voting for the bipartisan measure as soon as possible so we can get urgently needed resources out the door."

Whitehouse called on the President to support a robust economic stimulus measure and issue an emergency declaration for the pandemic earlier this week.
