Whitehouse Statement on CAFE Standard


Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, released the following statement today on the Trump administration's rollback of automobile fuel efficiency standards:

"Consumers and automakers don't want this reckless rollback, being pulled off for polluters under cover of the COVID pandemic.  We need to investigate the role of Marathon Petroleum and fossil fuel lobbyists, and whatever quid pro quos may have been offered so they can sell more gas.  It's hard to be much more evil than to use the coronavirus scare to change rules for greedy polluters, driving us headlong toward a climate cliff."
