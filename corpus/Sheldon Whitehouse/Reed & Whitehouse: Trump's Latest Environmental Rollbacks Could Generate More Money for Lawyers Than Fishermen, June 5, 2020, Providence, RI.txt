Reed & Whitehouse: Trump's Latest Environmental Rollbacks Could Generate More Money for Lawyers Than Fishermen


U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today issued the following joint statement in response to the Trump Administration's announcement that it is removing environmental protections for national marine monuments in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New England:

 

"If President Trump had done his job and taken the threat of COVID-19 more seriously, our fishermen and our nation would be better positioned to weather this pandemic.  Once again, President Trump has misdiagnosed the root problem.  If he really wanted to help, he would provide our fisherman with more relief and use the purchasing power of USDA to increase domestic markets for U.S. seafood producers.  But rather than providing targeted assistance, the Trump Administration is once again eliminating environmental protections.  This is short-sighted and a poor substitute for a long-term solution.  It does nothing to address the underlying issues.

 

"We worked with the Obama Administration to support the monument in a way that was fair to fishermen who fish this area, and the result has been twice approved in federal courts, in litigation defended by the Trump Administration.  This sudden change is unnecessary, disruptive, and contrary to the Trump Administration's own litigating position.

 

"We support the fisheries councils and will work with them to protect our oceans, fishermen, and fishing communities.

 

"This matter is likely to end up in court and could generate more money for lawyers than fishermen."
