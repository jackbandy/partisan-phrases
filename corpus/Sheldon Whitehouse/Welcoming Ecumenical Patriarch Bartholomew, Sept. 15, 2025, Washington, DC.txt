Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to extend a warm welcome  to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the  Orthodox Christian Church. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew will travel  to Washington this week to receive the prestigious Templeton Prize,  recognizing exceptional contributions to the fields of science and  religion. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is widely known as the  ``Green Patriarch'' for his longstanding commitment to protecting the  environment. He has organized several international, interfaith summits  to address some of the world's most pressing environmental problems. In  his own wise words, ``We must respond in an opportune manner to protect  life on earth from the worst consequences of human recklessness. May  God grant us the wisdom to act promptly.'' Thank you to His All- Holiness for emphatically voicing moral urgency on the climate crisis.

I would also like to honor the many contributions of Orthodox  Christians to America, with a special recognition to the parishioners  of the Church of the Annunciation in Cranston, RI. Last week this  parish, with Father Andrew George, Father Nicholas Lanzourakis, Charlie  Samaras, Denise Panichas, and other proud parishioners, celebrated a  touchstone of Rhode Island summers, the Church's 39th annual Cranston  Greek Festival. Thank you for all that you have done for the Cranston  community and the State of Rhode Island.
