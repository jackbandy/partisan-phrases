Whitehouse Marks Moment of Silence for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery


U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse this morning gathered with members of the Senate Democratic Caucus at the U.S. Capitol for a moment of silence to commemorate the lives of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, and to stand in solidarity with Americans peacefully objecting to racial injustice across the country.

"Our country is at a crossroads.  A nation reeling from a pandemic and an economic catastrophe that have disproportionately affected communities of color is mourning the tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many others.  All the while, President Trump is toiling to deepen the fault lines in American life," said Whitehouse.  "We hear the voices of the peaceful protestors who have marched.  We can and must do better to root out systemic racism in its many forms and meet America's full promise of justice for all."

Senate Democrats marked the moment of silence at 9:30 a.m. in Emancipation Hall, which was named in recognition of the enslaved laborers who helped build the U.S. Capitol.
