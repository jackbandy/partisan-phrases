Whitehouse Statement on Overnight Events in Providence


U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse this morning issued the following statement on the events that happened in Providence overnight:

"I am heartsick to see the destruction of small businesses in downtown Providence and attacks on police officers working to contain a dangerous situation.  Nobody has a right to inflict violence, which only serves to drown out the message of lawful protestors.  We must hold the people who organized this riot accountable and help rebuild what was broken.

"President Trump is fanning the flames of division at a moment when so many Americans are suffering.  But, true to our state's founding principles of hope and tolerance, Rhode Islanders will reject efforts to divide us.  Progress is made peacefully."
