Whitehouse Statement Ahead of Trump Budget Release


U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a member of the Senate Budget Committee, today issued the following statement ahead of the release of President Trump's FY2021 budget proposal:

"Everyone knows the latest Trump budget is dead on arrival in Congress.  It's merely a political stunt to gratify extremists in his party.  What we need is budget reform in Congress to address all the drivers of our massive deficits and help us to a bipartisan budget that honors the priorities of the American people."

Whitehouse has proposed bipartisan reforms to fix Congress' broken budget process and provide a more orderly, long-term approach to fiscal planning.
