Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the  150th anniversary of St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Lampasas, Texas.

Founded in 1873 during the turbulent years of Reconstruction, St.  Mary's has stood as a steadfast place of worship and community for a  century and a half. From its beginnings under the leadership of Dr.  Thomas S. Denny and a small group of faithful families, the church  persevered through frontier hardships, local feuds, floods, and  economic trials. Over the years, it has grown into a vibrant  congregation rooted in service, tradition, and faith.

The sanctuary itself, built of native limestone in the Victorian  Gothic style, is a testament to the perseverance of its early leaders,  including Capt. A.H. Barnes, Dr. James Bierbower, W.T. Campbell, T.H.  Haynie, W.C. Price, and others whose dedication made possible the  construction of a permanent church home. Generations of families, like  the Campbells, the Haynies, the Richeys, the Olivers, and many more  have sustained and enriched the life of St. Mary's across decades,  ensuring its continued presence as a spiritual cornerstone of the  Lampasas community.

Today, St. Mary's remains a thriving parish, carrying forward its  mission with more than a dozen families whose membership stretches back  multiple generations, while also welcoming new parishioners who bring  fresh perspectives and energy. Together, this congregation embodies the  resilience, stability, and continuity that have defined St. Mary's  since its founding.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring St. Mary's  Episcopal Church for 150 years of faithful service to its members, the  people of Lampasas, and the greater Central Texas region. May the  congregation continue to serve as a beacon of hope, light, and grace  for generations to come.
