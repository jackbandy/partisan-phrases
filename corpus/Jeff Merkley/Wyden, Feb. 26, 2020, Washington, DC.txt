Wyden, Merkley: Lane County to Get More than $1.1 Million in FEMA Funds


U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced that Lane County will get a federal emergency grant totaling more than $1.1 million to cover costs for severe storms from February 2019 that caused flooding, landslides, and mudslides.

"When Oregonians get clobbered by destructive weather, it's vital that the federal government step up to help with recovery from these disasters," Wyden said. "I am gratified that our teamwork with Lane County officials to secure funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency will now make needed resources available to assist their communities."

"Last winter brought extremely heavy rains and rapid snowmelt that led to mudslides, landslides, and flooding in communities throughout Oregon," said Merkley. "I'm glad we were able to secure this critical assistance for Lane County, and I'll continue to work with local leaders and fight for the federal support Oregonians in every corner of our state need to help them get back on their feet after destructive weather events."
