Letter to Hon. Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State - Senators Call for U.S. to Welcome Hong Kongers Fleeing Chinese Communist Party


Dear Secretary Pompeo, On this 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, we write with great alarm regarding the continued efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to rule by fear and oppression. The recent actions taken by the National People's Congress has effectively ended China's "one country, two systems" policy and, as you certified to Congress, Hong Kong no longer maintains a high degree of autonomy from China. We stand in solidarity with Hong Kongers as they fight to defend their basic democratic rights and remain free from the oppression that Beijing seeks to impose. While evaluating next steps for a broader response to the evolving situation in Hong Kong, we must recognize the immediate concern that some Hong Kongers are no longer safe living there and are seeking refuge outside of the region. As China becomes increasingly assertive, we must provide an alternative for those who desire to live in a land that shares their democratic values, protects human rights, and upholds the rule of law. We commend the recent actions by the United Kingdom and statements by Australia to welcome Hong Kongers who are seeking to live outside of Beijing's authoritarian rule. We strongly encourage the United States to follow suit and work arm in arm with our allies to find a solution to this challenge.  Now is the time to send the message to the Chinese government that the United States stands with those who believe in basic freedoms, democracy and human rights. During these critical times, the United States must explore new avenues to support those who share our core values of freedom and democracy. Please provide the undersigned with an update for your plans in this regard no later than June 12, 2020. We look forward to working with you in the coming days to find a solution to this challenge.
