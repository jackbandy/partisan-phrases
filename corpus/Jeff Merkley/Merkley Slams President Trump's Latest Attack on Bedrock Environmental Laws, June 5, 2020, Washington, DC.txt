Merkley Slams President Trump's Latest Attack on Bedrock Environmental Laws


Oregon's U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, who serves as a member of the Senate Environmental Justice Caucus, released the following statement after the Trump Administration announced that it will waive critical environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, under the ruse of economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Is "Trumpian' an adjective yet? It should be. It means issue edicts to shred democratically passed laws, almost always to enrich a mega-powerful group like the fossil fuel lobby.

"This assault on the people and the planet cannot stand."
