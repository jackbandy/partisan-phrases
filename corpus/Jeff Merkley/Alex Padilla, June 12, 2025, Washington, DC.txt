Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to say I am  extremely outraged that the executive branch's security team has shoved  a U.S. Senator out of a room, has proceeded to put that U.S. Senator on  the ground and to handcuff that Senator. This is what we expect to see  in authoritarian nations that can't tolerate a question, and they start  to attack the institutions.

What we are seeing in the United States right now, we are seeing it  in the form of the President willfully breaking the law on the rules  controlling the executive branch, time and time again. We see it in his  attack on the press, his attack on the universities, his attack on  extorting law firms. We see it in the form of him using the Trump v.  United States lawsuit to say: I, the President, am above the law, and I  could issue pardons to the whole executive branch, who is above the  law.

That is not the way it works in a republic. At least, it is not the  way it works if we are a republic.

If we, through a subservient Congress and in combination with a  deferential Supreme Court, slide into this authoritarian state, then we  have failed our oath to the Constitution.

It is absolutely wrong that any U.S. Senator, for attempting to ask a  question, be treated in this fashion.

I double down on the call of Leader Schumer. This merits a full  bipartisan investigation--bipartisan because all of us are Members of  the legislative branch. All of us have taken an oath to the  Constitution, and all of us should stand up for each other and  certainly our ability to explore the policies of this administration.
