Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026

Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4287 and ask  that it be reported by number.

Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, article I, section 9 of our Constitution  puts the power of the purse here in Congress. Our Founders considered  this the difference between a democratic republic where the people's  representatives design and choose the programs and fund them and an  authoritarian state where a King decides what the programs are.

The Supreme Court has reaffirmed that vision multiple times,  including in 1975 when it said a President could not impound funds and  in 1996 where it said Congress could not delegate the power of the  purse because it is given to us.

But an aberration has occurred--an aberration in which a President  can slow up funds, ask for Congress to undo the law that funded a  program at the end of a fiscal year, utilize a grace period, and then  the program reaches the end of the year and poof, like Cinderella's  carriage, it turns into a pumpkin, and the work we passed by law and  authorized by law is undone with no vote of Congress.

Mr. MERKLEY. That is a violation of the Constitution. We have the  responsibility to defend the power of the purse. Let's honor our oath  to a democratic republic.

Mr. MERKLEY. We are not an authoritarian state as long as we hold  onto the responsibilities assigned to us by the Constitution.

Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of the  applicable budget resolution, I move to waive applicable sections of  the act and applicable budget points of order for the purposes of the  pending measure because it is our responsibility to defend Congress and  the Constitution and preserve a democratic republic.                                Vote on Motion

Mr. MERKLEY.
