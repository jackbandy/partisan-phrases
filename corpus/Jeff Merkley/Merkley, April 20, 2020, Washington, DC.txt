Merkley, Wyden Announce Over $7.3 Million in Funding for Corvallis Transit System


Oregon's U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden announced today that the City of Corvallis will receive over $7.3 million in funding to support its public transportation operations and projects--including coronavirus response efforts.

The funding will be allocated to the Corvallis Transit System through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which Congress approved last month.

"Public transportation has been vital to communities throughout Oregon during this public health crisis--from making commutes possible for essential workers to keeping grocery stores and pharmacies within reach for Oregonians," said Merkley. "I'm pleased that this funding will help support the Corvallis Transit System during this tumultuous time, and will keep working to secure resources for public transit administrations across our state as we continue to fight this pandemic."

"The importance of public transit in our state is magnified during the coronavirus crisis for Oregonians needing transportation to get to work, buy food and prescription drugs for their families and more," Wyden said. "I am glad these CARES Act resources are on the road to Corvallis, and I will keep fighting for the financial support that public transit needs to remain a reliable option for Oregonians who depend on it."

Specifically, the funds will be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by providing administrative leave due to a reduction in transit service, cleaning products for buses and transit shelters, the provision of fixed-route transit, and the replacement of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-required Paratransit vehicles.
