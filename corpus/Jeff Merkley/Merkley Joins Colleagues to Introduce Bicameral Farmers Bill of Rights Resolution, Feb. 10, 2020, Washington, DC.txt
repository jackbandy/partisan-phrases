Merkley Joins Colleagues to Introduce Bicameral Farmers Bill of Rights Resolution


Oregon's Senator Jeff Merkley today announced that he has joined U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Representatives Deb Haaland (D-NM) and Chellie Pingree (D-ME) in introducing a groundbreaking Farmers Bill of Rights resolution--which affirms the rights of family farmers, ranchers, and traditional agricultural communities in Oregon and across the country.

"Family farms have been the backbone of Oregon's agricultural economy for generations," said Merkley. "These farmers' dedication to responsible stewardship of our land and agricultural innovation are woven into the fabric of the Oregonian spirit and have contributed to communities in every corner of our state. That's why we must make sure family farmers have a level playing field to compete."

The resolution outlines ten basic rights that all family farmers and ranchers should have access to and highlights the critical needs and fundamental agricultural rights of America's rural communities, Native Nations, and historically underserved farmers and ranchers. The resolution aims to ensure fairness in farm and food markets so rural communities and new generations of farmers can thrive. Oregon is home to more than 38,000 farms, which compete in national and international marketplaces and would benefit from the reforms outlined in the Farmers Bill of Rights.

Farmers now sell into an ever more concentrated marketplace that has reduced the prices they receive for their crops and livestock and has contributed to a decrease in net cash farm income.
