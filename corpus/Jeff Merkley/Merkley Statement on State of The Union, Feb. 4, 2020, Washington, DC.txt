Merkley Statement on State of The Union


Oregon's U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley released the following statement after the State of the Union Address:

"This State of the Union took place under the shadow of an impeachment trial that has clearly become a cover-up. President Trump may have intended to use tonight's speech to divert Americans' attention from the cloud that hangs over his presidency, but no words can distract from the corruption of his attempts to pressure a foreign government to intervene in our election.

"Tonight's speech only reinforces that while President Trump ran on a "drain the swamp' platform, he has spent the last three years becoming the most corrupt American president in modern history. From prescription drug prices, to Social Security and Medicare, to a tax scheme that gave away our national treasury to the wealthiest, the pattern has been clear: When rich and powerful special interests come knocking, President Trump won't hesitate to sell out working Americans for his own political benefit. This unchecked corruption has come to a head in President Trump's own self-dealing, attempting to use the power of the U.S. government to cheat in the 2020 election.

"Our democracy has survived for over two centuries because honest public servants have come together, regardless of party affiliation, to insist on a government of, by, and for the people. Today, we face another key juncture in the great American story. May the path ahead be one of restored integrity and partnership in tackling the great challenges facing America."
