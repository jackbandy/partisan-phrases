Cornyn on Texas Radio: Democrats' Cover-Up Allegations are "Pure Baloney'


Today on KSKY's The Mark Davis Show, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) discussed the Senate's impeachment trial proceedings. Excerpts of his interview are below.

"This is obviously historic. It's obviously very serious, and we're trying to do our duty as the jury in this impeachment trial, but it is repetitive."

"They've charged him with abuse of power, which is really kind of a grab-bag into which you can put all of your political, policy, and personal grievances, and that strikes me as dangerous to the presidency because that means any time you have 218 members of the House, they can impeach a president for abuse of power without charging him with any specific offense."

"If this becomes the new normal, then the power of representative government will concentrate in Washington, D.C. and the Congress to the detriment of the voters across the country who have the right to choose their own leaders."

"The House did such a half-baked job in getting some of these witnesses that they now say they want and need - that really the delays, as a result of litigation over privileges in the matters, that will basically occupy the Senate's time for, perhaps, months on end because the House was in such a rush to get this done before Christmas and did not go to court and litigate those claims before."

"You'll see Chuck Schumer and others saying that there's a cover-up because additional witnesses weren't called, which is pure baloney."

"I think the American people, because they've been able to see this on television in an entirely transparent sort of way, will have the confidence that everything that could've been presented was presented, and that's a stark contrast to the bunker, secret hearings that Adam Schiff conducted that were leaked selectively to the press."
