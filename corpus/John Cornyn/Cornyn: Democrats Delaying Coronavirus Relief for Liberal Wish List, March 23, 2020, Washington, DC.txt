Cornyn: Democrats Delaying Coronavirus Relief for Liberal Wish List


Today U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) discussed the delay of the CARES Act, critical legislation to get relief to Texans dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, by Senate Democrats on KFYO's "The Chad Hasty Show.' The Washington Times reported that Senate Democrats are demanding unrelated policy reforms, like solar and wind tax credits and new fuel emission standards, be included in the bill. 

"I'mÂ…pretty frustrated and downright angry at Sen. Schumer and Nancy Pelosi sitting on the sidelines receiving a government paycheck while hundreds of thousands of Americans are out of work because they've been told they can't go to work and they're not receiving a penny.

"We're trying to get them some help as well as the small businesses that we hope will still be in existence when this virus passes, as well as try to provide some loans that will be paid back to large employers that employ hundreds of thousands of people so our economy can jump back after this temporary crisis.

"And what they're doing is using this crisis to advance their ideological and political agenda. This is not a time for that. We need to get people help immediately who need help the most, particularly those who don't even have a paycheck coming in to pay for the necessities of life.

"Blocking this bill is completely irresponsible."
