U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) released the following statement today after U.S. Attorney Joseph D. Brown announced his resignation from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Texas:

"As a U.S. Attorney, Joe served his fellow Texans justly and honorably, cracking down on the illicit drug trade and prioritizing resources and training for law enforcement," said Sen. Cornyn.  "The Eastern District of Texas is undoubtedly safer because of his work.  I wish Joe the best in his next chapter, during which I know Joe will continue to serve and lift up his community."
