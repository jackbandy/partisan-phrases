Cornyn on Fox: Schumer Trying to "Hijack' Senate Trial


Today on Fox News' America's Newsroom, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) discussed the start of the Senate's impeachment trial proceedings. Excerpts of his interview are below, and video can be found here.

"They're worried that they won't be able to meet that threshold that's necessary to convict the President in the Senate. That's why they are clamoring for more witnesses."

"But in order to accommodate the concern, we have adopted or will adopt the same resolution that we did during the Clinton impeachment, which says the question of additional witnesses beyond which the impeachment managers want to offer initially will be deferred and decided by the vote of 51 senators later."

"It sounds to me they're in a state of panic and they realize that what they did through the partisan impeachment inquiry that was rushed in order to meet the Christmas deadline by Nancy Pelosi is not up to the standard necessary to convict and remove a President of the United States."

"They are going to now have to deal with a fair process that the American people will be able to see for themselves, from gavel to gavel, whereby they will have to meet their burden of proof to prove that this is a high crime and misdemeanor."

"I do think this case could be fairly efficiently presented to the Senate, and we could then make our decisions, apply those facts to this legal standard in the Constitution, and do that in a couple of weeks."

"It's clear that from the time that the President was inaugurated, January 20, 2017, that the impeachment effort was underway."

"Senator Schumer is complaining about something which is largely of his own making. He refused to negotiate with Senator McConnell on the rules and resolutions, so that means that Republicans, 53 Republicans, are going to have to vote for the resolution to set the ground rules up. Senator Schumer really wants to hijack the trial."
