President Signs Cornyn, Jackson Lee Bill to Study Emancipation Trail from Galveston to Houston into Law


U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) and U.S. Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (TX-18) released the following statements after President Trump signed the Emancipation National Historic Trail Study Act into law.  This legislation, introduced by Sen. Cornyn in the Senate and by Rep. Jackson Lee in the House, provides for the study of the Emancipation National Historic Trail, a 51-mile route from the former Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston to Freedmen's Town and Emancipation Park in Houston.  

"This law honors those Texas families who travelled from Galveston to Houston to share the monumental news that all slaves had been freed," said Sen. Cornyn.  "I thank President Trump and my colleagues in Congress for supporting the study of this trail to celebrate their legacy and remind future generations of how far our nation has come."

"The signing of HR 434 and its Senate companion bill is a historic moment for the State of Texas and for the nation," said Rep. Jackson Lee. "This Emancipation Trail will become only the second in the history of the United States to commemorate the history of African Americans. It will provide enhanced knowledge about the historic announcement by Captain Granger that the slaves were free. I am excited that we were able to secure this legislation in a very short period of time which now establishes the first historic trail solely within the boundaries of the State of Texas. This will be a great asset for the citizens of the State of Texas and I am delighted to have introduced this bill in the House and very pleased that Senator Cornyn joined me by introducing it in the Senate."
