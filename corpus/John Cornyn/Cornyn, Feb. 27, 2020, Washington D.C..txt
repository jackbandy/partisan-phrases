Cornyn, Rosen Introduce Suicide Prevention Legislation


U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) today introduced the Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act, which would require the National Science Foundation to award grants to institutes of higher education that support research on suicide treatment and prevention.

"Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for young Texans and is on the rise nationally," said Sen. Cornyn. "This legislation would help us understand the factors that contribute to someone making this decision and help identify how we can best support individuals in crisis."

"We must take action to confront the rising rate of suicide occurring across our nation," said Sen. Rosen. "Countless families and communities in Nevada and throughout our country have experienced this tragedy. This bipartisan bill will help us better understand how to help those suffering." 

Background on the Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act:

This legislation would require the National Science Foundation, in consultation with the National Institute of Mental Health, to award grants to institutes of higher education to research multidisciplinary factors like social behavior, human cognition and development, drug and alcohol abuse, and other behaviors involved in the treatment and prevention of suicide.

The bill also supports the work of early career researchers working in fields relevant to understanding and preventing suicide.

The Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act is supported by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the American Psychological Association.

If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal crisis or emotional distress, The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) provides free and confidential emotional support to people 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, across the United States.
