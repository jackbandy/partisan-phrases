Cornyn Announces Reimbursement Funds Available for Texas Communities Providing Coronavirus Care


U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) announced today that Congress' emergency funding legislation to address the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak will include resources available for reimbursements for state and local governments that have provided care to individuals who are being evaluated and, in some cases, treated for the virus.  

"Texas, and in particular San Antonio, was called upon to provide care for potential patients because of our top-notch healthcare facilities, military resources, and highly skilled medical professionals," said Sen. Cornyn. "I'm grateful to my colleagues who I worked with to ensure $950 million is available for reimbursement for the costs Texas and states across the country have incurred while monitoring and treating these individuals."
