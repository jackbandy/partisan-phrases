Cornyn Introduces Bill to Increase Border Patrol Agents' Overtime Pay


U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) today introduced the Border Patrol Pay Security Act to ensure U.S. Border Patrol agents earn similar overtime compensation already offered to other federal law enforcement agents.  It amends the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to allow U.S. Border Patrol agents to receive time and a half for hours worked between 80 and 100 hours during 14 consecutive days.

"Our border patrol agents put their lives at risk every time they put on their uniform," said Sen. Cornyn.  "Ensuring these dedicated men and women receive pay parity with other federal law enforcement positions is long overdue.  Just compensation will also help the U.S. Border Patrol confront one of its biggest challenges, recruiting and retaining the best talent to keep Texas' border communities safe."

This legislation is supported by the National Border Patrol Council.  "I want to thank Senator Cornyn for introducing this important piece of legislation," said Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council.  "Over the past several years, manpower has been the number one challenge for the Border Patrol. There are less agents on duty today than at any time in the last 10 years. Restoring FLSA for Border Patrol Agents will ensure pay parity with sister agencies at the federal level and will tremendously assist the Border Patrol in remedying attrition issues.  The Bill, when passed into law, will allow the Border Patrol to recruit and retain a strong well-trained workforce.  Senator Cornyn is one of the most respected legislators in Congress and he continues to tackle the tough issues that mean so much to the American public, in this case border security.  This is not the first time Senator Cornyn has stepped up for border security in Washington, and we are fortunate to have him in our corner."
