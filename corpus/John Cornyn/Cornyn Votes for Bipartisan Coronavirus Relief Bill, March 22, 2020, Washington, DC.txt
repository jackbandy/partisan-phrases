Cornyn Votes for Bipartisan Coronavirus Relief Bill


U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) issued the following statement after he voted to advance the bipartisan Coronavirus relief bill, the CARES Act, and Senate Democrats blocked it:

"This legislation, negotiated with Democrats, would provide immediate relief to folks who've lost their paychecks, small businesses running low on cash, and healthcare providers putting their lives at risk to treat this virus.

"It's incomprehensible that in the midst of a national crisis Democrats have chosen to block this bipartisan bill after they helped write it. Texans need help now, and it's time for the games to stop."
