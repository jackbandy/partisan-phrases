Cornyn on Democrats Blocking Small Business Rescue Funding


U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) today issued the following statement after Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Democrats blocked an effort by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to pass additional funding for the small business rescue loan program, which will soon be depleted:

"The Democrats' insistence on holding this relief hostage for extraneous funding that isn't needed is unfathomable. Coronavirus relief is no place for partisan politics, but Senator Schumer just can't help himself.

"Very soon this fund, which has been a lifeline to Texas small businesses, will run out. Allowing this fund to run dry and letting countless small businesses fail would be one of the most unconscionable things Senator Schumer and Democrats could do."
