Cornyn Discusses Reopening of Texas, Falling Oil Prices, Democrats Blocking Small Business Loan Program Funding


Today on Fox News' America's Newsroom, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) discussed Governor Abbott's announcement of a plan to reopen Texas, declining oil prices, and Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi's blockade of new funding for the Payroll Protection Program. Excerpts of Sen. Cornyn's interview are below, and video can be found here. 

On Texas' Announcement Of Reopening Guidelines:

"Appropriately, the Governor and the mayors are looking at conditions where they are."

"I feel pretty good about where we are, but we are going to have to be careful because public health has to be the paramount consideration." 

On Oil Prices Dropping:

"The Saudis and the Russians crushed oil prices around the world by flooding the markets."

"The problem is because of the coronavirus economic collapse, there's not as much demand."

"I'm really worried that this is going to destroy, or at least permanently damage, a really important part of our economy in Texas and the United States." 

On Schumer/Pelosi's Blockade of New PPP Funds:

"The first and most important thing we can do is defeat this virus, and then we need to get our economy back on track so people can go back to work."

"It's so important to replenish this fund."

"Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer seem just oblivious to the real need, and the pain being felt out there, and the jobs and businesses being destroyed."

"We knew this was a very popular program, and it seemed to be working the way we intended by keeping people connected to their employer. But there's more demand than we prepared for, so that's why it's important we act quickly. Unfortunately, Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi did not have the same sense of urgency."
