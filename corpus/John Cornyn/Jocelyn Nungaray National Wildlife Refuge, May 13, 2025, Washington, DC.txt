Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge


Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, Jocelyn Nungaray was a 12-year-old girl  who was sexually assaulted and murdered just north of Houston last  June. The two suspects who committed this ghastly crime were illegal  immigrants who never should have been in our country in the first  place.

To commemorate Jocelyn's life, I have introduced the Jocelyn Nungaray  National Wildlife Refuge Act, which would permanently rename the  Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge in Texas in her memory.

This bill would actually codify President Trump's Executive order and  ensure that future generations will remember Jocelyn for years to come.  I hope my colleagues will join me in renaming this Texas wildlife  refuge in her honor.

1596 and  the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.

Mr. CORNYN. I know of no further debate on the bill.
