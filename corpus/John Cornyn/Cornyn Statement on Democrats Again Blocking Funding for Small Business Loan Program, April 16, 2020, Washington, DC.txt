Cornyn Statement on Democrats Again Blocking Funding for Small Business Loan Program


U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) today released the following statement after Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Democrats blocked a second effort by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to pass additional funding for the small business Paycheck Protection Program, which shut down today due to a lack of funds:

"There's just no sense of urgency, apparently, when it comes to small businesses that need this lifeline known as the Paycheck Protection Program, and so they're holding that hostage in order to get other unrelated spending."

"Now is not the time to obstruct the money for the Paycheck Protection Program just because you have other demands you'd like to make."
