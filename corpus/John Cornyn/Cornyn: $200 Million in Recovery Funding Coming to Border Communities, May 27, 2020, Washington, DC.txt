Cornyn: $200 Million in Recovery Funding Coming to Border Communities


The North American Development Bank (NADBank) has approved a $200 million temporary financing program to combat the effects of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.-Mexico border region, U.S. Senator John Cornyn announced today. This program will encourage development projects that have both environmental benefits and direct positive impacts on the economy in the area. In addition to the program's $200 million provision, it also includes up to $15 million in technical assistance.

"The coronavirus outbreak has hit Texans hard, and as much as we can protect each other from its effects, we must," said Sen. Cornyn.  "I'm grateful to the North American Development Bank for making economic recovery in Texas border communities a high priority during the outbreak."
