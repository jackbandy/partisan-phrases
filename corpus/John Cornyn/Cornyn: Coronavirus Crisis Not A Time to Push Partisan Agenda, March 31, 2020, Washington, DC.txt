Cornyn: Coronavirus Crisis Not A Time to Push Partisan Agenda


Today on The Hugh Hewitt Show, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) discussed Speaker Pelosi's partisan agenda during the coronavirus pandemic and possible "Phase Four" legislation to address this public health crisis. 

On Impeachment Affecting the Administration's COVID-19 Response and Speaker Pelosi:

"There's no question about it. Look at the calendar, see what we were doing thanks to the House Articles of Impeachment during the whole month of January. I think there's no doubt in my mind about that."

"Historically, she knows we've always pulled together as a country, after 9/11 and after 2008. And unfortunately, we're beginning to see some of that national unity erode here in the instance of hyper-partisanship. I think it's a shame. I don't think we have time for that now. I think we need to respond as a nation, as we always have, unified, to a national emergency."

"it makes her just look diminished, I think, raising elevated partisanship at a time when we should be pulling together as a country." 

On a Phase 4 Bill:

"I've been staying on the phones and staying on conference calls with my constituents back in Texas, saying, "We're going to need your feedback when the program is implemented and the money starts flowing. Where are the problems? What do we need to fix?'"

"But you know, I think we shouldn't look at this as an opportunity to pass our political outbox or ideological agenda. We ought to be all about solving the problem, and that is the public health problem and economic consequences associated with it. That ought to be our full focus."
