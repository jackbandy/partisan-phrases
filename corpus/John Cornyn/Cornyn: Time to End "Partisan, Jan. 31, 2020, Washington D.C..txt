Cornyn: Time to End "Partisan, Half-Baked' Impeachment


Today on Fox News Radio's Kilmeade & Friends, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) discussed the Senate's impeachment trial proceedings and the precedent it could set for future Congresses. Excerpts of his interview are below.

"If the House can undertake a partisan, sort of half-baked, impeachment inquiry, vote on articles of impeachment, and dump it into the Senate's lap, where these questions on executive privilege would have to be litigated through the courts with delays of weeks, if not months, that that would set a bad precedent and basically allow the House to take over the Senate agenda where we can't do anything else."

"So I'm pretty optimistic that senators understand that this is a product of a partisan, half-baked, unprepared impeachment inquiry that we should not let become the new normal."
