Cornyn Statement on CITGO 6 in Venezuela


U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) released this statement following the news that the Maduro regime in Venezuela had re-captured six Citgo executives, five of whom are Texans:

"The re-arrest of these innocent Americans shows the ruthlessness and desperation of the failed Maduro regime," said Sen. Cornyn.  "I am heartbroken for their families, and I pledge to continue working with the Trump Administration, using every tool in our box, to free these innocent Americans from the crosshairs of the Maduro Regime's instability."
