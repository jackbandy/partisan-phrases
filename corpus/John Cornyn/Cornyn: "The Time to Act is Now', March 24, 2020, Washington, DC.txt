Cornyn: "The Time to Act is Now'


Today on the Senate floor, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) discussed the delay of the CARES Act, critical legislation to get relief to Texans dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Excerpts of Sen. Cornyn's interview are below, and video can be found here.

"If we're going to have any success at slowing the trajectory of this virus and minimizing the economic harm, the time to act is now. The eyes of the nation are upon us. They want to know if partisanship can be set aside in the face of a pandemic."

"There is in fact broad bipartisan agreement about the result. We need to get relief directly from Washington to the American people as soon as possible. That we need to provide small businesses with help so they can survive this storm. And once the virus is defeated, that they are still around to provide jobs to people they have now had to furlough or lay off. There seems to be broad bipartisan agreement. We need a freeze on student loan payments to provide peace of mind to tens of millions of borrowers, and that employees that have been impacted by the virus should get support now. And they should have jobs to come back to later."

"This virus is spreading at an exponential rate and we can't afford to waste time fighting one another over these sort of irrelevant partisan sideshows."
