Cornyn Praises EPA's Clarification of WOTUS Rule


U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) praised the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) announcement today regarding the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which redefines Waters of the United States (WOTUS) from the Obama Administration's sweeping rule. 

"After hearing from countless farmers, ranchers, and landowners about the Obama Administration's unworkable WOTUS rule, I commend the Trump Administration for this much-needed revision," said Sen. Cornyn.  "With new clarity on how the federal government views navigable waters, Texans will be able to better plan for their future, provide for their families, and protect our environment."

Sen. Cornyn voted against the Obama Administration's WOTUS rule in 2015, and the Trump Administration repealed the rule in September 2019.
