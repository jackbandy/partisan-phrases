Cornyn Introduces Fellow Texan Rep. Ratcliffe at DNI Nomination Hearing


U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced Representative John Ratcliffe (TX-04), who has been nominated to be the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), at today's hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

"John Ratcliffe has the personal integrity and intelligence to be able to understand the difference between being a legislator and being the Director of National Intelligence. These are simply different roles to be played while discharging our government responsibilities."

"And I'm proud to support his nomination and to give you my strongest personal recommendation."

"We need to be able to count on a leader to operate free of personal or political motivation, serving only with the security and safety of the American people in mind, and I believe John Ratcliffe is the person to do that job."

"I have confidence in his ability to serve as a steadfast leader and advocate for the intelligence professionals of the IC and the trusted partner with this committee."
