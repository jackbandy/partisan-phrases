Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my friend from  Utah Senator Lee, the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction for  hosting this unanimous consent request today to highlight the  importance of many pieces of legislation but including the Big Bend  National Park Boundary Adjustment Act.

It is no secret that Texas is home to a lot of wide-open spaces,  beautiful terrain, and vibrant wildlife. And Big Bend is a national  treasure.

This legislation expands and preserves the park's heritage, natural  resources, and jaw-dropping scenery while safeguarding private property  rights. It authorizes the National Park Service to acquire  approximately 6,100 additional acres adjacent to Terlingua Creek along  the western boundary of the park.

And it clarifies that the Park Service may only acquire land through  donation or exchange, not through eminent domain.

I am disappointed that our colleagues across the aisle have objected  to this. This legislation is critical to Texans and all Americans being  able to enjoy our big, beautiful national parks, including Big Bend.

And I thank my colleague from Utah for making the unanimous consent  request, but I am disappointed that even on something as much as a no- brainer as something like this, our Democratic colleagues can't resist  making partisan objections.
