Cornyn Votes for Third Coronavirus Relief Bill


U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) supported Senate passage of the CARES Act, critical legislation to get relief to Texans dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Excerpts of his speech on the Senate floor yesterday are below, and video can be found here.  A summary of how the bill will benefit Texans follows the excerpts.

"Already we were able to work and send two bills to the President's desk for signature. The first sent vital support to health care professionals and first responders who are doing everything they can to treat patients and prepare for more cases. We also provided initial funding for development of a vaccine, clinical trials, and more diagnostic tests. The second bill we passed focused more on the small businesses and the individual workers who are impacted economically."

"Sadly, over the last few days, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been oblivious to the sense of urgency that every other American seems to understand. After the original, intense bipartisan negotiations, we were finalizing a third relief bill which included, by definition, ideas from both Republicans and Democrats."

"Our Democratic colleagues blocked us from even debating the bill, not once but twice. The Minority Leader said the bill, which his members had helped write, wasn't good enough. He spent the next three days trying to change the bill to include provisions that he thought were more important priorities during a national emergency. Things like tax credits for solar panels and tighter emissions standards for airlines, proposals that have absolutely nothing to do with this crisis."

"This bill sends desperately needed funding to hospitals that are struggling to manage an influx of patients and helps fight the shortage of masks and other personal protective equipment."

"A family of four will receive up to $3,400 under this legislation, which will go a long way to throwing that lifeline to them and cover their rent, groceries, electric bills, and other expenses until they can make other arrangements, like apply for unemployment insurance under our beefed up provisions."

"This legislation will also provide relief for small businesses that are struggling to stay afloat."

"With both the physical and economic health of our country in crisis, this bold legislation is our best path forward."

"The American people are depending on us to respond responsibly in a bipartisan way during an emergency like this, and we cannot let them down."
