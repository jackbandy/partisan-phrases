Cornyn Supports Legislation to Fund $3B in Crude Purchase for SPR


U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) announced today that he will cosponsor forthcoming legislation to provide $3 billion in funding to purchase crude oil produced in the United States for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Text of the legislation is available here. This bill will be introduced in the House by Representatives Michael Burgess (TX-26), Lizzie Fletcher (TX-7), and Henry Cuellar (TX-28), among others.

"Without swift action, the coronavirus could have a devastating impact on Texas' energy producers and their workforce," said Sen. Cornyn. "This legislation would help support small to midsize producers and Texas workers while enhancing national security during this uncertain time."
