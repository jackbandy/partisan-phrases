Tuskegee Airmen Moment of Silence

Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that we acknowledge the passing of the  last of the Tuskegee Airmen. I will share a little bit about them.

They trained on Moton Field and on Tuskegee Army Air Field in  Tuskegee, Alabama, and later formed units like the 99th Fighter  Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group. They were under the command of  Colonel Benjamin Oliver Davis, Jr., who was born right here in  Washington, D.C.

When the pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group painted the tails of their  P-47s red, the nickname ``Red Tails'' was coined. The red markings that  distinguished the Tuskegee Airmen included red bands on the noses of  their P-51s.

Some of the bomber crews who flew some of the most dangerous missions  during World War II called them the ``Red Tail Angels.''

In combat during the war, they flew over 15,000 sorties, escorting  bombers and engaging enemy fighters.

They received numerous accolades for their service, including 3  Distinguished Unit Citations, 96 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 14  Bronze Stars, 744 Air Medals, at least 60 Purple Hearts, and one Silver  Star.

Colonel Davis went on to become the first African-American brigadier  general in the United States Air Force.

It is totally appropriate that we recognize the incredible  accomplishments, with all of the opposition that they faced, that the  Tuskegee Airmen achieved in the defense of our liberty.
