Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise this evening with my  colleagues to honor Doug LaMalfa in the joint remembrance of his life.  He was one of this body's best Members.

Doug was a dear friend whom I will miss. He was a talented and  trusted colleague who was serious about his work, representing his  constituents as he was constantly seeking to move policy that helped  them and our Nation.

Doug was a rice farmer, an occupation that he loved and that in many  respects was foundational to his work ethic, his love of the land, and  his love of the people and rural communities.

More than anything else, he was a faithful follower of Jesus Christ.  I will miss Doug and our weekly Thursday morning Bible studies.

I will miss his humbleness, his even temper, his humor, and his  presence in this body. I will miss hearing him call me Francis Gary  Powers after the U.S. spy plane pilot who was shot down over Russia and  captured in the 1960s.

My wife, Ann, and I are praying for God to comfort Doug's wife, Jill;  his children; his family; his staff; and all who, like those who have  gathered in this Chamber this evening, knew and loved Doug LaMalfa.
