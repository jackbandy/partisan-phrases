Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the student  winners of my first annual Black History Month Essay Competition:  Waverly Davis from Reeves Middle School in Olympia, Washington, and  Rion Walker from Curtis Senior High School in University Place.

I created this program to help students share the stories of Black  leaders who have influenced Washington State, especially in the times  we are in today.

Waverly highlighted Dorothy Hollingsworth, the first Black woman  elected to the Seattle School Board in 1975, who went on to serve on  the Washington State Board of Education. Hollingsworth's commitment to  civil rights and equality laid the foundation for all Washington  students.

From Waverly's essay: ``Her story has made me feel hope that things  aren't always as set in stone as they seem.''

Rion wrote about Quincy Jones, producer, composer, and musician, who  started his journey in Seattle and broke racial barriers across the  music and film industries.

From Rion's essay: ``Talent exists everywhere, but opportunity does  not, and addressing this gap is a civic responsibility.''

I thank our judges and all the students who participated. These  essays remind us that Black history is Washington State history and  American history.

Happy Black History Month.
