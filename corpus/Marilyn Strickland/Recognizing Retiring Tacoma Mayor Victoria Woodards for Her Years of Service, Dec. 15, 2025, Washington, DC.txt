Recognizing Retiring Tacoma Mayor Victoria Woodards for Her Years of Service


Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Victoria  Woodards, who is retiring as Tacoma, Washington's 39th Mayor.

A graduate of Lincoln High School, she proudly served her country in  the U.S. Army, thinking she would see the world, and ended up right  back home at Fort Lewis. She also pursued a long career in public  service as a parks commissioner, as a city councilmember, and as mayor  of Tacoma.

I congratulate Victoria on an exemplary and distinguished career of  more than 15 years serving the people of Tacoma. Under her leadership,  the city launched the Equity and Empowerment Initiative, which led to  the creation of our Office of Equity and Human Rights. The city  implemented key police reforms, including updates to the use-of-force  standards. She established the city of Tacoma's first Youth Commission,  giving high school students a chance to learn how government works. She  passed Home in Tacoma, which expanded key and necessary housing  opportunities across the entire city. She also raised our profile  nationally by serving as president of the National League of Cities,  promoting the platform of people, partnership, and possibilities. She  launched the Growing Resilience in Tacoma, otherwise known as GRIT, one  of the first guaranteed income pilots in the entire Nation to address  systemic poverty. She supported the creation of Maritime 253, which is  a skills training center in partnership with Tacoma Public Schools and  the Port of Tacoma.

Throughout her career, Mayor Woodards has broken barriers, championed  equity and justice for all, and has been instrumental in ensuring that  every voice in our community is heard. I thank Mayor Woodards for her  selfless service to the City of Destiny, Tacoma, Washington, and the  Nation.
