Mr. KELLY. Mr. President, I rise today to welcome His All-Holiness  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, DC. He is the spiritual  leader of Orthodox Christianity, the second largest Christian Church in  the world, with more than 250 million members worldwide and over 1  million here in the United States.

His All-Holiness is the 269th successor of the Apostle Andrew and the  longest serving Ecumenical Patriarch in history. He is recognized  across the globe for his leadership in promoting peace, advancing  religious freedom, and speaking out on environmental stewardship. He  has been honored with the Congressional Gold Medal and will receive the  Templeton Prize during this visit.

In Arizona, the Greek Orthodox community is an important part of our  State's civic and cultural life. Parishes across the State serve as  places of worship, education, and service, and they host traditions  that strengthen families and connect generations. Their contributions  are an important part of Arizona's diversity and character.

I am proud to join Orthodox Christians in Arizona and across the  country in welcoming His All-Holiness to the United States and to  Congress. His visit is a point of pride for many Arizonans and a  reminder of the shared values of faith, service, and community that  strengthen our country.
