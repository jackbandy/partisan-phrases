Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. President, when the Senate considers the rescissions  bill, H.R. 4, it is my intention to make the following motion to  recommit the bill:

A motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on       Appropriations to modify the proposed rescission of funds       from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to exclude       amounts designated to support public radio or television       stations that are licensed to or primarily serve rural areas       or Tribal communities.
