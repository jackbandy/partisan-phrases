Anniversary of January 6

Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. President, today marks 5 years since January 6, the  day a violent mob attacked the U.S. Capitol in an effort to overturn a  free and fair election and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power. It  was not a protest. It was not a misunderstanding. It was an assault on  our democracy.

I was there that day, as many of my colleagues were. I remember the  pounding on the door of the House Chamber. I remember seeing staff  stacking chairs against these doors to stop the mob from entering. I  remember helping evacuate the floor as a mob was taking over the  Capitol, and I remember looking around thinking about my family and  whether we would make it out safely. That day left scars on this  institution, on our democracy, and on the men and women who put  themselves in harm's way to defend it.

I served in the U.S. Marine Corps. I swore an oath to support and  defend the Constitution of the United States, and I know what it means  to take that oath seriously, not just in uniform but in life, which is  why I will be offering an amendment to the Defense appropriations bill  to ensure that military funeral honors remain reserved for those who  have defended the Constitution, not for those who have sought to  overthrow it.

Last year, the administration offered military honors for Ashli  Babbitt. Ashli Babbitt was not a hero; she was part of the violent mob  that tried to overturn our democracy. She ignored repeated lawful  orders from Capitol Police. She pushed to the front of the crowd. She  helped to smash a window into the Speaker's Lobby and attempted to  force her way through a barricaded door while she was armed  with a weapon. She did not die defending her country; she died trying  to tear it down.

Military funerals are sacred. They are reserved for those who upheld  their oaths, who defended the Constitution and the rule of law. To  grant those honors to someone who participated in an attack on this  Capitol would dishonor every servicemember who actually served to  uphold that oath.

I have seen real sacrifice. I have buried marines who gave their  lives in protecting others. That is honor. Those who serve are expected  to uphold military standards even after they leave service. When you  violate the law and betray your oath, you forfeit the privilege of  having military honors.

If we equate the January 6 insurrection with genuine sacrifice, we  cheapen everything our servicemembers have done in the defense of this  country. We erode trust in our military, and we feed the dangerous lie  that January 6 was anything other than a betrayal of our democracy.

Taxpayer money should not be used to provide a military funeral to  someone who took part in an attack on this Capitol. This is about  accountability. It is about honoring those who have truly served with  integrity, and it is about making clear, 5 years later, that we will  not rewrite the history of January 6.

I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to remember the  men and women who have defended this country honorably--those who  upheld their oaths, who protected our democracy--and those who continue  to serve with courage and sacrifice.
