Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Bill Matthys--a man  whose life reflects a steadfast commitment to education, public  service, and community.

Raised in rural Wharton County, Mr. Matthys graduated from El Campo  High School in 1965, later earning degrees from Wharton County Junior  College and the University of Houston, including a BA in English and  Journalism and a master's in Curriculum and Instruction. In 1967, he  married Pamela, his high school sweetheart, and together they built a  loving family and a legacy of service.

Following college, Mr. Matthys served on active duty in the United  States Army from 1970 to 1974, including time stationed in Germany, and  later in the Army Reserve until his honorable discharge as a Captain in  1981. His service to our Nation was marked by integrity and continued  through his 35 years dedicated to public education in Texas. He worked  as both a teacher and administrator, with 16 of those years at Cuero  ISD. After retiring from education, he continued serving the community  through legal work as a certified paralegal at a local firm.

His civic involvement has been just as remarkable. He has served on  the boards of the Cuero Chamber of Commerce, the Cuero Lions Club, the  Cuero ISD Education Foundation, and the DeWitt County Habitat for  Humanity. For 17 years, he represented the people of Cuero on the City  Council, including 14 years as Mayor Pro-Temp.

Mr. Speaker, Bill Matthys represents the very best of servant  leadership. His life is a testimony to the impact one person can make  through quiet faithfulness, love for family, and a deep-rooted  commitment to community.

May God continue to bless him, his family, and all those he serves.
