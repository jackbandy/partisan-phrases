Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Ganado  Maidens softball team--2025 UIL 2A State Champions.

With a final score of 5-4 over Riesel, the Maidens capped off a 33-5- 1 season marked by grit, discipline, and heart. They entered the  postseason on a 19-game winning streak and held their opponents to just  9 total runs across 10 playoff games.

This championship wasn't handed to them. In the title game, they were  down to their final out then delivered a two-run rally that turned the  tide. That's the kind of resilience that defines Texas athletics and  Texas values.

It wasn't just one team on the field--it was an entire community  behind them. Coaches, families, classmates, and neighbors, each playing  a role. As one local paper put it, ``lt took all of Ganado.'' And it  did.

In a time when the spotlight so often falls on the wrong examples,  these young women reminded us what it means to fight for something  bigger than yourself. Their victory is more than a trophy. It's a  testament to hard work, unity, and the enduring spirit of Texas.

I congratulate the Maidens.
