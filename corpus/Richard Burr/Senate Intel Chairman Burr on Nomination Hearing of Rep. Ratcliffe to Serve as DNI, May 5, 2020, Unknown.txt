Senate Intel Chairman Burr on Nomination Hearing of Rep. Ratcliffe to Serve as DNI


Today, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held its open hearing on the nomination of Rep. John L. Ratcliffe to serve as Director of National Intelligence (DNI). Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) released the following statement after today's hearing:

"The role our Intelligence Community plays in keeping America safe often goes unseen, but it should never be underestimated. It is essential that these men and women have the resources, leadership, and support they need to do their jobs well, particularly given the current unprecedented public health crisis. As I've said before, there is no substitute for having a permanent, Senate-confirmed Director of National Intelligence to lead the IC as it carries out its mission. 

"After hearing from Congressman Ratcliffe today, I believe he understands the challenges facing the Intelligence Community in the 21st century and is ready to work to meet them. He has committed to working with our Committee and with Congress to ensure proper oversight and information sharing. And he has pledged to support the men and women of the Intelligence Community in their steadfast work. I look forward to advancing Congressman Ratcliffe's nomination and supporting it when it comes before the full Senate."
