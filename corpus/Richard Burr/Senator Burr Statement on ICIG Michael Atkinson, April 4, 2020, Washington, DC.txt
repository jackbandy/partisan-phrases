Senator Burr Statement on ICIG Michael Atkinson


Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) released the following statement:

"I want to thank Michael Atkinson for his service as the Intelligence Community Inspector General. Over the last two years, he turned the Office of the ICIG around, restoring an important organization. I've appreciated his professionalism and responsiveness when working with the Senate Intelligence Committee on a wide range of issues and I wish him the best. 

"Like any political appointee, the Inspector General serves at the behest of the Executive. However, in order to be effective, the IG must be allowed to conduct his or her work independent of internal or external pressure. It is my hope the next nominee for the role of ICIG will uphold the same important standards laid out by Congress when we created this role."
