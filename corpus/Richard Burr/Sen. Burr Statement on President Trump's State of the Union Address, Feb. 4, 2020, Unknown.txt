Sen. Burr Statement on President Trump's State of the Union Address


Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) released the following statement following President Trump's State of the Union address:

"President Trump's address tonight underscored his commitment to delivering commonsense reforms that energize our economy, empower American workers, shape our judiciary, and more.

"Today, Americans of all backgrounds have more opportunities than ever before. We're in the middle of a "blue collar reform,' where Americans who have traditionally been among the lowest earners are now seeing some of the biggest gains. And unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, women, and veterans are all at record lows.

"On top of this remarkable economic growth, the Trump Administration has negotiated four trade deals in the last year: the landmark U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a phase-one trade deal with China, and individual trade agreements with Japan and South Korea. These trade deals give our farmers and manufacturers better access to a free and fair market, finally putting America's interests first.

"And in what is sure to be part of his lasting legacy, President Trump has today appointed more than a fifth of the federal judiciary. Since the President took office, the Senate has confirmed 187 qualified judges, including two Supreme Court Justices, ensuring we have officials on the bench who will uphold the Constitution and the rule of law for decades to come.

"Simply put: Americans are in a better position today than they were four years ago thanks to the work of this Administration. There is still much more work to be done, but it is my hope that my colleagues in the Senate choose to put aside political divisiveness, and work together on our common goal of building a strong, secure, and prosperous America."
