Senator Burr Statement on First Reported Coronavirus Case in North Carolina


Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) released the following statement on the first reported coronavirus case in North Carolina:

"As North Carolina responds to its first reported case of coronavirus, my number one priority remains protecting public health and safety. The U.S. is in a better position than any other nation to handle a public health emergency like coronavirus. But Congress must continue working to make sure first responders have the resources they need and the federal government is using all the tools at its disposal to stem the problem. I will continue working with federal, state, and local officials to ensure they have the support they need to protect North Carolina families and communities."

Earlier today, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a hearing with public health officials at the frontlines of the response from the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on the federal government's response to this public health emergency.
