CDC Awards North Carolina $13.8 Million to Support State and Local Coronavirus Response


Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) awarded North Carolina $13.8 million to support state and local health officials in their response to COVID-19, or the novel coronavirus.

Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), who supported this critical funding in the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, applauded the CDC's award.

"The next few weeks are critical for our efforts to flatten the curve and stop the spread of coronavirus," said Senator Burr.  "We can do this by ensuring our state and local public health officials, who have been working on the frontlines of this outbreak day and night, have the resources they need to protect our communities. This funding will help coordinate and deploy needed supplies throughout the state and increase our ability to test, identify, and track coronavirus cases. I look forward to continuing to work with local partners to make sure we are serving North Carolina communities throughout this public health threat."
