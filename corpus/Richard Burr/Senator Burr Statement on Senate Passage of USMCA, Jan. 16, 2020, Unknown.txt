Senator Burr Statement on Senate Passage of USMCA


Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), member of the Senate Finance Committee, released the following statement after the Senate's passage of President Trump's landmark trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA):

"Congress's passage of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is long-awaited and welcome news for North Carolina's farmers and manufacturers," said Senator Burr. "North Carolina is one of the biggest manufacturing and agricultural producers in the nation. Our small business owners, workers, and farmers rely on free and fair trade to grow their operations, provide for their families, and create more jobs. I was proud to support the USMCA in Committee and in the Senate today. I applaud President Trump for negotiating a deal that puts America's and North Carolina's interests first."

The Senate Finance Committee voted the USMCA out of Committee on January 7, 2020, by a vote of 25-3. The trade agreement passed the Senate on a vote of 89-10 and will head next to the President's desk to be signed into law.
