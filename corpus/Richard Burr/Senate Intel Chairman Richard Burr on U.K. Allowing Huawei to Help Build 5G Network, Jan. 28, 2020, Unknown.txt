Senate Intel Chairman Richard Burr on U.K. Allowing Huawei to Help Build 5G Network


Today, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) released the following statement on the National Security Council of the United Kingdom announcement that it will allow Huawei to build non-critical components of the country's 5G infrastructure:

"I'm deeply troubled by the U.K. government's decision to allow Huawei to build components of the country's 5G network. The risks Huawei poses are well-documented and impossible to ignore; once the door is opened, they may also prove impossible to contain. It is my hope U.K. officials will fully consider the long-term and far-reaching consequences of allowing the Chinese telecom giant, with ties to the Chinese government and intelligence services, access to its burgeoning 5G network. While the U.S. must consider its own security and economic priorities, I'm committed to working with U.S. officials, the U.K., and other allies as we move forward, including by supporting the development of credible alternatives to Huawei."

Earlier this month, Senator Burr joined Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-VA) and a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing the Utilizing Strategic Allied (USA) Telecommunications Act to encourage the development of innovative 5G alternatives.
