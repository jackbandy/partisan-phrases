Intel Chairman Richard Burr on Death of Iran's Qassem Soleimani


Today, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) issued the following statement on the death of Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization:

"Qassem Soleimani was the personification of a state sponsor of terrorism. At his direction, hundreds of American servicemen were killed and thousands more injured. At his urging, U.S. allies were attacked repeatedly and undermined by Iran's Quds Force and their proxies.

"Under Soleimani, Iran has become the single most destabilizing force in the Middle East and an exporter of tyranny throughout the region. The blood of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis, Yemenis, Syrians, Israelis, and countless others is on his hands.

"Soleimani is also responsible in part for Iran's current economic strife, as he put his violent campaigns and the enrichment of the corrupt Quds Force ahead of the interests of the Iranian people. 

"Iran and the Iranian people can now turn away from Soleimani's murderous adventurism, redirect the Quds Force's money into Iran's economy, bring home the troops Soleimani sent abroad, and move forward toward building a more peaceful region."
