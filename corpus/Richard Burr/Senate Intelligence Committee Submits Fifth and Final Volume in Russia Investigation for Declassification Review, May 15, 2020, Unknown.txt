Senate Intelligence Committee Submits Fifth and Final Volume in Russia Investigation for Declassification Review


Today, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) and Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-VA) released the following statement:

"The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has submitted the fifth and final volume of its bipartisan investigative report into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to the Office of Director of National Intelligence for classification review. In addition to submitting the full, classified report, and in order to help facilitate the Intelligence Community's review, we have also submitted what we assess to be a properly redacted, unclassified version of the report, totaling nearly 1,000 pages. It is our hope that ODNI can expeditiously review these documents so that the Committee can consider, vote on, and release the report as soon as possible.

"We want to thank the talented and tireless staff who have contributed to the Committee's investigation. The work they've done has already greatly added to our understanding of and response to foreign threats to our democratic process."

Background:
