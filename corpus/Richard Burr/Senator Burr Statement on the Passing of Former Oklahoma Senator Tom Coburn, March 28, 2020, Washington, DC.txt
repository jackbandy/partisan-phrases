Senator Burr Statement on the Passing of Former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn


Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) released the following statement on the passing of former Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK):

"Tom Coburn was among my closest and dearest friends and I will greatly miss him. Everyone who knew Tom knew he juggled many roles -- physician, public servant, husband, and father -- but was, above all, a devoted Christian. The passion and intention he brought to his work was always a reflection of the faith that sustained him. I hope that same faith provides comfort to the Coburn family during this difficult time. My family's prayers are with them as we mourn this loss."
