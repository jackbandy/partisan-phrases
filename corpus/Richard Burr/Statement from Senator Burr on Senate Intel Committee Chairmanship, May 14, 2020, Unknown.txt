Statement from Senator Burr on Senate Intel Committee Chairmanship


Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) released the following statement:

"This morning, I informed Majority Leader McConnell that I have made the decision to step aside as Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee until this investigation is resolved. The work the Intelligence Committee and its members do is too important to risk hindering in any way. I believe this step is necessary to allow the Committee to continue its essential work free of external distractions."
