Statement from Senate Intel Chairman Burr on Nomination of Rep. John Ratcliffe to DNI


Today, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) released the following statement:

"The work our Intelligence Community does is vital for ensuring America's safety, security, and success. I've appreciated the dedication and skill the men and women of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have shown over the last several months during a period of transition. As I've said before, however, there is no substitute for having a permanent, Senate-confirmed Director of National Intelligence in place to lead our IC. I look forward to receiving Congressman Ratcliffe's official nomination and ushering it through the Senate's regular order."
