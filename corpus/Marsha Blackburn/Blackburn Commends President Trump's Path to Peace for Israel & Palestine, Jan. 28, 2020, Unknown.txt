Blackburn Commends President Trump's Path to Peace for Israel & Palestine


"President Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to ensuring Israel's safety and security. Last year's unprecedented recognition of Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel reaffirmed our commitment to this critical alliance in the Middle East. Today, President Trump presented a path forward to peace which provides the opportunity for Palestinians to eventually have a state of their own." -- Senator Marsha Blackburn
