Blackburn: Their Day Job is Senator & Night Job is Presidential Candidate


Today, Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) spoke with Fox & Friends about her call for the four Senators running for president to recuse themselves from the Senate impeachment trial."

They should recuse themselves. There is precedent," said Senator Blackburn. "This came up in 1868 in the Andrew Johnson impeachmentÂ…. These individuals should say "Look, we're spending millions of dollars to defeat this guy, and we don't want him to be president.' I do not think it is possible to fulfill their oath of impartiality if they are going to be running against him when they're not sitting in the chamber."

BACKGROUND

Last night, Senator Blackburn said: "Tomorrow, one hundred United States Senators will be sworn in to serve in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Four of those Senators must recuse themselves for their unparalleled political interest in seeing this President removed from office. These four Democrats, Senators Bennet, Klobuchar, Sanders, and Warren, cannot sit in judgment of the very President they seek to replace. To participate in this trial would be a failure of the oath they took to do "impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws'. Their presidential ambitions prohibit their ability to view this trial through an objective lens."
