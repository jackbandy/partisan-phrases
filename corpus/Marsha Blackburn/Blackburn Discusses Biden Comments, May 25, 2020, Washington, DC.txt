Blackburn Discusses Biden Comments, Surveillance of Trump Campaign on Sunday Morning Futures


Yesterday, Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) joined Sandra Smith on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures.

On Former Vice President Joe Biden's Comments About African American Voters

"Joe Biden must have missed a lesson from his mother: think before you speak, because this shows what the Democrats think about African American voters. They take it for grantedÂ… It is the exact same thing they do when it comes to gender. They take women for granted. You're not fully a woman unless you're supporting a Democrat."

On Unwarranted Surveillance of the Trump Campaign

"Susan Rice needs to explain exactly what she knew, because she knew the FBI was spying. Jim Comey needs to talk about how this got started. Who cooked up this plot? And how did this set itself afoot?... Here's what Tennesseans tell me: They are sick of this. They are tired of a two-tiered justice system. They are tired of elitists feeling they can push all of this off on the American people and say we're above the law."

On the Potential Unmasking of the Trump Transition Team

"You look at the fact that supposedly they can surveil the entire Trump transition team. I vice chaired that transition team. Devin Nunes was on it. Jeff Sessions was on it. General Flynn was on it. Sandra, were they looking at all of us? Were they surveilling our communications?"

On China Imposing National Security Law on Hong Kong

"The global community knows China had an agreement with Hong Kong: two different sets and two different systems of government. Now they're trying to backtrack on that because their economy is shrinking. The world is looking at them and how they have mishandled the COVID-19 crisis. They want China to pay for this, and now they're seeing China's overreach. I stand with Hong Kong."
