Australian Wildfires


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, for over 100 years, Australia and the  United States have enjoyed a mateship made possible by our mutual  commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. 

  After signing 1951's Australia, New Zealand, United States Security  Treaty, or ANZUS, Treaty, our two nations entered into a new level of  cooperation on military matters; and for the past 15 years, we have  shared our firefighting resources with one another. 

  In August 2018, over 100 Australian firefighters rushed to our aid as  wildfires threatened to destroy communities in California, Oregon, and  Washington. 

  When our Australian friends asked for support last year as they  struggled to contain devastating bushfires, we were happy to return the  favor. 

  I am especially pleased today to honor two Tennesseans who heard the  cries for help and, in spite of the danger, asked, Where do I sign up? 

  Janan Hay Sharp, who serves with the Forest Service, and Tommy M.  Barnes, who serves with the National Park Service, embody the values  that set Tennesseans apart: bravery, compassion, and an eager  willingness to lighten another's load. 

  This month, I was happy to support S. Res. 527, a resolution led by  my friends Senator John Barrasso and Senator Ben Cardin recognizing the  longstanding partnership between the United States and Australia and  honoring firefighters like Janan and Tommy, who rushed toward the  flames to save a friend in danger. 

  They are a rare breed indeed, and today, I encourage all Tennesseans  to take a moment to reflect upon their bravery and their commitment to  a very special ally.
