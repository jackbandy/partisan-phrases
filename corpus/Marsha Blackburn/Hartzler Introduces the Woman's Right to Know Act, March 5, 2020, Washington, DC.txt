Hartzler Introduces the Woman's Right to Know Act


Today, Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler (MO-04) introduced H.R. 6077, the Woman's Right to Know Act. This bill will require abortion providers and their medical staff to inform women of the associated health risks of undergoing an abortion procedure to ensure that they are able to make an informed decision. "States throughout the country have already begun enacting these laws to ensure that women considering abortion procedures have the full breadth of information and knowledge of the consequences surrounding an abortion procedure," Hartzler said. "In any medical decision, knowledge is power-- and this one carries a multitude of mental and physical health risks for women." Specifically, the Woman's Right to Know Act sets reasonable medical requirements for physicians to meet to protect both the life of the mother and the child before an abortion can be performed:

Abortion providers must explain all the medical risks associated with an abortion procedure;

Abortion providers must explain the probable gestational age and development features of the unborn child at the time the abortion is to be performed; and

Abortion providers must present this information at least 24 hours in advance of an abortion procedure.

"I thank Senators Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee for introducing the Senate version of this bill. I'm eager to work with my colleagues to ensure this pro-woman legislation is passed to expand these safeguards for expecting mothers," Hartzler concluded.
