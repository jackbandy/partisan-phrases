Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) joined Fox Business's Mornings with Maria to discuss the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on the Crossfire Hurricane Investigation with former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.


"Rod Rosenstein sat in front of us yesterday and literally puntedÂ…every question. This is the epitome of weak leadership.

"Today we are going to take a vote to subpoena these people, and bring them before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

"We've got a list of [39] people that we want to hear from. We want to know, who all they were surveilling? Who were they unmasking? We're finding out now they wanted to unmask members of the Trump transition. Were they trying to unmask me as I Vice Chaired that transition team? Were they trying to unmask Vice President Pence? 

"This is unbelievable and they would never let something like this happen to their friends, but because they hate, absolutely hate, President Donald Trump, they're trying to roll the dice and see if they can get by with it."
