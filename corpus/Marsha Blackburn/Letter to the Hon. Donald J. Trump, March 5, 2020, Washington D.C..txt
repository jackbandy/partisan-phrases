Letter to the Hon. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States - Tennessee Congressional Delegation Urges President Trump to Approve Federal Disaster Assistance for 6 Tennessee Counties Devastated by Catastrophic Tornadoes


Dear Mr. President,

We are writing to urge you to quickly approve Governor Bill Lee's request to declare a major disaster pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act as a result of the catastrophic tornadoes that struck the Nashville metropolitan area in Davidson County and devastated communities in Putnam, Benton, Wilson, Carroll and Gibson counties on March 3, 2020.

At least 24 Tennesseans lost their lives in these storms, and major damage to homes, buildings, roads, bridges, utilities and businesses in several counties has been reported throughout West and Middle Tennessee, including downtown Nashville.  Images of the devastation are heartbreaking, and federal assistance is needed to help with recovery efforts. 

The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency has been working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and we are grateful for their efforts to respond to our communities' needs.  First responders throughout Tennessee have been working nonstop and we appreciate their bravery.

Governor Lee's request for both Public and Individual Assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act is attached, and we urge you to approve Governor Lee's request on behalf of the State of Tennessee as soon as possible.

Our offices can provide you with any additional information you need.
