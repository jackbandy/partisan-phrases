Blackburn Remembers Fallen Tennessee Law Enforcement Officers During National Police Week


Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) joined Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and her Senate colleagues to honor police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2019, and due to complications from COVID-19 in recent months. She gave the following statement about the resolution:

"We are indebted to our police officers and sheriffs for their service to our country and our communities. In particular, we remember eight Tennesseans who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2019: John Anderson IV, Spencer Bristol, Nicholas Galinger, Matthew Gatti, Steven Hinkle, Joseph Montijo, Debra Porter-Johnson, and Stephen Reece. This year, we also remember those officers who fell ill or passed away due to complications of COVID-19 contracted in the line of duty. Our hearts are with their families and friends."
