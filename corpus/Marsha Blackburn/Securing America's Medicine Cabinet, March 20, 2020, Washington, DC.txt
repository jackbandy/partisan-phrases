Securing America's Medicine Cabinet


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I have spoken several times about the  vulnerabilities in our pharmaceutical supply chain and again encourage  my colleagues to support the bipartisan Securing America's Medicine  Cabinet Act--or SAM-C Act--which I am sponsoring alongside my colleague  from New Jersey, Senator Menendez. 

  Without intervention, the FDA expects the pharmaceutical industry  will continue to rely on Chinese companies to make the active  pharmaceutical ingredients--or the APIs--that are necessary for so many  of our prescription and over-the-counter drugs. The threat it poses to  our supply chain is real. 

  On February 27, 2020, the FDA announced the shortage of one drug that  is used to treat patients with coronavirus. They attributed the  shortage to difficulties obtaining the API from a site in China. That  site has been affected by--guess what--coronavirus. 

  We do not need to remain vulnerable. We need to realize that we are  dealing with someone who has not been transparent. They have hidden  information from us. They are causing shortages of drugs and vaccines  and antibiotics. It is time for us to learn from these lessons. If we  ignore them, we do so at our own peril.
