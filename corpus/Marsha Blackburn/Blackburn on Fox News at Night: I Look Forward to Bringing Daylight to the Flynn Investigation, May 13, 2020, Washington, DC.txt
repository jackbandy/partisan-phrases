Blackburn on Fox News at Night: I Look Forward to Bringing Daylight to the Flynn Investigation


Last night, Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined Shannon Bream on Fox News at Night to discuss the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.

"Somebody cooked up this plot. Somebody gave an order. Somebody did the dirty work. Michael Flynn paid a price. The Trump administration paid a price, and the American taxpayer has footed the bill," said Senator Blackburn on the Obama administration's cover-up of the Flynn investigation. "At the Judiciary Committee, we're going to be able to have some hearings, call some [witnesses], issue some subpoenas. I look forward to being able to bring some daylight to this so that the American people will know what happened when you had basically a taxpayer funded conspiracy that got carried out by the Obama DOJ and FBI."
