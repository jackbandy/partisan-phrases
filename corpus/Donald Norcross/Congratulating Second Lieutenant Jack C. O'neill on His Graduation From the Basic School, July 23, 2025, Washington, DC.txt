Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Second  Lieutenant Jack C. O'Neill on his graduation from The Basic School. I  include in the Record the following proclamation:

Whereas, the United States Marine Corps upholds a proud       tradition of honor, courage, and commitment, and remains one       of the most respected fighting forces in the world; and

Whereas, The Basic School (TBS) in Quantico, Virginia,       provides newly commissioned Marine officers with the critical       leadership skills, warfighting knowledge, and ethical       foundation required to lead Marines in defense of our Nation;       and

Whereas, Second Lieutenant Jack C. O'Neill having earned       his commission through Officer Candidates School, has       distinguished himself through the successful completion of       this rigorous and demanding course of instruction,       demonstrating outstanding physical endurance, tactical       proficiency, and unwavering dedication to the values of the       Marine Corps; and

Whereas, he now prepares to continue his training at the       esteemed Infantry Officer Course, further sharpening his       combat leadership skills and preparing to take command of a       Marine rifle platoon in service to our country; and

Whereas, his achievement marks not only a significant       personal milestone but also a reaffirmation of his solemn       oath to serve and protect the United States of America with       honor and distinction;

Now, therefore be it proclaimed, that I, Congressman Donald       Norcross, Member of the United States House of       Representatives, do hereby congratulate Second Lieutenant       Jack C. O'Neill on his graduation from The Basic School and       commend him for his exemplary service and commitment to the       ideals of freedom, integrity, and duty;

Be it further proclaimed that his leadership and sacrifice       stand as an inspiration to all Americans, and we express our       gratitude and respect as he begins his journey as an officer       in the United States Marine Corps.
