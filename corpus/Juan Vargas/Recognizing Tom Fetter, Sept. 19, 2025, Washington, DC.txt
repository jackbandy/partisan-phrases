Recognizing Tom Fetter


Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, we have giants in San Diego. I rise today to  congratulate one of them, Mr. Tom Fetter, who is being honored as Mr.  San Diego by the San Diego Rotary.

A lifelong San Diegan, Tom was born in 1934 and grew up in Point  Loma. In 1957, he married his beautiful wife, Jane, a La Jollan.

Tom served in the Army before beginning a long and successful  business career in San Diego.

Tom has always been involved in community service, and it has been at  the center of his and Jane's lives. Tom has spent more than five  decades building up the community and serving on the leading boards of  San Diego institutions, which include the San Diego Yacht Club, The  Bishop's School, the Fleet Science Center, the San Diego Zoo, the USD  School of Law, and the San Diego History Center.

Notably, Tom was commodore of the San Diego Yacht Club during its  defense of America's Cup in 1994.

Tom's service to the San Diego Zoo is especially meaningful as his  father served as the zoo's board chairman in the 1960s.

Despite his many achievements, Tom considers his family to be his  greatest success, and they are a great blessing to San Diego.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Tom for everything he has done for San Diego,  and I congratulate him again on this prestigious honor. It is very well  deserved.
