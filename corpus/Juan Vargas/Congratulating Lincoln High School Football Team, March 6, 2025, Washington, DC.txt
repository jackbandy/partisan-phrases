Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Lincoln  High School football team on winning their second State title in 3  years. This was a huge achievement, but it is even more amazing when  you consider what this team had to overcome to get there.

The Hornets spent their entire season on the road, after their field  was deemed unsafe due to water damage. The team boarded buses and  traveled to every single practice. They never played a home game.

Despite these obstacles, this team never gave up. They demonstrated  resilience, grit, and teamwork, and together they brought home the  State championship.

Congratulations again to the Lincoln High School football team. All  the incredible players and coaches have made our entire district and  city proud.
