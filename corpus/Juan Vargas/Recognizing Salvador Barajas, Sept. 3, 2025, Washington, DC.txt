Recognizing Salvador Barajas


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694876/recognizing-salvador-barajas


Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Salvador Barajas,  an outstanding historical muralist and visionary artist, who has worked  tirelessly to preserve history, mental youth, and strengthen  multicultural identity in San Diego.

Mr. Barajas served in the United States Air Force from 1961 to 1964.  During his service,  he worked as a Technical Illustrator, a skill that would later  influence his artistic career. He was recognized as a Newfoundland Air  Force Base Boxing Champion and honorably discharged as Sergeant.

An Associate of Arts graduate of Los Angeles Trade Technical-College,  Mr. Barajas first became involved with Chicano Park in 1973. Since  then, he has been a driving force in the creation, restoration, and  preservation of its murals, negotiating with Caltrans to protect the  park's cultural heritage. Accordingly, he served as the Lead Artist for  the Historical Mural Restoration Project.

Mr. Barajas is the founder of Motivational Design and has completed  more than 500 public art projects throughout Southern California. Some  of his notable works include ``The Founders Mural,'' ``No Border  Wall,'' ``Amor Si Se Puede,'' and ``Amigos Car Club,'' and many others.

He is the recipient of multiple honors, including a Southwestern  College Honorary Degree, inclusion in the Mexican Heritage Foundation's  100 Portraits: Pioneers, Visionaries and Role Models, and recognition  as a San Diego County Library Living Well Legend.

Mr. Barajas lives in South Park with his wife, Leticia Barajas, and  is the proud father of four children, Xochitl, Analilia, Graciela, and  Salvador Jr., all graduates of California universities.

I am proud to honor Salvador Barajas as the 52nd Congressional  District Constituent of the Month for August 2025. His work has  inspired our community and will empower generations to come.
