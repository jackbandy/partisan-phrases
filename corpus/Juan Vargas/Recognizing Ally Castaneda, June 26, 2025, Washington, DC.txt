Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary  public servant, Ally Castaneda, who is departing my office and  Washington, D.C. for a new role.

Ally has been an outstanding member of my team since 2022. She began  her work as a Legislative Correspondent before becoming a Legislative  Assistant, and then a Senior Legislative Assistant.

In every role, Ally was the ultimate professional and went above and  beyond. This job gives us all an incredible opportunity to better  people's lives, and Ally embraced this ideal, She worked hard every day  to serve the people of California's 52nd Congressional District.

Ally led critical pieces of legislation, including the Border Water  Quality Restoration and Protection Act, and helped secure essential  funding for our district. In part because of her tireless advocacy, our  San Diego Congressional delegation has been able to secure millions of  dollars in funding to address cross-border pollution. For instance,  last year Ally worked with staff for the San Diego delegation to  successfully advocate for funding to support environmental  infrastructure in the Tijuana River Valley Watershed to be included in  the Water Resources Development Act.

It is impossible to interact with Ally and not be impressed with her  encyclopedic policy knowledge, attention to detail, and thoroughness.  She was always a trusted voice.

On a personal level, Ally is kind, principled, funny, and generous.  She cares about the people she works with and the constituents she  served in California's 52nd Congressional District. She will be greatly  missed in our office.

I thank Ally for her work, both past and future. We're always rooting  for her.
