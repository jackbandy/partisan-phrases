Amendment No. 1 Offered By Mr. Massie


Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of Representative  Norman's amendment, which would prevent my constituents' hard-earned  taxpayer dollars from funding woke earmarks and handouts to leftist  NGOs that undermine President Trump's agenda and, alarmingly, support  taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries for children.

Buried in the minibus package is $14.3 million in earmarks for  special interest projects across the country. At a time when our  national debt is skyrocketing well past $38 trillion, Members of  Congress should be focused on reining in wasteful spending and funding  the essential functions of our government, not divisive handouts to  NGOs.

Particularly concerning are the millions of dollars in earmarks going  to so-called gender clinics and hospitals that push puberty blockers,  cross-sex hormones, and even perform life-altering surgeries on  vulnerable children.

This is not healthcare funding. This is not healthcare. It is  promoting an ideology that harms children, sidelines parents, ignores  common sense, and contradicts President Trump's executive order to  restore biological truth and prevent the mutilation of our Nation's  children. Plain and simple: Americans' taxpayer dollars should not be  funding child mutilation.

Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to adopt  Representative Norman's amendment to stop this woke and weaponized  funding.
