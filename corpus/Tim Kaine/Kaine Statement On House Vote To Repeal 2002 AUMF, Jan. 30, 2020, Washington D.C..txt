Kaine Statement On House Vote To Repeal 2002 AUMF


Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, released a statement on the House passage of legislation to repeal the 2002 Iraq War AUMF:

"I'm pleased the House passed legislation to repeal the 2002 Iraq War AUMF. It's more important than ever that we repeal these obsolete war authorizations and shoulder our responsibility to determine whether a mission is in the national interest before sending our troops into harm's way. I hope the Senate will swiftly pass our bipartisan war powers resolution to prevent an unauthorized war with Iran and then take up my legislation with Senator Young to repeal the outdated 1991 and 2002 Iraq War authorizations," Kaine said.

For years, Kaine has been the leading voice in Congress raising concerns over Presidents' efforts to expand the use of military force without congressional authorization. Earlier this month, Kaine filed a war powers resolution to prevent further escalation of hostilities with Iran without authorization, which has gained the bipartisan support necessary to pass in the Senate. Last year, Kaine and Senator Young introduced a bipartisan bill to repeal the 1991 and 2002 AUMFs, formalizing the end of the Gulf and Iraq Wars.
