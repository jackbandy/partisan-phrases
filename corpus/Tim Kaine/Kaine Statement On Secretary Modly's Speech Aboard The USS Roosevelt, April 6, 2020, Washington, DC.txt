Kaine Statement On Secretary Modly's Speech Aboard The USS Roosevelt


U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement on Acting U.S. Navy Secretary Thomas Modly's reported speech aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt:

"Based on the transcript I've read, Secretary Modly's comments were completely inappropriate and beneath the office of the Secretary of the Navy. It's deeply disappointing that he would deliver a speech on board a U.S. aircraft carrier suggesting that Captain Crozier might be "stupid' and bashing the media for trying to report the truth. These dedicated sailors deserve better from their leadership."

More than 100 sailors aboard the USS Roosevelt have reportedly tested positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Last week, Senators Warner and Kaine wrote a letter questioning Secretary Modly about the conditions aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt and about any actions being taken to ensure the health and safety of sailors and other military personnel.
