Kaine Statement On Trump Veto Of His Bipartisan War Powers Resolution


Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, released the following statement after President Trump vetoed his bipartisan war powers resolution that passed both the Senate and House. The resolution would prevent further escalation of hostilities with Iran without congressional authorization.

"Last year, in President Trump's State of the Union remarks, he said: "Great nations do not fight endless wars.' But instead of following through on his word, President Trump vetoed legislation that would help avoid unnecessary war in the Middle East. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to override his veto. Unless there's a carefully reached consensus in Congress that war is necessary, we should not be sending our troops into harm's way."

For years, Kaine has been the leading voice in Congress raising concerns over Presidents' efforts to expand the use of military force without congressional authorization. Kaine has introduced bipartisan legislation to repeal the 2002 AUMF and replace the open-ended 2001 AUMF with a narrower authorization. He also introduced a bipartisan amendment to the national defense bill to prohibit unconstitutional war with Iran, which was supported by a bipartisan majority of Senators in June.
