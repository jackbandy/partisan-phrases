Kaine Statement On Trump Administration Proposal To Cap Medicaid Funding


U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, released the following statement after the Trump Administration announced plans to cap Medicaid funding:   

"President Trump is going after families' health care again. Millions of Americans, including nearly 384,000 Virginians, now have coverage through Medicaid thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and many of them are finally able to get the treatment they need for cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and addiction. President Trump's proposal threatens access to that care. We must do everything we can to reject the President's attacks on health care and protect Medicaid."

Kaine has been a leader in efforts to protect the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and improve the health care system to give all Americans access to quality health care they can afford. In 2017, Kaine voted against the Republican proposal that would have taken health care away from millions of Americans and he has spoken out against the Trump Administration's efforts to dismantle the ACA through the courts. Kaine has introduced Medicare-X to provide low-cost, high-quality health care in every zip code.
