U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) applauded $720,441 in federal funding through the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to assist Loudoun County, the City of Manassas, and the City of Norfolk in responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis. The federal funding was made possible through the FY2020 Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding (CESF) program, which was authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supported by Sens. Warner and Kaine.

"Right now, we need to make sure that our local governments can continue to count on the resources they need to keep combating this crisis," said the Senators. "That's why we're glad to know that this federal funding will be used to support additional supplies in Loudoun, Manassas and Norfolk."
