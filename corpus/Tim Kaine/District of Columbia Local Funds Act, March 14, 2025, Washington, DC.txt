District of Columbia Local Funds Act, 2025


Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I can make it fast or slow.

I am joining all of my colleagues to advocate for this bill.

One-third of the Virginia population is a resident of the DC metro  area and enjoys this Capital, and 150,000 Virginians come to work in DC  every day. They want DC police and services to be well funded. Please  support this bill. Thank you.                                Vote on S.1077
