Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolution

  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, on March 27 Congress passed the Coronavirus  Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in response to the  ongoing public health and economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19  pandemic. The CARES Act included a Higher Education Emergency Relief  Fund, which  provided nearly $14 billion in funding to ensure institutions of higher  education could make the transition to distance learning, provide  students with essential supports and resources, and cover the enormous  costs they've incurred during this time. Unfortunately, the  Administration has not followed Congress' intent to provide these  colleges and universities with the increased flexibility they need to  meet the needs of their students. 

  This is why I'm introducing the Coronavirus Relief Flexibility for  Students and Institutions Act, which would fix several implementation  issues with the higher education funds in the CARES Act by providing  institutions of higher education and students with the flexibility  Congress intended. This bill would make an additional 7.5 million  students eligible for emergency financial aid by expanding eligibility  beyond just those who have filled out a FAFSA and are eligible under  Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Additionally, it would allow  institutions of higher education to use CARES Act funds to cover  revenue losses incurred as a result of COVID-19, rather than limiting  the funding to the U.S. Department of Education's narrow interpretation  that funds can only be used for new expenses associated with the  transition of instruction to distance learning. It would also ensure  that colleges hardest hit by COVID-19 are receiving the support they  need by requiring an application to demonstrate such needs, rather than  providing all colleges with $500,000 in taxpayer funds regardless of  size. 

  In this difficult time, colleges desperately need the flexibility to  best serve their students. This bill will help ensure that Secretary  DeVos and the U.S. Department of Education follow Congress' intent to  stabilize our institutions of higher education that are hurting from  COVID-19 and provide emergency financial aid for the students who need  it, not just those that who have met bureaucratic requirements. I hope  the Senate passes this bill quickly to ensure that institutions have  the flexibility and supports they need to continue providing high  quality and equitable access to education for all students as we  continue to weather this pandemic.                                  ______                                   

      By Mr. CRUZ (for himself, Mr. Lee, Mr. Scott of South Carolina,          and Mr. Scott of Florida): 

  S. 3949. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit  kindergarten through grade 12 educational expenses to be paid from a  529 account during the Coronavirus Emergency Period; to the Committee  on Finance.
