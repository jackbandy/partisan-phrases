Kaine Statement On Senate Passage Of Bipartisan War Powers Resolution


Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, released the following statement after the Senate passed his bipartisan war powers resolution to prevent further escalation of hostilities with Iran without congressional authorization by a vote of 55-45:

"With passage of this resolution, we sent a powerful message that we don't support starting a war with Iran unless Congress votes that military action is necessary. If we're to order our young men and women in uniform to risk their lives and health in war, it should be on the basis of careful deliberation. After years of Congress avoiding its constitutional duty on matters of war, I'm grateful that a bipartisan majority of Senators affirmed that the President cannot send our troops into conflict without authorization."

For years, Kaine has been the leading voice in Congress raising concerns over Presidents' efforts to expand the use of military force without congressional authorization. Kaine has introduced bipartisan legislation to repeal the 2002 AUMF and replace the open-ended 2001 AUMF with a narrower authorization. He also introduced a bipartisan amendment to the national defense bill to prohibit unconstitutional war with Iran, which was supported by a bipartisan majority of Senators in June.
