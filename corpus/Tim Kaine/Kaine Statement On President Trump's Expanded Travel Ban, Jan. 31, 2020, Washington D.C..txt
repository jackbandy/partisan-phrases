Kaine Statement On President Trump's Expanded Travel Ban


Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement on President Trump's expanded travel ban:

"President Trump's discriminatory travel ban is un-American. Expanding this ban does not make us any safer and further hurts our country's reputation on the world stage. I hope my colleagues will join me to help pass the NO BAN Act that would put an end to President Trump's prejudiced travel bans."

Kaine has been outspoken against President Trump's discriminatory travel bans. He is a cosponsor of the National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act (NO BAN Act).
