Kaine Statement On Signing Of Historic Gun Safety Legislation In Virginia


Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement after Governor Northam signed into law several gun violence prevention measures:

"These commonsense reforms are an enormous achievement that will make Virginia communities safer. We have seen the scourge of gun violence in the tragedies of Virginia Tech and Virginia Beach and the all too common shootings in our cities and towns. As elected officials, it's our responsibility to learn painful lessons and take steps that can help save lives. I'm so proud of the General Assembly's efforts to pass comprehensive legislation to reduce gun violence. We must build on these efforts at the federal level."

Kaine has long supported commonsense steps to reduce gun violence, including universal background record checks prior to gun purchases. As Governor of Virginia, Kaine helped strengthen the background record check system following the tragic shooting at Virginia Tech. In the Senate, he has also co-sponsored legislation to close loopholes that allow domestic abusers to legally obtain weapons and to incentivize states to implement Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs) to restrict firearms access from individuals who the court determines are a danger to themselves or others.
