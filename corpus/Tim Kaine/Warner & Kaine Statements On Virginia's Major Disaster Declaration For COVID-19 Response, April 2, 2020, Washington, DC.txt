Warner & Kaine Statements On Virginia's Major Disaster Declaration For COVID-19 Response


U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine released the following statements after the President granted a Major Disaster Declaration to help Virginia respond to COVID-19, allowing FEMA to provide emergency protective measures to the Commonwealth at a 75% federal cost share for eligible assistance like medical care; purchase and distribution of food, water, and medicine; and Emergency Operation Center (EOC)-related costs:

"This disaster declaration will trigger important federal resources to help communities recover from COVID-19," said Warner. "Virginia will now be able to utilize a wide range of federal assistance programs to assist those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including crisis counseling, disaster unemployment, supplemental nutrition assistance, and more."

"I'm grateful that Governor Northam's request for a Major Disaster Declaration was approved to help Virginia combat the coronavirus. Last month, I wrote to the Trump Administration urging swift approval of these requests to help ensure Virginia and other states can get the support they need to respond to this pandemic. I'm committed to doing everything I can to push for additional federal resources for the Commonwealth," said Kaine.  

In early March, Kaine joined his colleagues in a letter urging President Trump to immediately consider any disaster declaration requests so states can utilize FEMA's Public Assistance program in their efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and protect public health. Public Assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), to which Congress provided an additional $45 billion in the CARES Act.
