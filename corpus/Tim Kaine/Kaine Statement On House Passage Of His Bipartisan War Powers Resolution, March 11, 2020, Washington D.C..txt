Kaine Statement On House Passage Of His Bipartisan War Powers Resolution


Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, released the following statement after the House passed his bipartisan war powers resolution to prevent further escalation of hostilities with Iran without congressional authorization by a vote of 227-186:

"For years, Congress has abdicated its responsibility on matters of war, but now a bipartisan majority in both the Senate and House has made clear that we shouldn't be engaged in hostilities with Iran without a vote of Congress. This legislation doesn't prevent the President from defending the United States against imminent attack. Rather, the resolution demands that the decision of whether or not we go on offense and send our troops into harm's way should only be made after serious deliberation and a vote of Congress. If President Trump is serious about his promise to stop endless wars, he will sign this resolution into law."

For years, Kaine has been the leading voice in Congress raising concerns over Presidents' efforts to expand the use of military force without congressional authorization. Kaine has introduced bipartisan legislation to repeal the 2002 AUMF and replace the open-ended 2001 AUMF with a narrower authorization. He also introduced a bipartisan amendment to the national defense bill to prohibit unconstitutional war with Iran, which was supported by a bipartisan majority of Senators in June.
