Kaine Announces Support For USMCA


U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement announcing support for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) ahead of votes in Senate committees on the deal next week:

"Canada and Mexico are two of Virginia's largest trading partners, and maintaining a strong trade relationship with them is critical for businesses and farmers across the Commonwealth," said Kaine. "My test for whether I'd support USMCA has always been whether the deal includes strong protections for workers and the environment. After changes negotiated by Democrats with the Administration, I feel confident this bill meets that threshold, and I'll support its passage through Congress."

"The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is vital to ensuring Virginia businesses and farmers have duty-free access to nearly all sectors of the North American market," said Virginia Chamber President & CEO Barry DuVal. "With more than 300,000 jobs throughout the Commonwealth supported by international trade, we appreciate Senator Kaine's support for this landmark trade agreement and his leadership toward strengthening Virginia's position in the global economy."
