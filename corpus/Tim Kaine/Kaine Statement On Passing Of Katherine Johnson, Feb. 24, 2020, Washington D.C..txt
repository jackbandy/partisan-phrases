Kaine Statement On Passing Of Katherine Johnson


Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement on the passing of Katherine Johnson:

"Katherine Johnson helped realize one of humankind's oldest dreams--to reach the stars. Hidden no longer, she will be remembered for her contributions to math and science and forever stand as a role model for those whose talents are not fully recognized because of prejudice. I am deeply saddened to hear of her passing, and my condolences go out to her family, my fellow Virginians, the NASA community, and everyone else who held her as a hero."

In November, Senators Kaine and Warner's bill to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Johnson, Dr. Christine Darden, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson for their work at NASA Langley was signed into law.
