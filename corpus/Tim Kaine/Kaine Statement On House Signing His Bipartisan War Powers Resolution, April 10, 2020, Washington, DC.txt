Kaine Statement On House Signing His Bipartisan War Powers Resolution


Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, released the following statement after his bipartisan war powers resolution was signed by the House. The resolution, which would prevent further escalation of hostilities with Iran without congressional authorization, passed the House last month after passing the Senate in February. It will next go to the Senate for signature and then be presented to President Trump for signature or veto.

"Today, the House signed my resolution establishing that we should not go to war with Iran unless Congress votes to do so. It doesn't stop the President from defending the U.S. from imminent attack or taking steps against terrorist groups or militias attacking our troops in the Middle East. But it makes clear that we should not enter a new war without the Congressional debate and vote our Constitution requires. I hope the President signs the resolution thereby honoring his frequent claim that the U.S. should not be involved in endless wars."

For years, Kaine has been the leading voice in Congress raising concerns over Presidents' efforts to expand the use of military force without congressional authorization. Kaine has introduced bipartisan legislation to repeal the 2002 AUMF and replace the open-ended 2001 AUMF with a narrower authorization. He also introduced a bipartisan amendment to the national defense bill to prohibit unconstitutional war with Iran, which was supported by a bipartisan majority of Senators in June.
