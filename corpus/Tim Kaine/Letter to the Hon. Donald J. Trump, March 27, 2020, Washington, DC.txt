Letter to the Hon. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States - Spanberger Joins Members of Virginia Delegation Urging Trump Administration to Approve Virginia National Guard Funding Request Amid Coronavirus Pandemic


Dear President Trump,

We write to urge you to quickly approve the request made by Governor Ralph Northam for additional authorities and funding under Title 32 U.S. Code 502(f)(2)(A) to assist the Commonwealth of Virginia to combat the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Governor Northam requests this authority and funding for the Virginia National Guard as they work to respond to incidents related to the preservation of life and property in connection with COVID-19 emergency response efforts.

On March 24, Governor Northam determined the need to increase the Virginia National Guard force to full time status and intends to utilize the Virginia National Guard to fulfill immediate COVID-19 emergency response requirements across the Commonwealth.

We urge your prompt approval of this request so Governor Northam may fully task the Virginia National Guard as he finds necessary to support the Commonwealth's COVID-19 response efforts in support of this National emergency declaration. Thank you for your timely support to this important request.
