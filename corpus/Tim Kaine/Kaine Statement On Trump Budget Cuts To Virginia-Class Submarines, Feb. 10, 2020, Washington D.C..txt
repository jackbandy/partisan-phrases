Kaine Statement On Trump Budget Cuts To Virginia-Class Submarines


U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released the following statement on President Trump's proposed budget cuts to Virginia-class submarines for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY 2021). The President's budget only proposes funding for the construction of one Virginia-class submarine, a 50% reduction from last year's budget and a departure from the Navy's longstanding projection that two Virginia-class submarines would be funded each year. Virginia-class submarines are constructed, in part, at Newport News Shipbuilding.

"I'm concerned that the President's budget proposal dramatically cuts funding for Virginia-class submarines. For years, robust funding for these submarines has strengthened our national security and our shipbuilding industry in Hampton Roads. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I'm going to push hard to reject this budget cut and ensure full funding for two Virginia-class submarines."

Kaine has been a strong supporter of funding for Virginia-class submarines and has discussed the benefits of them with military leadership.
