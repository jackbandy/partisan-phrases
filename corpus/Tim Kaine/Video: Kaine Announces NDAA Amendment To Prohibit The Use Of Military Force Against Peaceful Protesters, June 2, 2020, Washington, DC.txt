Video: Kaine Announces NDAA Amendment To Prohibit The Use Of Military Force Against Peaceful Protesters


Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), announced that he will introduce an amendment to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to prevent the use of military force against American citizens exercising their first amendment rights. The Armed Services Committee will take up the NDAA next week.

"The President is trying to turn the American military against American citizens who are peacefully protesting on domestic soil, which they have every right to do. I'm not going to stand for it," Kaine said. "As an Armed Services Committee member, proud supporter of our military, father of a U.S. Marine, and Senator representing a state so closely connected to the military, I can tell you: this is not what the United States military is for. I never thought we would have to use the NDAA to make clear that the U.S. military shouldn't be used as an agent of force against American citizens who are lawfully assembling. I thought that would seem obvious to everyone. But as we take up the NDAA next week, I'm going to be pushing to ensure the President can't treat the U.S. military as his personal palace guard to try to ward off peaceful protests."
