National Salvation Army Week


Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize May 12 to May 18,  2025, as National Salvation Army Week.

Founded in 1865, the Salvation Army has been unfailingly committed to  serving those in need without discrimination. For more than 150 years,  the Salvation Army has provided essential social services, including  disaster relief, food assistance, shelter, rehabilitation programs, and  youth development initiatives in local communities across the United  States.

The Salvation Army serves more than 27 million Americans annually,  offering compassion, hope, and support to the most vulnerable  populations, including individuals experiencing homelessness, veterans,  seniors, human trafficking survivors, and those recovering from  addiction. Across the Nation, the Salvation Army operates shelters,  food pantries, job training programs, and emergency disaster relief  efforts that strengthen communities and improve lives.

The Salvation Army continues to be a trusted partner at the local,  State, and Federal levels, providing critical services that address  poverty, hunger, and natural disasters. Volunteers, donors, and  officers of the Salvation Army exemplify the spirit of service, working  tirelessly to provide relief and opportunity for those in need--and  should be recognized and commended for their commitment to the  betterment of others. I am grateful for the work that the Salvation  Army accomplishes every day and applaud its dedication to social  service.
