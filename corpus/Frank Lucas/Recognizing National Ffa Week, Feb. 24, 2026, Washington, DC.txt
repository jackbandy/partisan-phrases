Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor an organization that  has shaped much of my life and to recognize the young leaders who are  the future of this great Nation.

This week marks National FFA Week, and as a product of FFA myself, I  know firsthand the values, knowledge, and character it instilled in me.

This year, the over 1 million students enrolled in FFA are led by  their National FFA Officer Team and the National FFA President, Mr.  Trey Myers of Perkins, Oklahoma.

A native of Oklahoma's Third Congressional District and a student at  Oklahoma State University, Mr. Myers is responsible for leading and  shaping the future of FFA. Those who know Trey know his strong Oklahoma  roots and his heart of service for those around him, as well as his  dedication to his family, his country, and his faith.

We are all looking forward to the great things that Trey and his  officer teammates will accomplish this year in that famous blue and  gold jacket.

Happy National FFA Week.
