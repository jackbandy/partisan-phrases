Doe and Usda Interagency Research Act


Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1326, the DOE and  USDA Interagency Research Act. This bill allows the Department of  Energy and the Department of Agriculture to work together to improve  how we grow our food, fiber, and fuel in America.

I introduced this bill in the last Congress with the help of the  ranking member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Ms.  Lofgren. The measure passed with unanimous support through the  committee and by voice vote on the House floor.

As a farmer and rancher myself, I am proud to sponsor this bill,  which will help us address cross-cutting research challenges that will  advance crop science, maximize carbon storage, enhance precision  agriculture technologies, and much more.

DOE and USDA already have a successful track record of collaboration  to mitigate invasive species, modernize the grid, address the energy- water nexus, develop biofuels, and improve agriculture operations.

DOE has some of our country's most advanced computing capacities, as  well as world-class research facilities and a depth of scientific  expertise.

These resources can be used to support the work being done by  America's farmers and ranchers, ultimately strengthening our  agricultural production.

This bill before us today is a smart, bipartisan legislation that  codifies the partnership between DOE and USDA, ensuring that they can  continue to work together on these interindustry challenges.

I thank Ms. Lofgren for working with me these past two Congresses on  this bill, and I deeply appreciate her support of agricultural  research. It is always a pleasure to be on the floor with Ms. Stevens  from Michigan.

I urge all my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill.
