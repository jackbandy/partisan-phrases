America Faces A Housing Crisis

Mr. LICCARDO. Mr. Speaker, America faces a housing crisis. One part  of the solution to that crisis, though, lies right in our backyards.  The solution has many names: granny flats, backyard cottages, or  accessory dwelling units, but all expand our affordable housing supply.

When I was mayor of San Jose, we made building backyard apartments  easier by enabling thousands of homeowners to be able to get their  permits online in a single day. The problem, though, is that many  homeowners of modest means could never get a shovel in the ground  because they couldn't get financing.

We talked to the banks and the banks said they would lend if  homeowners could get FHA insurance, or if Fannie or Freddie would  backstop the loans.

Today, along with my Republican colleague  Andrew Garbarino, I have  introduced a bill to do just that. The bipartisan SUPPLY Act will  empower homeowners to become home providers.

Mr. Speaker, together we can make affordable housing a reality for  thousands more Americans.
