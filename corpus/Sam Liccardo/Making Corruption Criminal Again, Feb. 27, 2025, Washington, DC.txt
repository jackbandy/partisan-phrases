Making Corruption Criminal Again


Mr. LICCARDO. Mr. Speaker, let's make corruption criminal again.

Three days before his inauguration, President-elect Trump launched  the Trump meme coin. Trump's partners and some investors based in China  pumped up the price, making hundreds of millions of dollars with early  selling while the price was high.

As they sold, though, the price plummeted. They duped more than  800,000 Americans, who collectively lost $2 billion. Welcome to what  experts refer to as a ``rug pull.''

When I was a criminal prosecutor, we had a different name for this.  It was ``corruption.''

Foreign interests got the best Presidency money can buy. Donald Trump  got richer, and Americans got screwed.

Today, I introduced the MEME Act, which prohibits top Federal  officials from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting financial assets, with  criminal and civil penalties.

Mr. Speaker, our public offices do not belong to us. They belong to  the American people, and they are not for sale.
