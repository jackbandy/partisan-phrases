Mr. LICCARDO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary life of Colonel Vu Van Loc, a South Vietnamese Army  veteran and beloved community member and leader in San Jose, for his  selfless dedication to Vietnamese refugees and to cultural  preservation.

Born in 1933 in northern Vietnam, Loc Vu and his family fled their  homeland during the fall of Saigon, ultimately finding refuge in San  Jose, California, the largest community of ethnic Vietnamese of any  city outside of Vietnam.

Soon after arriving, Loc Vu founded the Immigrant Resettlement and  Cultural Center to aid fellow refugees in rebuilding their lives. Over  the next four decades, the IRCC became a lifeline to Vietnamese,  Cambodian, and Laotian families throughout our region.

He also founded, funded, and passionately led the creation of the  Museum of the Boat People and the Republic of Vietnam to ensure future  generations understand the tremendous sacrifice, courage, and  resilience of the thousands who came to our shores after the Vietnam  war.

Loc Vu passed away peacefully this November at the age of 92. I was  fortunate to have known Loc Vu for two decades, and I will miss our  community's friend, mentor, and leader. His legacy lives on in the  hearts of the more than 20,000 neighbors he has helped to support and  uplift.
