Living Up to the Promise of America


Mr. LICCARDO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the 50th  anniversary of Black April.

As Pulitzer Prize-winning author and one of San Jose's favorite sons,  Viet Nguyen, has written: ``All wars are fought twice; once on the  battlefield and a second time in memory.''

On this day, 50 years ago, fathers, mothers, sisters, and brothers  looked out across a vast ocean as Saigon was falling behind them. Among  them was Helen, my constituent, who watched as her aunt boarded a boat,  and days later she would also follow the path of Vietnamese refugees on  to San Jose in my district, which proudly boasts the largest population  of ethnically Vietnamese people of any city in the world outside of  Vietnam.

Helen's journey was filled with horror and hardship, but rooted in  hope, hope for a life with freedom and opportunity. We must honor her  hope by living up to the promise of America, by fulfilling our  democratic values, and by embracing those who come to America from  around the world earnestly seeking freedom, as she did.
