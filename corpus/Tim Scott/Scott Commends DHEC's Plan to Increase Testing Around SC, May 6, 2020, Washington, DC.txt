Scott Commends DHEC's Plan to Increase Testing Around SC, in Nursing Homes


Following news from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) that COVID-19 testing will be dramatically increased across the state, including for all residents and staff at nursing homes, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) released the following statement.

"Increased testing is absolutely critical as our state begins to reopen. Last week, I wrote Governor McMaster regarding the immediate importance of testing in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, and I am pleased that DHEC's plan to ramp up testing tackles this issue directly. Across the world, nursing homes have time and time again turned into hotspots for the spread of the virus, making it clear they are an essential starting point as tests become more widely available. I commend the Governor and his team for getting this plan together quickly, and look forward to this increased testing enhancing our ability to stop the spread of COVID-19 in South Carolina." 

Earlier today, DHEC announced they will be testing more than 200,000 South Carolinians in the next two months, including all 40,000 residents and staff at South Carolina's nursing homes.
