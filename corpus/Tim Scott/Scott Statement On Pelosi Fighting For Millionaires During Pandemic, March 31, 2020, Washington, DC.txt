Scott Statement On Pelosi Fighting For Millionaires During Pandemic


Yesterday, it came to light House Speaker Nancy Pelosi thinks the next round of Coronavirus relief legislation should include a "full rollback of the limit on the state and local tax deduction (SALT)." Estimates show that if this change were instituted, more than half of the dollars would go to millionaires, and nearly all would go to those making more than $200,000 a year. U.S. Senator Scott (R-SC) released the following statement:

"After wasting four days trying to pass the Green New Deal as part of the last coronavirus relief package, now Speaker Pelosi wants to hand out billions of dollars to millionaires," Scott said. "This is offensive to the American people, counterproductive to helping those most in need, and would never pass the Senate. Pandemic relief is supposed to help the American people, Speaker Pelosi, not serve as a grab bag for your liberal wish list."
