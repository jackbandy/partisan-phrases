Sen. Tim Scott on Speaker Pelosi Finally Transferring Impeachment Articles to Senate


U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) released the statement below following the Speaker's announcement:

"If Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats truly believed that the president was a national security risk, why did they wait twenty-eight days to send the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate? Let's be frank and call it what it is--a political stunt that has backfired on her party. Despite the antics of House Democrats, I look forward to conducting a fair and speedy trial in the Senate so we can put this behind us and continue working on an agenda that puts every day Americans first."
