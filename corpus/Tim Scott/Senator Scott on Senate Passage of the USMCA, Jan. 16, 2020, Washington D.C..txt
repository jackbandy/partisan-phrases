Senator Scott on Senate Passage of the USMCA


Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) released the following statement upon Senate passage of the United States-Canada-Mexico Agreement:

"Presidents in the past have campaigned on renegotiating our multilateral trade deals and failed to produce results. Make no mistake, this is a major win for not just President Trump's agenda, but our nation as a whole.

"I support and voted for the USMCA, and I also want to make certain moving forward that we don't stifle growth and innovation in the process. Specifically, I will continue to keep an eye on how the rules and regulations surrounding the automotive industry are carried out."
