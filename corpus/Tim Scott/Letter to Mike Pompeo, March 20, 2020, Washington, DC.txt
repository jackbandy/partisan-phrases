Letter to Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State - Senator Scott Sends Letter to State Department to Expedite Safe Return of Americans Stuck Overseas due to COVID-19


Dear Secretary Pompeo,

As you know, due to COVID-19 many countries shut down their borders with very limited or no notice to individuals from other countries. As a result, there are American citizens stuck in multiple countries with no means of returning home. 

My staff has been working with the Office of American Citizens Services and Crisis Management this past week to identify American citizens in the various countries (see the attached list). We appreciate your working with us to help these individuals. 

It was brought to our attention early today that a South Carolinian currently unable to leave Peru is running out of their heart medication. I am both concerned for their health, as well as the probability others are also in this situation. The longer our American citizens are unable to return home, the potential medical issues will escalate, not to mention financial pressures placed on those being forced to pay for lodging and other expenses for far longer than they anticipated. 

Please expedite as quickly and as safely as possible the return of American citizens to our country. This is a difficult time for all of us, and we need to bring our citizens back home to their families. If my staff or I can be of assistance, please contact me immediately.

Sincerely,
