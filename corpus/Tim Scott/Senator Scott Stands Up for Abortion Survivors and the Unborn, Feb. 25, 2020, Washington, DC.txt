Senator Scott Stands Up for Abortion Survivors and the Unborn


U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) today released the following statement after voting for S.311, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act: 

"I work every day to advance an agenda that values the dignity and worth of every individual. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is about granting the proper healthcare to precious babies who have survived botched abortion procedures. I will not allow the intentional suffering and death of any child. All lives are intrinsically valuable and we must do everything to grant children access to their God-given right to live," Scott said.

The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would amend the criminal code to "prohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion." Currently, only some states have protections for the survivors; this legislation would set a federal standard.

Scott delivered a powerful speech on the legislation last year.

 Scott also voted for S.3275, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.

 The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill Scott cosponsored with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), prohibits elective abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Scientific studies show that after 20 weeks of pregnancy, an unborn child is able to experience physical pain. The United States is one of only seven countries worldwide that allows elective abortion so late in a pregnancy.
