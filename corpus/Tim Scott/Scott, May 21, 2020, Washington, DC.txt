Scott, Colleagues Introduce Helping Gig Economy Workers Act


Today, Senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Senator Mike Braun (R-IN), Senator Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), , and Congresswoman Caroline Miller (R-WV) will introduce the Helping Gig Economy Workers Act, which will allow businesses to provide contractors with employee assistance without being penalized by miscategorizing them as full-time employees.

"In the wake of COVID-19, our recovery will be powered, in part, by independent contractors and the gig economy," Senator Tim Scott said. "The Helping Gig Economy Workers Act will ensure that businesses can offer the proper support to people working every day to deliver food, offer transportation to those who might not otherwise have access to it, and provide a variety of other goods and services. From Uber and Lyft drivers, throughout the entire gig economy, many workers prefer their independent contractor status, and keeping that intact is absolutely critical."

"As Main Street Entrepreneur who has created hundreds of permanent jobs and hired temporary contract workers, I know this legislation will let businesses like Uber, Lyft, and others provide COVID-19 assistance through bonuses, cleaning materials, hand sanitizer, and other goods without being penalized for their goodwill," said U.S. Senator Mike Braun. "Bottom line: this commonsense bill will provide a safe harbor for businesses who want to help the temporary and service workers helping us during COVID-19."
