Senator Scott To Serve on Presidential Task Force on Reopening the Economy


After talking with President Donald Trump this morning, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) announced he will serve as a member of the President's Task Force on reopening the economy. Scott released the following statement:

"As our nation faces an unprecedented crisis in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical that we put plans in place to both keep Americans healthy and restart our economy. I want to thank President Trump for the opportunity to serve our nation on this task force, and I will be working with colleagues on both sides of the Capitol to tackle the wide range of issues facing American families and workers right now. As a former small business owner, I know just how important it is to both workers and our communities that we find a safe, responsible path to getting folks back to work and our economy back online."
