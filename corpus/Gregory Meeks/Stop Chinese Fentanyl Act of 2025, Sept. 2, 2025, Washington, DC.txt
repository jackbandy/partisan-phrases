Stop Chinese Fentanyl Act of 2025


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 747, as amended.

The opioid crisis has claimed too many lives. We have seen some real  progress the last few years in part because of domestic and  international policies put in place by President Biden, including  getting President Xi to do more to stop fentanyl precursors from  reaching our shores. Of course, the issue is far from solved.

This bill will strengthen sanctions on major Chinese producers of  fentanyl and those who aid and abet opioid traffickers. If you are  knowingly sending deadly chemicals to American citizens, you absolutely  must be sanctioned, and I would encourage President Trump and Secretary  Bessent to focus more on this issue.

That said, we cannot sanction our way out of the fentanyl crisis.  Sanctions are an important tool, but cooperation is essential. If we  want countries to limit the fentanyl precursor exports and prevent  these substances from entering our communities, we need the active  partnership of law enforcement in nations like China and Mexico.

This is just a simple fact. Tough talk has its place, but effective  diplomacy and law enforcement cooperation are indispensable.

Let me be clear. Use of military force is not a viable solution.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative Barr, for his advocacy  on this important issue. Congress works on behalf of the American  people best when we work together, and Mr. Barr and I worked together  on several issues in this Congress. Both sides worked in good faith to  get this bill done last Congress and again here today.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

As I have indicated, I support this bill because sanctions have a  role in curbing the opioid crisis, but they are only a sliver of the  solution.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
