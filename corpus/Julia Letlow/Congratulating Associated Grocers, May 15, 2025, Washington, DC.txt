Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the 75th  anniversary of Associated Grocers, Inc. of Baton Rouge. For 75 years,  this organization has been a steadfast partner to locally owned  supermarkets, supporting small businesses, sustaining local jobs, and  fostering economic growth across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.

Associated Grocers was founded in 1950 by a group of visionary  independent grocers who understood the power of collaboration in a  competitive marketplace. Over the decades, this cooperative has grown  to serve more than 200 independent retailers, a model that strengthens  local economies and ensures that consumers have access to fresh,  quality foods, even in rural and underserved areas.

Congratulations to Associated Grocers, Inc. of Baton Rouge on this  milestone anniversary. May their legacy of service, partnership, and  community leadership continue to inspire future generations.
