Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Louisiana State  University baseball team for taking home their eighth national title.

Under the leadership of Coach Jay Johnson, LSU captured their second  title in 3 years. The Tigers triumphed through their championship  season with 53 wins and an undefeated College World Series.

Coach Johnson and his team exemplified excellence on and off the  field, making Louisiana proud of not only their athleticism but also  their outstanding character and service to the Baton Rouge community.

As LSU's Representative in Congress, I joined my constituents in  following the team's journey to yet another championship. ESPN this  week referred to LSU as the ``Greatest Ever College Baseball Program,''  and I couldn't agree more.

This victory wasn't just about raising the trophy at the end. It was  a testament to the resilient, winning spirit of our State.

I thank the players, coaches, and staff for inspiring a new  generation of Tigers to dream big and for representing Louisiana with  honor on the national stage.

Congratulations. Geaux Tigers.
