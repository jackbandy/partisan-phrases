Ms. CROCKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an exceptional  member of our community, Mr. Robert Phillips, the recipient of D  Magazine's Volunteer of the Year Award.

For more than two decades, Mr. Phillips has dedicated thousands of  hours to serving low-income families through the Ferguson Road  Initiative's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Program. His  unwavering commitment to accurate, free tax preparation has made him a  cornerstone of this vital effort--and a source of immense pride for our  district.

As both a tax preparer and site coordinator at two VITA locations,  Mr. Phillips has helped thousands of individuals and families navigate  the tax system--even during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when  many other sites were forced to close. Thanks to his dedication, and  that of fellow volunteers, the program has completed over 17,900 tax  returns, returned more than $3.3 million to the community, and saved  taxpayers an estimated $300,000 in fees.

Mr. Phillips' selfless service and steadfast leadership have helped  ensure financial stability for countless Dallas residents. He has also  mentored and supported fellow volunteers, strengthening the very fabric  of our community.

I am deeply grateful for Robert's contributions and proud to  represent him in Congress. I congratulate him on this well-deserved  recognition and wish him continued success in all his endeavors.
