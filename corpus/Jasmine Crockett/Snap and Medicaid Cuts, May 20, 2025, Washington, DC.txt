Snap and Medicaid Cuts

Ms. CROCKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for a 28-year-old single  mother of five in my district. She is doing everything right. She is  working hard, raising her babies, and trying to keep them fed and  healthy.

She was receiving $1,000 a month in SNAP benefits. Then one day it  was suddenly cut to $500. She picked up more hours because that is what  moms do.

In this bill they talk about people being lazy. I just want to say  that the only thing that is lazy about this bill is their lies. That is  because when we think about their lies and their lying, it relates to  those who are going to be subjected to the work requirements.

There are lies about cutting almost 14 million people off their  healthcare. Frankly, they lie about this being fiscally responsible.  You don't have to believe me, Mr. Speaker. Just Google members of the  Freedom Caucus and their objections. They hate the fact that after all  of this, we are going to have death, malnutrition, and the shuttering  of hospitals both in rural and urban America. Yet still, they are going  to drive us into further debt.

When we talk about cutting SNAP, she was only going to get $15 a day  or $2.50 per person.

Mr. Speaker, we need to make sure that we don't choose cruelty over  competency, callousness over compassion, and cons over constituents.

Mr. Speaker, tell Republicans where they can cram this crap.
