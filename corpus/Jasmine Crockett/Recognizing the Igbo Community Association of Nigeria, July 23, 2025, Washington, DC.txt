Ms. CROCKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great joy and honor to  recognize the Igbo Community Association of Nigeria (ICAN) DFW and its  annual Igbo Day Celebration.

For over 25 years, ICAN DFW has played a pivotal role in preserving  the rich customs, language, values, and traditions of the Igbo people,  while also fostering cross-cultural understanding throughout the  Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. The annual Igbo Day Celebration is much  more than a cultural gathering--it is a powerful celebration of  identity.

ICAN DFW has been instrumental in building bridges across  communities, empowering families, and supporting generations of Igbo  descendants as they navigate life in the diaspora. From cultural  education and youth mentorship to advocacy and charitable outreach,  ICAN DFW has consistently demonstrated what it means to lead with  purpose and pride.

The Igbo Day Celebration stands as a vibrant reminder of the strength  and beauty of the Igbo spirit. It is a time to reflect on the Igbo  heritage, honor ancestors, and inspire future generations to carry the  legacy forward.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the Igbo Community Association of Nigeria  DFW's continued dedication to cultural enrichment, community service,  and social impact. Their efforts have not only strengthened the Igbo  community but have enriched the broader Dallas- Fort Worth landscape. I  congratulate them once again on this remarkable occasion and wish them  continued success, growth, and many more milestones in the years ahead.
