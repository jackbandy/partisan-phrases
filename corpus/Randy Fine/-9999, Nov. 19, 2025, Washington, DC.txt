Mr. FINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize First Lieutenant  Duncan DeMarsh, a proud lifelong resident of Volusia County and an  outstanding young leader who will soon deploy for 1 year to the Middle  East with the Florida Army National Guard in service to our Nation.

First Lieutenant DeMarsh has distinguished himself through his public  service as the legislative aide to my friend, State Representative  Tramont, where he worked tirelessly on behalf of the people of Florida.  He was also elected vice chairman of the Volusia Republican Party,  where he helped secure important victories in the most recent election.

As he prepares for his deployment, I express my deep gratitude not  only to Duncan, but also to his new bride, Savanna DeMarsh, and the  rest of their family, who share in the sacrifice that military life  demands. Their strength and support make his service possible.

We in Congress and the American people are indebted to the brave men  and women who stand watch on our behalf. I ask my colleagues to join me  in wishing First Lieutenant Duncan DeMarsh a safe mission and a swift  return home.
