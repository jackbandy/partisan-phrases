Recognizing Usaf Chief Master Sergeant Jason Q. Shaffer


Mr. FINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a warrior of the  United States Air Force, Chief Master Sergeant Jason Q. Shaffer.

Chief Shaffer embodies the mindset and diligence that is needed to  defend our Nation. He entered the Air Force in March 2000 as a security  forces member and has been serving for 25 years.

During his time in the Air Force, he developed an impressive  background, which includes experience at varying levels in the Security  Forces. He has participated in operations in Africa, Europe, the Middle  East, South Asia, and the Pacific region. He is now retiring after all  of that time.

Being a servicemember is tough. It is demanding, and the time spent  away from your family is even harder. Yet, we can never forget to thank  those who make that sacrifice.

I thank him; his wife, Tawny; and his children, Dallas, Ashlynn, and  Teagan, for making sacrifices so our Nation can prosper.

Chief Jason, Aim High and have a happy retirement.
