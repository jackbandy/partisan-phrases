Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. FINE. Mr. Speaker, I have heard from my colleagues on the other  side that we should be focused on issues that matter, that we should be  thinking about our kids.

As I lay awake at night here in Washington--I have only been here a  couple months, but as bad as I thought it was going to be. It is far  worse because Rome is burning and too many people in this building say  that that is a great opportunity to roast marshmallows.

The fact of the matter is, if we can't make these cuts, which are as  simple and as easy as you would think--$6 million to fund media in  Gaza, funding PBS and NPR--even if it was a good idea, you can't do it  when you are borrowing trillions of dollars a year.

If we can't make these cuts, which should be the easiest imaginable  cuts, then there is no hope for us. I am grateful to my leadership for  bringing this forward. I am grateful to President Trump for doing it,  but make no mistake: This is only the first step if we want to put out  the fire.
