Serving 35 Years Ago As A Page on the House Floor


Mr. FINE. Mr. Speaker, every time I come on to this floor, I marvel  at the fact that I get the opportunity to serve here, but today it  means a lot more because 35 years ago as a page in this institution, my  mom used to come and watch me every day.

She would come and sit in the gallery over there never knowing that  35 years later, her son would ultimately serve in Congress. Frankly,  had you asked me 1 year ago today, I would have told you that I would  not expect to be serving here.

However, it was 1 year ago today that my mom died. It was 5 days  after that that President Trump asked me to run. Today, as I mourn my  mother on the 1-year anniversary of her death, I think of all of the  things that I can do to make sure that I make her proud in how I served  her every day because as I often say to my constituents, I won't let  you down because I am not going to let her down.
