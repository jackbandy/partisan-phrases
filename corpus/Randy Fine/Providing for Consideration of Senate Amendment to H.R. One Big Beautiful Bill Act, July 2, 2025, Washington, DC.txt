Mr. FINE. Mr. Speaker, as I sat here and listened to that panoply of  speeches or motions over the last few seconds, I was reminded of the  fact that when we say there should be no cuts to Medicaid, we are  saying there should be no  cuts to illegal immigrants who are getting Medicaid.

We live in a world where we spend more money than we bring in, and it  is not fair to actual Americans to be forced to take on additional debt  to give benefits to people who are not in this country legally.

Mr. Speaker, I note that the Democrats have not proposed a solution  that would allow us to continue to give benefits to people who  shouldn't be here anyway and pay for them without our children going  into future debt. We must keep that in mind.

I am here to fight for Americans, and that is what this bill does.
