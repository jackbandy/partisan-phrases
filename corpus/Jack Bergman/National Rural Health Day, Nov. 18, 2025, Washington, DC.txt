National Rural Health Day


Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, in small towns and communities across  America, rural hospitals are critical lifelines. They provide emergency  care, support seniors and veterans, deliver behavioral health services,  assist mothers who are giving birth, supply pharmacy services, and  serve as major local employers.

Yet, many rural hospitals are under serious strain. Nearly half are  operating at negative margins. Since 2010, more than 150 rural  hospitals have cut inpatient services or closed their doors  permanently, including some in northern Michigan and the Upper  Peninsula.

These closures aren't happening because communities don't need care  but because the financial reality of providing it in rural America  keeps getting tougher.

When a rural hospital closes, families face hours-long drives in  emergency situations, expectant mothers lose access to obstetric care,  and seniors suffering from a heart attack or a stroke may arrive too  late.

As we mark National Rural Health Day this week, we must renew and  strengthen our commitment to rural hospitals by ensuring fair  reimbursement, strengthening telehealth and infrastructure, and  preserving access to critical resources like the 340B drug program, a  key revenue stream for rural hospitals.

Rural hospitals must not only survive but thrive. We need to keep  that because it is not about ZIP Codes.
