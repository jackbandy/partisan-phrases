Recognizing Ms. Camilla ``cam'' Williams for Her Dedicated Service to the Republican Party


Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize and honor Camilla  ``Cam'' Williams for her extraordinary dedication, service, and  unwavering commitment to the Republican Party and to our shared  conservative values.

For well over a decade, Cam has been a faithful Republican precinct  delegate and a constant presence in efforts to support Republican  candidates at the local, state, and national level. She has given  countless hours of her time to ensure that our Party's message is heard  and that our candidates have the support they need to succeed.

Cam has set records in the State of Michigan for the most phone calls  made in support of Republican candidates, an achievement that  demonstrates not only her dedication, but also her determination to  connect with voters and strengthen our Nation through grassroots  engagement. She has given thousands of hours of volunteer service,  never asking for recognition or reward. Her work has been marked by  passion, humility, and humor. Through her vigor and tireless spirit,  she has shown us all what it means to serve faithfully.

Cam embodies the very best of what it means to be a Patriot, someone  who works not for personal gain, but out of love for her community, her  country, and the values that have guided generations of Americans. The  positive impact of her service is felt across Michigan and beyond and  will continue to inspire future leaders in our movement.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Michigan's 1st Congressional  District, I thank Camilla Williams for her service, her leadership, and  her enduring commitment to the conservative cause.
