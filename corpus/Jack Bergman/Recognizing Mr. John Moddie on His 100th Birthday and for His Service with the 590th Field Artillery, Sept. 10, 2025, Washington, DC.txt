Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize Mr.  John Moddie on his 100th birthday and to commend him for his valiant  service with the United States Army as a member of the 590th Field  Artillery Battalion, 106th Infantry Division during World War II.

At just 18 years old, while working as a stock clerk at Peterson Boat  Works in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, Mr. Moddie answered the call to serve  his country by enlisting in the U.S. Army. Following basic training at  Camp Roberts, California, he was assigned to B Battery of the 590th  Field Artillery Battalion, 106th Infantry Division at Camp Atterbury,  Indiana. Excelling in his training on the 105 mm Howitzer, Mr. Moddie  set sail for England to prepare for deployment to the Western Front.

On the morning of November 30, 1944, Mr. Moddie and his battalion  crossed the English Channel to Le Havre, France, where they awaited  orders to move up the Seine River into Germany to take part in what  would become the Battle of the Bulge--the second-most deadly battle of  the war for American troops. On December 19, 1944, he was captured by  German forces and held at Stalag 9B in Bad Orb, Germany, as a prisoner  of war. Despite enduring extreme conditions and losing nearly half his  body weight, he survived until liberation by Allied forces on April 2,  1945.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Moddie's life is a testament to courage, sacrifice,  and patriotism. Let us honor him for his extraordinary service to our  Nation, his devotion to his fellow servicemembers, and his steadfast  commitment to family and community. On behalf of Michigan's 1st  Congressional District, I wish him a joyous 100th birthday and extend  the gratitude of a Nation, he so bravely served.
