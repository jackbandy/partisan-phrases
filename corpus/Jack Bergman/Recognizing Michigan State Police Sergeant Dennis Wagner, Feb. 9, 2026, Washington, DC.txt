Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Sergeant Dennis Wagner  of the Michigan State Police for his decisive actions and lifesaving  efforts in responding to a medical emergency at Nub's Nob Ski Resort.  Due to his courage and professionalism, a life was saved, and a man in  need will return to his family safely.

On January 3, 2026, while cross-country skiing off duty at Nub's Nob  Ski Resort, Sergeant Wagner observed a skier collapsed along the side  of the trail. Without hesitation, he stepped in to assist Nub's Nob ski  patroller Steve Biggs, who had begun providing emergency care. Sergeant  Wagner helped roll the  skier onto his back, positioned the head to open the airway, and  immediately initiated chest compressions.

Members of the Nub's Nob Ski Patrol arrived shortly after with an  automated external defibrillator, administering two shocks. CPR  continued following the defibrillation once it was deemed safe to do  so, and oxygen was delivered using a bag-valve mask. Sergeant Wagner  assisted ski patrol in securing the skier onto a toboggan for transport  down the trail.

Upon arrival at the ski patrol room, Emmet County Emergency Medical  Services assumed care and transported the skier to McLaren Northern  Michigan Hospital, where he is expected to make a full recovery.  Medical staff later confirmed that the rapid response, early CPR, and  timely use of an AED were critical to saving the skier's life.

Mr. Speaker, let us join together in recognizing Sergeant Dennis  Wagner for his lifesaving and selfless actions. I thank him for his  continued dedication to the people of Michigan through his service with  the Michigan State Police, and I commend him for embodying the very  best of public service.
