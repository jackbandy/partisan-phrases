Thanking Northern Michigan Electric Cooperatives and Linemen for Restoring Power Throughout Northern Michigan


Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deepest  gratitude to the electric cooperatives and linemen who worked  tirelessly to restore power to the communities of Northern Michigan  following the devastating ice storm of March 2025.

After multiple days of high winds and freezing rain, thousands of  families in Michigan's First District were left without power, while  temperatures remained in the single digits. During this State of  Emergency, local electric cooperatives demonstrated extraordinary  dedication and resilience. Lineworkers from Alger Delta Cooperative  Electric Association, Cloverland Electric Cooperative, Great Lakes  Energy Cooperative, Presque Isle Electric and Gas Cooperative, and  Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative braved dangerous conditions to  restore essential services to the region, and I commend them for their  hard work and a job well done.

For decades, these cooperatives and their workforce have provided  reliable energy and critical assistance throughout Northern Michigan.  In rural communities, dependable energy is not just a convenience: it  is the backbone of modern life and public safety. These cooperatives  consistently ensure that all residents of Northern Michigan--especially  the area's most vulnerable individuals, including those with medical  needs, families with children, and the elderly--remain safe and warm  throughout harsh northern winters. Simply put, these cooperatives help  deliver a quality of life to rural areas that might otherwise be left  behind.

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and applaud the outstanding  service of Alger Delta Cooperative Electric Association, Cloverland  Electric Cooperative, Great Lakes Energy Cooperative, Presque Isle.  Electric and Gas Cooperative, and Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative.  Their selflessness and dedication to our communities in Northern  Michigan deserve our highest praise and deepest appreciation.
