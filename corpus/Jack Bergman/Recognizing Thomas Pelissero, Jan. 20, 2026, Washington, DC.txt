Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Mr. Thomas  Pelissero for his heartfelt tribute to his hometown of Bessemer,  Michigan, in his book: ``Bring One Home: A Memoir of Boyhood,  Basketball, and Hometown Spirit.''

This book is not only a salute to Bessemer, but the tough, resilient  communities across Michigan's Upper Peninsula and middle America.

Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago this week, the Bessemer Speedboys  basketball team ended a 42-game losing streak, at the time, the longest  in Upper Peninsula high school basketball history.

The people of Bessemer always showed up, cheered, and stood by their  team. That loyalty and perseverance reflect the hardy spirit that  defines this town and so many communities across our Upper Peninsula.

That spirit remains alive today.

Mr. Pelissero's book launch filled Bessemer City Hall to standing  room only and raised more than $5,000 for the Bessemer Public Library.  Since its release in November of 2025, ``Bring One Home'' has earned  national recognition to include inclusion in the Library of Congress.

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Mr. Pelissero for capturing  the character, resilience, and enduring fellowship of Bessemer and the  Upper Peninsula we are all proud to call home.
