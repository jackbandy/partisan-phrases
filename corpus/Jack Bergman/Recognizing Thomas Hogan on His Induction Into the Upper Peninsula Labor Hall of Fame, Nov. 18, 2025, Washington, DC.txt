Recognizing Thomas Hogan on His Induction Into the Upper Peninsula Labor Hall of Fame


Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Thomas Hogan  for being inducted into the Upper Peninsula Labor Hall of Fame. A proud  U.S. Marine Corps Veteran and Purple Heart recipient, Mr. Hogan brought  the same courage, perseverance, and sense of duty he demonstrated in  Vietnam to his lifelong commitment to Michigan's working men and women.

Following his service with the United States Marine Corps, Mr. Hogan  began his career as an apprentice with the International Brotherhood of  Electrical Workers, ascending through the ranks from journeyman to  Business Manager of Local 1070. Over the course of 25 years, he  negotiated contracts that improved wages, strengthened workplace  safety, and upheld the dignity of electrical workers across Michigan's  Upper Peninsula. His dedication towards empowering Michigan's  electricians helped strengthen apprenticeship programs, protect  pensions, and solidify equal pay for equal work.

Mr. Hogan played an integral role in the creation of IBEW Local 906,  which united electrical workers across fourteen counties and laid a  stronger, more equitable foundation for future generations of  electricians. His steadfast commitment to ensuring the fair treatment  of electricians across the U.P. helped eliminate wage disparities,  expand training opportunities, and improve cooperation between labor  and management with the U.P. Construction Council.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Thomas Hogan for his induction into  the Upper Peninsula Labor Hall of Fame and thank him for his decades of  dedicated service to his fellow electricians, to the Upper Peninsula,  and to our Nation.
