Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank the courageous men and  women responding to the historic ice storm that left tens of thousands  without power across northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. Ten  counties are under a state of emergency, and our grid suffered near  total collapse under nearly 1 inch of ice.

In the face of these challenges, linemen from Michigan and across the  country have worked tirelessly in brutal conditions to restore power.  This past weekend, I was able to meet with many of our first  responders: police, firefighters, dispatchers, and emergency medical  teams. They all answered the call, keeping our communities safe and our  roads open. Their bravery, professionalism, and dedication embody the  spirit of resilience and unity that defines northern Michigan.

The determination of all those affected has not gone unnoticed. My  colleagues and I stand ready to support the State's request for Federal  assistance.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking these everyday heroes who  rose to the challenge helping us rebuild, recover, and emerge stronger.
