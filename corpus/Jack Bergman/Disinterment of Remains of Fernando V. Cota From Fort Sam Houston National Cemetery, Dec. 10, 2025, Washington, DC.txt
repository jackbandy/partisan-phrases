Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, I am impressed with our Nation's will to face down  potential aggressors. From protecting the shipping lanes in the Red Sea  to using sea power to protect our allies to securing our borders and,  finally, to projecting power to strike a nuclear-ready Iran, our  military continues to be up to the task.

Our servicemembers should be commended on their professionalism and  commitment, but we have much more to do to better prepare. The National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026 continues to press  needed reform to make our military more lethal and ready.

Accelerating the acquisition cycle, slaying a bloated military  construction process, delivering environmental stewardship to  communities impacted by PFAS, and providing quality housing for our  servicemembers, this bill is essential for keeping trust with our  servicemembers and their families.

This bill is laser focused on the future to ensure our forces have  the training, maintenance, and equipment to deliver a credible future  deterrent that prevents any would-be aggressors.

Undoubtedly, Mr. Speaker, this bill is worthy of your support.

Before I conclude, I thank Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Smith  for their steadfast support and leadership in delivering this bill.

Our national security is stronger when we can work across the aisle  and deliver commonsense outcomes for our Nation. I urge all Members to  vote ``yes.''
