Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, today, Father Charles Trullols led our  opening prayer. I have known Father Charles since 2020. He is an Opus  Dei priest and leads the Catholic Information Center here in our  Nation's capital. Originally from Barcelona, Spain he became a priest  in 2006 and served in Grenada, Spain before coming to the United States  where he ministered to others in Pittsburgh, South Bend, and Chicago  before taking on his current role.

In 2020, when it seemed the world had lost its collective mind, Opus  Dei was, and remains a source of hope for me. The camaraderie and  fellowship of seeking to follow Jesus together with colleagues kept me  grounded. There, I met Father Charles whose love for Jesus and people  come together in his own ministry.

Father Charles provided patient counsel, consistent prayer, and  ongoing friendship--things he does naturally and always for God's  glory. I'm thankful for his ministry to me and others.
