Expanding Wksi Eligibility Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697267/expanding-wksi-eligibility-act


Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4430) to lower the aggregate market value of voting and non- voting common equity necessary for an issuer to qualify as a well-known  seasoned issuer, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4430

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding WKSI Eligibility       Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER.

(a) In General.--For purposes of the Federal securities       laws, and regulations issued thereunder, an issuer shall be a       ``well-known seasoned issuer'' if--

(1) the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting       common equity held by non-affiliates of the issuer is       $400,000,000 or more (as determined under Form S-3 general       instruction I.B.1. as in effect on the date of enactment of       this Act); and

(2) the issuer otherwise satisfies the requirements of the       definition of ``well-known seasoned issuer'' contained in       section 230.405 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations (as       in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) without       reference to any requirement in such definition relating to       minimum worldwide market value of outstanding voting and non-      voting common equity held by non-affiliates.

(b) Report on Withdrawn Applications Related to Well-known       Seasoned Issuer Status.--The Securities and Exchange       Commission shall, not later than 90 days after the end of       each calendar year, publish the total number of applications       submitted during such calendar year where the applicant--

(1) submitted the application under section 230.405 of       title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, for a determination by       the Commission that the applicant not be considered an       ineligible issuer under such section;

(2) requested such determination in order to meet the       definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under such       section; and

(3) withdrew the application.

Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO estimate  for this bill.       Legislation Considered Under Suspension of the Rules

The Majority Leader of the House of Representatives       announces bills that will be considered under suspension of       the rules in that chamber. Under suspension, floor debate is       limited, all floor amendments are prohibited, points of order       against the bill are waived, and final passage requires a       two-thirds majority vote.

At the request of the Majority Leader and the House       Committee on the Budget, CBO estimates the effects of those       bills on direct spending and revenues. CBO has limited time       to review the legislation before consideration. Although it       is possible in most cases to determine whether the       legislation would affect direct spending or revenues, time       may be insufficient to estimate the magnitude of those       effects. If CBO has prepared estimates for similar or       identical legislation, a more detailed assessment of       budgetary effects, including effects on spending subject to       appropriation, may be included.
