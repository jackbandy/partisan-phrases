Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2026

Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chair, I rise today to urge you and all of our  colleagues to support amendment No. 57 to the FY 2026 Department of  Defense appropriations bill.

This amendment strikes section 8072, a misguided rider that prohibits  the Navy from decommissioning littoral class combat ships.

The state of shipbuilding in the United States is nothing we would  hope to have. It is broken. This program maybe represents the pinnacle  of its brokenness. The ship doesn't accomplish what it was designed  for. I am encouraged when I speak to the chairman to know that it is  being put to use elsewhere, but it is not accomplishing the mission  that the Navy needs it for.

This provision ties the Navy's hands, forcing it to retain a deeply  flawed, costly, and ineffective class of ships that undermines our  national security, endangers our sailors, and wastes taxpayer dollars,  when we could move forward and build a ship that could accomplish the  mission.

President Trump is trying to take leadership over this and fix it,  and this ties his hands in a way that prevents options. We should leave  the Commander in Chief that decision.

The littoral combat ship program, costing over $30 billion, with each  ship priced at roughly $500 million, is a textbook example of Pentagon  inefficiency and contractor-driven bloat. Designed as a light, fast,  customizable vessel for near-shore warfare, the LCS has instead become  a symbol of our flawed procurement system.

Mr. Chair, since its inception, the program has been plagued by  persistent propulsion system failures, weapons system integration  issues, hull problems, and rampant cost overruns.

A 2022 GAO report exposed the LCS's shortcomings. It has not  demonstrated the operational capabilities needed for its Navy mission.

Operational testing revealed significant challenges including the  ship's inability to defend itself, if attacked, and frequent failures  of mission-essential equipment on the ships. Deployments have been  marred by breakdowns and setbacks, rendering these ships unreliable at  best.

Mr. Chair, forcing the Navy to maintain a fleet of broken and  expensive ships is simply irresponsible. I think it is wrong to take  our Commander in Chief's hands. Our sailors deserve the best and most  reliable vessels to defend our Nation. Every dollar spent on the LCS is  a dollar diverted from building a stronger, more capable fleet.  Retaining these ships compromises readiness, squanders limited  resources, and puts lives at risk.

My amendment restores the Navy's authority to make strategic  decisions about its fleet and frees up resources for platforms that  actually enhance our national security.

Mr. Chair, I urge our colleagues to put the safety of our sailors and  the strength of our Navy first, and I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes''  on amendment 57.

Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
