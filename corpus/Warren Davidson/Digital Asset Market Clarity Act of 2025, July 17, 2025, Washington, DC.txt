Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025


Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, the ability to move payment or digital  tokens that represent other assets person to person, without a third  party or intermediary, across any space digitally at the speed of light  is part of the reason this industry was created.

What do those tokens represent? Either securities, commodities or  real world assets? We have needed a bright-line test since this market  began to decide who regulates them.

I introduced the first piece of legislation on this back in 2018  called the Token Taxonomy Act. Think of the harm that could have been  prevented if we had that bright-line test all this time.

The other essential component is self-custody, the ability to control  your own assets. You can't go person to person if you have to go  through an intermediary without a permission.

It does that. It does just what we need it to do, just like cash. We  finally have market structure in place with this bill. I hope the  Senate delivers the same structure soon, and we get the certainty the  markets need.
