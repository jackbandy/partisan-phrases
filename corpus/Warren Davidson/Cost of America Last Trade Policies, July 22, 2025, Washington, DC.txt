Cost of America Last Trade Policies


Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, for decades, Washington, D.C., has  allowed international trade organizations to put our competitors ahead  of the American people. Groups like the World Trade Organization allow  China to exploit trade loopholes while claiming to be a developing  nation, stealing our intellectual property, and manipulating their own  currency.

Under these America last trade policies, Ohio has lost a third of its  manufacturing jobs. Between 2000 and 2010, Hamilton County in the  Eighth District lost 66,000 good-paying, high-skilled jobs. My district  heard the giant sucking sound of American industry fleeing overseas.

These jobs drove innovation and productivity, and they built our  middle class. America last trade policies not only exported jobs and  outsourced our defense industrial base, but they exported much of our  future. Our trade policy ought to put American industry and American  citizens first.
