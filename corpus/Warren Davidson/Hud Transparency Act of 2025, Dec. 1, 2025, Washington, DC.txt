https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697209/hud-transparency-act-of-2025


Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 225) to require the Inspector General of the Department of  Housing and Urban Development to testify before the Congress annually,  and for other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 225

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``HUD Transparency Act of       2025''.       SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY.

Not later than October 1 of each year, the Inspector       General of the Department of Housing and Urban Development       shall appear before the Committee on Financial Services of       the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking,       Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and present       testimony on the Office of Inspector General's--

(1) efforts to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse;

(2) ability to conduct and supervise audits,       investigations, and reviews;

(3) actions to identify opportunities for the programs of       the Department of Housing and Urban Development to progress       and succeed;

(4) recommendations to improve overall efficiency and       public accountability of the Department of Housing and Urban       Development;

(5) assessment of the extent to which the Department of       Housing and Urban Development has resources sufficient to       carry out its statutory mission; and

(6) ongoing activities regarding any such additional work,       as appropriate.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 225, the HUD Transparency Act.

I thank the gentlewoman from Texas, Congresswoman De La Cruz, for  sponsoring this legislation.

The HUD Transparency Act of 2025 is a piece of commonsense  legislation that strengthens accountability, enhances oversight, and  ensures the American people have a clear view into how Federal housing  dollars are spent.

For years, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, has  administered programs that touch millions of families, seniors, and  veterans in communities across our Nation. These programs are critical.  They support affordable housing development, combat homelessness, and  help communities recover after disasters.

Unfortunately, over the years, in my view, the agency has shown time  and time again they are unable to perform some basic functions. The  agency continually fails to hold local public housing authorities  responsible for providing safe housing.

Reports from the inspector general, the Government Accountability  Office, and our own committee have repeatedly identified some of the  same issues: outdated and incomplete reporting, inconsistent and  unverifiable data, missed deadlines, and major programs operating  without clear evidence of effectiveness.

As the branch with the power of the purse, it is Congress'  responsibility to ensure tax dollars that go toward HUD's programs are  managed effectively, efficiently, and transparently. H.R. 225 delivers  on that responsibility.

This bill requires the Office of the Inspector General of the  Department of Housing and Urban Development to annually testify before  Congress so we can ensure the Department is meeting its performance  reporting and management standards. By requiring the HUD Inspector  General to appear in front of Congress, Ms. De La Cruz's bill makes HUD  take the necessary steps to publish key performance information, report  program outcomes in a timely manner, and makes the data available so  Congress and the public can better ensure Federal housing programs are  meeting their goals.

The HUD Transparency Act is a straightforward, bipartisan solution to  a longstanding problem. HUD needs to use consistent reporting formats  so Congress can compare outcomes across programs and track progress  over time. It ensures that the American people can see how their tax  dollars are being used.

These are basic principles of good governance. Transparency  strengthens public trust and improves program performance. It allows  Congress to address problems early instead of after tax dollars have  been wasted or ones in need have been left behind.

Importantly, this bill does so without imposing new burdens on State  or local governments and without slowing down the delivery of critical  housing assistance. H.R. 225 simply ensures that HUD operates with the  openness and accountability the American people expect and deserve.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. De La Cruz for this important measure, and I  urge our colleagues to support it.

Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Congressional  Budget Office estimate for this bill.      H.R. 225, HUD TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2025, AS REPORTED BY THE HOUSE             COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES ON JULY 15, 2025 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                           By fiscal year, millions of                                                    dollars--                                      -----------------------------------                                          2025      2025-2030   2025-2035 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Direct Spending (Outlays)...........          0           0           0 Revenues............................          0           0           0 Increase or Decrease (-) in the               0           0           0  Deficit............................

Statutory pay-as-you-go procedures apply? No.

Mandate Effects:

Contains intergovernmental mandate? No.

H.R. 225 would require the Inspector General of the       Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to testify       annually before the Congress on different topics including       the sufficiency of the agency's resources, actions taken to       identify opportunities for program improvement, and the       inspector general's ability to investigate and audit HUD       programs to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse.

Using information from the agency, CBO estimates that       implementing H.R. 225 would cost less than $500,000. Any       related spending would be subject to the availability of       appropriated funds.

The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Zunara Naeem.       The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy       Director of Budget Analysis.                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                             Director, Congressional Budget Office.

Mr. DAVIDSON.  De La Cruz).

Ms. DE LA CRUZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  225, the HUD Transparency Act of 2025.

This commonsense legislation requires annual testimony from the  Department of Housing and Urban Development's inspector general. By  doing so, the HUD Transparency Act adds formal oversight over HUD that  does not currently exist.

In the past, Congress has gone years without hearing from HUD's  inspector general. With a budget that exceeds $70 billion, we must have  proper oversight over HUD to ensure housing programs are working for  all Americans.

That being said, my bill will require the inspector general to  provide Congress with recommendations and insights into reforming HUD's  programs and rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in our Federal  spending.

Housing issues impact all Americans. I commend this administration  for their focus on restoring the American Dream of homeownership by  bringing down housing costs and cutting red tape. Our HUD programs play  a critical role in increasing the affordable housing supply and access  nationwide.

However, the success of HUD's programs relies on the Department's  ability to root out fraud, waste, and abuse. The HUD Transparency Act  aids in this by adding critical oversight to ensure that those who  qualify for HUD's programs can receive the housing assistance that they  need.

Ms. DE LA CRUZ. Mr. Speaker, this legislation has a strong record of  bipartisan support, including passage in the House in the 118th  Congress.

As this legislation continues to receive overwhelming bipartisan  support, I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  join me in passing this important piece of legislation, the HUD  Transparency Act of 2025.

For the reasons I explained earlier, I urge my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
