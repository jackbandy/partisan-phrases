Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4423) to continue the pause on disbursements and new  financing commitments to the Government of Burma, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4423

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``No New Burma Funds Act''.       SEC. 2. CONTINUATION OF PAUSE ON WORLD BANK DISBURSEMENTS AND                     COMMITMENTS TO BURMA.

The Secretary of the Treasury shall direct the United       States Executive Director at the International Bank for       Reconstruction and Development to use the voice and vote of       the United States to continue the pause by the Bank on       disbursements and the making of new financing commitments to       the Government of Burma, that was initiated after a military       coup overthrew the democratically elected Government of Burma       in 2021, unless the Secretary of the Treasury determines that       it is not in the national interest to do so.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4423, the No New Burma Funds  Act. I thank the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Williams) for sponsoring  this bipartisan legislation.

I am pleased to note that this bill passed the Financial Services  Committee unanimously by a vote of 54-0 in July of this year. That kind  of agreement underscores the seriousness of the threat posed by Burma's  military regime and the broad consensus that the United States must  respond firmly.

The No New Burma Funds Act ensures that the United States will oppose  any new World Bank financing that could benefit Burma's illegitimate  military junta and supports international efforts to restore democratic  governance.

Since the military overthrew the elected Burma Government in 2021,  Congress has fought to hold Burma's military coup accountable and  support the Burmese people in their struggle for freedom to restore  their rightful voice in their own government.

Yet despite widespread global condemnation, the acting Government of  Burma continues to entrench its power, exploit state resources, and  suppress democratic aspirations of its citizens, all while seeking  access to new streams of international financing.

The No New Burma Funds Act responds directly to this challenge by  ensuring that the United States continues to use its full voice and  vote at the World Bank to maintain a strict pause on disbursements in  new financing commitments to the current government in control of  Burma.

Supporting democratic movements, defending human rights, and  advancing stability in Southeast Asia are in our American interest.  When international institutions inadvertently enable authoritarian  regimes through new financing, our credibility suffers, and in this  case the Burmese people would pay the price.

By reaffirming and strengthening this pause, H.R. 4423 provides a  responsible and targeted approach that prevents international funds  from benefiting the current government and maintains the pressure  applied following the 2021 coup.

This is a bipartisan, commonsense measure that upholds human rights,  reinforces international accountability, and supports the long-term  prospects of peace and democracy in Burma. I thank the bill's sponsor  for her work on this legislation and commitment to standing with the  people of Burma.

I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill  and help send a clear message that the United States will not allow  international financing that empowers brutal dictatorship or tyranny in  Burma.

Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO estimate  for this bill.   H.R. 4423, NO NEW BURMA FUNDS ACT, AS REPORTED BY THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON                  FINANCIAL SERVICES ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2025 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                           By fiscal year, millions of                                                    dollars--                                      -----------------------------------                                          2026      2026-2030   2026-2035 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Direct Spending (Outlays)...........          0           0           0 Revenues............................          0           0           0 Increase or Decrease (-) in the               0           0           0  Deficit............................ Spending Subject to Appropriation             *           *           *  (Outlays).......................... ------------------------------------------------------------------------ * = between zero and $500,000.

Increases net direct spending in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036? No.

Increases on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive       10-year periods beginning in 2036? No.

Statutory pay-as-you-go procedures apply? No.

Mandate Effects:

Contains intergovernmental mandate? No.

Contains private-sector mandate? No.

H.R. 4423 would require the United States Executive       Director at the International Bank for Reconstruction and       Development to advocate for a continued pause on       disbursements and new financing commitments to the Government       of Burma.

On the basis of information about the costs of similar       diplomatic efforts to influence the actions of other nations       and international organizations, CBO estimates that       implementing H.R. 4423 would cost less than $500,000 over the       2026-2030 period. Any spending would be subject to the       availability of appropriated funds.

The CBC staff contact for this estimate is Emma Uebelhor.       The estimate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy       Director of Budget Analysis.                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                             Director, Congressional Budget Office.

Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, for the reasons I explained earlier, I  urge all of our colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
