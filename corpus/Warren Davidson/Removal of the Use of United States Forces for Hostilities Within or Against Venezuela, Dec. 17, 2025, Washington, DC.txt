Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I would ask Mr. McGovern: Is the  contention that this is a present condition, that there are U.S. forces  in violation of the War Powers Resolution, or is it about a  hypothetical future?

I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.

Mr. DAVIDSON. The contention is it is a pressing condition?

Mr. DAVIDSON. I disagree with that. I will be voting ``no.''
