Mr. DOWNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colter Lumley who  on January 22 earned the rank of Eagle Scout. I had the honor to watch  Colter from a young boy get involved in his community and do things  that mattered, not just for his community but for the State of Montana.

Colter hails from Emigrant, Montana, and can now count himself among  the 11 other boys who have achieved the honor since Troop 551 began in  1984. Those who know him best attest to Colter's humility and work  ethic, saying that all he does is rise in the morning and put forth  more effort and hard work before noon than most his age do in a full  day.

His Eagle Scout project was to replace a retaining wall at the fire  department in Gardiner, Montana. He arranged the preconstruction  meetings, organized the delivery of the supplies, and was even able to  get a price reduction to save money. He then rallied his football team  and his troop to replace the wall, completing the job in 20 hours and  placing over 600 cinder blocks.

Colter has made his country and his State proud. We thank Colter for  setting an example for his peers and his community, and we congratulate  him on this great achievement.
