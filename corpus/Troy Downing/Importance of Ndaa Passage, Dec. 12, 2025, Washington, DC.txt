Mr. DOWNING. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to  recognize the importance of the House's passage of the 2026 National  Defense Authorization Act earlier this week.

The 2026 NDAA codifies critical provisions of President Trump's peace  through strength agenda, including authorizing full funding for the  Sentinel ICBM program. The Sentinel program is set to provide essential  upgrades to the land-based component of our nuclear triad.

I thank the airmen, the security forces, the missileers, everyone at  Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls, Montana, for their continued  hard work on the initial planning and construction phases of this  project.

Nuclear deterrence is the bedrock of our national security. As China  and Russia rapidly expand their arsenals and modernize their missile  capabilities, we cannot fall behind.

I look forward to working with my colleagues on continuing  congressional support for Sentinel as this program progresses.
