Mr. DOWNING. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Military  Appreciation Month.

Being an Air Force veteran myself, I understand the sacrifices that  are made every day by this Nation's men and women who serve in our  Armed Forces. These sacrifices aren't just borne by our servicemembers  but also by their families who support them and by their children who  are left at home while we send them into harm's way to defend this  great country and all that she represents.

To my brothers and sisters in arms in Montana and across this great  Nation, I thank them. I thank them for taking the watch. I thank them  for defending this Nation. I thank them for protecting us. They bring  honor upon themselves. They bring honor upon their families, their  communities, and to these great United States of America.
