Recognizing Tarquin Bennion


Mr. DOWNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary  young Montanan, Tarquin Bennion, who will make his Carnegie Hall debut  on July 20.

Tarquin hails from Sidney, Montana, and is one of the 28 violinists  from around the country headed to the Big Apple to perform with the  National Youth Orchestra of the United States.

Not only will he debut in New York, he will also represent our Nation  and  our State as he tours internationally in Japan, Hong Kong, China, and  South Korea.

Tarquin's journey began at the age of 5 when his mother, who taught  herself to play the violin at age 34, inspired him to pursue music.  Since then, his passion has taken him to venues like the Montana Senate  Chamber where he performed a piece from Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 4  during his time as a page.

Mr. Speaker, Tarquin's remarkable talent and dedication are an  inspiration to his peers and to his State. I congratulate him on this  incredible accomplishment and wish him the best of luck in his bright  future. I know this is just the beginning.
