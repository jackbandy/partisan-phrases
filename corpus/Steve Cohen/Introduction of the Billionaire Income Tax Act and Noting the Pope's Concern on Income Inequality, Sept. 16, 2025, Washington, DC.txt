Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I plan to introduce the Billionaire Income  Tax Act on Wednesday and will hold a press conference with the House  cosponsor Congressman Don Beyer and the Senate bill sponsor Ron Wyden.

It is an effort to establish a level of fairness in federal income  taxation and prevent millionaires and billionaires, and the aspiring  trillionaire, Elon Musk, from taking advantage of the tax code to pay  what, for them is pocket change. I have not asked him, but it looks  like Pope Leo would endorse the Billionaire Income Tax Act. He recently  did an interview with a biographer and excerpts were released on  Sunday. Speaking of societal polarization, he said it is in part caused  by income inequality. One factor, he said, and I'm quoting him, is  ``the continuously wider gap between the income levels of the working  class and the money that the wealthiest receive. For example, CEOs that  60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what  the workers are receiving, the last figure I saw, it's 600 times more  than what average workers are receiving. Yesterday the said news that  Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world. What does  that mean and what's that about? If that is the only thing that has  value anymore, then we're in big trouble.'' I agree with Pope Leo and  hope our bill will have a significant effect on what everyone seems to  acknowledge is a huge and growing problem.
