National Insecurity Strategy

Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, at the end of last week, President Trump  published his national security strategy. It could have been called his  national insecurity strategy.

To say it is bad is a misstatement, understatement. It is disastrous.  During Europe's largest land war since World War II, the strategy saves  its harshest criticisms for our allies rather than Russia, with war  criminal Putin, who started the war.

The document elevates strongman leadership models over democratic  values, something unheard of in America. It is focused on spheres of  influence and suggests that the strongest person in the region gets to  decide the rules. These are not American values.

Previous national security strategies upheld America's commitment to  democracy and human rights, strengthened our alliances, and countered  powerful first adversaries like Russia and China.

This strategy abandons that tradition in favor of a narrow  transactional approach. Notably, the word ``corruption'' is absent from  the entire strategy. It is well known that global corruption fuels  instability, weakens governments, and its absence is extremely  dangerous and allows bad actors to flourish.

The national security strategy abandons our allies, our principles,  and the values that have guided American leadership for decades.
