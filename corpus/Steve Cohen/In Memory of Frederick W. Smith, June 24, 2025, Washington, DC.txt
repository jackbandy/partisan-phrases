Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to appear here.

In Memphis, one of our great leaders in the State of Tennessee, in  the United States of America, and the world, in fact, was Frederick W.  Smith, Jr.

Fred Smith died suddenly this past weekend. He was 80 years old.

Fred Smith started a business called FedEx, the largest air cargo  system in the world. He started it with an idea that he came up with at  Yale University and made it a paper. The paper didn't get a very good  grade, but the people of the world judged it as A-plus, and everything  about Fred Smith was A-plus.

He was just a regular, decent human being and a good guy. He was  always available. He never made you think he was a big titan of  business or a leader of industry in the world. He was just somebody who  was interested in what you had to talk to him about, and he would offer  his advice.

In Memphis, he did have his hand in just about everything. Our  basketball arena, FedExForum, has made the city the home of an NBA  team. That is because of Fred Smith. Our college football team plays in  Liberty Stadium. He has pledged $50 million to improve that stadium and  bring it up to higher standards. We have a golf tournament that is the  FedEx St. Jude Golf Classic.

He had his hand in every good thing in Memphis from education, zoos,  and the civil rights museum. It is a big loss to Memphis. It is a big  loss to Tennesseans. It is a big loss to Americans.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. DesJarlais and Mr. Burchett for joining me  up here. I ask everyone to stand for a moment of silence in the memory  of Frederick W. Smith, Jr., a life well lived.
