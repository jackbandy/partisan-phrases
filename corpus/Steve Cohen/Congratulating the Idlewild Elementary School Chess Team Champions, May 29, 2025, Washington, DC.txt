Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Idlewild  Elementary School Chess Team champions, and their coach Mark Beatty, on  their impressive run of successes this year. The 15-member team won the  2025 Henry D. Sabine State Scholastic Team Chess Tournament in both the  kindergarten through third grade and kindergarten through fifth grade  categories. The wins qualified them for a trip to Orlando, Florida,  earlier this month to compete in the National Elementary Championship  hosted by the U.S. Chess Federation. Beatty founded the Idlewild team  in 2013. He also coached chess teams at Grahamwood Elementary, White  Station Middle School and White Station High School where his teams  have won 45 state team titles. Idlewood, my elementary school alma  mater and the only school in Tennessee to receive the Top Magnet School  of Excellence designation, also sent teams to the national chess  tournaments in 2024 and 2023. This proud tradition puts Idlewild on a  short list of the Nation's best elementary schools and its students  deserve our encouragement and respect. They are certainly living up to  their motto: ``Children First, Excellence Always!''
