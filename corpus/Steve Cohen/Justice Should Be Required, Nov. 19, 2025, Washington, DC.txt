Justice Should Be Required

Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I am here to talk about two incidents that  shame me as a Member of this House and as an American citizen.

Today, President Trump signed the Epstein documents release bill.  Lots of women were up here who were victims of Jeffrey Epstein's sexual  felonies, and they celebrated when the House passed it and the Senate  passed it, but it is clear today that classified documents therein will  not be released and documents that might relate to an ongoing  investigation which President Trump authorized going after Bill  Clinton, Larry Summers, and others on the Democratic side which are  false and improper investigations where Ms. Bondi said there was  nothing there, will not allow for material to be disclosed.

The Senate said the House shouldn't get involved with the $500,000  that each Senator should get for simply having a phone call noted--not  listened to, not documented, but noted. It is $500,000 for nine  Senators.

That money should go to the Epstein victims. Truth spoken. Justice  should be required.
