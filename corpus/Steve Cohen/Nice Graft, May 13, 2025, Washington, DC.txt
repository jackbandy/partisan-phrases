Nice Graft

Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, President Trump was offered this $400 million  airplane. He said he thought it was a ``nice gesture.''

A nice gesture is when somebody passes the salt and pepper. That is a  nice gesture.

A nice gesture is when somebody says, ``Good morning. Have a nice  day.'' That is a nice gesture.

A nice gesture is when a gentleman pulls a chair out for a lady to  sit down. That is a nice gesture.

To take a $400 million airplane from Qatar as the plane of the United  States of America's President is cheap, demeaning, and harmful to our  country that has always flown high as the finest nation on this Earth.  It is also graft and corruption.

Mr. Speaker, the emperor wears no clothes.
