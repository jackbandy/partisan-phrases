Rescissions Act of 2025

Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, if there was fraud, there would be arrests.  There is not fraud. There have not been arrests. They are depending on  the word of Mr. Musk, who took out a chain saw from the President of  Argentina and waved it around, a chain saw. He took a chain saw to the  budget, not a scalpel.

If my colleagues want to improve something, improve it. Mr. Speaker,  regarding the Kennedy Center, if they want to improve it, they want  ``Hee Haw,'' have ``Hee Haw,'' but don't get rid of the Kennedy Center.

There will be people who will die. This bill is good for Russia and  China and undertakers because it is going to have people dying. Bill  Gates said this is the richest man in the world, Musk, taking advantage  of and killing the poorest children in the world. They are not going to  be getting PEPFAR programs created by George Bush. They are not going  to get the sustenance they need which is rotting in ships right now.

Don't end it, mend it. This is a terrible bill. This is Musk's bill  on drugs.
