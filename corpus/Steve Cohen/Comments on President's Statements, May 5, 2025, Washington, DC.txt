Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I watched the President's interview on  ``Meet the Press'' yesterday. I was shocked at the lack of  understanding that the man has of his job.

He takes an oath to protect, preserve, and defend the Constitution of  the United States, and he says he is not sure if the Fifth Amendment is  applicable to people in this country and is not sure if he will stand  up and protect the Constitution. This is unfathomable.

Then, he comes up and tells us he wants to have a parade that will  cost over $90 million on his birthday, which happens to coincide with  Flag Day and the birth of the United States Army, neither of which have  ever merited a parade in the past--$90 million with airplanes, tanks,  and troops to appease a man's ego, to let him think for a while that he  is Genghis Khan or Napoleon.

He is not Genghis Khan. He is not Napoleon. He is not the Pope. He is  the President of the United States, who works for us, the American  people.
