Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act

Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the PERMIT Act.  For over 50 years, the Clean Water Act has protected rivers, streams,  and wetlands that our communities rely on. This bill undermines these  protections by shielding polluters from responsibility for toxic waste  like PFAS, lead, mercury, and arsenic, and by limiting Federal review  and community input when drinking water is at risk.

I filed three straightforward amendments to protect public health:  One to require cumulative impacts and groundwater reviews for projects  near community drinking water aquifers, like the one that supplies  Memphis; a second one to restore oversight and public participation for  nationwide permits, protections that would have prevented the Byhalia  pipeline from being rushed through my district; and a third one to  require the EPA to certify that this bill will not increase exposure to  harmful contaminants.

Unfortunately, none were made in order. Therefore, I oppose the bill  and urge a ``no'' vote.

Permitting reform should not come at the expense of children's and  seniors' health, clean drinking water, or communities with a history of  industrial exposure. I do this because of a commitment to the safety of  the people.

Looking at my dear friend, Mr. Graves, I hate to speak against one of  his bills because he was such a good ally when I was on Transportation,  and I have great respect for him, but nevertheless I am against the  bill.
