Providing for Consideration of H.J. Res. Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Department of Energy Relating to ``Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer Gas-Fired Instantaneous Water Heaters''; Providing for Consideration of H.J. Res. Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Environmental Protection Agency Relating to ``Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems: Procedures for Facilitating Compliance, Including Netting and Exemptions''; and Providing for Consideration of H. Con. Res. Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this budget is about the millionaires, the  trillionaires, the people earning over $400,000 a year, and giving them  a $4 trillion tax cut over the next 10 years. It is not about working  people. It is about hurting working people, hurting the poor, hurting  people with disabilities, and hurting children.

What this Congress is looking at doing, because of Musk and Trump and  the Republican colleagues here that I share this floor with, is cutting  programs that help the public.

In October, Elon Musk incorporated United States of America, Inc., in  Texas. What that means is it shows his mentality. He thinks he owns  this government. He has bought it. He has been given it. He doesn't  care about anybody else. He is the only stockholder.

America is not a stockholder. Americans are the people who give him  the money to give it to the trillionaires and billionaires who were  first in President Trump's inaugural crowd. They were first in the  crowd. They are first in his mind. They are first in his heart. They  are his people.
