Take Ice Out of Memphis

Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I had a community meeting this weekend and  met with some folks in Memphis. The issues that they were most  interested in were immigration, ICE. They were very concerned about the  people from ICE with masks on their faces mistreating people. They were  dragging them out of cars, stomping on their heads, and arresting them.

We have seen oftentimes they have done that to American citizens, and  they did it in error.

They were also concerned about the immigrants who were taken out of  our community who do so much good in our community.

I am writing a letter to Kristi Noem and reminding her that she said  they were going to get the worst of the worst: the murderers, the  rapists, and the sexual offenders.

She is not doing that. They have decided they are going to get  anybody who is in the country improperly, and that is wrong.

I will write the Trump administration and ask them to take ICE out of  Memphis. It shouldn't be part of this surge they have to help us with  our crime problem.

Hispanic immigrants are not part of our crime problem. If they were,  he would go after one or two of them and not so many.

Get to the business of taking care of Memphis and not eliminating and  deporting people who help our society and our community.
