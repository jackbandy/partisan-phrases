More Funding for Fbi

Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, one of the things we did in the big, ugly  bill that passed last week or the week before is that we put more money  into ICE than we put into the FBI.

The United States' largest investigative function will be in ICE, not  in the FBI. We put more money into chasing people who fix our roofs,  take care of our yards, take care of our children, take care of our  seniors, work the back section of the restaurants, and make America  work. We should be putting that money into finding criminals that the  FBI should be finding.

We have a crime problem. That should be first. The people committing  felonies, rapes, murders, and child sexual abuse is what they said they  were going to go after in the immigration fights. Yet, now they are  going after statistics and records for deporting more people than any  other country in the world.

It is a shame. Crime should be focused on in the FBI and not, as  President Trump said today, that the FBI should be working on voter  fraud, public corruption, and election fraud in the 2020 elections, and  then he said thugs and criminals.

The first order is to protect us from criminals. Save America. Put  our moneys where they serve the best purpose, and that is the FBI, not  ICE.
