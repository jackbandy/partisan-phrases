Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this is about the billionaires. It is not  about the middle class. It is not about a budget deficit because the  majority wouldn't have to give the money to the billionaires if my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle gave it to decreasing the  deficit.

This is the party that is trying to kill Social Security through the  DOGE boys, who are cutting out services for people who use the phone to  deal with their Social Security and eliminating employees from Social  Security. The majority is trying to kill Social Security. That is who  it is, and Republicans want to help the billionaires and hurt the folks  who live on Social Security.
