Mr. SELF. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendments Nos. 476 and  478.

We are at an inflection point in American history. China is investing  heavily in AI, integrating it into its military and economy. America  cannot afford to fall behind.

My first amendment expands AI pilot programs and logistics, cyber  defense, intelligence, and maintenance. AI is a vital force multiplier,  cutting costs, speeding decisions, and keeping our warfighters ahead.  It also mandates regular reports to Congress for swift, informed action  to maintain our edge.

My second amendment ensures an immediate pay raise for Department of  War blue-collar workers, the mechanics and technicians who keep our  bases and equipment ready. These Americans have yet to receive a 2025  pay raise because the fully partisan committee that was supposed to  represent these blue-collar workers failed in its mission and had to be  dissolved.

Mr. Chair, I look forward to working with the Department of War on  implementing recommendations to make sure these crucial workers are  paid what they deserve.
