Saluting Our Soldiers of Tomorrow


Mr. SELF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute our soldiers of  tomorrow, the service-bound academy students of the Third Congressional  District of Texas.

This district of Texas is home to some of the best and brightest  young people, and it is always an honor to recommend such fine students  to our Nation's service academies.

I am confident that they are ready to join the premier service  academies and ultimately serve with the best in the United States  military.

This year, Texas' Third District is going to send nine cadets to the  United States Military Academy, six midshipmen to the United States  Naval Academy, eight cadets to the U.S. Air Force Academy, one  midshipman to the United States Merchant Marine Academy, one candidate  to the United States Military Academy Civil Preparatory School, three  candidates to the Naval Academy Preparatory School, one candidate to  the United States Naval Academy Civil Preparatory School, and three  candidates to the United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School.

Mr. Speaker, to these 24 appointees and 8 preparatory candidates, I  say God bless them and God bless America. I salute them.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the names of the 32 academy  students and their respective hometowns.                           u.s. military academy
