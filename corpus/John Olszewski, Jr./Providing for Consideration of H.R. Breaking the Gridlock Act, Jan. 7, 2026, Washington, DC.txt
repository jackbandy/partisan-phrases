Providing for Consideration of H.R. Breaking the Gridlock Act


Mr. OLSZEWSKI. Mr. Speaker, despite Americans consistently  identifying higher costs as their number one issue, today marks 369  days that this Republican-led Congress has failed to take any  significant action to address the affordability crisis. Instead,  chaotic trade policies, along with devastating cuts to healthcare and  food programs by the President, have only driven up costs.

The recent expiration of ACA tax credits makes things even worse. In  Maryland, it is the equivalent of a $4,700 tax hike. I have heard from  many constituents who are now forgoing insurance altogether, exposing  them to risks and spiking premiums across the board.

I am also deeply concerned about the chilling economic effect that  this will have. If we aren't going to pass legislation to lower costs  in this Congress, can we at least pass legislation to keep them from  going up even more?

I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the legislation before  us. Extend these tax credits for struggling families.
