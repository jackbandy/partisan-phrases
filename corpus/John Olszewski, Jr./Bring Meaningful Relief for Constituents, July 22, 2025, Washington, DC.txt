Bring Meaningful Relief for Constituents

Mr. OLSZEWSKI. Madam Speaker, it is now the fourth time I have come  to this floor with a poster to count the days. We are now 200 days into  this session of Congress and, sadly, I return with the same message. I  wish it weren't so.

I have scoured our voting record, trying in vain to find one vote,  just one, that would lower costs for American families. The closest I  found was a bill that would improve price transparency for concert  tickets, but nothing to actually address price gouging.

When it comes to the most basic of necessities, there hasn't been one  serious effort from House leadership to lower costs. Instead, President  Trump and this GOP majority are doing the opposite, driving up costs  through tariffs. The big, ugly budget makes things even worse by ending  food programs and causing both healthcare costs and utility bills to  skyrocket.

I again call on House leadership to bring legislation to this floor  that delivers meaningful relief to all our constituents.
