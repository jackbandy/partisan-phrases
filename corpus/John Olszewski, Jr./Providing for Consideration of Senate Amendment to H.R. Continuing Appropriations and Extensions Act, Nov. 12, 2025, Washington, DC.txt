Mr. OLSZEWSKI. Mr. Speaker, this funding deal is why Americans have  lost faith in Congress. It does absolutely nothing to address the  crushing cost of healthcare, in what amounts to a massive tax hike on  working families.

It does absolutely nothing to stop President Trump from canceling the  very funding we would provide, something he has already done again and  again.

Here is what it does: It allows Senators to write themselves, and  only themselves, million-dollar checks because their phone records were  legally subpoenaed, checks paid for by American taxpayers.

It is corruption at a whole new level. With bribery and insider  trading, someone breaks the law. Here, Congress is writing a law that  protects and funds corruption. It is brazen and disgusting and an  effort to legalize corruption. Anyone who votes for this CR is  complicit in that corruption.

If government still belongs to the people and not the powerful, then  we must reject this self-serving scam.
