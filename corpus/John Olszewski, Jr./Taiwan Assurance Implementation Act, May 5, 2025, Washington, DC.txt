Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act


I rise in support of H.R. 1512. In the 118th Congress, this body came  together to overwhelmingly pass this bipartisan measure from  Representatives Wagner, Connolly, and Lieu 404-7, and I see no reason  why today's vote should be any less supportive.

It is critical that the United States shows unwavering support for  our friend Taiwan in the face of the PRC's persistent use of economic,  political, and military coercion against it.

Just last month, the PRC conducted large-scale drills in the waters  and airspace around Taiwan in a dangerous and destabilizing show of  force. I heard these concerns reinforced recently during a  congressional visit to the Pacific countries.

Under such tense circumstances, we must work to maintain peace and  stability in the Taiwan Strait by bolstering deterrence and redoubling  our commitment to the U.S. One China policy.

While providing Taiwan with the weapons to defend itself, we must  also strengthen our unofficial relationship with Taiwan in the cultural  and economic space and build resilience in Taiwan against PRC gray zone  tactics.

Since 1979, in order to build a bilateral relationship with China,  our government has maintained internal executive department guidelines  to limit official interactions with Taiwan consistent with our One  China policy. This bill simply directs the executive to report the  guidelines to Congress every 5 years so that Congress is aware of them.

Mr. Speaker, Taiwan is a friend and a fellow democracy that we should  continue to engage with warmth and respect.

The United States needs a Taiwan policy that works for us and Taiwan  while upholding our longstanding One China policy, which has kept  Taiwan safe for over four decades.

Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me and support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
