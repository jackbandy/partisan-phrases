Mr. OLSZEWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind my colleagues that  this bill is more than words on paper. The policies we are debating  today have real impacts on real people, people like 4-year-old Amir  Rich, who visited my office earlier this month. Amir was born at just 2  pounds and spent 452 days in the hospital.

Today, although he still depends on feeding tubes and oxygen tanks,  he is thriving. He is walking and able to speak. He lit up my office  with energy. That is thanks to the care he received under Medicaid.

Christina was forced to leave her 16-year career in corrections to  become his full-time caregiver, placing a significant financial strain  on their family. In the face of rising costs for American families,  Medicaid has become a vital lifeline helping to cover the kind of care  Amir needs.

The bill before us guts these lifelines like Medicaid and CHIP. These  programs cover nearly half of all American children.

For families like Christina and Amir, today's vote is a matter of  life and death. I encourage my colleagues to look at Amir. Look at him  and oppose this reckless bill. Protect the vital support systems that  serve millions of Americans.
