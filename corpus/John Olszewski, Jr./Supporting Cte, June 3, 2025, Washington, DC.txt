Supporting Cte

Mr. OLSZEWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank my colleague, Chairman  Williams, for his leadership on a bipartisan bill that we passed  earlier today to ensure that small businesses have access to  information about career and technical education programs and that  helps them, more importantly, hire both accomplished and competent CTE  graduates.

I am proud to co-lead this effort as someone who prioritized  workforce development as well as career and technical education in my  prior roles. As Baltimore County executive, I helped implement a $3.3  billion school improvement plan with a strong emphasis on CTE. I  created the Public Health Pathways Program, connecting residents with  high-demand nursing jobs. As a State legislator, I helped create the  Maryland Employment Advancement Right Now Program, addressing the needs  of workers by creating formal career pathways to good jobs.

These efforts work. Countless Americans are hungry for employment and  are seeking opportunities to improve their livelihoods by pursuing  their passions.

This bill is just one of many steps we need to take to build a strong  pipeline of skilled workers in high-need industries.

CTE graduates have the skills and dedication that Maryland and  American small businesses need, and I thank my colleagues for  supporting this commonsense bill.
