Sen. Lee Serves Utah Fare to Senate Colleagues


Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) will serve Utah-made tacos, tortilla chips, salsa, and cookies to his Republican Senate colleagues this Thursday at the weekly conference lunch.

"We all need to support each other through this difficult time, and one way to do that is eating at local restaurants and buying local food," Sen. Lee said. "That is why I am so proud to serve Angelica's tacos at this Thursday's Senate Republican lunch."

Each week the Senate is in session, Republican senators take turns providing lunch to their Republican colleagues.

This Thursday Sen. Lee will be serving tacos from Angelica's in St. George, Utah, along with Don Julio tortilla chips, Salsa Queen salsa, and Crumbl cookies.
