Sen. Lee Named to President's Economic Task Force


Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) was named to President Trump's Congressional Economic Task Force on Wednesday. The bipartisan and bicameral group of federal lawmakers will provide counsel to President Trump on the reopening of the American economy.

"It is an honor to be chosen by President Trump to serve on the Congressional Economic Task Force," Sen. Lee said Thursday. "Utah has a plan and is leading the way in solutions to this economic crisis and I look forward to sharing those ideas with the president. We had a booming economy before this crisis, and with the right safeguards in place, we will have a booming recovery too."
