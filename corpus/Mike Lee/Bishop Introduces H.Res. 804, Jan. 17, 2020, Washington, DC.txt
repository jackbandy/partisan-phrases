Bishop Introduces H.Res. 804, Celebrating Utah's Role in Advancing Women's Suffrage


Today, Representative Rob Bishop was joined by Representatives Stewart, Curtis, and McAdams in introducing H.Res. 804, a bill recognizing the leading role of Utahns in the fight for women's suffrage and celebrating the sesquicentennial of the first votes by women under the equal suffrage law in 1870.

Upon introduction, Representative Bishop said the following:

"Utah has always been a leader in the effort to provide women the right to vote. While Utah was the second territory/state to legally allow women suffrage, it was the first in the nation to have a woman cast a legal ballot, cast by Seraph Young and roughly 25 other women in Salt Lake City on February 14, 1870. In ironic injustice, it was the federal government that repealed that right in Utah, but one of the first things Utah did upon statehood was guarantee women's suffrage and the right to hold office in the state constitution. The first woman elected to a legislative body was in Utah. This resolution recognizes that proud history."

Senator Romney and Senator Lee introduced companion legislation in the Senate.
