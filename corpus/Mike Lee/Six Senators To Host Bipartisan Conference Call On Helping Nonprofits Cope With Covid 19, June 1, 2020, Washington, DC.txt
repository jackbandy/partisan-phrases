Six Senators To Host Bipartisan Conference Call On Helping Nonprofits Cope With Covid 19


Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Chris Coons (D-DE), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), James Lankford (R-OK), Tim Scott (R-SC), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) will speak on a conference call at 5 PM ET on Tuesday, June 2, hosted by a coalition of national nonprofits to discuss how Congress can help the nonprofit community during the Coronavirus crisis with a Universal Charitable Deduction.

"The Coronavirus continues to disrupt all of our lives, but it also presents three unique challenges to our nation's charitable organizations," Sen. Lee said. "First, charitable organizations that help our most vulnerable communities are seeing increased demand for their services. Second, the virus has disrupted how many of these organizations deliver their services. And third, most charities have suffered a decline in donations as Americans have felt the financial pain of less work and unemployment."

"Congress can help by allowing all taxpayers to claim the full charitable deduction for the tax year 2020. This would help more Americans donate to charitable organizations."

The following organizations are sponsoring the call: American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American Red Cross, Americans for the Arts, Catholic Charities USA, Council for Advancement and Support of Education, Easterseals, Faith and Giving Coalition, Girl Scouts of the USA, Jewish Federations of North America, National Council of Nonprofits, Salvation Army USA, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, United Way Worldwide, Volunteers of America, and YMCA of the USA.
