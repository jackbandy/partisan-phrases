Sen. Lee Statement on Passage of USMCA


Sen. Mike Lee issued the following statement Thursday after the Senate voted overwhelmingly to approve the United States--Mexico--Canada Agreement (USMCA):

"Today's passage of the USMCA was a huge win for all of Utah, especially the more than 120,000 Utahns whose jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada. Utah dairy farmers, manufacturers, and the agriculture community will all benefit from continued free and fair trade with our immediate neighbors to the north and south. Utah exports more than $2.5 billion a year to Mexico and Canada, and thanks to this agreement that number will only grow and make Utah's economy stronger. This update to our trade policy moves the U.S., Mexico, and Canada further into the 21st century, setting mutually beneficial standards regarding the treatment of digital services and e-commerce."
