Romney, Lee Introduce Legislation to Protect Utah's Voice in Land Management


U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Mike Lee (R-UT) today introduced an amendment to the American Energy Innovation Act that would limit the extension or establishment of national monuments in the State of Utah. "One person in Washington should not possess the unilateral power to make a decision that will dramatically change the way of life for rural Utahns," Senator Romney said. "The decision to establish a national monument should belong to Congress with involvement from our local communities and state legislature. Our amendment protects Utah from abuse under the Antiquities Act." "Rural Utahns should not have to live under the constant threat that their way of life could be suddenly changed with a single stroke of a pen in Washington," Senator Lee said. "At a bare minimum they deserve the same protection that the citizens of Wyoming and Alaska enjoy from the Antiquities Act. That is why we are introducing this "or Utah' amendment to the energy bill, which will simply extend the same Antiquities Act protections Wyoming and Alaska currently enjoy to the state of Utah." Background:The legislation is similar to the PURE Act, separate legislation that would protect Utah from presidential Antiquities Act abuse in much the same way Alaska and Wyoming are currently protected.
