Autism Awareness Month

Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize that April is  Autism Awareness Month.

Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disability that generally  appears before the age of 3, impacting social interaction,  communication skills, and cognitive function.

Today, 1 in 36 children in the United States are diagnosed with  autism, and approximately 5.4 million Americans are living with autism  spectrum disorder. By raising awareness, we can support individuals and  families affected by autism and help them lead fulfilling lives.

I will take a moment to recognize my longtime dear friend Vincent  McLaughlin, a dedicated advocate and true inspiration. Vincent has  shown unwavering commitment to his community through his decade-long  service on the Ulster County Planning Board representing the Village of  Saugerties, his 16 years of service as a volunteer firefighter, and his  continuous work to raise awareness and support for those living with  autism.

In 2023, he was appointed to the New York State Council on  Developmental Disabilities because of his advocacy and dedication,  which embody the spirit of community involvement and empowerment.  Vincent's selfless efforts make a difference every day, and I am  grateful for his dedication and support.

As we observe Autism Awareness Month, let us commit to supporting all  Americans with autism, ensuring they receive the necessary resources,  opportunities, and respect they deserve. As my friend Vincent has  proven, autism should never be a barrier to success or happiness.
