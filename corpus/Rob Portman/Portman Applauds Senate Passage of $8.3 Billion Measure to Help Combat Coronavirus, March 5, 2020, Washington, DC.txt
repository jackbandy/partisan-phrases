Portman Applauds Senate Passage of $8.3 Billion Measure to Help Combat Coronavirus


Today, Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) applauded the Senate passage of the $8.3 billion funding measure to help prevent, prepare, and respond to the domestic spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. The legislation now heads to the president's desk for signature. Portman released the following statement:

"The worldwide threat of the novel coronavirus is serious, and we must be prepared. By passing this legislation in an overwhelmingly bipartisan manner, the Senate took an important step toward ensuring that our federal, state, and local agencies have the funds to help prevent, prepare, and respond to the spread of the virus. While there have been no confirmed cases in Ohio to date, this funding will help Ohio respond to any potential outbreaks and will expedite the development of a vaccine and treatment options, increase the production of and access to diagnostic tests, and help states and municipalities fund response efforts.

"I've attended multiple briefings by the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, and the administration and have been in close contact with Governor DeWine and his team. All of our federal, state, and local agencies are working together, and we must ensure they have the resources they need to prepare for this threat.

"I urge the president to sign this funding into law quickly so we can ensure the federal government is doing everything possible to keep Americans safe and secure."
