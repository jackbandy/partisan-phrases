Portman Praises Trump Administration's Phase One Trade Agreement with China


U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) issued the following statement after attending the White House signing ceremony for the phase one trade agreement with China: 

"I applaud President Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer for their persistence and their determination in finalizing this phase one agreement with China. It represents a good first step towards creating a more balanced economic relationship between our two countries, but the agreement will only remain durable over time if it is enforced. That is why it is significant that this agreement includes the option to re-impose tariffs should China fail to hold up its new commitments, including preventing the theft of intellectual property.

"There is more work to do in phase two to fully address China's unfair trade practices. China is Ohio's third-largest trading partner after Canada and Mexico, with more than $700 million in soybeans, and other agriculture commodities shipped there every year. We also sell nearly $500 million of auto parts and more than $500 million in aerospace parts to China. We must continue to hold China accountable to its trade obligations in order to help workers, exporters, and consumers across Ohio and our country.

"I have faith in American workers, farmers, and business owners and their ability to innovate and compete successfully if there is a level playing field. All we ask for is fair and reciprocal treatment from our trading partners and today's signing of the phase one agreement is an important step in that direction."
