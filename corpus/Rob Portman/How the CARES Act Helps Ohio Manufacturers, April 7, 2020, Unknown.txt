How the CARES Act Helps Ohio Manufacturers


Two weeks ago, Congress passed and President Trump signed into law the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The CARES Act is providing unprecedented financial support to offset the economic free fall brought about by the virus. Manufacturers in Ohio, which have been among the businesses hurt significantly by this slowdown, will soon get some much-needed help as part of the CARES Act.   

Specifically, the CARES Act rescue package will help manufacturers in Ohio during the coronavirus pandemic by:

These provisions will increase transparency in the prescription drug supply chain and establish mechanisms to prevent global shortages of life-saving therapeutics.CARES provides $10 billion for USPS' last-mile service for delivery of medical equipment.This service is critical to delivering consumers can continue to purchase and receive American-made medical equipment for the duration of the pandemic from the safety of their home.Helping Manufacturers Stay Afloat
