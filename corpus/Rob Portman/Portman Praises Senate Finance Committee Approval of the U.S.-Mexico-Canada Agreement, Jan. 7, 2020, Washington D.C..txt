Portman Praises Senate Finance Committee Approval of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement


U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) issued the following statement after the Senate Finance Committee approved the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA): 

"The Senate Finance Committee's strong bipartisan approval of USMCA is good news for Ohio and the country, and an important step forward in our efforts to secure passage by the full Senate. This long-awaited agreement is a significant improvement over the status quo of NAFTA. By opening more markets, it is good for American workers, farmers, and manufacturers, and it will create thousands of new jobs here in the United States.  

"USMCA is particularly good for Ohio as our two top trading partners are Canada and Mexico. This agreement expands market access for Ohio farm products, incentivizes more auto production in the state, and makes online sales easier for Ohio companies. 

"I applaud President Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer for their persistence and their determination to finalize this historic new trade agreement. A vote for USMCA is a vote for improved market access, more U.S. manufacturing, and a more level playing field for American workers, farmers, and service providers. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting it when it reaches the Senate floor."
