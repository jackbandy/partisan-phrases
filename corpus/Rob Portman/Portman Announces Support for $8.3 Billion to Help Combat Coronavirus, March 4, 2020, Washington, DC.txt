Today, Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) announced his support for the newly-released $8.3 billion funding measure to help prevent, prepare, and respond to the domestic spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. The legislation is currently under consideration in the House of Representatives. Portman released the following statement:

"The worldwide threat of the novel coronavirus is serious, and we must be prepared. I support the $8.3 billion funding package to ensure our federal, state, and local agencies have the funds to help prevent, prepare, and respond to the spread of the virus. While there have been no confirmed cases in Ohio to date, this funding will help Ohio respond to any potential outbreaks and will expedite the development of a vaccine and treatment options, increase the production of and access to diagnostic tests, and help states and municipalities fund response efforts.

"I've attended multiple briefings by the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, and the administration and have been in close contact with Governor DeWine and his team. All of our federal, state, and local agencies are working together, and we must ensure they have the resources they need to prepare for this threat.

"I urge all of my colleagues to support this funding. This shouldn't a partisan issue. This is about ensuring the federal government is doing everything possible to keep Americans' lives safe and secure."
