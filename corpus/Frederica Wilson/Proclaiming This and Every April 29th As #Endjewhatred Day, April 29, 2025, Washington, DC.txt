Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to include in the Record  the following Proclamation in recognition of this and every April 29th  as #EndJewHatred Day.

Whereas, for centuries, the Jewish people have sustained       their shared religious, cultural, and ethnic identity and       traditions in the face of enslavement, persecution, genocide,       segregation and discrimination, and all manner of adversity;       and

Whereas, since the first Jewish person set foot in America       in 1654, members of the Jewish community have made indelible       contributions to the state of Florida and to the United       States of America, contributing to the vibrant cultural,       historical, and social framework of American life; and

Whereas, the greatness in American democracy and the       promise of liberty and opportunity have drawn countless       Jewish individuals to these shores, including those escaping       from oppressive regimes in Europe, survivors of the       Holocaust, and those seeking a haven from persecution; and

Whereas, the Jewish community has been instrumental in       advancing civil rights initiatives across America, fighting       discrimination, and advocating for justice and inclusivity       for all members of society; and

Whereas, despite notable progress toward social justice,       the Jewish community continues to face antisemitism and Jew-      hatred; and

Whereas, the reality of antisemitism has manifested itself       in various forms, from microaggressions to violent attacks,       targeting Jewish individuals for their identity and seeking       to deny their shared identity; and

Whereas, the alarming increase in hate crimes against the       Jewish community has catalyzed movements such as End Jew       Hatred, which seeks to reshape public dialogue and create a       society where Jew-hatred is intolerable, empowering       individuals to embrace their Jewish heritage without fear of       attack or persecution; and

Whereas, we all have a moral obligation to confront and       reject Jew-hatred in all its forms; and

Whereas, the first official recognition of ``#EndJewHatred       Day'' on April 29, 2022, exemplified a united stand against       Jew-hatred, empowering collective action towards a future       characterized by fighting racism and bigotry with       understanding and equality; and

Whereas, it is imperative that we remain vigilant and       proactive in opposing Jew-hatred to ensure that the painful       history of the past is not forgotten or repeated;

Now, therefore, be it proclaimed, That I, Representative       Frederica Wilson, in recognition of the urgent need to end       Jew-hatred in this generation, hereby declare and proclaim       every April 29 as ``#EndJewHatred Day;'' and

Be it further proclaimed, That I, Representative Frederica       Wilson, affirm and proclaim that the 24th Congressional       District of Florida stands united in condemning Jew-hatred in       all its forms and remains steadfast in the commitment to end       discrimination against, and persecution of, the Jewish       community.
