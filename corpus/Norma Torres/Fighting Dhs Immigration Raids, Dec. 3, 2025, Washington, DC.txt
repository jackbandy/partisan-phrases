Fighting Dhs Immigration Raids

Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out  against the narrative being promoted about immigrants, portraying them  as rapists, drug dealers, and murderers.

These claims are nothing more than a self-reflection of our country's  leaders who promised to protect Americans and enforce the law, yet  whose actions have violated basic human rights, the Constitution, the  rule of law, and are now costing our country economically.

Under these policies, DHS is targeting people because of the color of  their skin, the language they speak, and where they come from. Families  are being separated, children are traumatized, and communities live in  fear. These actions are weakening our labor force, shrinking our tax  base, and threatening industries that rely on a stable workforce.

Members of Congress should not be targeted with CS gas, shoved, or  have false charges filed against them simply for performing oversight.

Citizens should not be shot at simply for raising concerns about the  safety of children in the presence of armed men in their neighborhoods.

This approach doesn't make us safer. It disrupts local economies,  increases costs for taxpayers, and undermines the workforce that keeps  our country running.

Every day these policies continue, businesses lose workers, consumers  lose purchasing power, and taxpayers pay for the unnecessary  enforcement. We need transparency, fair treatment,  and laws that reflect reality, not fear or political theater.

Let me remind this Chamber, undocumented immigrants--the same people  being targeted--contributed $96.7 billion in Federal, State, and local  taxes in 2022, including $25.7 billion into Social Security benefits  they will never receive, $6.4 billion into Medicare, $1.8 billion into  unemployment insurance.

If some Members don't care about the human cost, consider the  financial one. Removing these workers weakens our economy and raises  costs for everyone. Protecting them protects our bottom line.
