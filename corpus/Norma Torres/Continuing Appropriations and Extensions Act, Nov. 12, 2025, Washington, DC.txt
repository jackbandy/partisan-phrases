Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026

Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition  of this deeply flawed bill because the American people deserve better.

Since Trump returned to office, Republicans have created an  affordability nightmare, a mass transfer of hard-earned taxpayer  dollars to billionaires.

In my district alone, more than 350,000 people are facing  skyrocketing healthcare costs or cuts to critical services. Republicans  shut down the government instead of finding bipartisan solutions to  keep care affordable and took a 7-week paid hiatus, doubling healthcare  costs for working families, cutting off food assistance right before  Thanksgiving, and letting Trump spend his days pardoning  insurrectionists, enriching billionaires, cozying up to dictators, and  building himself a new ballroom, all while taking food away from  families in need.

Now Senate Republicans want to reward themselves with a taxpayer- funded handout. It is shameful. House Republicans should be here doing  their jobs, not making life harder for working families.

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
