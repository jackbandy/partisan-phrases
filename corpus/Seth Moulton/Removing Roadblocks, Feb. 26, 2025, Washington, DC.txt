Removing Roadblocks


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688243/removing-roadblocks


Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, in President Trump's first term, facing a  crowd of protesters, he asked our military: Can't you just shoot them?  Just shoot them in the legs or something?

Thankfully, his former Secretary of Defense shot down that idea.

Today, the President seems to be choosing military leadership he  believes will say yes. He is purging dedicated, capable leaders with no  explanation other than removing roadblocks.

This is a blatant attempt to politicize our military, replacing  loyalty to our Constitution with political loyalty to Trump.

Our Founding Fathers designed our military to be explicitly  apolitical. They must be rolling in their graves today.

When I joined the Marines in 2001, I raised my right hand and swore  an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States just like every  other servicemember and veteran. That oath is sacred. We swear our  lives, to kill and to die, if necessary, to the United States, not to  the President.

The Trump administration must not be allowed to undermine that oath.
