Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize my friend, Father  Shaughnessy.

I was at a marine reunion this weekend, and we heard remarkable  stories of heroism from ordinary Americans who signed up for the Marine  Corps, who did heroic things. There were a lot of stories about  marines. There were stories about one civilian who was with us in the  fight, who, as we were getting hit with incoming rounds, would walk  thoughtlessly amongst us to give us comfort. When marines were getting  hit, he didn't seem to care. One marine told a story of him showing up  on a stack of marines going into a room, and the marine turned around  and said: Father, you probably shouldn't be right here.

Father Shaughnessy never met a marine who didn't respect him, just  like he never met an R he could pronounce. Yes, every time he opened  his mouth, we knew he was from Worcester, Massachusetts. What he said  with his words inspired courage in all of us.

Father Shaughnessy is a friend. He is a leader, and he is an American  hero.
