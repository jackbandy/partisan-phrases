Sen. Moran Applauds President Trump's Announcement to Increase Support for Farmers and Ranchers


Today, U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) issued the following statement after President Trump's announcement to expand relief to farmers and ranchers through the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP):

"Through no fault of their own, our farmers and ranchers are facing extreme financial harm during the COVID-19 pandemic, and I am pleased the administration is increasing the amount of support farmers and ranchers can receive during this pandemic. While we negotiated the CARES Act, I worked with my colleagues to make certain it would provide critical aid for our producers. In addition, I urged the administration to raise or eliminate the payment caps that would prevent many family-owned farms and ranches from receiving the aid they need to stay in business. I appreciate President Trump and Secretary Perdue's leadership in this effort to ensure relief payments for our producers cover as much financial loss as possible."

Agricultural economists have estimated over $13 billion in harm to the cattle industry and $5 billion to the pork industry due to the pandemic, with many billions more in injury to other crop producers.

The CARES Act provided $23.5 billion to support farmers and ranchers during this pandemic, including $9.5 billion for livestock, dairy and specialty crop producers, as well as farmers supplying local food systems. Sen. Moran urged the president in April to eliminate relief restrictions for livestock, dairy and specialty crop producers to make certain farmers receive the support they need to weather this crisis. Sen. Moran also took several steps to bolster the livestock industry by calling for emergency payments for ranchers and advocating for increased funding for cattle producers in the CARES Act.
