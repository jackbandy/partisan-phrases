Sen. Moran Statement on Iran War Powers Resolution


U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today released the following statement on S.J. Res. 68, the Iran War Powers Resolution:

"Qassem Soleimani was a perpetrator of death and responsible for thousands killed in the Middle East, including American soldiers. The Constitution, through Article II, grants the President of the United States the authority to protect Americans from harm, and President Trump was justified in his decision to remove Soleimani from the battlefield. 

"The Constitution, in Article I, provides Congress the power to declare war -- a responsibility I take seriously. The prospect of military action against Iran has consequences that ought to be considered by the full Congress on behalf of the people it represents. In supporting the War Powers Resolution, I respect the president's obligation to defend against imminent threats while making sure any additional action is properly debated and approved by Congress as required by the Constitution."
