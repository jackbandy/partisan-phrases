Sen. Moran Statement on the President's FY2021 NASA Budget Request


U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) -- chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies --  today issued the following statement after President Trump released the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) budget request for FY2021:

"If the United States is going to accomplish our shared goal of a Moon landing by 2024, NASA must actively execute a plan of well-defined programs and activities that are both strategic and transparent. While it is encouraging to see a proposed budget that supports returning American astronauts to the Moon, I remain eager to receive sufficient budget details to match our ambitious human exploration goals.

"In addition, I am disappointed the budget would cut STEM education, which plays a vital role in making certain we have the talent to achieve our mission. I look forward to my subcommittee's oversight hearings in the coming months to discuss the FY2021 budget, the specifics of the five-year Artemis plan and how this budget will ensure our nation's leadership in the space domain for years to come."
