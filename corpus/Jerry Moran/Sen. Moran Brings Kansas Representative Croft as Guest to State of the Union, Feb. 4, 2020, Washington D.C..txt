Sen. Moran Brings Kansas Representative Croft as Guest to State of the Union


U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today welcomed Kansas Representative Chris Croft, who represents the 8th district in Overland Park, Kansas, to the U.S. Capitol to be his guest at the State of the Union.

"Rep. Croft is both a veteran and an advocate for veterans in his role as a Kansas representative," said Sen. Moran. "He served in the U.S. Army for 30 years and after retiring as a Colonel was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives. Rep. Croft is dedicated to his country, to Kansas and to our nation's veterans, and I'm honored to have him join me at the State of the Union as my guest."

During his time in the Army, Rep. Croft served in Iraq and was selected as the executive director for the Center for Army Leadership at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In that role, he helped create the Army's first leader development manual and assisted U.S. allies around the world to establish their own leadership centers. He received the distinction as the longest serving director of the Army's Leadership Center.

After retiring from the Army, Rep. Croft continued his service by running for the Kansas House of Representatives. He was elected as the representative for the 8th district in 2018 and was selected to serve on the Veteran and Military Affairs Committee. Croft is working to pass legislation to help establish a new home for veterans in northeast Kansas. 

 "Attending the State of the Union is like attending the Super Bowl; this is a bucket list item," said Rep. Croft. "I'm excited to represent the people of Kansas and bring attention to the important work we are doing in the state legislature. I look forward to hearing the president highlight what we've accomplished and his vision for the future. We have a big year ahead of us, and we need to stay focused."
