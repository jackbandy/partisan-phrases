Sen. Moran Statement on Passage of Phase III COVID-19 Relief Package


U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) issued the following statement after the Senate's passage of the "Phase III' relief bill, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act:

"Our country is facing a pandemic, and we must act now to make certain Kansans have the support they need to weather this storm. The CARES Act is far from perfect and includes many provisions I would not support in ordinary circumstances, but hospitals need supplies, small businesses need loans, farmers and ranchers need certainty and folks who are out of work, through no fault of their own, need relief. Through direct payments to families, assistance to hurting industries and strategic solutions to meet health care demands, Phase III will provide relief and resources to help make certain small businesses can keep employees on the payroll and reopen their doors when this pandemic has passed.

"Despite the bill's many imperfections, I'm pleased a number of provisions I advocated for are included in this legislation, such as providing aid to the aviation industry and community banks and providing additional resources to the FCC as we utilize more broadband and telecommunications services to meet the economic and educational needs of families in this uncertain time."
