Chairman Moran Statement on the President's FY2021 Veterans Affairs Budget Request


U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) -- Chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee -- today issued the following statement after President Trump released his Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) budget request for FY2021:

"Our veterans deserve the best care this country can offer, and President Trump's budget proposal for FY2021 supports the ongoing implementation of community care under the MISSION Act, reducing veteran suicide and transforming the VA's system to provide veterans with the right benefits at the right time.

"As Chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I look forward to learning more about the budget request and working with Secretary Wilkie to identify how veterans' outcomes will be improved under the new investments in VA programs."
