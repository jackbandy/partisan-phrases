Sen. Moran Announces $63 Million for Kansas Nursing Homes Impacted by COVID-19


U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today announced the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will be distributing $63.4 million to Kansas skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) to help combat the effects of COVID-19. This funding was provided through the CARES Act.

"Caring for our seniors is particularly challenging during this pandemic, and to help protect our loved ones, we rely heavily on the services of nursing homes across the state," said Sen. Moran. "This funding will help provide the tools and resources needed to prevent the virus from spreading into nursing homes that haven't been infected and help provide life-saving resources to the facilities where they continue to battle the spread of the virus."

Distribution Methodology Provided by HHS:

- HHS will make relief fund distributions to SNFs based on both a fixed basis and variable basis. Each SNF will receive a fixed distribution of $50,000, plus a distribution of $2,500 per bed. All certified SNFs with six or more certified beds are eligible for this targeted distribution.

- Nursing home recipients must attest that they will only use Provider Relief Fund payments for permissible purposes, as set forth in the Terms and Conditions, and agree to comply with future government audit and reporting requirements.
