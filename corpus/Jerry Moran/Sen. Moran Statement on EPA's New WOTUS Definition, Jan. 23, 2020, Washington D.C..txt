Sen. Moran Statement on EPA's New WOTUS Definition


U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today released the following statement on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) decision to better define "waters of the United States" (WOTUS) which helps clarify federal authority under the Clean Water Act:

"The new WOTUS definition helps clarify the jurisdiction the federal government and states have over waterways and provides a welcome change from the overreaching Obama-era WOTUS rule. This rule reduces unnecessary regulations and allows Kansas farmers, ranchers and other landowners to better utilize the water resources available to them. It is important that we work to protect our wetlands and waterways for future generations, while also providing clarity on the EPA's jurisdiction over our land and water."
