Sen. Moran Statement on Announced Layoffs at Spirit AeroSystems


U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today released the following statement regarding the layoffs announced at Spirit AeroSystems:

"Wichita would not be the Air Capital of the World without the extraordinary engineers, designers and manufacturers who have invested in our aviation industry and made Wichita their home. The layoffs announced today at Spirit AeroSystems have dealt a harsh blow not only to the company but also to Spirit suppliers and subcontractors. This week, I had conversations with both the incoming CEO at Boeing and the FAA Administrator to encourage them to work together and do everything necessary to get the 737 MAX safely back in the air. I will work with business leaders and Administration officials to do everything possible to see that this is a short-term impact to the aviation and aerospace industry in Wichita.

"In addition, I have spoken directly with President Trump and Vice President Pence regarding the impact the layoffs will have in Kansas and throughout the aviation and aerospace industry. I plan to continue working with the Administration and Department of Defense to showcase the capabilities of Wichita manufacturers in an effort to diversify the industry and bring more job opportunities to the region."
