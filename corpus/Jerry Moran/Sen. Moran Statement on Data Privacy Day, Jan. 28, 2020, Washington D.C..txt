Sen. Moran Statement on Data Privacy Day


U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) -- Chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Manufacturing, Trade and Consumer Protection -- today issued the following statement in recognition of Data Privacy Day, an international day set aside to raise awareness and promote privacy and data protection: 

"Americans deserve certain assurances regarding how businesses are collecting and using their personally identifiable information. As chairman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee overseeing consumer protection, I have conducted public hearings and made inquiries to hold businesses accountable and gain a better understanding of how they are using consumers' data while working to improve federal laws to protect consumers in a rapidly developing technological age. Congress needs to pass comprehensive legislation that protects consumers' data privacy and work to promote responsible regulatory changes that empower consumers rather than deceiving them."
