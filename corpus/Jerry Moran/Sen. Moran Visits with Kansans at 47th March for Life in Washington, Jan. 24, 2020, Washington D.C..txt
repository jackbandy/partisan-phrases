Sen. Moran Visits with Kansans at 47th March for Life in Washington, D.C.


U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today, during a scheduled break in the Senate impeachment trial, met with students from Kapaun Mt. Carmel High School in Wichita participating in the 47th March for Life in Washington, D.C.   

"Every year, Kansans travel to Washington, D.C. to march for the protection of the unborn, and every year, I'm reminded by their actions that this is a fight we will never stop waging," said Sen. Moran. "It is an inspiration for me to visit with these marchers, especially young Kansans, who are supporting a cause that is greater than themselves. I want to thank the Kansans, and all the people who came out today, for marching for the unborn and speaking out for those who cannot speak for themselves."
