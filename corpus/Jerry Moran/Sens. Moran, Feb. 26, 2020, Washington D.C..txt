Sens. Moran, Tester Introduce Resolution Honoring Disabled American Veterans


Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Ranking Member Jon Tester (D-Mont.) introduced a resolution honoring the 100th anniversary of DAV (Disabled American Veterans). The Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees held a joint hearing yesterday with DAV to hear the organization's thoughts on the future of veteran care and discuss how Congress can empower the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to care for disabled veterans.

DAV was founded Sep. 25, 1920 and chartered by Congress in 1932 as the official voice of the wartime-disabled veterans of the U.S. Every year the organization helps thousands of veterans complete benefit claims, coordinate rides to medical appointments and assist disabled veterans as they transition out of the military.

"DAV has partnered with Congress for the last century in making certain our veterans have the care and support they deserve," said Sens. Moran and Tester. "Through securing transportation for our veterans, assisting them with VA paperwork and continuing to advocate for veteran needs, DAV has helped our veterans succeed in their life after service. We are grateful for DAV's work and look forward to continuing to partner with them on behalf of our nation's veterans."

Chairman Moran and Ranking Member Tester yesterday held a joint House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing and heard from DAV.
