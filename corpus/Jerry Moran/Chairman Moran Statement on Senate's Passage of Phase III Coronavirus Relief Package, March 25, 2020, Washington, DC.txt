U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) -- Chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee -- released the following statement in response to the Senate's passage of the "Phase III' relief bill, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act:

"Many of our veterans are at a higher risk if they contract COVID-19 due to age and pre-existing conditions. During this pandemic, it is important our veterans have continuity of health care and the benefits they have earned. It is also crucial the VA has the necessary resources to support the dedicated front line employees responding to this crisis. Today, I voted to pass the Phase III coronavirus relief package that includes new authorities to help make certain the VA can respond quickly to the needs of our nations veterans."
