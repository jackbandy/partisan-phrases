U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today released the following statement after being confirmed as the 12th chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee:

"During my time in Congress -- as both a member of the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs -- I have made improving the quality of life for veterans across the country a top priority, including the nearly 200,000 veterans living in Kansas. Today, I have the distinct privilege of assuming the role of chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. There is no group of people I hold in higher regard than those who serve our nation, and I take seriously the responsibility of providing our veterans with the best our country has to offer.

"I have always relied on veterans to help drive policy decisions in Washington, and I will continue to look to those who have served for ideas and solutions to improve the lives of their fellow servicemembers. As chairman, I am committed to ensuring our veterans have the right resources at the right time to achieve success after service. To veterans in Kansas and millions of veterans across the country: I work to serve and honor you."
