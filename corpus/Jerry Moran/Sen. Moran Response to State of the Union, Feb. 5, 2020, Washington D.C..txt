Sen. Moran Response to State of the Union


U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today released the following statement in response to President Donald Trump's third State of the Union address:

"The State of the Union offers Congress and the American people the unique opportunity to hear directly from the President of the United States regarding his vision for America's future. I was pleased the president discussed trade, our economy, STEM education, and support for our military and veterans. President Trump highlighted accomplishments we as a nation have made on establishing fairer trade with China and signing the historic United States Mexico-Canada Agreement. These new trade opportunities will help provide Kansas farmers and manufacturers with new markets to sell their products around the world.

"As Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I look forward to working with President Trump to pass and implement policies that prioritize veterans and ensure they receive the care they deserve. I was honored to bring veteran and Kansas Representative Chris Croft to the State of the Union as my guest, and I appreciate the president bringing a number of veterans to the State of the Union as his guests to honor their service and the success they have achieved after service.  

"President Trump also conveyed his wish for Congress to fully fund NASA's Artemis program. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science, I am committed to ensuring NASA has the necessary resources for our country to once again put Americans on the moon, furthering our national security and scientific priorities.

"I look forward to working with President Trump and the administration on the many issues discussed tonight to deliver positive results for Kansans and all Americans."
