Sen. Moran Statement on Additional Funding for Paycheck Protection Program, Testing & Hospitals


U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today released the following statement in response to the Senate's passage of the bipartisan relief package which adds an additional $310 billion to the U.S. Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), $25 billion for testing, including $21.2 million for Kansas, and $75 billion for hospitals:  

"The successful PPP program has already provided more than 26,000 Kansas businesses with vital resources to continue operating and keep their employees on the payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. I am pleased the Senate could reach a bipartisan agreement to replenish this program, and I urge my colleagues in the House to quickly pass this relief package so that the many more small businesses with applications hanging in the balance can receive relief, keep the lights on and save jobs.

"Another critical aspect of this relief package is funding for COVID-19 tests and resources for Kansas hospitals. Kansas is in desperate need of additional COVID-19 tests and this relief package will provide much needed assistance to our state. Through widespread testing, Kansans will be able to feel secure in their health so they can return to work and our economy can recover."
