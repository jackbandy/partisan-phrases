U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today released the following statement on the Senate's vote to pass a supplemental funding package to protect against the coronavirus:

"The threat of coronavirus is serious, and today the Senate took an important step to ensure our federal, state and local governments have the tools necessary to help protect against the spread of the virus. The Senate passed an $8.3 billion supplemental funding package to supply test kits, quarantine locations, additional medical staff, further research on the virus and more. I am pleased that Kansas will receive $6 million to bolster the state's efforts to protect against the coronavirus. This funding is an important step in protecting the health of the American people, and I will continue to work with the administration, state and health officials to make certain we are ready on all fronts to stop the spread of this virus."
