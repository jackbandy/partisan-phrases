Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, the Lower  Elwha Klallam Tribe Project Lands Restoration Act.

I thank Chairman Westerman and Subcommittee Chairman Hurd for their  partnership in bringing this important legislation to the floor. I am  deeply honored to serve on the House Natural Resources Committee and  the Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs. I am proud to represent  a district that is home to 12 federally recognized Tribes, Tribes that  led the Nation in co-stewardship, climate resilience, and ecosystem  restoration.

Each time this Congress gathers to address land restoration and  treaty reserved rights, we are doing incredibly meaningful work, not  only alongside the Tribes that we serve, but in service of the  integrity of our Federal Government's commitments.

I also want to extend a special thank you to Chairwoman Frances  Charles of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe for testifying before the  committee earlier this year on this bill. Chairwoman Charles has spent  her career protecting the Lower Elwha's culture, preserving their  language, and ensuring that treaty reserved hunting and fishing rights  remain.

It strengthens the restoration of the Elwha watershed, which is one  of the most iconic examples of climate resilience and ecological  recovery anywhere in the country. This bill recognizes that the Lower  Elwha people have lived on and cared for this land since time  immemorial.

Transferring land into trust is one of the most impactful actions the  United States can take to deliver on trust and treaty obligations. It  is one of the clearest ways we can demonstrate respect for Tribal  sovereignty and return land to the stewardship of the people who know  it best.

This bill is straightforward, and it is long overdue. It aligns our  policies with our values, and it honors the community that has spent  decades repairing the damage caused by a Federal infrastructure that  was built without Tribal consent.

As someone who has the honor of representing the Lower Elwha Klallam  Tribe, I am proud to lead this legislation alongside Senators Cantwell  and Murray. I recognize the dedication and work of my predecessor,  Representative Derek Kilmer, who championed this bill in past  Congresses prior to his retirement last year.

Chairwoman Charles' leadership has been essential to one of the most  ambitious restoration projects in our country's history: the removal of  the two dams on the Elwha River, the largest dam removal project of our  Nation's history at the time, and the healing of a river system that  has been blocked for a century.

Just this year, we celebrated an anniversary of the river being free,  the return of the salmon through canoe journey. This is an endeavor in  which Tribal canoe families journey from around the Salish Sea and  British Columbia to come to land, to celebrate, to commemorate their  history, and to promise to preserve the land, water, and ecosystem for  seven generations forward.

This legislation is an important piece of that puzzle, transferring  approximately 1,082 acres of Federal land into trust for the Lower  Elwha Klallam Tribe. These are lands once tied to the Federal  hydroelectric project, lands acquired during the dam removal process,  lands that include cultural sites, historic villages, and ecological  areas directly connected to the Tribe's stewardship of the Elwha River.

Placing these lands into trust is not just a procedural act. It is a  promise fulfilled. It affirms the Tribe's sovereign right to protect  and manage sacred sites for generations to come.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in moving this  bill forward so we can take the final step in returning these lands to  the Lower Elwha people, and I yield back the balance of my time.
