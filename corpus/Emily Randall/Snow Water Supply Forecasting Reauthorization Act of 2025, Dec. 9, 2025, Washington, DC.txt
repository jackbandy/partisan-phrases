Snow Water Supply Forecasting Reauthorization Act of 2025


I rise in enthusiastic support of H.R. 3857, the Snow Water Supply  Forecasting Reauthorization Act, brought forward by my colleague and  fellow freshman, Jeff Hurd.

This legislation, as he described, would extend the Bureau of  Reclamation's Snow Water Supply Forecasting Program through 2031,  ensuring that communities have accurate water supply forecasting.

This program plays a critical role in advancing new technologies,  expanding snow monitoring areas, and improving the accuracy of water  supply forecasts.

This work is extremely vital to supporting Western communities facing  growing challenges of climate change, persistent drought, and growing  demands from communities that are growing in our States.

Across the West, communities are experiencing changing precipitation  patterns, diminished snowpack, earlier runoff, and changing water  availability. I certainly look to the mountains, the Olympics and the  Cascades, every time I drive around my district, using a very  nontechnological approach to assessing the snowpack on the mountains.

Mr. Speaker, there are definitely scientists using much better tools,  but this legislation authorizes even better tools to allow us to plan  for our communities' safety and our access to clean water, agriculture,  and a thriving economy.

Paired with the growing demand for water, these changes we have seen  create uncertainty for water managers and users who rely on accurate  data for planning.

By reauthorizing the Snow Water Supply Forecasting program, we ensure  water managers and users have the information that they need to make  informed decisions and support the continued collaboration between  agencies and expanding snowpack data collection and forecasting  capabilities.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
