Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2916 would finalize a longstanding land claim in  New York for the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe by ratifying and confirming  the Agreement of Settlement and Compromise to resolve the Akwesasne  Mohawk Land Claim in the State of New York.

Under this settlement, the Tribe will see 3,500 acres of land  returned to reservation status and have the opportunity to acquire up  to 14,000 acres of land in the land claim areas.

The settlement also provides Akwesasne Mohawk students who attend  State University of New York institutions free tuition and mandatory  fees.

In addition, the Tribe will have the right to nine megawatts of power  at a preferred rate from the New York Power Authority and will receive  $70 million from the power authority over 35 years.

This legislation will finally resolve the Akwesasne Land Claim after  43 years of litigation and 11 years of negotiation.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this policy, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
