Sheriff Adrian ``butch'' Anderson Post Office Building

I rise today in support of H.R. 1008. Sheriff Adrian Anderson was a  47-year veteran of the Dutchess County Sheriff's Office. In 1983, he  was elected mayor of Pawling and served as the village's mayor for 8  years. He received five Combat Crosses, which are awarded to officers  who perform acts of heroism in their communities.

Sheriff Anderson was an active member of many local organizations, as  my colleague shared, serving as a board member of the Make-A-Wish  Foundation of the Hudson Valley and chairman of the March of Dimes.

I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Sheriff  Anderson by naming a post office in Holmes, New York, after him.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
