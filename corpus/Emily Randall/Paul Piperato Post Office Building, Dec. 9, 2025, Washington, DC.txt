Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1009.

During his tenure as county clerk, he modernized the office by  implementing a digital records system and introduced new, user- friendly, and novel features to its website and mobile services for the  public.

Paul Piperato remained an active part of his community, serving  various local organizations and youth programs.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1009, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
