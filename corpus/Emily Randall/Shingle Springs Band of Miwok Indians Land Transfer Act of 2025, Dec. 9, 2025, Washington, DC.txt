Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians Land Transfer Act of 2025


As you heard from Chairman Westerman, H.R. 2302 will help provide the  Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians the ability to address their  housing and infrastructure needs for their citizens.

Like Americans across the country who are struggling to afford  housing in the Trump administration's economy, the Tribe is currently  facing a housing shortage, with over 180 families listed on the Tribe's  housing wait list. Without additional land, the Tribe is unable to  build the housing needed to provide these families with homes.

The Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians Land Transfer Act will  address this challenge by transferring 80 acres currently managed by  the Bureau of Land Management and 185 acres of tribally owned fee land  into trust for the benefit of the Tribe.

This bill is an important step toward ensuring that the Shingle  Springs Band of Miwok Indians has the lands they need, their lands, to  meet the current needs of their citizens and to plan for sustainable  community growth.

Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
