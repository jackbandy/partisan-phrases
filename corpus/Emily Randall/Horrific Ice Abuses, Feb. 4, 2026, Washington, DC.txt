Horrific Ice Abuses

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, across the Nation, out-of-control ICE  agents are terrorizing our communities. They shot Renee Good in the  face four times. They are tearing people out of their homes, out of the  windows of their cars, and illegally detaining people who have Brown  skin.

This is fascism, pure and simple, and ICE must be held accountable.

Since I was elected to Congress, I have made six oversight visits to  the Northwest Detention Center in my district. Each time I have gone,  the lack of medical care and serious privacy concerns have consistently  been issues.

I was told by a detained individual that they were unable to receive  the medications that they needed until nearly a week after they had run  out. When they finally received it, it was the wrong dosage.

Another person who I met with asked the officer, who had accompanied  them to a health appointment in the community, to step out of the room  while he received sensitive medical information. The officer refused.

This administration's reckless dehumanization of our immigrant  neighbors is horrific, and it is not just immigrants who they are  terrorizing. Tribal members in my district and across the country are  being instructed to carry their Tribal IDs with them in case they are  stopped by ICE.

DHS is not above the law, and neither is Secretary Noem. We must hold  them accountable, and we must prevent more death and violence.

That is why I voted against funding lawless, out-of-control agents  who are terrorizing our communities and why I continue to call on us to  impeach Secretary Noem and to hold the Trump administration accountable  for the chaos and the violence that they have unleashed and to  restructure a Department that is no longer holding the trust of the  American people and that needs serious reform.
