Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Chair, I was going to say some nice things about  rising in support of a bipartisan NDAA that supports housing,  healthcare, and childcare, but I have sat here appalled at the language  that we have heard on the House floor from the other side of the aisle.

I stand in strong opposition to the person from North Carolina's  amendment. I have sat listening to her violent, dangerous, and  dehumanizing vendetta against parents, children, and trans people  trying to live their lives and trying to defend our country.

This is a pattern of the unhinged political war on trans people that  this person from North Carolina, the Republican Party, and the  President are waging.

Denying the ability of out trans folks to serve in our military isn't  enough for these people. The person from North Carolina is trying to  erase the existence of trans people from forms, from hallways, from our  military, and choosing violence.
