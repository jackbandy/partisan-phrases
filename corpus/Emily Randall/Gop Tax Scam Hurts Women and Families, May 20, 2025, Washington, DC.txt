Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, for months, Members of Congress and the  American people have been told by our Republican colleagues that we are  being alarmist about this budget proposal.

We aren't being alarmist. House Republicans' cuts to Medicaid, SNAP,  and other essential programs are alarming. These are real people who  are depending on us to make sure they still have healthcare and are  able to feed their families.

These are real people who come to my townhalls, who write to us, and  who call my office. They are real people like Aneliese, a single  mother, who called our office urging us through tears to protect SNAP,  saying: I will have no way to feed my child. I am extremely stressed  out, and if they cut food stamps, I don't know what I will do.

They are real people like Christy, whose daughter has autism and  epilepsy. She said: Losing Medicaid would be absolutely devastating to  my family. I won't be able to keep my daughter healthy or get her the  medications she needs.

They are real people like Veronica, whose grandmother's last few days  in long-term care were only possible because of Medicaid.

Taking healthcare and food away from people isn't bringing down  prices for families. It is telling people that your health and your  lives aren't worth as much as billionaires' bank accounts.
