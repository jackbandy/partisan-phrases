Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2175.

During his 31 years in the U.S. Marine Corps, Brigadier General  Frederick R. Lopez was deployed to South Vietnam during the Vietnam war  to  lead infantry and sniper units and later held leadership positions,  including Deputy Commanding General for the 1st Marine Expeditionary  Force.

He earned numerous honors, including the Navy Distinguished Service  Medal and Bronze Star with a Combat V, marking a distinguished military  career.

In addition to his military achievements, Brigadier General Lopez  worked in aerospace and defense, served on national security boards,  and remained actively engaged in veterans' advocacy activities.

Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Congressman Carbajal, for  advocating on behalf of his constituents and bringing this bill to the  floor. I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of  Brigadier General Lopez by naming a post office in Santa Barbara,  California, after him.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge the  passage of H.R. 2175. I yield back the balance of my time.
