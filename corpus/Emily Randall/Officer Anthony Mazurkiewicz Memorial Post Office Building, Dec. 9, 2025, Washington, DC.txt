Officer Anthony Mazurkiewicz Memorial Post Office Building


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697615/officer-anthony-mazurkiewicz-memorial-post-office-building


I rise today in support of H.R. 323. Officer Anthony Mazurkiewicz was  born in 1967 and was a 29-year veteran of the Rochester Police  Department. He received the Rochester Police Department Life Saving  Award, Officer of the Month Award, 17 Excellent Police Service Awards,  and 7 Unit Commendation Awards.

Officer Mazurkiewicz and his partner were shot while undercover  investigating a double homicide. His sacrifice while serving in the  line of duty deserves to be honored.

I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Officer  Mazurkiewicz by naming a post office in Avon, New York, after him.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge passage  of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
