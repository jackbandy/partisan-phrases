Epermit Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697678/epermit-act


Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the ePermit Act  sponsored by my colleague, Representative Dusty Johnson, and co-led by  Representative Scott Peters.

The ePermit Act will help enhance and deploy technology to improve  permitting processes all across the Federal Government. Perhaps more  importantly, the bill is an example of what can be accomplished with a  bipartisan approach to problem solving and good-faith negotiations.

The Fiscal Responsibility Act directed the Biden administration to  study the possibility of improving digital tools for permitting.  Representatives Johnson and Peters partnered to turn those Biden  administration recommendations into good legislation. The current  administration has helped finalize the bill with further input from  both Democrats and Republicans.

Again, I strongly support this bill, and I hope to do more of this  kind of important bipartisan work in the future.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
