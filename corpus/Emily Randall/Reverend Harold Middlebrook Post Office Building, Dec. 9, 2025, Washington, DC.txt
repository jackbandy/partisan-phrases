Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1372.

I offer that I think many members of the Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform were very interested to ensure that this bill made it  in the package today, so I am glad to see it here.

Reverend Harold Middlebrook was born in Memphis on July 4, 1942. He  was a civil rights activist, ordained minister, and leader in the  community. Through his active involvement with the civil rights  movement, he became friends and marched with Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr., on more than one occasion.

Reverend Middlebrook secured the appearance of Dr. King for multiple  strikes and also participated in multiple sit-ins in Atlanta while a  minister at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. King held a pastorate.

I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Reverend  Middlebrook by naming a post office in Knoxville, Tennessee, after him.

Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support from all of our colleagues for  H.R. 1372.
