Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1461.

Bettie Cole was a longstanding community leader in her home State of  Pennsylvania.

Born in Edgeworth on April 5, 1923, she studied journalism and  communications. Later in 2000, she became known as the historian of  Sewickley Valley's Black community. That year she published ``Their  Story: The History of Blacks/African Americans in Sewickley and  Edgeworth,'' documenting an often overlooked part of the local  community. Her book was published after 20 years of research, including  more than 100 interviews.

I commend my colleague, Congressman Deluzio, for advocating on behalf  of his constituents and bringing this bill to the floor. I encourage my  colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Bettie Cole by naming a  post office in Pennsylvania after her.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1461, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
