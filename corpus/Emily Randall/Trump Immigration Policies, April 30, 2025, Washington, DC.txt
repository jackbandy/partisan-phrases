Trump Immigration Policies

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  leading us in this Special Order hour today.

Mr. Speaker, fear, anger, terror, sadness, these are the emotions  that just scratch the surface of what my community and our immigrant  neighbors are feeling. Why should we expect anything less? This is  exactly what this administration wants: to force immigrants into the  shadows, to break their spirit, and to disrupt our communities.

When you come for immigrants, you come for small businesses. When you  come for immigrants, you come for our farmworkers and for our fish  processors. When you come for immigrants, you come for nurses, doctors,  and caregivers. When you come for immigrants, you come for the very  identity of what makes this country America.

Last week, I met with immigrants' rights advocates and toured the  Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. The detainee population has  doubled in the last few months. The average time detained has extended.  Discretionary releases are now uncommon, even for detainees without  violent criminal records. Folks are being detained and disappeared for  nothing more than political speech.

Mr. Speaker, what this visit reaffirmed for me is that any  immigration policy rooted in hate and fueled by chaos doesn't make our  immigration system more efficient or safe; it overwhelms the system. We  don't fix a broken system by breaking people.

Most of our origin stories, even as Members of the House in this  body, begin as immigration stories. It is past time that all of us  remember that.
