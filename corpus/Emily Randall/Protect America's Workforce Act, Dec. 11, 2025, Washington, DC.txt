Protect America's Workforce Act


Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Garcia and  Congressman Golden for the opportunity to speak on Protect America's  Workforce Act.

Mr. Speaker, I represent 27,000 Federal employees who have been  through  an incredibly challenging year marked by reckless DOGE firings, chaotic  rehirings, and unprecedented uncertainties.

They have been stripped of their ability to collectively bargain  through President Trump's March executive order. They have been  subjected to harassment and questioning of their political loyalties  for nonpartisan positions. They live in constant fear that they may  lose their jobs due to illegal reduction-in-force efforts that the  administration has been trying to get away with.

As a result, we are losing talented and highly skilled workers at  rates we can't afford. For Naval Base Kitsap, which includes Submarine  Base Bangor and the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate  Maintenance Facility, that is a national security issue.

I am a proud former union member and the daughter of union members,  and I will always fight to protect union rights. What is true about  Kitsap, where I grew up, is that we are not red or blue, but we are a  union town. That is why I was proud to cosponsor this bill and a proud  signer of the discharge petition.

Mr. Speaker, today, I will be a proud ``yes'' vote on passage.
