Cormorant Relief Act of 2025


Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to speak on H.R. 2293, the  Cormorant Relief Act of 2025.

Aquaculture facilities nationwide are facing issues with predatory  birds. We experience it in Washington State as well, along with the  pinnipeds that we spent some time discussing last week.

Double-crested cormorants consume large quantities of fish from these  operations, negatively impacting businesses that provide jobs and  support their local communities.

From 2003 to 2014, the Fish and Wildlife Service implemented the 2003  proposed rule adopting the Aquaculture Depredation Order and the Public  Resource Depredation Order, a Federal program that allowed aquaculture  operators, States, and Tribes to manage cormorant populations in a  controlled way with proper oversight. That program was found to be  unlawful by the courts.

This bill would lawfully reinstate the depredation order for  aquaculture facilities. Further, it would expand coverage to 12 States  and allow the Secretary to add others as appropriate. The bill would  also include aquaculture lake managers and pond managers who face  similar challenges.

I am pleased we were able to work out a bipartisan solution that  maintains environmental safeguards under bedrock environmental  protections like NEPA and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. This approach  will provide a reasonable regulatory framework with proper oversight  and require renewal every 5 years to ensure that it is working as  intended and that, moving forward, the Fish and Wildlife Service  conducts proper environmental assessments as it renews the program.

This bill will help U.S.-based aquaculture producers deliver healthy  and affordable protein for American families.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
