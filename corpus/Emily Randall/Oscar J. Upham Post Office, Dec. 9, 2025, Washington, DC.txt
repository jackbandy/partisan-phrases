Oscar J. Upham Post Office


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697637/oscar-j-upham-post-office


Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2283.

Oscar John Jefferson Upham served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps  from 1896 to 1901. He earned the Medal of Honor for his valiant actions  during the Boxer Rebellion in Peking, China. He was also known for  firing the opening shot from the USS Oregon at the Battle of Santiago  Bay in 1898 during the Spanish-American War.

After his military service, he continued his private life in Guthrie,  Oklahoma, where he worked as a letter carrier for an impressive 40  years before his passing in 1949.

Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for this legislation by  encouraging my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Oscar  Upham by naming a post office in Guthrie, Oklahoma, after him. I yield  back the balance of my time.
