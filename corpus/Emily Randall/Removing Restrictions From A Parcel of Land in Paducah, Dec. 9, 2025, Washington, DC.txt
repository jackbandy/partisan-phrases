Removing Restrictions From A Parcel of Land in Paducah, Kentucky

Mr. Speaker, in 2012, the National Park Service conveyed this 3.62- acre parcel of land in Kentucky to the city of Paducah through the  Federal Lands to Parks Program.

This program allows States, counties, and local governments to  acquire surplus land for public recreational purposes, an incredibly  impactful alternative to the Trump administration's public lands  selloff scheme.

Although the land was conveyed to the city, the National Park Service  still retains a deed restriction. Today, the parcel is utilized, as you  heard, by the Oscar Cross Boys & Girls Club, which provides programming  for youth in the community. The club is a central part of the community  but faces challenges in accepting new members and a growing wait list  due to the need for renovations and expansion of facilities.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1276 would remove the National Park Service's deed  restriction, allowing the city of Paducah to transfer the parcel to the  club so that they can move forward with the renovations and  improvements needed to increase capacity, expand programming, and  better serve youth in the community.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority for working with us in the markup  to add language that ensures that this property continues to serve a  public purpose by the Boys & Girls Club. This is an important assurance  and guarantee.

Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
