Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Hoyle) for her leadership.

I rise in strong support of H.R. 900, the Sinkhole Mapping Act, a  bipartisan piece of legislation which I introduced with my fellow  Floridian, Gus Bilirakis.

Mr. Speaker, sinkholes pose a significant problem for Florida and  many States, yet we don't have a comprehensive mapping system to help  first responders and community planners, as was mentioned by our  chairman, Chairman Westerman. I thank him for bringing this bill today.

Sinkholes cost over $300 million a year. We see that in Florida  homes, community centers, and businesses being affected by this. Having  a database that displays potential sinkholes in our Sunshine State and  across the Nation would absolutely be critical. That is what this bill  does.

This bill directs the U.S. Geological Survey to study the short- and  long-term mechanisms that trigger sinkholes. This includes extreme  storms, prolonged droughts, shifts in water management practices,  ongoing aquifer depletion, and other major water uses. It is all about  having a public website displaying maps depicting zones at greater risk  of sinkhole formation, helping save lives and helping us have more  resilient communities.

I thank Chairman Westerman, Ranking Members Huffman and Hoyle, as  well as Representatives Bilirakis, Frost, Castor, Wilson, Costa,  Harder, Fitzpatrick, and Bell for joining me.

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
