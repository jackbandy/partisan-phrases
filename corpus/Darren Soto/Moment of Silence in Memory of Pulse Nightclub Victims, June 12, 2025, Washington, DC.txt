Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, 9 years ago today, on June 12, 2016, at 2:02  a.m., our little happy town of Orlando, Florida, was changed forever as  we saw 49 angels killed and 53 others who were injured in a mass  shooting during Latin Night at the Pulse nightclub, a safe place for  the LGBTQ community located just south of downtown Orlando. At the  time, it was the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.

I was proud to work on both sides of the aisle in June 2019 to  introduce the National Pulse Memorial. In June 2020, it passed the  House but did not pass the Senate. Finally, in June 2021, it was  introduced, passed into law, and signed by President Biden.

We know that the National Pulse Memorial happened because this was a  national tragedy. At the time, we saw memorials and moments of silence  across the Nation, across districts, from sea to shining sea.

In remembrance of those who we lost and those who were injured and  their families, I ask my colleagues to please stand and join me for a  moment of silence.
