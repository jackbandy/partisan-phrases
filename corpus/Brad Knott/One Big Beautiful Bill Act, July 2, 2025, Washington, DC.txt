One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Mr. KNOTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill.

After listening to the previous few hours, it should surprise no one  that the party of open borders, the party of illegal aliens, and now  the party of State-run grocery stores hates this bill because this bill  secures America's borders. It protects America's farmers and America's  businesses. It protects us from tremendous amounts of waste, fraud, and  abuse, and it stops the largest tax hike in American history.

This bill is a win for the American people.
