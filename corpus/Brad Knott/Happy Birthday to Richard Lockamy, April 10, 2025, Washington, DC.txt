Mr. KNOTT. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to wish the happiest of  birthdays to my dear friend and brother in Christ Richard Lockamy.

I have known Richard for as long as I can remember. With age, I  admire, respect, and appreciate the man Richard is, and that admiration  is growing with every day.

Briefly, Richard grew up in Benson, North Carolina, the oldest of  four. He attended Shaw University, followed by North Carolina State  University, where he received a graduate degree in mathematics.

He married Lena Lockamy, with whom he shared 48 wonderful years of  marriage before Lena passed into her eternal heavenly home nearly 5  years ago.

Richard and Lena had one son, Marcus, who, in his own right, is now a  wonderful man.

Professionally, Richard has worked at some of the world's leading  companies, and for decades he has taught at the high school and  collegiate level.

Despite his many professional accomplishments, what truly sets  Richard apart in my life and in the lives of many others is his  faithful service to his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. With each day  and every encounter, Richard's witness is as apparent as it is  infectious. I saw this personally in the Raleigh men's class of Bible  Study Fellowship where for nearly 40 years Richard met with dozens of  men each week.

Mr. Speaker, I wish Richard a happy birthday.
