Epstein Files Transparency Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696815/epstein-files-transparency-act


Mr. KNOTT. Mr. Speaker, I have been very supportive of this effort,  specifically to bring justice to the victims of this horrific series of  crimes. However, I have worked behind the scenes to raise concerns with  this petition as it is currently drafted.

Specifically, I believe that there is a grave risk of harming  innocent people, and I repeat, harming innocent people. When innocent  people are harmed, that is not furthering justice.

With an investigation of this size and a file that is as large as the  Epstein files and as poorly defined as that is in this petition, there  will invariably be people who are released, pursuant to this discharge  petition, who had nothing to do with criminal activity. Imagine, if you  will, a bellman, a waiter, some type of doorman, a mere social attendee  who had no impact whatsoever on the criminal activities of Jeffrey  Epstein, no participation. Their lives are forever ruined.

I am reading specifically from the petition's language that  ``prohibited grounds for withholding'' information in this file are  ``embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.''

I would just submit that if you were going to be embarrassed, if you  were going to suffer social harm, and that is all the encompassed  activity that you were a part of, you will be named in this petition.

I resent that. Innocent people should not be harmed when we are  pursuing justice.

I understand the political nature of this petition. I resent the fact  that there was not room for good faith amendments, and I urge the  Senate to protect innocent people.
