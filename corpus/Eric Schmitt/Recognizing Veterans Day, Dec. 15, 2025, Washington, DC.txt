Recognizing Veterans Day


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698198/recognizing-veterans-day


Mr. SCHMITT. Mr. President, this November marks two very special  dates for our great country. Our Nation comes together every November  11th to celebrate Veterans Day, in recognition of the exemplary and  selfless work put forth by those who have served in our great  Republic's Armed Forces. Since our Nation's founding, our brave troops  have valiantly defended American freedom and values. Time and again,  our veterans' unwavering courage and dedication have shielded our  homeland from foreign aggression and helped secure the blessings of  liberty for our neighbors overseas.

November 10th also marks an important landmark in our Republic's  history. On this day in 1775, the Continental Congress formed what  would become the U.S. Marine Corps under the command of Major Samuel  Nicholas. Since its founding 250 years ago, the Marine Corps has stood  as a symbol of excellence and steadfast commitment to defending our  homeland. From the Revolutionary War to the present, our marines have  demonstrated outstanding courage wherever and whenever they are called  to serve.

I encourage my colleagues to join me as we honor those currently  serving in or retired from our uniformed services and commemorate those  who gave the last measure of devotion to protecting their fellow  Americans. These heroes' adaptability and bravery have safeguarded our  Nation for two and a half centuries, and we all owe them our most  sincere gratitude.
