Mr. SCHMITT. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4241 and ask  that it be reported by number.

Mr. SCHMITT. Mr. President, we are at an inflection point right now  in America's role in the world. As we reassess how we deploy our time,  money, and political capital abroad, Congress has an obligation to  ensure that taxpayer-funded organizations operate within the mission  and guardrails Congress has established.

The National Endowment for Democracy was created to support  democratic norms overseas, not to engage in domestic political advocacy  or to amplify one side of America's internal debates. That distinction  is essential to its legitimacy.

Yet there is ample evidence that NED has drifted from its statutory  mission. Senior leadership and staff have used official positions to  engage in domestic political advocacy, and NED funded a foreign  organization that created ideological blacklists of conservative  American media outlets.

These concerns go directly to whether NED is fulfilling the role  Congress intended. That is why the President's budget included no  funding for NED this year.

I requested the State Department inspector general investigate NED's  leadership conduct and the use of taxpayer dollars. Until that  investigation is complete--

Mr. SCHMITT. I would argue that if we are true to advocating the  democratic norms, accountability must come first in our own democracy.

I urge adoption of the amendment.
