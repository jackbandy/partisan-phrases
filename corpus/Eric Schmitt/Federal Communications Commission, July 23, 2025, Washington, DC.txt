Mr. SCHMITT. Mr. President, as spectrum auctions move forward, it is  critical that the FCC maintains the integrity of its prior decisions  related to spectrum use and auctions. Reallocating or modifying  licenses that were legally purchased through auctions, such as by  relocating licensees or changing the operating rules applicable to  those licenses, would undermine the certainty businesses rely on to  make  long-term investments in wireless innovation. Companies, investors, and  consumers need confidence that once they have secured spectrum rights  through a lawful process, those licenses and spectrum access frameworks  will be honored. To do otherwise puts future participation and  investment at risk.
