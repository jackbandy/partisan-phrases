Horrific Ice Abuses

Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Congressman  Espaillat, for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, people across the country and in the Inland Empire are  scared that they could join the roughly 50 individuals who have died  under Donald Trump's and Kristi Noem's brutal immigration crackdown,  such as Renee Good, Silverio Villegas Gonzalez, Alex Pretti, and many  more.

Just north of my district sits the Adelanto ICE processing facility,  which has seen multiple people die while in custody. The conditions at  Adelanto have long been deplorable, which is why I have long called for  it to be shut down.

Yet, we must look for ways to press our case even more forcefully.  Just yesterday, I voted against more blank-check funding for ICE and  CBP. No accountability and no reform equals no taxpayer money.

I call on every Member of this body to hear the cries of communities  from coast to coast: Impeach Kristi Noem, end open-ended DHS funding,  and stop the killing of our neighbors.
