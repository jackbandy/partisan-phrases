Californians Should Continue to Peacefully Protest

Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, in just 1 week, this administration has  conducted raids into my community to meet arbitrary deportation quotas.  They have unnecessarily sent National Guard and marines, which have  only inflamed peaceful protest, and they have thrown down to the ground  a U.S. Senator, my U.S. Senator, and handcuffed him for trying to ask  questions to DHS Secretary Noem.

This is happening because the administration does not like that they  have different opinions from the State of California.

My constituents deserve more from their President, and our democracy  deserves more from the President. I stand with all Californians who  want to keep pushing, keep using our voice, and keep peacefully  protesting the actions of this lawless President.
