Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025

Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, as the ranking member of the House Committee  on Veterans' Affairs, I rise today in complete opposition to the  Republican rip-off budget resolution.

Let's be clear: This is a tax break for billionaires like Elon Musk  paid for by working people, including millions of our veterans. The  Republican rip-off cuts at least $880 billion from Medicaid, the  program that 80 million Americans, including 9 million veterans, rely  on for health insurance coverage.

This extreme budget also cuts $230 billion from SNAP. Every year,  SNAP helps almost 43 million Americans, including over 1 million  veterans, put food on the table.

Republicans aren't just going to leave American veterans without  healthcare or make them go hungry. They also want to take a chain saw  to VA, attacking the very people who provide care to the veterans who  have served our country with honor.

This is completely unacceptable, and I urge every Member to oppose  this abomination of a resolution that uses veterans as a piggy bank to  pay for a billionaire tax break.
