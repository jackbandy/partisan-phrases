Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I join the global community in celebrating  the remarkable achievements of His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew, which now include the 2025 Templeton Prize.

Patriarch Bartholomew has long been a voice of spiritual clarity and  moral courage. His leadership in advancing interfaith dialogue, human  rights, and especially environmental stewardship, has earned him the  nickname ``The Green Patriarch.'' The Templeton Prize recognizes his  decades of work urging the world to see care for creation not just as  policy, but as a sacred duty.

In Riverside, we are blessed with a vibrant Orthodox Christian  community. Parishes such as Saint Andrew Orthodox Church remind us of  the enduring presence of Eastern Orthodox faith in Southern California.  These communities embody the values Patriarch Bartholomew champions-- reverence, beauty, responsibility, and peace.

His visit to our Nation's capital is not just a symbolic moment; it  is an opportunity for our country to honor a global religious leader  who is known for his phrase: ``War in the name of religion is war  against religion.''

On behalf of Riverside, I extend congratulations to His All-Holiness.  May his work continue to inspire, and may our communities reflect his  vision of faith in action.
