Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that we are considering H.R. 1107, the  Protecting Veteran Access to Telemedicine Services Act of 2025, as  amended. It will enable VA providers to prescribe substances to  veterans through telemedicine without first conducting an in-person  exam. This bill will make permanent a flexibility that has been  extended to VA and non-VA prescribers alike since the COVID-19  pandemic.

The current waiver, which has been extended by the Drug Enforcement  Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services, is set  to expire in December of 2025. This legislation will make permanent VA  prescribers' authority to prescribe controlled substances via  telehealth, if and when DEA and HHS end the temporary authority.

Telemedicine has helped VA to greatly increase veterans' access to a  variety of types of care, providing a critical lifeline for veterans,  especially those who may have difficulty leaving the house or who live  in extremely rural areas.

We can clearly recognize that after the pandemic, we must be open to  changing the way we provide care to everyone, especially veterans, to  reflect technological advancements, individual preferences, and the  necessity of expanding access to care. In fact, telehealth is the  industry standard for many providers and categories of care, including  many in the VA's community care network. Veterans should expect nothing  less when they receive care from the VA.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1107, which is the  Protecting Veteran Access to Telemedicine Services Act of 2025, as  amended.

Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on H.R. 1107, Protecting Veteran Access to Telemedicine  Services Act of 2025, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
