Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act

Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill.

My Republican colleagues have tried and failed to repeal or weaken  the Affordable Care Act more than 70 times over the past 15 years.

The bill before us does nothing to address the expiring tax credits,  and contrary to what my colleague Mr. Kiley has said, the bill that  would extend the tax credits is bipartisan. It would pass this House.

In the richest country in the world, the country that is the global  leader in medical innovation, Americans will die from treatable  conditions.

Republicans claim that their bill will give consumers more choices.  No choice, this is not about choice. People will have the choice to be  refused health insurance for preexisting conditions by unregulated junk  health insurance plans and be denied reproductive healthcare.

Instead of making the ACA tax credits permanent, Republicans have  once again proposed a piecemeal, nonsolution that makes health  insurance more expensive and strips Americans of their basic healthcare  rights.

Mr. Speaker, vote against this bill. Bring the bipartisan solution to  the floor.
