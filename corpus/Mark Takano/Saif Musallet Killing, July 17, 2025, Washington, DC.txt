Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my shock and outrage over  the killing of Saif Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian American from  Florida who was visiting his family in the West Bank.

He was beaten on his own family's land by settlers. We have grown too  used to this kind of violence. We have grown weary of news reports  detailing the onslaught of deaths, but we should never accept the  killing of innocence, let alone the killing of an innocent American  citizen.

In an unusual and forceful statement, Ambassador Huckabee called the  killing a ``criminal and terrorist act'' and urged Israeli authorities  to conduct a full investigation and bring those responsible to justice.

I echo the call of the ambassador for an investigation and ask my  colleagues to do the same. The United States Congress cannot allow  silence to reign and complicity to creep in. Instead, we must demand  justice.
