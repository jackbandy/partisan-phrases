Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 3481, the  Delivering Digitally to Our Veterans Act of 2025, as amended.

Veterans should not have to fight to get information about their  earned GI Bill benefits, and this legislation looks to ease access to  information from the VA to veterans by allowing the Department of  Veterans Affairs to do outreach using digital messaging, such as text  messages, direct messages, and virtual chat, in addition to direct  mail.

VA is already doing much of this, but H.R. 3481, as amended, looks to  codify these efforts into law to ensure they are available to veterans  in the future.

H.R. 3481, as amended, also includes the text of H.R. 3386, the  Streamlining the Solid Start Communications Act. Then-Congresswoman  Elissa Slotkin and Senator Hassan permanently authorized the Solid  Start program, which has been a critical outreach to newly separated  veterans. Solid Start allows VA to stay connected with veterans as they  navigate their transition to civilian life.

H.R. 3481, as amended, expands VA Solid Start outreach efforts to  include the same texts and digital options included in the underlying  text.

Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 3481, the Delivering Digitally to Our Veterans Act, as  amended.

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
