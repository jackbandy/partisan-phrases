Recognizing Richard Kirk McPike

Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise with a profound sense of pride and a  touch of sadness. After 13 years of service to this body as a chief of  staff, Richard Kirk McPike is leaving my office.

Kirk has been the leader of my team since 2012, setting up the  office, building LGBTQI+ political infrastructure, helping me earn the  Veterans' Affairs' Committee gavel and so much more.

Kirk's proudest accomplishments are not counted in the bills passed  or titles held. They are measured in the many people he has led and  mentored, from interns to senior staffers. One of his greatest talents  is knowing when to let go of great staff, understanding they sometimes  need to grow beyond my office. Today, it is my time to do the same.

I will miss my friend Kirk. I will miss his counsel, but I know he  will serve the Commonwealth of Virginia as a delegate with the same  intelligence and decency he brought to this House. I wish him Godspeed  and good luck.
