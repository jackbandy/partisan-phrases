Montgomery Gi Bill Selected Reserves Tuition Fairness Act of 2025


Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 983, the  Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserves Tuition Fairness Act of 2025.

This bill mandates the Department of Veterans Affairs to deny courses  that do not charge in-State tuition rates to veterans using certain  educational assistance under title 10. The VA already has the authority  to disapprove courses at higher education institutions that do not  offer in-State tuition rates for other GI Bill beneficiaries.

Mandating in-State tuition rates is good policy. It ensures that only  schools who prioritize quality education at a fair price participate in  the programs. It preserves the GI Bill benefits for student veterans,  and it makes the entire GI Bill program more solvent and sustainable so  that the GI Bill stays available for veterans for generations into the  future.

Mr. Speaker, it is also crucial to ensure that selected reservists  receive the same benefits as their Active-Duty counterparts by ensuring  that in-State tuition is granted regardless of their residency.

This bill will expand educational opportunities by providing them  with more affordable education options. Their dedication to serving our  country deserves nothing less.

We passed this bill last Congress, but, unfortunately, the Senate did  not consider it in time. I hope we finish this work in this Congress,  and I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. Speaker, while the House debates various veterans-related  legislation today, none are more urgent than the legislation I am  introducing to stop thousands of veterans from losing their homes.

Last Thursday, Secretary Doug Collins and President Trump announced  the abrupt termination of the Veterans Affairs Servicing Purchase  program, known as VASP.

This program was designed to prevent foreclosures for veterans with  VA home loans who had exhausted every other option. With no notice, no  replacement, and no plan, the Trump administration decided that these  veterans are on their own.

The decision came down just hours after the new Trump tariffs sent  our economy reeling, plunging the stock market, increasing job  insecurity, and deepening financial strain on working families,  including veterans.

It is hard to imagine a starker representation of their values. At  the very moment veterans are needing stability, the administration  chose to take it away. They did it while Republicans in Congress are  pushing massive tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.

The Republicans are pushing for massive tax cuts for billionaires  while forcing veterans into foreclosures. Veterans who served this  Nation are now calling our offices, panicked and unsure if they will  lose their homes. They don't know what is next, and the truth is  neither does VA.

Secretary Collins has provided no answers and no alternatives to  VASP. Ending this critical support without a clear plan is not just  reckless, but it is cruel. That is why I am introducing the Foreclosure  Assistance Immediately Reinstated, or FAIR Act, to reinstate the VASP  program and make it clear that VA's job is to help veterans stay in  their homes, not push them into homelessness.

The VA Home Loan Program has been a pillar of the American middle  class since the original GI Bill. It helped returning World War II  veterans achieve economic security through homeownership. Yet, today's  veterans, facing high costs, low wages, and an unstable economy, need  that same promise fulfilled.

Let me be very clear. This is not a handout. These are earned  benefits. Veterans stepped up to defend our country, our Nation, and  they deserve more than empty slogans and broken promises in return.

VA had the tools, and has the responsibility, to intervene when  veterans faced foreclosure. VASP was working. It had already helped  over 15,000 veterans keep their homes with tens of thousands more  eligible.

Ending it based on the false narrative that veterans would game the  system is an insult to their service and sacrifices. This decision  abandons our values. It punishes the very people who kept their promise  to America.

Mr. Speaker, it is our turn to keep our promise to them. I urge my  colleagues to support the FAIR Act and send a clear message: We don't  let veterans fall through the cracks. Not on our watch.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 983, the Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserves Tuition  Fairness Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
