Veterans Readiness and Employment Program Integrity Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 3579, as amended,  the Veterans Readiness and Employment Program Integrity Act.

The VA Veteran Readiness and Employment program, otherwise known as  VR&E, is also known as Chapter 31. It is a comprehensive benefits  program designed to help veterans with service-connected disabilities  find and maintain suitable employment. It offers personalized  assistance, including career counseling, vocational training, and  educational support to help veterans overcome employment barriers.

The program's ultimate goal is to empower disabled veterans to  achieve independence and a successful career in the civilian workforce.

I take great pride in my work on the Honoring our PACT Act that  resulted in hundreds of thousands of veterans finally having their  disability recognized, making them eligible for the VR&E program.  However, that massive influx of new applicants has brought to light  improvements that are needed for the VR&E program.

This legislation seeks to add some good-governance steps to the  program, to make sure veterans are aware of how the benefit works upon  sign up and ensures that veterans are actively seeking employment as  they are prepared to exit the VR&E program.

This legislation also includes data reporting for Congress and  veterans so wait times and wage data are public.

Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the balance of my time to close.

Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R.  3579, as amended, the Veterans Readiness and Employment Program  Integrity Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
