Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 970, the Fairness  for Servicemembers and their Families Act of 2025.

Mr. Speaker, just a few short years ago we increased the maximum  coverage amount under the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI)  program and the Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI) program from  $400,000 to $500,000. Prior to that, however, those maximum coverage  amounts had not been increased since 2005, clearly failing to keep pace  with inflation.

To ensure that we are not waiting another decade or more to improve  this benefit for our servicemembers and veterans, my good friend  Representative Marilyn Strickland has introduced this bill which  requires the VA to periodically review coverage amounts every 5 years  and report to Congress what the level of benefits would be if adjusted  for inflation over that period. This will allow Congress to regularly  make a more informed decision about whether or not these maximum  coverage amounts should be increased.

Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense legislation that allows Congress to  better do our job to support servicemembers, veterans, and their  families. This legislation passed the House last Congress, and I  encourage my colleagues to support it once again.

Mr. Speaker, I now yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the State  of Washington (Ms. Strickland), my good friend and author of this bill.  She currently serves on the House Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure and the House Committee on Armed Services.

Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I yield myself  the balance of my time for the purpose of closing.

Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 970,  the Fairness for Servicemembers and Their Families Act, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
