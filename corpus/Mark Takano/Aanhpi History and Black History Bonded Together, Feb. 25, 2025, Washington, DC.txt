Aanhpi History and Black History Bonded Together


Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, Black history has shaped our country, and I  am proud to celebrate Black History Month with my Congressional Asian  Pacific American Caucus colleagues.

The coalition of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islanders,  and Black Americans has worked hand-in-hand for generations to advance  racial equality. That coalition was on full display during Martin  Luther King, Jr.'s historic march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 when  he wore a lei gifted to him by Reverend Abraham Akaka of Hawaii.

It existed even on the battlefield. Senator Daniel Inouye was a proud  and decorated member of the legendary 442nd Infantry Regiment. He  recalled how he sustained injuries in combat, which resulted in the  loss of his arm, and that it was soldiers from the 92nd Division, a  segregated African-American unit, who provided him with the blood for  the 17 transfusions that kept him alive.

AANHPI history and Black history are inextricably tied together and,  in the case of Senator Inouye, a blood bond uniting our two communities  together.
