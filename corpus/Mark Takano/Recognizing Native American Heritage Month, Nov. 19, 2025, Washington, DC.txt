Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to recognize Native  American Heritage Month.

Native American Heritage Month is an opportunity to not only honor  the rich cultures and history of Indigenous peoples across North  America, but to recognize the continued leadership of Native Americans  in each of our communities. From the public sector to the business  community, to my colleagues on the House floor, Native American leaders  are today helping shape the future.

I represent Riverside which stands on the traditional and ancestral  lands of the Cahuilla Nation; Gabrielino-Tongva People, Payomkawichum/ the Luiseno Indians; and Yuhaaviatam, clan of Maara'yam/the Serrano.

Riverside is also home to the Sherman Indian High School. I thank all  of the educators and staff who work tirelessly to build an environment  that provides a quality education to hundreds of students and helps  preserve the rich culture of Native peoples from across North America.  I thank them for their work of creating the next generation of Native  American leaders.
