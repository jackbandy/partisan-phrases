Deliver for Veterans Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 877, the Deliver  for Veterans Act. This bill would make it easier for disabled veterans  to obtain the adaptive automobiles they are entitled to through their  service-connected disability. If signed into law, this bill could save  veterans tens of thousands of dollars on shipping costs of vehicles.

Two Congresses ago, we passed the Veterans Auto and Education  Improvement Act, a bill authored by Ranking Member   Mike Levin and  Representative Lizzie Fletcher, which expanded the adaptive auto  benefit for veterans, allowing them to get a new vehicle if 10 years  have passed since last using the benefit.

This bill from Representative Moylan builds upon that work by  simplifying the process for veterans who require their adaptive vehicle  to be shipped. This includes veterans who live in areas such as Guam,  Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

Again, I support the substance of this bill, but I think we should  have a very serious conversation about the majority's choice to  perpetuate cutting veterans' pensions. I believe that we should include  this item in any negotiations with the Senate before this bill becomes  law.

Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 877,  the Deliver for Veterans Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
