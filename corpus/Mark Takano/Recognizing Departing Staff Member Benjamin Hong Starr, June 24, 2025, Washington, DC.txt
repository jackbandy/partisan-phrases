Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the incredible  contributions of one of the most dedicated staffers in Congress,  Benjamin Hong Starr.

Ben first came to my office as a Victory Institute fellow, before  joining my staff officially as a staff assistant. Ben not only excelled  in, but innovated upon, this position--implementing strategies and  policies that continue to this day. From making constituents feel at  home to battling the rats in the House Office Building basement, Ben  proved there was no challenge he could not face.

Ben's unique abilities, professionalism, and dedication are apparent  to all who across paths him. Throughout the nearly four years Ben was  in my office he continued to exceed expectations in every role he was  assigned. As a part of my legislative staff, he continuously found new  ways to address the needs of California's 39th district. From  spearheading efforts to improve air quality to advancing consumer  protections, Ben consistently demonstrated the same zealous ingenuity  that made even the most complex issues seem solvable.

As Ben moves into his new role with the Congressional Progressive  Caucus, I could not be prouder of the impact he has already made on  behalf of the Inland Empire. I, and every person whose life Ben has  touched, will be watching as he continues helping to create a better  world.

I congratulate Ben and thank him for his service.
