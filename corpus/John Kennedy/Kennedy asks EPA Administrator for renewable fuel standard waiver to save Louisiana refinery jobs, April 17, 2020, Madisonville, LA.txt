Kennedy asks EPA Administrator for renewable fuel standard waiver to save Louisiana refinery jobs


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today wrote a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler to request a waiver of the renewable volume obligation (RVO) under the renewable fuel standard (RFS) program in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

"Federal and state governments are working together to save lives and livelihoods in Louisiana and many other states, as America's oil industry is struggling mightily. I'm proud to join my state officials in asking the EPA to quickly approve this waiver and protect Louisiana refinery jobs," said Kennedy.

Governor John Bel Edwards recently requested that the EPA approve a waiver to lower the total RVO in order to combat the impact of the coronavirus on the oil and gas industry.

Low demand for gasoline and jet fuel has forced refineries operating along the gulf coast to decrease production between 20 and 33.3 percent. As oil prices decline, refineries across the country are fighting to maintain facilities and pay employees.
