Neurofibromatosis Awareness Day


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Children's Tumor Foundation is  observing May 17, 2020, as neurofibromatosis--NF--Awareness Day to  educate the public about this rare genetic disorder that impacts more  than 2 million people around the world. It is estimated that 1 in every  3,000 births is diagnosed with NF; yet it is still is relatively  unknown to the public. 

  NF affects all populations equally, regardless of race, ethnicity, or  gender. The disorder causes tumors to grow on nerves throughout the  body and can also affect development of the brain, cardiovascular  system, bones, and skin. Further, the disorder can lead to blindness,  deafness, bone abnormalities, disfigurement, learning disabilities,  disabling pain, and cancer. 

  The Children's Tumor Foundation leads efforts to promote and  financially sponsor world-class medical research aimed at finding  effective treatments and, ultimately, a cure for NF. They do this by  actively fostering collaborative partnerships in both science and  industry to speed the drug research and development process through a  number of consortia. 

  In kind, the Children's Tumor Foundation is working around the clock  to improve access to quality patient healthcare through its national NF  clinic network. It provides patient and family support through its  information resources, youth programs, and local chapter activities. 

  Much remains to be done in raising public awareness of NF to help  promote early diagnosis, proper management and treatment, prevention of  complications, and support for research. 

  NF affects children all across the world; and in recognition of this  important initiative and the tireless research taking place, I support  recognizing May 17, 2020 as Neurofibromatosis Awareness Day.
