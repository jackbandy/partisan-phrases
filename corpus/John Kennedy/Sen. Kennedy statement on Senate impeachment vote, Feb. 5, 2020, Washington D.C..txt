Sen. Kennedy statement on Senate impeachment vote


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) released the following statement after the Senate rejected both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

"The vote today was nothing more than a proxy vote on President Trump. It was a partisan impeachment in both houses. Our founders did not intend impeachment to be used this way. I believe Speaker Pelosi's attempt to normalize impeachment and to turn it into a routine political weapon was a mistake. In fact, it was reckless. A country as great as ours deserves better, and so do her people."
