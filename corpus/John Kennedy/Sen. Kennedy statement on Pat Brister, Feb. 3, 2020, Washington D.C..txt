Sen. Kennedy statement on Pat Brister, former St. Tammany Parish president


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) released the following statement about former St. Tammany Parish President Pat Brister:

"Pat was a close friend to Becky and me for many years and a tireless advocate for the people of St. Tammany Parish and Louisiana. Pat's service was always defined by her humility and ability to inspire those around her. St. Tammany Parish saw incredible economic growth under her leadership. I'm only one of many, many people who feel the loss of Pat as a person and a leader. Becky and I are praying for comfort for the entire Brister family during this sad time."
