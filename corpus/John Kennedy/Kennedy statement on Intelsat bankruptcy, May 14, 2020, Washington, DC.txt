Kennedy statement on Intelsat bankruptcy


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) released the following statement in response to reports that Intelsat has filed for bankruptcy, which would put its pending agreement with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on hold.

"Intelsat's decision to file for bankruptcy reveals what many suspected all along: Intelsat had no intention of accepting the FCC's deal. The FCC should withdraw its offer, take control of America's spectrum and save taxpayers billions of dollars instead of shelling out that money to foreign companies," said Kennedy.
