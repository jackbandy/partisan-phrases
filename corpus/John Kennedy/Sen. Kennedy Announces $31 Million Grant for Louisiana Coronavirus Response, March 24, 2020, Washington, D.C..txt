Sen. Kennedy Announces $31 Million Grant for Louisiana Coronavirus Response


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced a $31 million FEMA grant to the Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness in response to the coronavirus.

"The federal and state governments are committed to doing whatever it takes to protect local communities from the coronavirus--and to doing it quickly. This $31 million grant could increase medical services and supplies for Louisiana communities in order to slow the spread of this disease and care for those affected by the virus," said Kennedy.

President Trump declared a national emergency on March 13 to protect public health and safety in response to the coronavirus. The grant comes under the authority of the Stafford Act. It could be used to support emergency protective measures, including emergency medical care, medical sheltering, general health communications and the distribution of supplies.
