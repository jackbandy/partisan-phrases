Sen. Kennedy Praises Secretary Perdue, USDA for Helping Food Get to New Orleans Food Banks


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) praised the United States Department of Agriculture and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue for cutting through bureaucratic tape in order to make 4 million pounds of food available to food banks in New Orleans.

"Louisiana residents have Secretary Perdue and his team to thank for filling up our food banks, especially in areas hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic. As we tackle the economic challenges that come with the coronavirus, we have to work on multiple fronts to make sure Louisiana families have food on their tables. I'm grateful to have Sonny Perdue as an ally in this battle," said Kennedy.

Kennedy spoke with Perdue by phone on Friday to request the food banks be granted flexibility to deliver food to people whose health or livelihoods have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The food for these programs comes with certain restrictions concerning who is eligible to access it. Perdue granted Kennedy's request to allow food banks to better meet the local demand, which continues to increase in Louisiana.
