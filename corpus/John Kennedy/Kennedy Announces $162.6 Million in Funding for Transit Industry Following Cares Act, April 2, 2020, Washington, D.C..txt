Kennedy Announces $162.6 Million in Funding for Transit Industry Following Cares Act


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $162.6 million in funding from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to support Louisiana's transit industry in response to the coronavirus.

"Our public transportation system has to adapt to the coronavirus. This funding will help reduce the burden on Louisiana's public transit providers and support the long-term economic health of Louisiana communities," said Kennedy.

A provision from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act requires the FTA to allocate funds to operate and maintain Louisiana's public transportation systems. The funding will cover operating expenses incurred on or after January 20, 2020 and will be available to urban, rural and tribal area providers.
