Sen. Kennedy Announces $2.5 Million Grant for Debris Removal


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced a $2.49 million FEMA grant to remove flood debris in West Feliciana Parish.

"Last year's floods created debris in West Feliciana Parish, and this grant will help clean up streets and revitalize communities there," said Kennedy.

In September 2019, President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration in the state of Louisiana as a result of severe flooding.
