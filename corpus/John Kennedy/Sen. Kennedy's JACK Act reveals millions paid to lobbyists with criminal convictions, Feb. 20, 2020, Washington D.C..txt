Sen. Kennedy's JACK Act reveals millions paid to lobbyists with criminal convictions


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today announced that individuals with criminal histories have, over the past year, disclosed making at least $3.1 million lobbying in our nation's capital. President Trump signed Kennedy's Justice Against Corruption on K Street (JACK) Act into law in January 2019. The JACK Act requires lobbyists to disclose any convictions they have related to corruption.

"Everyone has a right to petition the government, but the American people deserve to know whether a lobbyist has a history of corruption. The JACK Act is shedding light on swamp creatures who broke our laws," said Kennedy.

The bipartisan legislation amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which establishes requirements for lobbyists to disclose how much money they make representing issues to lawmakers as well as who pays them.

The JACK Act has made it possible for any American to find information about how much money is flowing to lobbyists convicted of crimes like bribery, extortion, embezzlement, illegal kickbacks, tax evasion and money laundering.
