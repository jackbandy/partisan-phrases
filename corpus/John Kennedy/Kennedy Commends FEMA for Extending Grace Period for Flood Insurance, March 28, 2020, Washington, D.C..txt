Kennedy Commends FEMA for Extending Grace Period for Flood Insurance


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today commended FEMA for responding to economic challenges caused by the coronavirus by extending the grace period for flood insurance renewals from 30 to 120 days.

"Louisiana property owners are struggling under the coronavirus pandemic and need relief. This extension will give policyholders more time to renew their flood insurance and allow them to prioritize their families during this difficult time," said Kennedy.

According to FEMA, policyholders who may be struggling financially because of the coronavirus pandemic will be given additional time to pay insurance premiums and avoid policy cancellations for nonpayment.

To avoid a lapse in coverage on policies with expiration dates between February 13, 2020 and June 15, 2020, policyholders must pay the appropriate renewal premiums within 120 days of the expiration date. For underpayment notices received between February 13, 2020 and June 15, 2020, policyholders must pay the additional premium amount requested within 120 days of receiving the notice.

FEMA advises policyholders who need to prolong their 120-day extension to contact their insurance agents or insurers for alternative payment options those insurers may offer.
