Sen. Kennedy Asks Interior Secretary Bernhardt for Royalty Relief to Save Louisiana Oil and Gas Jobs


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) has spoken with Department of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to request that he temporarily suspend royalty payments from oil and gas producers to the federal government.

"Oil and gas jobs remain a vital part of Louisiana's economy, and factors outside workers' control are jeopardizing those jobs. The simplest, smartest lifeline we can extend to the oil producers is pressing pause on the royalties the federal government charges them. Families and independent producers have worked long and hard to support America's energy independence. They deserve a little flexibility in return," said Kennedy.

Low barrel prices are putting enormous strain on the state's oil industry, and Kennedy reached out to the Interior Secretary in an effort to preserve countless Louisiana jobs. Many oil producers operating in the Gulf of Mexico would benefit from a suspension of royalty payments, including small and medium-sized companies.

Kennedy also spoke recently with Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the U.S., urging her to end the disagreement with Russia that has helped send oil prices plummeting.
