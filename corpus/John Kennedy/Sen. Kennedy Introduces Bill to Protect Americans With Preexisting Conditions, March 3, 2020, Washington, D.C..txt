Sen. Kennedy Introduces Bill to Protect Americans With Preexisting Conditions


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today introduced the Continuing Coverage for Preexisting Conditions Act of 2020 to keep in place legal protections for people with preexisting medical conditions.

"Americans with preexisting health conditions should have confidence that they're going to keep the coverage they've been paying for. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have long agreed that our health system should protect men, women and kids with preexisting conditions, and my simple bill would do that regardless of what the Supreme Court may decide here," said Kennedy.

The Supreme Court has decided to hear arguments about the constitutionality of Obamacare. The Continuing Coverage for Preexisting Conditions Act would ensure that coverage for preexisting conditions continues even if the court rules that Obamacare's individual mandate is unconstitutional.
