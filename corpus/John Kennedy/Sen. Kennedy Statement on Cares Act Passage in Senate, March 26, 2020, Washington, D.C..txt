Sen. Kennedy Statement on Cares Act Passage in Senate


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) released the following statement after the Senate passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, along with additional emergency funding.

"The coronavirus has hit Louisiana hard and nearly ground the gears of our economy to a halt. People's lives and their livelihoods depend on a swift, comprehensive response to this pandemic. The size and scope of spending in this bill is significant, but inaction in the face of this unprecedented challenge would be reckless.

"The CARES Act is the best path open to preserving and reviving our economy as we battle the coronavirus in Louisiana communities and around the country. Of course, this bill is far from perfect, but it gives families, workers and employers the resources they need to be resilient.

"This virus poses a unique health risk, and we know that poverty can also threaten lives. Understanding that, I voted today to protect the wellbeing of Louisianans now and into the future by investing in medical services, families, workers and businesses," said Kennedy.

The CARES Act includes significant provisions to protect the health and wellbeing of Louisianians. These include resources for medical care, small businesses, workers and key industries.
