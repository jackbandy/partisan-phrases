Sens. Kennedy, Cassidy introduce bill to stop dangerous mail-order abortions


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) joined Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) in introducing legislation to protect the sanctity of human life by prohibiting chemical abortions from being performed without the supervision of a health care provider.

Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Kevin Cramer (S-N.D.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) are also original cosponsors of the Teleabortion Prevention Act.

"Chemical abortions already put women at astonishing risk, and mail-order abortions put up even more barriers between women and critical medical care. If we really want to protect vulnerable women and children, we have to stop the dangerous trend of mail-order abortions," said Kennedy.

"Louisiana requires a physician performing an abortion to have admitting rights at a local hospital. This is for the safety of the mother. Teleabortion clearly does not comply," said Cassidy.

The Teleabortion Prevention Act would make it a federal offense for health care providers to perform chemical abortions without first physically examining patients, being present during every procedure and scheduling follow-up visits for patients.
