Sen. Kennedy attends Congressional Gold Medal ceremony honoring Steve Gleason, former New Orleans Saint


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today attended the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony for former New Orleans Saints star Steve Gleason. 

 

"I am so honored to see Steve Gleason receive the Congressional Gold Medal for his tireless work advocating for ALS patients. He holds a special place in the heart of every Louisianians, not only for his on-field heroics, but for his work raising support and assistance for those battling ALS. Steve is an inspiration to millions of Americans, and I can't think of anyone who deserves this honor more." said Kennedy.

 

After being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2011, Gleason became a prominent advocate for people living with ALS and helped raise almost $10 million to provide assistance for ALS patients. In addition, Gleason helped gather support for the Steve Gleason Act of 2015 and the Steve Gleason Enduring Voices Act of 2017, which are now helping equip ALS patients with speech-generating devices.

 

The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian honor bestowed by Congress. It requires the approval of two-thirds of both the House and Senate and the signature of the President. To date, only 163 institutions, people, or events have been awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.

 

Alongside Sens. Cassidy, Cantwell, and Murray, Sen. Kennedy was an original cosponsor of the Stephen Michael Gleason Congressional Gold Medal Act last Congress. The bill was officially signed into law by President Trump on January 3, 2019.
