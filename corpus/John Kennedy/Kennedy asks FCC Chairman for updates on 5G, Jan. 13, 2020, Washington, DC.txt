Kennedy asks FCC Chairman for updates on 5G


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) has sent a letter to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai requesting that the chairman update him on any progress made on FCC auction plans and compensation proposals for satellite companies operating within the C-Band.

 

"As the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) works to clear C-Band Spectrum through a public auction, I write to request that you keep me apprised of any and all developments in respect to the FCC's auction plans and subsequent auction schedule. Additionally, I also ask that I be given notice of any proposal the FCC considers in regards to compensation for the satellite companies currently operating within the C-Band," said Kennedy.

 

At present, foreign satellite companies are operating within the C-Band, a part of the spectrum that the FCC is attempting to set aside for future 5G wireless use. Spectrum refers to electromagnetic waves that wireless devices use to deliver voice, text, video and other wireless communications. C-Band represents a portion of the spectrum that cable operators and broadcasters use for satellite reception of network programming. C-Band, however, is necessary for building a robust 5G network.

 

The FCC recently considered allowing foreign satellite companies to sell the spectrum within the C-Band. Those private sales could have deprived the American taxpayers of information and revenue from such sales.
