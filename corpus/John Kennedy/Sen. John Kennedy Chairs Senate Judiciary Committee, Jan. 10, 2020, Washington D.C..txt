Sen. John Kennedy Chairs Senate Judiciary Committee


U.S. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) chaired this year's first meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee to hear from nominees for the federal bench. The nominees included U.S. Attorney David Joseph, who is nominated to be an Alexandria-based judge for the U.S. District Court for the Western District in Louisiana.

"Mr. Joseph has done a wonderful job as U.S. Attorney. He's worked for big and small law firms. He's clerked for a member of the Louisiana Supreme Court. He's served our country and served it well," said Sen. Kennedy. "During his tenure as U.S. attorney, Mr. Joseph has proven himself to be serious and mature. He's demonstrated that he can strike abalance between applying the rule of the law and realizing that people are human. I have every confidence that he'll do the same if confirmed as a federal judge."
