Sen. Kennedy Asks President Trump to Declare Major Disaster in Louisiana


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) wrote today to President Donald Trump to request a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of Louisiana in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

"It is no secret that Louisiana needs your help during this disaster. . . . I am requesting that you approve this request as expeditiously as possible in order to make additional resources available to supplement the state's resources," wrote Kennedy.

Gov. John Bel Edwards (D-La.) yesterday made a formal request for a federal emergency declaration for Louisiana in response to the coronavirus global pandemic. The request cites the need for federal funding for emergency work under the Stafford Act.
