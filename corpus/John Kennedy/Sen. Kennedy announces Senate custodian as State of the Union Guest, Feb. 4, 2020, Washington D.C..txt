Sen. Kennedy announces Senate custodian as State of the Union Guest


Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) announced that Felicia Proctor will accompany him to President Donald Trump's third State of the Union address. Proctor is a Washington native and part of the AbilityOne Program, an independent federal initiative that helps people with disabilities attain meaningful employment.

"It's my honor to attend the State of the Union with Felicia, who pours her time and talents into helping the Senate run day in and day out. Her dedication to her work is inspiring, and I'm glad to get to share this historic moment with someone whose kindness and professionalism make the Capitol a brighter place," said Kennedy.

Proctor has four years of experience working for Goodwill of Greater Washington and supporting senators and their staff as a custodian. The AbilityOne Program employs more than 40,000 individuals--including approximately 3,000 veterans--who are blind or otherwise disabled.

This year marks the third time Kennedy has invited a Senate custodian as his guest for the president's State of the Union address.
