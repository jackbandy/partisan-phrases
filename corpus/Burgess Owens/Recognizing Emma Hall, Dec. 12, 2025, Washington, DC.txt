Recognizing Emma Hall


Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend, Ms. Emma  Hall, my deputy chief of staff and the first and only communications  director since the beginning of my journey here to D.C.

Emma has served in my office and the constituents of Utah's Fourth  Congressional District for nearly 5 years.  During this time, I have come to rely on her sharp instincts, her keen  attention to detail, and her unwavering commitment to keeping my  constituents back home informed of the day-to-day effort here in  Washington.

It is often said in Congress that if we do not communicate what we  are doing, then folks back home will assume that we are doing nothing.  With relentless consistency, every bill, letter, hearing, and townhall  meeting has been communicated with my constituents with  professionalism, clarity, and, if I may say, refinement. Ms. Hall is  meticulously organized, with tasks completed weeks ahead of schedule.  Nothing is left to the last minute.

She is the heart and soul of our team. No birthday is forgotten  without a card, cake, and celebration.

Over these last 5 years, her leadership and thoughtfulness have  helped in the effort to make our team feel like a family. For that,  Emma will always remain a member of Team Owens.

Mr. Speaker, our entire team will miss Emma. We wish her the very  best in her new endeavor.
