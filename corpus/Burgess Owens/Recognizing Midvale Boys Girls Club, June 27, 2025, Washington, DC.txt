Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, it was a pleasure to visit the Midvale Boys &  Girls Club recently to speak with the youth about success, grit, and  the power of their dreams.

This summer, over 200 young people, supported by 17 dedicated staff  members, will be granted an environment where they can have fun. In the  process, they will build character, learn leadership skills, and  develop healthy relationships.

Many of the youth will take part in activities like the run club,  where the benefits of competition can be experienced. They are also  learning the importance of goal setting, the pain of preparation, and  the tenacity to push through the pain.

They are in the process of learning one of life's more important  lessons, which is that we cannot control the scoreboard, but we can  control the hustle. These tenets are the heart of meritocracy and what  I observed during my visit to the Midvale Girls & Boys Club.

I thank the staff for their commitment. I hope the young people enjoy  the experience, remember what they are learning, apply what they have  learned, and, more importantly, pass it on.
