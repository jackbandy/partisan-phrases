Recognizing Utah Global Pizza Champions


Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary  team of hardworking Utahns who brought home a world  title--Team Utah from Papa John's, winners of the 2025 Global Pizza  Games.

Out of more than 6,000 locations worldwide, this locally owned and  operated franchise in West Jordan achieved something that's never been  done before in our state. Competing against teams from Peru, the UK,  South Korea, the UAE, and across the United States, they earned first  place with unmatched precision, speed, and teamwork, setting a record  time of 8 minutes and 33 seconds while producing four near-perfect  pizzas, each scoring an impressive 9.9 out of 10.

Behind this victory are three standout individuals: Nicole Brock, a  25-year veteran and general manager in American Fork; Benny Loughton,  her assistant manager; and Phillip Newson, their coach and motivator.  Their dedication, discipline, and belief in excellence showcase the  best of Utah's work ethic and spirit.

Mr. Speaker, their victory is a testament to what's possible when  local businesses invest in people, when teams lead with pride, and when  hard work meets opportunity.

Congratulations to Team Utah, our Global Pizza Champions. They have  made us proud.
