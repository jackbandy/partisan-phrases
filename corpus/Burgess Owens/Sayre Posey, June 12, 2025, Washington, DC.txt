Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Utah's State Teacher  of the Year, Sayre Posey, an outstanding educator who embodies the  mission of the Merit Caucus: excellence, innovation, and high  expectations.

She comes from a long line of teachers. Her great-grandfather taught  in a one-room schoolhouse in West Virginia, and her mom is a retired  kindergarten teacher.

Now, teaching eighth grade U.S. history at Northwest Middle School in  Salt Lake City, Ms. Posey brings history to life through project-based  learning. Her students have earned honors at regional and State  national history day competitions.

She is proof that when we empower great educators and focus on merit,  then our students thrive.

Mr. Speaker, I thank her for her leadership and proudly recognize her  service today.
