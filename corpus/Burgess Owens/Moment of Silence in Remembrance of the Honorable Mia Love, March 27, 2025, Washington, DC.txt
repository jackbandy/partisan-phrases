Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, today we remember and honor a trailblazer, a  leader, and a dear friend, Mia Love.

Mia made history as Utah's first Black mayor and the first Black  Republican woman elected to Congress, but her impact went far further  than those titles. She was a fierce advocate, a tireless servant, and a  bright light in the lives of so many.

Mia brought passion, energy, and an unwavering commitment to the  people of Utah's Fourth District, a district that I am now proud to  serve. She led with grace and conviction, never backing down from a  challenge, and always striving to make a difference for those she  served. It is for me a profound honor to follow in her footsteps.

Her legacy is one of faith, courage, and love, and the highlight of  her life was her husband, Jason, and her family. These descriptions are  all fitting for a woman whose name said it all.

While we grieve her loss, we also celebrate a life well lived, a  mission well served, and a friend deeply missed. Our Utah communities  mourn for the Love family. We pray that they find peace in the Heavenly  Father's love and comfort and solace in what Mia has meant to all of  us.

Now, please rise for a moment of silence.
