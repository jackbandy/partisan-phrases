Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, as with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, I stand before my colleagues with a heavy heart to honor the  life and legacy of my dear friend and esteemed colleague, Doug LaMalfa.

Doug's sudden passing this week leaves a void not only in this  Chamber but in the hearts of all who knew him. To a person, a testament  from everyone who has crossed his path would be this: What a really  good man.

As a Member of the Western Caucus, I witnessed firsthand Doug's  fierce advocacy for farmers, ranchers, and hardworking families who  form the backbone of our Nation. It was inspiring.

On the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I saw the same  tenacious commitment to his beloved State of California as he  championed water rights and fought for the conservative values at the  very core of our American culture.

Doug was a steadfast warrior for the country and State he loved. He  will be sorely missed. His faith, grit, and authenticity have inspired  us all. Rest assured, we will continue to carry on the torch that Doug  championed so well.

We know where Doug is at this moment. Our prayers are with him, with  Jill, and with his family. Rest in peace. May God bless him.
