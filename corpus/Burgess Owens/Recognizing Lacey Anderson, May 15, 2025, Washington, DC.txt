Recognizing Lacey Anderson


Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the House Merit Caucus, I am  proud to recognize a Utah educator who embodies excellence, Ms. Lacey  Anderson.

Lacey is a special education teacher who refused to accept low  expectations for neurodivergent students. Instead, she founded Autism  Solutions Academy in West Jordan, Utah, becoming a board-certified  behavior analyst and building a school that meets the needs of kids  where they are.

Her student-first approach provides real options for parents of  special needs children. By customizing lesson plans and blending  teaching, she makes sure that every student, regardless of ability, has  the path to succeed.

During a recent visit, I met Sofia, a student who once was nonverbal  and withdrawn. Today, she is reading, writing, and thriving because of  a teacher who believed in her.

That is what real leadership looks like. That is merit in action.  When we raise the bar, our kids rise to meet it. Every child in America  deserves the same chance.
