Delivering on Educational Freedom

Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, the one big, beautiful bill is the most  transformative legislation in a generation.

It delivers tax-free Trump accounts for newborns, tax cuts for  working families, and no tax on tips and overtime. For millions of  parents, the most powerful piece of this is that it delivers nationwide  school choice.

States like Utah have led the way. We have shown that when parents  are in charge and students are first, kids thrive. This bill brings  real education freedom to every ZIP Code in America.

I grew up in the segregated South. My parents, both educators, saw  education as a legacy. I want that same legacy and opportunity for my  17 grandkids and millions of schoolkids across the country.

This bill empowers parents with scholarships for tutoring, private  and parochial schools, and special needs, keeping the Federal  Government out of the way.

Mr. Speaker, school choice funds students, not systems. Let's pass  the one big, beautiful bill and deliver on the promise of educational  freedom for every child and every family.
