Recognizing Bluffdale Elementary School

Mr. OWENS. One of the Merit Caucus' core missions is to spotlight  exceptional educators, and Utah is blessed with so many. My team  recently visited Bluffdale Elementary, a dual language immersion school  where students start learning Portuguese in the first grade and stick  to it throughout high school.

Two inspiring classrooms were taught by Ms. Jessica Bell-Aver's first  grade class and Edson Habelo's sixth grade class. Both teachers spoke  exclusively in Portuguese, and the students rose to meet the challenge.  First graders eagerly answered questions about the calendar and weather  in Portuguese. Sixth graders tackled science concepts like ecosystems  in fluent Portuguese.

This is what happens when we set a high bar. Bluffdale's students are  thriving because dedicated teachers believe in their potential and push  them to reach them. That is merit in action.
