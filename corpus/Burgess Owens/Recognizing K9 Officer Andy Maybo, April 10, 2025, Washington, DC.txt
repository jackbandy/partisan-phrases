Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor K9 Officer Andy Maybo  of the U.S. Capitol Police, whose tireless work has ensured that our  fallen heroes are never forgotten.

For years, Officer Maybo has been at the heart of organizing the  National Peace Officers' Memorial Service, coordinating with Congress,  the U.S. Capitol Police, the Secret Service, and the U.S. Park Police.

His dedication has been particularly impactful for Utah's fallen  officers, ensuring that their families were properly honored at this  important event. In addition to his role in the memorial, Andy served  as president of DC FOP Lodge 1 and contributed to several other lodge  committees.

As Andy steps down from his role on the National FOP Memorial  Committee this May, we owe him our deepest gratitude for his leadership  and service. His unwavering commitment has made a lasting impact on the  families of fallen officers across the nation.

I thank Officer Maybo for his years of service and dedication. May  God bless him, and may God bless the United States of America
