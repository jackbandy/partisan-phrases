Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Utah Pipe Band  and the Barclay School of Highland Dance--two groups that embody the  spirit of tradition, excellence, and service.

For over a century, the Utah Pipe Band has honored our heroes,  playing at Memorial Day events across our great state, competing in  Highland Games, and standing as a living tribute to history. Last year,  they marched on the sands of Utah Beach for the 80th anniversary of D- Day. Before that, they played in Honolulu for the 80th anniversary of  Pearl Harbor. Their music isn't just performance, it's a bridge to the  past, a reminder of sacrifice, and a call to honor.

Their motto, Act well thy part, is more than words--it's a way of  life. And it speaks to what makes Utah special: faith, family, service,  and a deep respect for the past.

I thank them not just for their music, but for what they represent.  Our state, our country, and our history are better because of them.
