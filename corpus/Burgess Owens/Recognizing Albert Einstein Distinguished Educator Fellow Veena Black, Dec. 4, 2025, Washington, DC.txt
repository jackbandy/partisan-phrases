Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Veena Black,  an Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellow, a dedicated  elementary schoolteacher for over 20 years, and a personal friend who  has served our office with exceptional commitment this past year.

Veena was selected amongst a highly competitive group of peers to  come to Washington to better understand the legislative process and to  improve STEM education in the United States.

For 1 year, she has not only stepped away from the classroom and her  beloved students, but, as a devoted wife and exceptional mother, she  also left behind her husband, Gabe, and their two children: Aidan and  Sydney.

Veena's passion for STEM education and her students was unmistakable  and contagious. Her kindness and the time she gave to everyone who  stepped into our office enriched our team. She was the dependable,  welcoming smile that greeted us each day.

Her time in our office was impactful and memorable, and it  permanently deepened my understanding of what it means to teach in  America today. I came to rely on her invaluable insight as an award- winning educator. Her hard-earned classroom experience directly shaped  our education policy work, giving us a clearer understanding of how  Federal decisions truly affect teachers and students.

While we dearly miss Mrs. Black in our Cannon office, I am grateful  that she returned to the place where her impact is greatest and most  needed which is in the classroom.
