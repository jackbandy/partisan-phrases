Recognizing Gateway Parks and Barn Elite Training

Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, in Utah, we believe in opportunity, hard  work, and raising kids with the character to stand tall--not just in  the classroom, but in life. That means giving them more than screens  and participation trophies. It means real challenges, real discipline,  and real opportunities to grow.

That's why I want to recognize two Utah businesses--Gateway Parks in  Spanish Fork and Barn Elite Training in Mapleton--that are stepping up  where too many institutions have failed.

Gateway Parks is making winter sports accessible to kids who might  never get the chance, teaching them confidence, grit, and the value of  falling down and getting back up. Barn Elite Training is giving young  athletes a place to push their limits, to build mental and physical  toughness in an era when both are in short supply.

Too many kids today are struggling--with stress, with isolation, and  with a culture that pushes them toward passivity instead of purpose.  Meanwhile, Washington drags its feet. But these businesses aren't  waiting for permission--they're taking action. And as we refocus on  Making America Healthy Again, this is exactly the kind of leadership we  should be lifting up.

I'm proud to recognize Gateway Parks and Barn Elite Training for  investing in our youth--because a strong America starts with strong  kids.
