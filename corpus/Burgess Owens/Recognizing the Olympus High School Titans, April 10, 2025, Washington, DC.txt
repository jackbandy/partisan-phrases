Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Olympus High  School Titans on winning the 5A Boys Basketball State Championship.

With a commanding 69 to 40 win over Highland High, the Titans capped  off a season defined by discipline, grit, and teamwork. This  championship reflects the hours of practice, the leadership of their  coaches, and the drive of a team that refused to let up.

I also want to give a special shout-out to three players from the  Millcreek area--Luke Owen, Jack Evan, and Malakai Philip--whose efforts  on the court made a lasting impact.

Their hard work, and the hard work of the entire team, has brought  pride to their school and to our entire community.

Congratulations again to the Titans on an outstanding season and a  well-earned title.
