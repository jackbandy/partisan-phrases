Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1069, the  PROTECT Our Kids Act. For far too long, American education has been  undermined from within by actors who have taken advantage of our free  and open society to advance the nefarious and anti-freedom objectives  of the Chinese Communist Party.

Under the veneer of cultural and educational exchange, the CCP and  operatives have restricted free speech, monitored Chinese students and  faculty, and served as intelligence-gathering conduits on emerging  American technologies.

These soft power tactics are part of a broader strategy to cultivate  networks of communist influence, within the very institutions  responsible for shaping the next generation of American patriots.

These subversive efforts are not limited to our universities. The CCP  has even reached into elementary classrooms, cultivating favorable  attitudes toward the Chinese Communist Party among young American  students.

With passage of the PROTECT Our Kids Act, schools that refuse to  confront this reality will no longer be eligible for Federal funds,  full stop. The message is straightforward and simple to education  administrators who don't understand the concept of American patriotism.  This behavior will not be tolerated and no longer subsidized by the  American taxpayers.

Under this Republican majority and this Trump administration,  American education will be protected and renewed. Our classrooms will  return to their rightful purpose: teaching and preserving our great  American values.
