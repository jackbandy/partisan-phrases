Recognizing Mark Otten


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694043/recognizing-mark-otten


Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize an extraordinary  Utah educator, Mr. Mark Otten, a teacher at Gunnison Valley High School  in South Sanpete School District.

Mark has been teaching for 40 years at the same high school he once  attended. He teaches 11th grade math and  college algebra with one goal in mind: to help his students surpass  him, and they do.

One of his students just ranked number one in Utah and number two in  the Nation in the Trig-Star exam, beating Mr. Otten's own timed score.

Some of Mark's former students are now his doctor, dentist, and even  his mechanic. That is the kind of legacy every teacher hopes for.

Mr. Otten says he is not ready to retire, and I hope he doesn't  because Utah needs more educators like him: humble, committed, with  passion for and belief in the next generation.
