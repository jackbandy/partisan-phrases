Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me  time.

Today, I rise just flabbergasted and outraged by the latest attempts  to undermine protections that keep our air clean, safe, and healthy. Do  we really disagree about that?

Today's bill would allow an unnecessary, dangerous increase in some  of the worst toxic chemicals back into the air that we and our children  breathe, even when these facilities have abided by these standards for  decades and proven that they have the technologies to do so. Let me  repeat that: They have the technologies. They have the equipment  already.

As a pediatrician, I know how damaging these toxins can be. Mercury  and lead can lead to severe developmental delays, birth defects, and  brain damage for children. Dioxins are known human carcinogens. The  list goes on.

As a Member of Congress who strives always to find pragmatic,  bipartisan solutions for us and for our children, I simply fail to  understand when my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  choosing to relax these standards for clean air, all while stripping  healthcare away from more than 13 million Americans.

I mean, they are jeopardizing our health and taking away our  healthcare. I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose this bill. It is a  corporate giveaway that hurts our constituents once again.
