Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, oil over democracy. Trump has made clear  his priorities, accepting ruthless suppression by Maduro's comrades so  long as the oil profits flow to him as the self-described acting  President of Venezuela.

With one major oil company describing the country as uninvestable,  Trump has absolutely no winning strategy to secure any benefits for the  American people.

He doesn't just want to be king of America. He wants to be king of  the universe. He wants to be a Putin or a Xi, disrupting the global  order that bipartisan American leaders made possible to prevent another  world war.

Imperialism, starting wars around the world wherever Trump's latest  whim takes him, will not Make America Great Again. It will make us much  less safe.

To found this country, Americans got rid of one despotic king. We  don't need another one. Instead, we must demand an accountable  President by adopting this important resolution and asserting the power  of Congress.
