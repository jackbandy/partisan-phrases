Rescissions Act of 2025

Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, where lies are king, the truth is the  enemy. Institutions that spread knowledge are defamed as ``enemies of  the people.'' NPR and PBS are targeted here today precisely because  they are so good at delivering the truth. Like millions, I tune into  both of them daily.

Trump tweets: `` . . . RADICAL LEFT' `MONSTERS THAT SO BADLY HURT OUR  COUNTRY!'' What hurts Trump are facts when he demands flattery.

This attempt to quash thorough, objective NPR and PBS reporting is a  sign of Trump's weakness, of his drive toward tyranny. Trump doesn't  want a country of engaged, informed Americans. He prefers those who  salute on command, like for his North Korean-style, taxpayer-funded,  wasteful $45 million birthday bash this Saturday.

Reject these dangerous DOGE cuts and defend the right of the American  people to know.
