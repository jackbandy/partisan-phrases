Breaking the Gridlock Act

Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, our vote today represents hope, the hope of  millions to access their family physician, the hope for so many  Americans who have wondered how they will be able to afford healthcare,  hope that by using an extraordinary measure today in the House, we can  address an extraordinary need.

After 70 Republican repeal efforts, after rejecting the amendment I  offered last May to retain these credits, and after delaying for months  to give us the opportunity to provide this care, we are here today with  hope.

Now, the responsibility shifts to the Senate. They need to promptly  approve this measure and not attach any weakening provisions such as  junk insurance and health savings account tax shelters. Keep it focused  on affordability, on providing enrollment periods for those who have  already lost their coverage because of enormous premium hikes.

We have heard so much about fraud. The only fraud that has been  identified relates to broker fraud that Trump has made worse and  Republicans have ignored. The biggest fraud of all would be replacing  ObamaCare with Republican nothing care.
