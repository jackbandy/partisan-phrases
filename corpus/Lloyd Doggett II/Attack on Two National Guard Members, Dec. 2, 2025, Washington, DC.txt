Attack on Two National Guard Members

Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, we all mourn the loss from the tragic  attack on two National Guard members here in Washington last week. Yet,  once again, the master of distraction seeks to avoid any accountability  for his role in this tragedy. Only 7 months earlier, the Trump  administration granted asylum to the assassin.

Big unanswered questions for the President: What specific vetting was  done with regard to the 3 years that this assassin lived here in  America? Was his post-traumatic stress from his prior violent work  considered? Was the caseworker who reported his possible radicalization  interviewed and reviewed? Was his inability to even get a job a factor?  Did this review include biometric information, checking social media  platforms, and other steps?

Instead of blaming all immigrants and blaming Biden, how about just  looking in the mirror and figuring out what went wrong here in this  regime and how to fix it in order to avoid another tragedy? Americans  deserve accountability and answers.
