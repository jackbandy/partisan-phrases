Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025

Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, Speaker Johnson calls our soaring national  debt the ``number one threat'' to our Nation. The Republican Senate  leader says that it is a ``ticking time bomb'' just before he lights  the fuse with this sorry resolution that hikes the debt by $6 trillion.

The independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget urges us  to reject this ``unprecedented level of fiscal recklessness.''

Republicans are borrowing trillions more so Elon and his billionaire  buddies can get more.

Already a wrecking ball to our democracy, Trump, the self-described  ``king of debt,'' is king today with his schemes to spike the debt as  the Musk DOGE charade wrecks public services and Trump's ``beautiful''  tariff wrecks our economy and heads us straight toward a recession.

With soaring debt, plummeting markets, and a measles outbreak, I have  to give the Republicans credit for turning America red, but not the way  we expected.
