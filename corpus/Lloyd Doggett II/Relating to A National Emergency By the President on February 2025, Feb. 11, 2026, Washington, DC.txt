Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, President Trump's repeated bullying of  Canada and its eloquent Prime Minister Carney is both embarrassing and  alarming. Our country could not have a better neighbor or trading  partner than Canada.

Declaring emergencies where none exist, Trump delights in these  executive decrees for tariffs. He can act like a king, and he is  enabled to be a king-like figure on this issue by Republicans, even  though it is costing American families thousands of dollars.

There have been 76,000 American manufacturing jobs lost amidst Trump  chaos. Small businesses are losing out if they don't have a lobbyist  who can go to Mar-a-Lago and bargain with Trump.

This vote is about reaffirming ``no king,'' no rule by decree from  the President when he has no authority to do this, and recognizing that  our Constitution places responsibility for trade and tariff taxes where  it should be, right here in this Congress.
