H.R. 4


Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when the Senate considers the Rescissions  Act of 2025, H.R. 4, it is my intention to make the following motion to  recommit to the bill:

(1) A motion to recommit the bill H.R. 4 to the Committee       on Appropriations of the Senate with instructions to report       the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day       on which the Senate is not in session, with changes that--

(1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and

(2) remove any rescissions that may undermine the public       broadcasting infrastructure that supports the access of       communities to emergency alert systems.

Mr. President, Senator Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland supports the  motion to recommit bill H.R. 4 to the Senate Committee on  Appropriations to eliminate rescissions that would undermine the public  broadcasting infrastructure that supports the access of communities to  emergency alert systems. Senator Alsobrooks knows the role of public  radio and television in ensuring communities have access to information  and emergency alerts.
