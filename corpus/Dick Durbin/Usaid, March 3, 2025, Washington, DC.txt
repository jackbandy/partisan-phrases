Usaid

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to thank my colleague from  Hawaii. If he can spare 30 seconds, I would like to tell him a story.

Years ago, I went to India to the dusty villages--not the big  cities--just to see what USAID was doing. I heard about it. I wanted to  see it. The most graphic example I can remember from that experience  was when they showed me a bag of some grain supplement, and on it was  written ``USAID from the people of the United States of America.'' What  they were doing with this was making a lunch for the children in the  village. I don't think your kids or mine would have touched it. It  looked like some odd rice crispy ball that was held together with  water. They sat with little tin plates with this rice crispy ball on it  from the USAID package to eat their lunch. But before they ate their  lunch, they paused. I said, ``What is going on?'' The guide said to me:  They are saying a prayer of thanks to this United States of America for  giving them food to eat.

I thought to myself, for goodness' sake, it is 1 percent of our  Federal budget--1 percent--that we spend in this manner to try to give  kids around the world a chance to survive. There are many other things  we do, but that basic example with those kids sitting in the dust of  that village eating that rice crispy ball and thanking the United  States of America for it touched my heart and still does to this day.  Thanks for what you said. I appreciate it so much.
