Congressman C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger joined the rest of the full Maryland congressional delegation, including U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, John P. Sarbanes, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone, today in announcing $1.2 million in federal funding through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help community health centers (CHCs) throughout Maryland respond to the growing health demands posed by the COVID-19 outbreak.

 

"Every single day, community health centers work on the frontlines to deliver quality health care to our most vulnerable communities," the lawmakers said.
