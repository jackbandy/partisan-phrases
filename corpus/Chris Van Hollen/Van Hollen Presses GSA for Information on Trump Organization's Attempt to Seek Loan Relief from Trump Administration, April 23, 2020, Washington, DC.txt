Van Hollen Presses GSA for Information on Trump Organization's Attempt to Seek Loan Relief from Trump Administration


Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) sent a letter to Administrator Emily Murphy of the General Services Administration (GSA) pressing for more information on the Trump Organization's efforts to obtain relief from the Trump Administration on required lease payments for the Trump International Hotel. In addition to Administrator Murray, the Senator also copied GSA Inspector General Carol Ochoa on his request. GSA currently leases the Old Post Office Building in Washington, D.C. to the Trump Organization's Trump International Hotel.

"Clearly, this request necessitates a high level of scrutiny. While Eric Trump, the president's son, has publicly asserted that he wants GSA to treat the Trump Organization the same as any other company, the potential for undue influence and special treatment is obvious," Senator Van Hollen writes in his letter.

He continues, "Indeed, there are still unresolved questions about the constitutionality of the current lease arrangement, which are detailed in the GSA Inspector General's report, "Evaluation of GSA's Management and Administration of the Old Post Office Building Lease.'"

The Senator goes on to ask GSA for the following information, which taxpayers have a right to know:

GSA's policies and procedures for evaluating requests to modify an existing lease to reduce monthly lease payments or to suspend lease payments;The number of requests received from GSA tenants since March 15th to alter their lease payments; and the number of such requests from tenants in Washington, D.C. The number of requests for lease payment modifications since March 15th that have been approved by GSA and the number that have been denied since that date, and the same information with respect to GSA tenants in Washington, D.C. The status of the Trump Organization's request for lease payment modifications.
