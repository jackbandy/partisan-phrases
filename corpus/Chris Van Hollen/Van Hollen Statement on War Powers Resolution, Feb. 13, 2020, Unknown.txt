Van Hollen Statement on War Powers Resolution


Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) released the following statement regarding his vote of support for the War Powers Resolution (S. J. Res 68) to prevent the President from starting a war with Iran without Congressional authorization."A few weeks ago, we almost stumbled into war with Iran. The Constitution gives Congress -- and Congress only -- the power to declare war. Today, a bipartisan majority of Senators sent a clear and important reminder to President Trump of this uncontestable fact. The Commander in Chief's power to protect the nation is not a blank check to go to war. Trump's campaign of "maximum pressure' on Iran has resulted only in total failure. The success of this resolution should persuade the Administration to work with the Congress to develop a real strategy to reduce tensions and enhance our national security."
