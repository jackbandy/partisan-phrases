Van Hollen to Attend Munich Security Conference


Today U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) announced that he will be attending the Munich Security Conference from February 14th -- 16th as part of a bipartisan Congressional delegation. Senator Van Hollen is a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs and also serves on the Senate NATO Observer Group and as Co-Chair of the Senate Foreign Service Caucus. During the Conference, the Senator will speak at a session titled "Partner, Competitor, or Rival? Transatlantic Relations and the China Conundrum" hosted by the American Council on Germany and the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies.

"From day one, President Trump has abandoned global norms and undermined U.S. leadership and credibility abroad. Given this fact, the U.S. Congress must bolster our alliances while holding our adversaries to account. That's why I've introduced multiple bipartisan bills to take action where this Administration will not. These include the Otto Warmbier BRINK Act, to apply secondary sanctions on companies that do business with North Korea, enacted into law last December; the DETER Act, to prevent Russian interference in our elections; legislation to extend New START and deescalate nuclear tensions; and bills I've introduced to hold China accountable such as the True Reciprocity Act and the Defending America's 5G Future Act. I look forward to discussing these efforts in Munich," said Senator Van Hollen.
