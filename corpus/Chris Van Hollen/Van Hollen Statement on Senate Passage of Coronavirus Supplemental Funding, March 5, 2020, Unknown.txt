Van Hollen Statement on Senate Passage of Coronavirus Supplemental Funding


Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) released the following statement regarding the Senate's passage of a bipartisan supplemental funding package to address the coronavirus:

"I was proud to support this funding package to ensure Maryland and our country have the resources necessary to immediately and more effectively respond to the coronavirus. I'm pleased that Congress was able to come together on a bipartisan basis to provide this significant investment to immediately boost our efforts to address the virus.

"This comprehensive package provides our state and local governments with direct financial support to address this public health emergency. We must continue to work together at all levels of government to coordinate our response. The bill also contains critical resources for the research, development, and approval of a potential vaccine, treatments, and diagnostics -- work that is being done at Maryland's NIH and FDA facilities. Additionally, the legislation provides funding to support preparedness at our hospitals and health centers, to bolster their capacity to handle coronavirus on the frontlines. Lastly, the bill includes critical support for small businesses that have been impacted by financial losses stemming from the outbreak. Just last week I heard from Maryland business owners with concerns about this issue and worked to include this provision. As we continue to combat the coronavirus, I will keep fighting to ensure that Congress provides the tools necessary for an effective response."

Tomorrow, Senator Van Hollen will visit the NIH to visit labs working on a potential coronavirus vaccine and will receive an update from researchers on their progress.
