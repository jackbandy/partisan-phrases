Van Hollen Announces Unanimous Senate Passage of Bipartisan Legislation to Improve Child Care Protection


Today, the Senate unanimously passed the Child Care Protection Improvement Act, authored by Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and Richard Burr (R-NC). This bipartisan legislation would create a task force to assist states in the process of implementing federal work requirements for child care workers.

"As we work to make sure childcare is affordable, we must also ensure that it's safe and that parents have peace of mind about who is watching their children," said Senator Van Hollen. "Right now, too many states have been slow to implement the criminal background check requirements that are already in place under the law, including interstate checks. Our Child Care Protection Act would change that, and today the full Senate has voted to move this bipartisan legislation forward. Now it's time for the House to act. Working together, we will help states make the improvements necessary to ensure a high-quality childcare workforce and a safe environment for every child."

"Keeping our children safe from harm must always be a top priority," said Senator Burr. "This commonsense legislation enhances child safety by helping states meet the employment requirements Congress envisioned six years ago. I'm proud to see the Senate unanimously pass this important legislation to give working parents peace of mind and better safeguard our children."
