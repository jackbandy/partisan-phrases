Maryland Congressional Delegation Announces Nearly $2.4 Million in Federal Support for Renters and Homeowners Affected by COVID-19 Pandemic


Congressman Steny H. Hoyer (MD-05) and the full Maryland Congressional Delegation, including U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Congressmen Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone, today announced $2,377,692 in federal funding for Maryland renters and homeowners struggling with the economic impact of COVID-19.

Funding comes from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) FY20 Comprehensive Housing Counseling Grants. It will support counseling services to help Marylanders improve their housing conditions and to resolve any issues with meeting rent or mortgage obligations.

"Maryland families continue to grapple with the economic fallout of this pandemic -- especially the fear and stress that come with trying to meet rent or mortgage obligations," the lawmakers said. "Our constituents are looking for a lifeline and, as a delegation, we want to ensure that the federal government delivers helpful resources during this challenging time."

They continued: "Alongside robust support for new housing vouchers, expanded affordable housing capacity and time-sensitive financial support, Marylanders will now have the opportunity to connect with housing counselors to help them meet the challenges of this public health emergency."
