Van Hollen Joins Peters, Colleagues in Introducing Bill with Colleagues to Provide Unemployment Assistance to Those Affected by Coronavirus


U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) has joined Senate Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Gary Peters (D-MI) and 22 colleagues in introducing the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Act to provide federally-funded unemployment assistance to individuals affected by the coronavirus outbreak.

"The coronavirus has already taken a serious toll on American jobs and our economy. We must immediately ensure help for those who have been impacted, so they can make rent, feed their families, and more," said Senator Van Hollen. "This legislation will help lessen the economic harm of the pandemic on everyday working families, and we need to pass it now." 

"Michiganders forced to stay at home from work due to Coronavirus shouldn't need to worry about being able to pay their bills or putting food on the table," said Senator Peters. "We need to do everything possible to support workers and families during this challenging time. I'm pleased to help lead this effort to help ensure Michigan families can stay afloat financially during the coronavirus outbreak." 

The bill would create a temporary unemployment compensation program to provide benefits to individuals unable to work because of coronavirus. Modeled on the Disaster Unemployment Assistance program, this new program would be tailored to help those affected by the pandemic. While Congress has provided temporary unemployment benefits in response to disasters, it has not previously provided benefits in response to a public health crisis.

The program will be particularly helpful for those without paid sick leave, and will cover self-employed workers and workers without sufficient work history to qualify for regular unemployment insurance.
