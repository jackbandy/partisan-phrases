"Local governments are on the frontlines of this crisis," said the lawmakers. "This federal funding will shore up the capacity of Maryland's cities and counties to respond to its widespread consequences. Funds can be used to address a wide variety of needs including providing shelter to homeless individuals, increasing affordable housing options, and maintaining crucial public services during this difficult time. We look forward to the announcement of additional awards to Maryland state and local governments in the days and weeks to come."

$30,870,453 through Community Development Block Grant (CDBG),$15,408,028 through Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) program, and$1,520,827 Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program. The funding announced today represents $2 billion of the overall $5 billion provided for CDBG, $2 billion of the overall $4 billion provided for ESG, and the entirety of the $65 million for HOPWA under the CARES Act.
