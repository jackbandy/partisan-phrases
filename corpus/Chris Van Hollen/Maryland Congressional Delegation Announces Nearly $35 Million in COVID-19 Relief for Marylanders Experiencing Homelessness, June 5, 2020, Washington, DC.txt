Maryland Congressional Delegation Announces Nearly $35 Million in COVID-19 Relief for Marylanders Experiencing Homelessness


Congressman Steny H. Hoyer (MD-05) and the full Maryland Congressional Delegation including Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, and Congressmen Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone, today announced $34,985,870 in COVID-19 relief through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG-CV) for jurisdictions in Maryland. 

These funds will be used to address the impact of COVID-19 among individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. They may also be used to support additional homeless services, prevention, and eviction prevention assistance for the families and individuals who are newly experiencing homelessness as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eviction prevention programs include rapid rehousing, housing counseling, and rental deposit assistance.

"The economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic mean that more Marylanders need help keeping a roof over their heads than ever before," the lawmakers said. "At the same time, individuals experiencing homelessness are among those at the highest risks of coronavirus transmission. These federal funds will enable local governments to provide critical community housing services in response to these urgent needs."

The $2.96 billion allocated today nationwide is allocated based on a formula which accounts for local levels of sheltered and unsheltered homelessness, levels of homelessness risk, and economic and housing market conditions. Awards are as follows:
