Letter to the Hon. Barbara Barrett, Secretary of the U.S. Air Force - Van Hollen Presses Administration to Expedite Honorary Promotion for Col. McGee


Dear Secretary Barrett:

I write regarding the honorary promotion for Colonel (Ret.) Charles E. McGee authorized in Section 599A of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020.

Based on conversations between my staff and the Air Force's Congressional Liaison office, I understand that this honorary promotion is currently on your desk for approval, after which, due to a ruling by the Air Force General Counsel, it must go through the Joint Staff, several OSD offices, the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Council before it can be presented to the President. We have been advised that this process may take two months or more.

While I understand the importance of thoughtful consideration in situations such as this, I ask that you make every effort to move this honorary promotion package through the appropriate channels and to the President as quickly as possible.

I was honored to be able to assist in securing this honorary promotion authority through the NDAA, and I hope that you will assist me ensuring that one of our Nation's distinguished Tuskegee Airmen receives this honor as soon as possible.
