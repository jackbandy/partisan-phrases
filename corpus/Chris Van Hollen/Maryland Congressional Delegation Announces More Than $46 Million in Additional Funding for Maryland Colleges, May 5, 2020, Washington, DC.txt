Congressman Steny H. Hoyer (MD-05) and the Maryland Congressional Delegation, including Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Congressmen Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin, and David Trone, today announced $46,702,104 for Maryland's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and colleges serving large populations of low-income students through the U.S. Department of Education Higher Education and Emergency Relief (HEER) Fund created through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. These supplemental awards are provided on top of those that HBCUs and other MSIs received under the $170 million previously announced by the delegation for Maryland colleges and universities.

"Maryland's Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Serving Institutions, and community colleges serving high populations of low-income students play a critically important role in our communities," said the Delegation. "We fought to obtain dedicated assistance to ensure that they have the resources to make it through this challenging time. This federal funding will help these institutions continue to educate and serve the needs of their students."

Of the $14.25 billion provided for higher education relief nationally through the CARES Act, Congress set aside $1.05 billion for HBCUs and Minority Serving Institutions and $344 million for schools that the Secretary determines has the greatest unmet needs related to COVID-19. Federal funding may be used for institutions to cover the costs of attendance for eligible students, technology associated with a transition to distance education, and faculty and staff trainings. It may also be used to cover operational costs including lost revenue, reimbursements for prior expenses, and payroll. Awards include $44,795,871 for four HBCUs, $1,311,412 for nine community colleges, and $594,821 for public and private non-profit nonprofit schools.
