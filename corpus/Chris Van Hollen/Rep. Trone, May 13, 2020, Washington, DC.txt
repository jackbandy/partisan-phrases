Rep. Trone, Maryland Delegation Members Announce More than $205 Million to Expand Statewide Testing Capacity


Members of the Maryland congressional delegation, including U.S. Congressman David Trone, Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, and Jamie B. Raskin announced that Maryland will receive $205,723,600 to expand COVID-19 testing capacity statewide.

 

Funding comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and was authorized through the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. This new federal funding follows the delegation's recent announcement of nearly $7 million to help Maryland's community health centers increase COVID-19 testing, also provided through the most recent federal legislation.

 

"Widespread testing is still the key to safely reopen Maryland's economy and help Americans get back to work," the lawmakers said. "Our federal COVID-19 response effort has focused intensely on the need to expand America's COVID-19 testing capabilities significantly. We will continue to work closely with state and local officials to improve our ability to track the virus, contain outbreaks and protect the health and safety of all Marylanders."
