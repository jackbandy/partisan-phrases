Maryland Congressional Delegation Announces $500,000 in Federal Funding to Support State-level Coronavirus Response


U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Andy Harris, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie Raskin, and David Trone today announced $500,000 in federal funding to support Maryland's response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Funding comes from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These resources will help public health officials in Maryland monitor and assess possible coronavirus cases across the state.

"The coronavirus is a public health threat that demands a strong, coordinated response by federal, state, and local partners," said the lawmakers. "We commend the ongoing work by Maryland's public health workers to help keep Marylanders safe."

Additional resources will be made available through the bicameral, bipartisan supplemental appropriations package passed by the House and Senate this week.
