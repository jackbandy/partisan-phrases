Maryland Congressional Delegation Announces Award of Nearly $7 Million for Community Health Centers to Increase COVID-19 Testing Capacity


Congressman Steny H. Hoyer (MD-05) and the Maryland Congressional Delegation, including Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Congressmen Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin, and David Trone announced $6,975,492 for eighteen community health centers in Maryland through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Authorized through the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, these awards will help health centers to cover the costs of purchasing, administering, and expanding their capacity to administer COVID-19 tests.

"Ensuring widespread access to testing is the first step necessary to moving safely to the other side of this pandemic," said the Delegation. "These federal funds will help CHCs across Maryland increase testing capacity, especially for families and individuals who face barriers to obtaining health care. We will continue working closely with state officials to support Maryland's COVID-19 response efforts and keep delivering critical federal resources to our state."

All Maryland community health centers are currently conducting testing for COVID-19. The delegation previously announced $15.6 million for Maryland community health centers through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) Act.

HHS has awarded nearly $583 million to 1,385 centers across the country. The funds may be used to expand the range of testing and testing-related activities to best address the needs of their local communities, including the purchase of personal protective equipment; training, outreach, procurement and administration of tests; laboratory services; and the expansion of walk-up or drive-up testing capabilities.
