Van Hollen Statement on EPA's Response Regarding its Responsibility to Enforce Chesapeake Bay Pollution Reduction


Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) released the following statement regarding the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) response to his January 8, 2020 letter urging the EPA to provide clarity on their commitment to enforcing Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) pollution reduction targets.

"I am deeply frustrated and concerned by the EPA's lack of clarity in their response to my letter regarding their commitment to protecting and preserving the Chesapeake Bay. Their response ducks the main question we asked: do they plan to enforce the pollution reduction targets in the Bay Agreement? Failure to enforce these targets puts the health of the Bay at risk. And without stronger assurances, we must take them to court.

"The Chesapeake Bay Program was created under the EPA's jurisdiction with the task of enforcing the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) pollution reduction targets. This responsibility has been upheld by the Courts and is crucial to the ultimate health of the Bay and our Bay Economy. As a member of the Environment and Public Works and Appropriations Committees, I look forward to receiving answers directly from Administrator Wheeler on this issue the next time he sits before our Committees."
