Van Hollen Statement on Promotion of Charles McGee to Brigadier General


Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) released the following statement congratulating Charles McGee on his promotion to Brigadier General:

 "I salute Brigadier General Charles McGee for his extraordinary service to our country. I am proud to have teamed up with Representative Anthony Brown to pass this legislation and to provide Colonel McGee with this honorary promotion to Brigadier General. Thank you, General, for your sacrifice to our nation, and again, happy 100th birthday!"

Brigadier General McGee, a resident of Bethesda, Md., served with the Tuskegee Airmen in World War II, completing 136 combat missions. Just over two months ago -- on December 7, 2019 -- he celebrated his 100th birthday.

In July, Senator Van Hollen introduced legislation to authorize Col. McGee's promotion, which was then passed unanimously by the full Senate. Senator Van Hollen and Congressman Brown also pushed to include their provision within the House and Senate NDAA. In December, Senator Van Hollen announced the successful inclusion of the provision within the NDAA, and the legislation was then passed by both the House and the Senate. On December 20, 2019 it was signed into law by the President.
