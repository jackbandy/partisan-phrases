Van Hollen Statement on Current Phase Three Coronavirus Package


Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) released the following statement regarding his vote in opposition to moving forward with the current version of the phase three coronavirus package.

"After claiming they wanted to put American families, workers, and small businesses first, Republicans have pulled a total U-turn, with a package that instead bails out big corporations with a slush fund without adequate safeguards to protect the public interest. I urge Republicans to come back to the table and work together with us on legislation that actually provides support to those who need it most. Our workers, families, and small and mid-size businesses are desperate for immediate economic relief, and we must act now."
