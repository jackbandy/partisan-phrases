Recognizing Adina Togal


Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Adina Togal, a  fearless young leader who is working hard to save lives.

Adina was just 12 years old herself when she suffered a severe  allergy attack that almost took her life. It wasn't caused by the food  that she ate. It was from a medication she had been prescribed.

Unfortunately, unlike its requirements for food labels, the FDA  doesn't currently have a standardized system for disclosing the  presence of common allergens in medications. Information that could  save lives.

As Adina's Representative and as a doctor who has cared for patients  for more than 20 years, I want to make sure that no one is in danger of  a life-threatening allergy attack simply because they took their  medication. That is why I am introducing the ADINA Act to make this  commonsense change to allergen information on drug labels a reality.

I am proud this bill is strongly bipartisan. My colleagues on both  sides of the aisle agree it is a no-brainer. I am hopeful that together  we can make this country safer and healthier.

Mr. Speaker, I extend my heartfelt thanks to Adina and her family for  her deep dedication, her tireless advocacy, and for all she is doing  for millions of Americans with allergies to make their lives safer.
