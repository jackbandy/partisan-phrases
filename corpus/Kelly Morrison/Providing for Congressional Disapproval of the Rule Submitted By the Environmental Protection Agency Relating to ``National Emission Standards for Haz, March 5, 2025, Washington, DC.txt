Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise, as a doctor of more than 20  years, in opposition to H.J. Res. 61, an egregious and completely  unnecessary assault on our public health.

This resolution put forward by congressional Republicans would rip  away protections that keep Americans safe from some of the most  dangerous and cancer-causing air toxins in the world, such as arsenic  and lead.

As an OB/GYN, I am extremely concerned because these toxins are known  to cause reproductive harm and birth defects.

Just last night, in this Chamber, President Trump claimed: ``Our goal  is to get toxins out of our environment.'' President Trump also  highlighted the concerning increase in rates of childhood cancer and  claimed: ``Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities.''

Yet, less than 24 hours later, the Republican majority is choosing to  increase toxins in our environment, expose more Americans to some of  the most dangerous pollutants, and likely increase the rates of cancer.

Let's be clear: This cost-effective rule presents minimal cost to  industry in order to protect public health.

What are we doing here? Why are we selling out the health of  Americans? The consequences of this would be devastating to our  children, moms and new babies, and families across the country. It is  completely preventable.

To my Republican colleagues who hold the majority rule in this  Chamber,  please, for the sake of the health and well-being of the American  people, vote ``no'' on this resolution.
