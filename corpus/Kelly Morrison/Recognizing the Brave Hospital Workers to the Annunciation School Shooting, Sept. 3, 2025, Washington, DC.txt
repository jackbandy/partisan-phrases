Recognizing the Brave Hospital Workers to the Annunciation School Shooting


Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in recognition of the brave  hospital workers who responded to the Annunciation school shooting last  week.

Whenever a mass shooting happens, the ripple effects of the trauma it  causes in that community are profound. I will take a moment to thank  every healthcare worker who helped save lives in responding to this  event.

Children's Masonic, and particularly the staff at Hennepin  Healthcare, took in nearly a dozen children in critical condition.  These children arrived alone, unidentified, and ripped apart by gunshot  wounds.

The hospital staff leapt into action immediately, removing shrapnel,  performing emergency surgery, and providing stabilizing care and  comfort to these little children.

While we are immensely grateful for their expertise, we should not  normalize that doctors and nurses in the United States have had to  become expert in managing war wounds. The toll it takes on them is  real. This event reminds us of how critically important our level 1  trauma centers are in our communities. They are lifesaving, and these  hospital workers are our heroes. I am immeasurably grateful.
