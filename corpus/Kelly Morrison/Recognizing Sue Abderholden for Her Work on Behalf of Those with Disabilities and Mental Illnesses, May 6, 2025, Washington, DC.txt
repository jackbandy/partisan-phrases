Recognizing Sue Abderholden for Her Work on Behalf of Those with Disabilities and Mental Illnesses


Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Sue  Abderholden for her decades of tireless service and steadfast  commitment to Minnesotans living with disabilities and mental  illnesses.

For the past 24 years, Ms. Abderholden has served as Executive  Director of the Minnesota chapter of the National Alliance on Mental  Illness.

Under her leadership, our state has become more compassionate, more  informed, and more responsive to the needs of those facing mental  health challenges.

She played a central role in passing over two dozen laws that  expanded access to care and improved how we support people with mental  illnesses.

Ms. Abderholden's advocacy brought mental health training into our  schools, ensured screenings for individuals entering the justice  system, and reformed civil commitment laws to emphasize voluntary  treatment.

She expanded crisis and early intervention services, championed a  more diverse mental health workforce, and worked to strengthen housing  and community-based support services.

Her compassion extended to her home where Ms. Abderholden and her  family fostered children with disabilities and youth aging out of  foster care, offering stability and care when it was most needed.

On behalf of myself and countless Minnesotans, I offer my gratitude  to Ms. Abderholden for her decades of hard work and service.
