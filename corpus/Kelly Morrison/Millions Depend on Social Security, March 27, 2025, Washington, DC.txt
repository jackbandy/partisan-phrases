Millions Depend on Social Security

Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to voice a concern from my  constituents, Jeff and Bev.

Last week, Trump's billionaire Commerce Secretary was speaking with  another billionaire about how only fraudsters would complain about  missing a Social Security check. Trump's billionaire Commerce Secretary  said that if Social Security didn't send out checks for a month, his  mother-in-law simply would not call to complain.

At the very same time, I held a townhall with my constituents where  Jeff and Bev, from Bloomington, asked this question: If or when Trump  ends Social Security, Bev and I will be unable to pay our mortgage. We  will become homeless at age 70. What can we do? What should we do?

There are tens of millions of Americans across the country like Jeff  and Bev who depend on that check coming every month. On their behalf, I  ask my Republican colleagues who have majority rule of this Chamber,  what are they going to do to stand up for American families and stop  the billionaires who are dismantling Social Security?
