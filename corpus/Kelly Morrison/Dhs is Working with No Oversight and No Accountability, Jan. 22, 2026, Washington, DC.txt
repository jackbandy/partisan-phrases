Dhs is Working with No Oversight and No Accountability


Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my horror at what we are  witnessing in Minnesota. Kristi Noem's DHS has been working with no  oversight and no accountability. The irresponsibility and recklessness  are costing human lives.

ICE is terrorizing our communities, indiscriminately racially  profiling, using force against peaceful protesters, barging into  people's homes without warrants, preventing doctors from treating their  patients, blocking students from their classrooms, snatching children,  elderly people, pregnant women, veterans, active military, and American  citizens from our streets.

Republicans have been silent while this administration terrorizes  people in communities and violates the rights and freedoms enshrined in  our Constitution.

What will it take for the majority in this Congress to speak up?  Where is your line?

Our communities deserve the dignity of safety and justice, not the  cruelty of silence and complicity. You can stop this. Please stand up.  Stand up for the Constitution, stand up for freedom, stand up for  liberty, stand up for justice, and stand up for humanity.
