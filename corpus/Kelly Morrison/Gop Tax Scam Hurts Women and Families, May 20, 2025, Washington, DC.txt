Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families

Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise on behalf of Minnesota  families who will lose access to healthcare if the Republican budget  passes. I want to tell you about Alicia and her daughter, one of them.

Alicia's oldest daughter is 11 years old. She is a happy, active, and  confident fifth grader. She has also faced a lifetime of medical  challenges including an immune disorder, a blood disorder, and a spinal  condition.

Alicia and her family didn't ask for this. Nothing they did caused  this. They work hard. They pay their taxes. They love their daughter  fiercely. They simply cannot afford the care that she needs without  Medicaid.

Medicaid is what allows Alicia's daughter to go to school, to regain  her motor skills, and to run a 5K with her classmates, something  unthinkable before her treatment. It is the reason she is not just  surviving but she is thriving.

Republicans are going to gut the program that she and half of all  American children get their healthcare coverage through. This isn't  about politics. It is about our values. It is about protecting the  health and future of our children. We must protect Medicaid. Our kids  are watching, and they are counting on us.
