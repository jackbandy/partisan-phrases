Doe and Sba Research Act


Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 788, the DOE and  SBA Research Act.

As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Rural Development,  Energy, and Supply Chains, I am proud to co-lead this bipartisan  legislation with the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaLota) and the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Thanedar).

This bill would require the Department of Energy and the Small  Business Administration to enter into a memorandum of understanding  that would improve collaboration between these two agencies. This joint  agency effort would expand opportunities for small businesses to  participate in research and development opportunities at DOE and its  national laboratories.

It is in our economic and national security interests for the United  States to remain a leader in R&D and technological advancement. In  order to maximize our impact, we must tap into talent wherever we can  find it. Too often, small businesses are overlooked when it comes to  research and development opportunities.

Small businesses are not only the backbone of our economy, but they  also drive forward American innovation and ingenuity. The DOE and SBA  Research Act will help ensure that small business owners continue to  play a central role in the United States' leadership in these areas.

I thank my colleagues for their collaboration on this critical  legislation. I thank Chairman Williams and Ranking Member Velazquez for  their support. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  legislation.
