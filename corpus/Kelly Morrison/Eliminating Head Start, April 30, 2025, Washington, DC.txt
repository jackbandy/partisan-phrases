Eliminating Head Start

Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise on behalf of the 800,000  children who will lose access to early childhood care, healthcare, and  education because of the Trump administration's budget.

Their budget proposes to eliminate Head Start, the nationwide program  that provides essential care to nearly 1  million children across our country. Meanwhile, the White House is  assessing ways to ``persuade women to have more children.''

I am an OB/GYN. It has been my life's work to help women have  children. Let me tell you, eliminating early childhood care and  education, making our Nation's childcare crisis even worse and taking  away parents' ability to go to work and provide for their families, is  not how you persuade women to have more children.

On top of that, gutting Medicaid, the health insurance program that  covers half of all children and 40 percent of all births, is not how  you persuade women to have more children.

It is hard to imagine a more antifamily agenda. The Republican plan  pressures women to have more children then abandons them, gutting the  healthcare, education, and support they need to be healthy and to  thrive.
