Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3854, the  Modernizing All Veterans and Survivors Claims Processing Act.

The bill before us includes the provisions of the Justice for  America's Veterans and Survivors Act, which I co-led with the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards). Our bipartisan bill will improve the  VA's data collection efforts on the prevailing causes of death among  veterans.

As a physician myself, I can tell you firsthand that thorough and  accurate data is critical to delivering the best possible care for  patients. I believe it is incumbent upon us as lawmakers to take the  same approach with policymaking, especially when it comes to crafting  legislation to help care for our veterans.

The information provided under this report will help us to better  understand the most serious threats facing our veterans, whether it be  suicide, toxic exposure, or other life-threatening conditions.

This reporting will also include important information on veterans  with service-connected disability, which will help to ensure that  surviving family members receive the benefits that they are entitled to  in a timely fashion.

This commonsense legislation will provide the information that we  need to ensure that our veterans are getting the best possible care,  which is a goal that we all share.

Mr. Speaker, I will end by thanking the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Edwards) for his partnership and the chair and ranking member for  their support. I also thank the bill's sponsor, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Valadao).

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  legislation.
