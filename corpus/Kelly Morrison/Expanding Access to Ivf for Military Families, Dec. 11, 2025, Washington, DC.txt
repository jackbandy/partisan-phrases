Expanding Access to Ivf for Military Families

Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to condemn the betrayal of  President Trump and his Republican majorities. Trump called himself the  fertilization President and promised to expand access to IVF, but his  Speaker of the House just blocked critical IVF expansion for military  families.

The American people overwhelmingly want to expand access to IVF. It  is what Donald Trump promised them as he was running for President last  year. I quote word for word: ``Under the Trump administration, we are  going to be paying for that treatment, or we are going to be mandating  that the insurance company pay.''

Here we are, and the Republican Congress is sending a bill to  President Trump's desk that fails to expand coverage for military  families to do just that.

The brave servicemembers who put their lives on the line for our  country and our freedoms will not be able to access the care they need  to grow their families if they suffer from infertility.

Mr. Speaker, this is sadly only the latest betrayal by the Republican  majority talking a big game about being profamily but blocking policies  that would actually support them. It is beyond disappointing. It is  cruel.
