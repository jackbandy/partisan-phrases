Women's History Month

Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, as we recognize Women's History Month, I  rise, as an OB/GYN, in fierce defense of our Nation's moms and babies.

Right now, the Republican majority in Congress is launching a full  attack on America's families.

Let's start first with where we are in our country. We are facing a  serious and worsening maternal healthcare crisis.

Just look at this map. In more than half of our country, women do not  have a place to go that provides obstetric care. Among peer nations, we  have both the highest rate of maternal deaths and the highest rate of  infant deaths--in the United States of America.

This is a crisis. It is an unacceptable crisis, and it demands  immediate action from our Nation's legislators.

Yet, the Republican majority is shoving a budget through that would  gut Medicaid, which is the single largest payer of maternity care in  our country, in order to give tax cuts to billionaires.

As an OB/GYN who has spent my life caring for women and delivering  babies, let me tell you: It is unconscionable to threaten the care  women receive before, during, and after pregnancy, but that is exactly  what the Republican majority is doing with their budget.

Republicans are choosing to shut down more hospitals and clinics  across the country. Republicans are choosing to make even more of our  country into maternal care deserts. Republicans are choosing to take  healthcare away from moms and babies.

It does not have to be this way. As we celebrate Women's History  Month, I implore the Republican majority to make their policy match  their profamily rhetoric and choose to put America's moms and babies  first.
