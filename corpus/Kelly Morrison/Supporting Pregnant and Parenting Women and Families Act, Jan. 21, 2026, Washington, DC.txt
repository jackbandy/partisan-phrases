Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act


Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 6945.

The Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act is yet  another Republican betrayal cruelly masked by a misleading title.

After spending the last few weeks threatening access to childcare  support and doing literally nothing to help millions of Americans  afford their healthcare, Republicans want to direct taxpayer dollars  away from helping families afford necessities like food, rent, and  childcare to crisis pregnancy centers that prey on vulnerable women  seeking legitimate reproductive healthcare.

We have heard today that wonderful, caring people staff these crisis  pregnancy centers, and I don't doubt that, but crisis pregnancy centers  do not provide medical care, though they imply that they do. Crisis  pregnancy centers are unregulated, deceptive, and dangerous.

As an OB/GYN myself for more than 20 years, I have seen far too many  patients who have had, at best, confusing and, at worst, life- threatening experiences at crisis pregnancy centers. They don't serve  patients. They serve the anti-abortion agenda.

Let me be clear: Every person has the right and deserves the dignity  to make their own healthcare decisions, free from intimidation,  deception, and coercion. At a time when our country has a shameful  maternal and infant mortality crisis and is facing a worsening shortage  of obstetricians, the so-called pro-life movement is focused not on  helping women or supporting their families or delivering the IVF  coverage the President promised; they are focused on denying women  their reproductive rights and failing to deliver for American families.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand for women and families,  for dignity and for freedom, and vote ``no.''
