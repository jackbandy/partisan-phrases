Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness

Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to a provision  tucked away in the Republican's budget proposal that will open up the  Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness to toxic sulfide-ore copper  mining.

My husband and I take our kids camping and paddling in the Boundary  Waters every year, and we are not alone. The Boundary Waters is the  most visited wilderness area in the country. There is literally no  other place like it on Earth. It is a major driver of the nearly $13.5  billion outdoor recreation economy in Minnesota.

All that is at risk if sulfide-ore copper mining is allowed in the  watershed of the Boundary Waters. It is known as the most toxic  industry in America, and it has never been done in Minnesota before.

The Republican majority is prioritizing the interests of an  international Chilean mining conglomerate that has no interest or stake  in the economy or well-being of Minnesotans.

They will extract our resources. They will pollute our air, land, and  water. They will permanently damage our pristine Boundary Waters and  leave Minnesotans to foot the bill for the cleanup.

Mr. Speaker, we should protect Minnesota's crown jewel and not  destroy it.
