Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor State  Senator Ann Rest for her decades of dedicated service in the Minnesota  Legislature and her deep commitment to improving the lives of all  Minnesotans.

For over 40 years, my friend and former colleague Ann Rest has served  with distinction. First elected to the Minnesota House in 1984, she  served eight terms before being elected to the Minnesota Senate, where  I had the privilege of serving alongside her.

During her Senate tenure, she held key leadership roles, including  Assistant Majority Leader and President Pro Tempore. In 2023, she made  history as the first and only Minnesota legislator to chair the Tax  Committee in both chambers.

Her career is marked by legislative achievements that strengthened  Minnesota's economy and communities. She championed fairer tax policy,  supported investments in public education, and worked to make  government more transparent and accountable. Most notably, she played a  central role in a $3 billion tax bill in 2023 delivering relief to  families, seniors, and small businesses across our state. In 2025, she  was honored as a ``Legislator of Distinction'' by the league of  Minnesota Cities for her effectiveness and dedication.

Senator Rest is a hardworking, resilient person and an accomplished  legislator. She is also a diehard Twins fan and a devoted grandmother.  Her legacy is felt not only in her legislative achievements, but also  in her care for her constituents. On behalf of countless Minnesotans, I  offer Senator Rest my sincere gratitude for her decades of service to  our great state. I wish her a very happy and well-deserved retirement  and a winning season for the Twins next year.
