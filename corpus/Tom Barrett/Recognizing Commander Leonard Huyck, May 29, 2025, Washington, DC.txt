Mr. BARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true legend in the  Michigan veteran community. It is with deep respect and heartfelt  appreciation that I get to recognize Commander Leonard Huyck for  extraordinary service and steadfast leadership of VFW Post 8964.

Since being elected Post Commander in May of 1983, Leonard has  dedicated forty-two years of his life to leading his fellow veterans,  honoring their service, and strengthening the bonds of community and  patriotism that define the VFW. His leadership has not only guided Post  8964 through decades of change, but ensured it remained a place of  honor, support, and purpose for all who served.

Forty-two years is more than a milestone, it's a testament to  Leonard's character, commitment, and love of country. He has given his  time, energy, and heart to this mission, building a legacy that will  outlast all of us in the process.

On behalf of a grateful Nation, I thank Commander Huyck for his  service. He has made a difference in the lives of many, and our  community is a better place because of him.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and the people of our  mid-Michigan community in recognizing Commander Huyck for his decades  of service.
