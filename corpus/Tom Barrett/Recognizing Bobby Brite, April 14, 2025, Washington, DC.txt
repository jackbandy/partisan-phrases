Recognizing Bobby Brite


Mr. BARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding  American and true patriot, Mr. Bobby Brite, who was named Veteran of  the Year for 2024 by the American Legion.

Bobby is a 26-year veteran of the United States Army who served our  country with integrity, sacrifice, and quiet leadership. He served on  active duty from 1990 to 1996 and again from 2003 to 2005, when his  work as an infantry platoon leader during Operation Iraqi Freedom II  earned him the Bronze Star Medal and the Combat Infantry Badge.

Following his retirement in 2023, Bobby rededicated his life to  serving his brothers and sisters who also hung up the uniform. Today,  he is Post Historian for American Legion Post 141 in Howell, Michigan,  where he previously served as Post Commander, 1st Vice Commander, and  Finance Officer.

He is also Secretary for the VFW Post 6464, President of the Howell  Veterans Society, American Legion Department of Michigan Membership  Committee Member, and a Post 141 Past Commanders Committee Member.

To put it simply, Bobby Brite is a pillar in the veteran community-- offering support, building friendships, and fighting to ensure that no  veteran is left behind. Whether it's helping a fellow veteran navigate  the VA system, organizing community events, or just being someone to  lean on, Bobby is always there. His efforts exemplify the very spirit  of the American Legion--``For God and Country''--and I could think of  no one more deserving of this tremendous honor.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating my good  friend, Bobby Brite, on this incredible achievement. Our community, the  state of Michigan, and the United States of America are grateful for  his continued service to our Nation and its heroes.
