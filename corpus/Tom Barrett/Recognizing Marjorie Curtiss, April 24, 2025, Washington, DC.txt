Recognizing Marjorie Curtiss


Mr. BARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a truly  extraordinary American, Marjorie Ann Smith Curtiss, who is celebrating  her 100th birthday today. Born in 1925, Marjorie has spent the past  century as a proud Michigander whose life has been defined by strength,  service, and resilience.

In 1943, during the Second World War, Marjorie became one of the  original ``Rosies,'' embodying the spirit of Rosie the Riveter and  stepping up to support her Nation on the home front. Immediately after  her high school graduation, Marjorie volunteered at the Chevrolet plant  near her home in Flint, Michigan, where she worked on rehabilitating  military trucks for the front lines. A few months later, Marjorie  became an inspector, where she played a critical role in maintaining  records on the Briggs & Stratton airplane engines being rebuilt at the  facility until the operation closed in 1945.

Marjorie's legacy, however, goes far beyond the factory floor. After  marrying her husband John David Curtiss, she raised four children, put  herself through nursing school, and achieved a career in the field.  Today, she is the proud matriarch of a growing family that includes  seven grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren. Her legacy of  love, perseverance, and hard work continues to shine through them.

Mr. Speaker, Marjorie Curtiss is an exceptional woman who answered  the call to support her Nation in its darkest hour. Her story, which is  woven into the fabric of our Nation, is nothing short of remarkable. I  urge my colleagues to join me and all of Michigan's Seventh  Congressional District in wishing her a very happy 100th birthday.
