Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have always believed that a  strong city is like a well-planted tree: deep roots give you staying  power, sturdy branches let you grow, and a good neighborhood street,  well, that's your main limb. So today, I'm pleased to recognize a man  whose roots run deep and whose work on roots and limbs alike has  brought new life to Green Cove Springs, Florida. I rise to honor the  retirement of Steve Kennedy, longtime City Manager for the City of  Green Cove Springs.

Steve joined the city as City Manager on October 1, 2018, following  more than 38 years of exemplary municipal service in Georgia. During  his nearly seven-year tenure here, he led with vision, steadiness, and  a keen sense of public service, culminating in an impressive 48-year  career in local government.

One of Steve's signature achievements for Green Cove Springs is the  redevelopment of Walnut Street, where he oversaw the major redesign and  reconstruction project that is now helping the city both preserve its  historic charm and position itself for future growth. This project  reflects Steve's commitment to the everyday quality of life for  residents, business owners, and visitors alike.

Under his leadership, the city also advanced the Harbor Road Advanced  Wastewater Treatment Plant and established the city's first  Community Redevelopment Agency, major infrastructure and policy shifts  that will benefit the community for decades to come.

On behalf of the people of Northeast Florida, I extend my sincere  thanks to Steve Kennedy for his dedication to public service, his  countless hours working behind the scenes to ensure this city's  progress, and for planting the kind of roots that will support growth  for generations. May his retirement be full of relaxation, quality time  with family and the satisfaction of watching all he built continue to  flourish.
