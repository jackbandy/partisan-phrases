Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding  me time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the SAVE America Act, to show  an ID before you cast your ballot.

Mr. Speaker, I have heard on the other side of the aisle in this very  debate that it is already illegal to cast a ballot when you are not  eligible to vote. It is already illegal. We don't need another law.

Mr. Speaker, it is already illegal for a minor to purchase alcohol.  Yet the clerk says: Please show me your ID.

America is hungry for fair elections. I don't think it is too much to  ask that we show an ID to restore election integrity. Let's give  America what they want.

For all those who say that it is too much to ask to show an ID, I say  that it is nonsense. One citizen, one vote is the foundation of our  Republic.

Mr. Speaker, let me go ahead and do the math for you and everybody in  this room. One illegal vote is one too many. Let's pass the SAVE  America Act now, and let's save voter integrity and voter elections  right now.

Let's do it, Mr. Speaker.
