Town of Hilliard Remembers Our Vietnam Veterans


Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, President Calvin Coolidge once  said, ``The nation which forgets its defenders will be itself  forgotten.'' His words perfectly encapsulate the importance of  remembering our Vietnam War veterans.

I rise today with great honor to recognize the legacy and great  sacrifice of our Vietnam War veterans through The Wall That Heals,  which will be on display in Nassau County, Florida, from April 17th  through April 21st at the Northeast Florida Fairgrounds.

The Wall That Heals is a half-scale replica of the permanent memorial  in Washington, D.C., that stands six feet tall at the center and covers  almost 300 feet from end to end.

The traveling exhibition will be a unique opportunity for individuals  in our community, including the 26,900 Vietnam Veterans who call the  Fourth Congressional District of Florida home, to see the names of  their loved ones and comrades who otherwise may not be able to make the  trip to Washington.

I would like to thank the Town of Hilliard, Veterans of Foreign Wars  Post 10095, and all the volunteers who dedicated their time and effort  to bring this distinct honor to Northeast Florida.

Mr. Speaker, we will never be able to repay our debt to those who  have given their last measure of devotion for the spirit of America.  But we can continue to do our duty: to remember. May the lives of those  who served and were killed during the Vietnam War never be forgotten.
