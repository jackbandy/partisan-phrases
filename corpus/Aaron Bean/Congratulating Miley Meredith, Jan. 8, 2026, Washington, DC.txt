Congratulating Miley Meredith

Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, some achievements don't just earn  applause, they open the door for others. Today, we honor someone who  has done just exactly that: Miley Meredith, the first female Eagle  Scout in Nassau County, Florida.

From Troop 9152 of Scouting America in Yulee, Miley has shown  outstanding dedication, creativity, and a genuine commitment to serving  others, qualities that earned her the rank of Eagle Scout. The  accomplishment, Mr. Speaker, as you know, is impressive for any Scout,  but for Miley's achievement, it also marks an historic moment for our  community--expanding what is possible for young women in northeast  Florida.

As part of her service project, Miley devoted more than 155 hours  installing a 25-foot flagpole and creating a 6-foot mural for the Yulee  Lions Club, strengthening a valued community organization.

On behalf of Florida's Fourth Congressional District, I proudly  congratulate Miley Meredith, an Eagle Scout whose achievements earn and  deserve applause and whose example will continue opening doors for  others.
