Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate a milestone  that truly brings a smile. This week, Dr. William Stewart Mitchell III  of Fleming Island, Florida, marks his 100th birthday, a century defined  by faith, family, and devoted service to our Nation.

Dr. Mitchell graduated valedictorian of Hamilton County High School  before entering the Navy in 1943. Recognizing his talent, the Navy  placed him in the B-12 program at Emory University, where he again  graduated valedictorian from dental school. He went on to serve with  the 1st Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, providing essential care as a  naval officer in the Dental Corps. His distinguished career spanned sea  service, Active Duty, Reserve Duty, and retiring as a lieutenant  commander.

Mr. Speaker, Dr. Mitchell has built a legacy of excellence and  dedication to others. Today, I honor him as he celebrates 100 years on  this planet, and I recognize a life that has given this Nation  countless reasons to smile. It is a privilege to share his story with  this Chamber.

Mr. Speaker, I wish Dr. Mitchell a happy birthday.
