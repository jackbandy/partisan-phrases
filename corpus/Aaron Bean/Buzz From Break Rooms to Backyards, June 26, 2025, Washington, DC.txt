Buzz From Break Rooms to Backyards

Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,  some say it is the bee's knees. What is the buzz?

Basically, it brings better jobs, bigger paychecks, and booming  communities. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is about boosting wages,  backing small businesses, bolstering border security, and it brings tax  relief.

Mr. Speaker, I recently sat down with manufacturers from my district  in northeast Florida who reviewed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and  they said bravo.

The Trump tax cuts have bolstered growth, boosted job creation, and  benefited American production. However, barring action, burdensome tax  hikes will be bothersome. In northeast Florida alone, the One Big  Beautiful Bill Act protects 15,000 jobs and over $2.6 billion in base  economic output.

The House has done its part, but I am banking on the Senate to bring  it on and show the American people they are serious about ensuring  manufacturing remains the bedrock of our blossoming economy.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is not just about good policy. It is  the reason there is a buzz from break rooms to backyards. It brings  bold benefits to builders, businessowners, and breadwinners. It is the  best for workers, families, and our big, beautiful future. Let's get it  done, and let's boogie.
