Putting Your Money Where Your Mouth is

Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, if families across the Nation pay  their debts and live within their means, shouldn't we in Congress  reevaluate how money is being spent in Washington and across the  Nation? Of course we should.

For far too long, our government has put the cost of not just  emergencies but everyday expenses on our Nation's credit card. Now, as  a result, our national debt is a staggering $36 trillion and growing  every day.

Mr. Speaker, I am willing to put my money where my mouth is, and that  is why I have introduced the Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is Act to  reduce congressional office budgets by $100,000, just a paltry 5.2  percent.

The American credit card has reached its limit. We must tighten our  belts. We have bills to pay and emergencies to cover. We need to be in  this together.

Mr. Speaker, I have one question for you and this body: Are we  willing to put our money where our mouths are?

I encourage all of my colleagues to join in this effort. Let's go get  them.
