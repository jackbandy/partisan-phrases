Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, let's go back to 1974, which was,  indeed, a big year. It was the year ``Blazing Saddles'' was a massive  box office success, ``All in the Family'' was the top-rated TV show,  and ``Happy Days'' premiered on ABC.

Mr. Speaker, it was that same year that Trinity Baptist College was  founded in Jacksonville, Florida, 50 years ago.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Trinity Baptist College's 50th  anniversary, a milestone that invites reflection on a half-century  commitment to higher education from a God-centered worldview.

Mr. Speaker, TBC believes that ministry is not confined to the pulpit  or the classroom but rather every career can be a platform for living  out faith and sharing the gospel.

With this understanding, the college has seen impressive growth in  both its academic and athletic programs. Most importantly, TBC has  upheld a bold, unapologetic Christian worldview in every aspect of  student development. For five decades, TBC's mission has remained  unchanged and is today more alive than ever before as it strengthens  students for service, purpose, and leadership.

Mr. Speaker, as TBC celebrates its golden anniversary, I ask my  colleagues to join me in wishing them a hearty congratulations on 50  years of preparing students to learn with integrity, whether in the  classroom, workplace, or the community.

May God's favor and blessing be upon Trinity Baptist College as it  embarks on the next 50 years.
