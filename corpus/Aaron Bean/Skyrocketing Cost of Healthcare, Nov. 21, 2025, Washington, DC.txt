Skyrocketing Cost of Healthcare

Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the  skyrocketing cost of healthcare. When President Obama signed the  Affordable Care Act, he promised affordable coverage for all.

Mr. Speaker, 15 years and trillions of dollars later, all we have  gotten is higher costs and less coverage.

Basic economics tells us that when government subsidizes the price,  demand surges and prices soar. We have seen this movie before. Since  Federal student loans began 50 years ago, college tuition has risen  four and a half times faster than the rate of inflation.

When Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act and spent $1  trillion on subsidies, inflation hit a 40-year high. It is clear that  pouring taxpayer money into our broken healthcare system will only  drive prices higher.

As we debate healthcare costs, the solution is not spending more. It  is time for real, market-driven reforms that allow for competition and  consumer choice.
