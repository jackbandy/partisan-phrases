Others returned bearing the scars  of captivity, both visible and unseen. Behind every prisoner of war and  missing soldier is a story of sacrifice, of family left waiting, and a

nation with a solemn duty to remember.Today, I rise in honor of  National Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Recognition Day to remember  the more than 500,000 POWs who endured the horrors of enemy captivity.  We also honor the tens of thousands still missing in action.

These patriots and their loved ones deserve more than a single day of  remembrance. They deserve a permanent place of honor. That is why I  have introduced legislation to designate the POW/MIA Memorial Museum at  Cecil Field in northeast Florida, just outside of Jacksonville, as a  national landmark.

Mr. Speaker, on this day, with grateful hearts, we, the people,  reaffirm our promise to account for every missing hero. May we never  forget.
