Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, diamonds are rare and among the  most sought-after treasures in the world--but so are police officers.  Their courage, dedication, and commitment to protecting communities  make them priceless. Unlike diamonds, their shine comes not from the  way they reflect light, but from the way they reflect honor, integrity,  and sacrifice every single day.

Today, I rise in observance of Clay County Police Memorial Day on  Thursday, May 8th, in Clay County, Florida, and to honor the brave men  and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.

Clay County Police Memorial Day is more than a ceremony--it is a  solemn tribute, a reminder of their courage, and a commitment to never  forget their service.

These officers answered the call to protect and serve, putting their  lives on the line every day to ensure the safety of our community. They  walked into uncertainty, faced danger without hesitation; and upheld  the values of integrity, justice, and duty. Their legacy lives on in  the hearts of those they touched.

To the families of our fallen heroes, we offer our deepest gratitude.  No words can truly capture the weight of your loss or the sacrifice,  but please know that your loved ones will forever be honored and  remembered.

Mr. Speaker, let us reaffirm our commitment to those who continue to  serve. Let us support and lift up our law enforcement officers,  recognizing their dedication and ensuring they have the resources and  protection they need.

Mr. Speaker, let us pledge to keep the memory of our fallen officers  alive--not just today, but every day. So that just as the legacy of  diamonds is everlasting, so will be the legacy of our fallen Clay  County police officers.
