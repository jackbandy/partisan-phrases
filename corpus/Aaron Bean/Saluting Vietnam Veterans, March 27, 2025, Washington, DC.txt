Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, did you know that more than 3  million Americans, some only 18, 19, or 20 years old, served in  Vietnam? Each one had a duty to serve, but our duty, Mr. Speaker, is to  remember.

On March 29, National Vietnam War Veterans Day, we remember the brave  Americans who served, including the 26,900 Vietnam veterans who call  the Fourth Congressional District of Florida home. We remember the  58,000 patriots who never returned home safely to the warm embrace of  their families. Today, their names are hauntingly etched into the two  faces of black granite in our Nation's Capital known simply as The  Wall.

A replica of this very wall, almost 300 feet long, will be on display  in my district from April 17 to April 21, 2025, at the Northeast  Florida Fairgrounds in Nassau County, Florida. This will be a unique  and moving opportunity for individuals to come see the names of their  loved ones and patriots who otherwise may not be able to make it to  Washington, D.C.

Mr. Speaker, we remember the 150,000 who were wounded in battle and  bear the visible scars of post-traumatic stress and Agent Orange  exposure. We remember those who faced brutal captivity as prisoners of  war, and the 1,200 servicemembers still missing in action from Vietnam.

Mr. Speaker, we may never be able to repay our debt to those who have  given the last measure of devotion for the spirit of America, but we  can continue to do our duty to remember.

Mr. Speaker, on National Vietnam War Veterans Day and every day, we,  the people of the United States, with a grateful heart salute those who  endured great dangers at the hands of the enemy and lost in service to  our Nation.
