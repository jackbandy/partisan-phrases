Congratulating Oslene Ducady on Becoming An American Citizen


Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a truly  remarkable Journey--the dedication, perseverance, and unwavering  commitment that has brought Oslene Ducady to this moment becoming a  citizen of the United States of America.

Born in Haiti, the fifth of nine children, Oslene came to this  country chasing a dream, not for herself, but for her future children.  She moved to Green Cove Springs in the great state of Florida, where  she met her husband, Alix.

For 35 years, she built a life, raised six incredible children, and  poured her heart into her community. Yet through it all, she nurtured  the quiet fire within--a flame fueled by ambition, determination, and  the unwavering pursuit of a place to call home.

And this week, that pursuit reaches its pinnacle On Friday, May 16,  2025. Oslene will raise her hand and take the Oath of Allegiance,  becoming a proud citizen of the United States of America.

My office was honored to play a small part in helping her navigate  the final steps of that journey. Her story is a reminder that the  American Dream is not always fast or easy, but it is real, and it is  still worth fighting for.

I congratulate Oslene and her family. Today, we celebrate not just a  new citizen, but a dream realized.
