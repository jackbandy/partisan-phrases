Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank very much the chairman for  yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, one citizen, one vote. It is the pillar of our democracy  and you would think that of all the issues that we debate on this  hallowed floor, this is the one. This is the one that brings everybody  together, the pillar of our democracy, one citizen, one vote. Everybody  is on the same team.

Mr. Speaker, you would be wrong. It is amazing that you would be  wrong because there are people in this room that think women are  incapable of getting an ID. I think that is an insult to women.

Mr. Speaker, let me remind you why we are here. We are here because  this previous administration, the Biden administration, imported 10 to  15 million illegal aliens who have come here and we have evidence that  they are participating in our elections.

The next thing you will say is: Did they get Social Security numbers?  Mr. Speaker, they did. The DOGE team just announced millions of  illegals now have Social Security numbers. It is happening, and it ends  today when we vote on the SAVE Act.

I have just heard my colleagues say it is already against the law. We  don't need this act, but let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, it is already  against the law for a minor to buy beer, but yet the clerk checks the  ID before the purchase is made.

We need the SAVE Act. We need security. We need to come together. I  invite our colleagues to come together. There is still time to agree  that the pillar of our democracy is one citizen, one vote. The right  answer on the SAVE Act is a ``yes'' vote.
