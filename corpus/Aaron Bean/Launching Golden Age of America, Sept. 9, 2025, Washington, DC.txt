Launching Golden Age of America

Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, William Shakespeare asked: ``What's  in a name? A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet.'' He may  have been speaking about the flower, but, Mr. Speaker, he could very  easily have been talking about the One Big Beautiful Bill Act because  no matter what you call it, its impact is just as sweet.

I spent the last several weeks visiting factories and businesses of  all sizes in northeast Florida, visiting with constituents and  taxpayers about what they thought about the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,  and it made me ask: What should we call it?

Some say it should be called the peace through strength bill because  it modernizes America's military and ensures our Nation stands tall in  the face of global uncertainty. Others call it the border bill because  it finishes the wall, strengthens enforcement, and invests in the  infrastructure needed to restore order and integrity to our immigration  system. Some say it should be called the strengthening Medicaid bill  because it protects Medicaid for those who really need it most,  pregnant women, children, seniors, people with disabilities, and low- income families, by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse.

Mr. Speaker, I can't deny that a crowd favorite is calling it the  working families tax cut bill because it delivers the largest tax cut  in American history. It puts money back in the pockets of people who  need it most: people who rely on tips and overtime and people living on  Social Security. It lifts burdens off the backs of working parents,  retirees, and disabled veterans.

The truth is, Mr. Speaker, whatever name you choose, this bill will,  and is, launching the golden age of America because, as Shakespeare  reminded us, it is not the name that defines the value. It is the  action the bill takes, and this bill, by any name, is just as sweet.
