The First 100 Days


Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, is it true President Trump has done more in 100 days  than the previous President has done in 4 years?

Mr. Speaker, I have only got 60 seconds, but let's break it all down:  border closed; mass deportation of illegal immigrants; fentanyl  smuggling dropping; Laken Riley Act signed into law; inflation cooling;  egg prices down; gas prices falling; astronauts back home; 11 American  hostages freed; reducing the Federal bureaucracy, saving taxpayers  billions of dollars and rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse; reversing  the anti-crypto crusade; unleashing American energy; the green new scam  terminated; EV mandates eliminated; revoked DEI policies in the  military and government; affirming there are only two genders; no more  men playing in women's sports; restoring America's leadership on the  world stage; rebuilding our military; military recruitment up;  defending religious liberty; sending gang members back to their own  home countries; standing up for American workers; adding 345,000 new  jobs; securing billions of dollars in new investments in the United  States.

The golden age of American prosperity is indeed here. As exciting as  the first 100 days of President Trump have been, it is clear President  Trump is just getting started.
