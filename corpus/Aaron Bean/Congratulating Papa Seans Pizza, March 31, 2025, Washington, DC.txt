Congratulating Papa Seans Pizza

Mr. BEAN of Florida. Madam Speaker, yes, we are fired up for March  Madness in northeast Florida, and, no, I am not just talking about the  No. 1 seed Florida Gators basketball team. I am talking about Papa  Seans Pizza in Baldwin.

Papa Seans just sliced up the competition in a bracket-style  tournament held by radio station WQIK. Papa Seans beat out fellow  contestants to gain its ``One Shining Moment'' as the best pizza in the  Jacksonville area.

It is no surprise that Papa Seans knows how to whip up votes. Founder  Sean Lynch is the mayor of Baldwin.

I recently had some of Papa Seans' pizza while visiting Baldwin. Let  me tell you, no recount is needed, Madam Speaker. Papa Seans serves up  a superior slice.

It is an honor and testament to the hard work of the mayor and his  team, who have created not just a great place for food but a gathering  spot where neighbors become friends.

I congratulate Papa Seans. If you are ever near Baldwin, trust me,  Madam Speaker, stop in for a slice.
