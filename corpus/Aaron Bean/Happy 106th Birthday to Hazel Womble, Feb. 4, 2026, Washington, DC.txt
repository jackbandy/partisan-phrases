Happy 106th Birthday to Hazel Womble

Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, let's go back to the year 1919. We  had just 48 States. World War I had just ended but we called it the  Great War because we didn't know there was going to be another. Charlie  Chaplin had just released a short silent film called ``Sunnyside,''  before talking pictures would be all the rage. In this very Chamber,  the House voted to send the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to  vote, to the States for ratification.

Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 106th birthday of someone  born that year, an American hero named Hazel Womble of Jacksonville,  Florida, who is today one of our Nation's oldest living veterans. Here  she is surrounded by friends and family.

Born on Christmas Eve in 1919, Hazel would go on to serve her country  with extraordinary courage in World War II. Hazel enlisted in the Navy  Reserves and served as an operating room nurse at U.S. naval hospitals  from Portsmouth to Newport and even overseas in Bermuda.

In the darkest days of the war, she answered her country's call with  the steady hands and a nurse's calm demeanor, holding the line not with  a rifle but with a lifesaving skill and unwavering resolve.

She earned the World War II Victory Medal and the American Theater  Ribbon, continuing her service to our Nation until her medical  discharge in 1953.

At 106 years young, Hazel is not a page in our history book. She is a  living chapter of American courage. Her life reflects a generation  shaped by sacrifice, strengthened by service, and sustained by quiet  resolve.

Mr. Speaker, we honor Hazel Womble not only for the years she has  lived but the example she has set. Today, we celebrate an American who  continues to inspire us all more than a century after her journey  began. America is very proud of her.

Wishing Hazel a happy 106th birthday.
