Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support the AI for Main Street Act,  which would allow SBDCs to assist small business owners on how to  evaluate artificial intelligence. I commend Mr. Alford and Ms. Scholten  for working together on this bipartisan legislation.

AI has the potential to boost productivity, enhance customer service,  and save costs. While it is becoming increasingly common for small  businesses to use AI to streamline their operations, many still do not  know how to access it responsibly. If used incorrectly, AI could have  disastrous consequences.

That is why it is incredibly important for SBA and its  entrepreneurial ecosystem to help small businesses understand the  potential pitfalls and learn how to avoid them.

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support this bipartisan bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I commend the sponsors for working  together on this important legislation to provide small businesses with  the training they need.

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
