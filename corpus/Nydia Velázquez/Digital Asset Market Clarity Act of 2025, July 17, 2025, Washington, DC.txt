Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025


Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  bill. It is ironic we are debating a bill called the CLARITY Act when  it offers no clarity on one of the biggest issues in crypto, the  blatant conflicts of interest inside our own government.

Since returning to office, President Trump has turned the Presidency  into a crypto cash machine. It is now estimated that crypto makes up  the majority of Donald Trump's net worth.

Foreign investors, some under Federal investigation, are pouring  millions into these ventures, buying access, influence, and favorable  treatment.

So I ask: What are we doing here?

With this bill, not only are we continuing to allow President Trump  to issue his cryptocurrency, but we are allowing him and his cronies to  be in charge of the regulators overseeing that venture and compromising  the stability of capital markets in our country.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
