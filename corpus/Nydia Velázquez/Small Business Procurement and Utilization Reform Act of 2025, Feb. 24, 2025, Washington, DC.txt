Small Business Procurement and Utilization Reform Act of 2025


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1687940/small-business-procurement-and-utilization-reform-act-of-2025


Mr. Speaker, I commend Representatives Stauber and Cisneros for their  work to bring this important bipartisan legislation to the floor today.

Mr. Speaker, Congress and the executive branch have carefully crafted  fair and deliberate policies to ensure that small businesses can  compete for Federal contracts.

These policies, including and especially the small business  procurement goals and set-aside authorities, have leveled the playing  field for small businesses and enabled their participation in the  Federal marketplace. They have a proven record of success.

Federal agencies award a record amount of contracting dollars to  small businesses each year. However, many other factors, complexities,  and policies, like category management and overly strict past  performance requirements, are countering the impact of these programs.  As a result, the government has over 40 percent fewer small businesses  in its ecosystem than it did just a decade ago.

These trends mean that fewer small businesses are getting larger  contracts and that contracts are becoming out of reach for many small  businesses, especially those that are not already government  contractors.

This legislation is a productive step that will help break that  cycle. The SPUR Act will require SBA to take into account new small  business government contractors when grading a Federal agency's  performance toward meeting its small business goal.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work of my colleagues on  this bill, and I urge its adoption. I yield back the balance of my  time.
