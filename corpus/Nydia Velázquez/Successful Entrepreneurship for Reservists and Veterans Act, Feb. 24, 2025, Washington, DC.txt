Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 828, the Successful  Entrepreneurship for Reservists and Veterans Act, also known as the  SERV Act.

Veteran entrepreneurs are powerful economic engines and job creators.  More than 1.6 million veteran businessowners employ nearly 3.3 million  Americans and make approximately $983.9 billion in sales.

With that said, one of the biggest challenges facing veteran-owned  small businesses is access to capital. Servicemembers report that it  can be difficult to build credit while serving overseas. Studies have  shown that a higher percentage of veterans are turned down for loans.  The uncertainty underscores the need for investment in veteran-owned  small businesses.

The bill we are considering today would require the Government  Accountability Office, GAO, to conduct a study on the availability of  credit to veteran, service-disabled, and reserve-owned small  businesses.

I commend Representatives Davids, Alford, and Conaway for their  bipartisan work on this bill that will identify barriers and improve  SBA's outreach to veterans.

Ms. VELAZQUEZ.  Davids), the main sponsor of the bill.

Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Ms. Davids, Mr. Alford, and Mr.  Conaway for their commitment to our Nation's veterans. I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 828, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
