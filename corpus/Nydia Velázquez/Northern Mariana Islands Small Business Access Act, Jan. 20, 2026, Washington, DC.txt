Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3496, the Northern Mariana  Islands Small Business Access Act.

This is a straightforward but important bill that expands access to  SBA's microloan program to small businesses in the Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands.

These small businesses face unique challenges, as geographic  isolation leads to higher costs for goods and services. Their economy  is heavily reliant on tourism, which can ebb and flow with the economy  and natural disasters.

Having access to affordable credit gives small businesses the ability  to weather the storms and economic uncertainty and fully prepare for  the next opportunity.

The extension of the microloan program to CNMI will be critical to  support business growth, create jobs, and stimulate the local economy.

I have long supported efforts to ensure the territories have full  access to SBA products and services. In previous Congresses, I worked  with then-Representative Sablan to establish an SBDC center in CNMI,  and I also worked to ensure that CNMI had access to the microloan  program as part of a more comprehensive bill.

Unfortunately, the bill to improve the microloan program was not  enacted into law. I am glad to be working across the aisle again to  make sure territories receive full access to SBA services.

Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this important bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
