Wosb Accountability Act

Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, in 1994, Congress established a goal of  awarding 5 percent of Federal contracting dollars to women-owned small  businesses. Recognizing the obstacles that female entrepreneurs faced  when entering and competing in the Federal marketplace, Congress  identified this goal as an uphill battle. Three decades later, we can  see how much of an understatement that was and how much more work has  to be done.

Empowering female entrepreneurs has long been a top priority of mine.  In 2000, to give women-owned firms a boost and incentivize agencies to  bring in more WOSBs to compete for contracts, I wrote the law and  created the WOSB program.

Today, many women-owned firms are critical partners to Federal  agencies as a result of that law, yet the WOSB goal has been met only  twice, and women-owned firms are not seeing the contracting  opportunities that should accompany their level of participation in the  market. We need to again provide a boost to the WOSB program and  encourage more competition and success for WOSB firms.

My legislation that we are considering today will move more firms  through the SBA's certification process so Federal agencies have a  larger pool of companies that can trigger WOSB competitions.

Mr. Speaker, it will further protect the integrity of the program. We  want to ensure that women-owned firms are who they say they are because  that is who the program is designed to empower.

We expect that contracting officers will have more confidence working  with WOSBs, knowing that the SBA has already verified them.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill.
