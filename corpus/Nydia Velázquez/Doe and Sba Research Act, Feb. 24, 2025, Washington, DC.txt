I rise today in support of H.R. 788, the DOE and SBA Research Act.  This legislation would allow SBA and the Department of Energy to enter  into an MOU to formalize the research and development activities that  are currently underway.

The Department of Energy has 17 national labs that play a crucial  role in fostering innovation and driving small business growth. The  labs form partnerships with small businesses so that they can leverage  the expertise of DOE's scientists and also gain access to world-class  labs to test new products. They also foster networking opportunities  that enable small businesses to connect, collaborate, and expand their  base.

These types of partnerships are critical to increasing small business  innovation, providing high-paying jobs for Americans, and ensuring our  country remains competitive. I applaud Mr. LaLota, Dr. Morrison, and  Mr. Thanedar for their bipartisan work.

Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsors of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
