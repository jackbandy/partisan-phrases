Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, On January 5th, our dear  friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa, passed away unexpectedly at the age  of 65. A lifelong resident of Northern California, Doug was a fierce  fighter for the people he represented and for his state's vast and  beautiful natural resources.

Representing one of California's largest districts, Doug never  hesitated to drive hundreds of miles to meet a handful of constituents.  He drew no distinctions between those living in the more remote corners  of his district and those in the big city. Doug believed everyone  deserved to have their representation and voice heard in Congress. It's  that spirit of duty and selfless service that made him so admired among  his friends and colleagues, and which made him one of the most  respected people in this institution.

Doug became a close friend of mine during my tenure as Vice Chairman  of the House Republican Conference, where my weekly responsibility was  to recruit other Members to help me amplify the House Republican  message on the House Floor. Even in late night sessions and on days  when others had left town early, Doug was always faithful to show up,  eager to speak to the greatness of this country and about our tireless  work to improve the lives of the people he represented. For that  commitment, his kindness, his optimism and faith, and his sense of  humor, I and all of my many Republican colleagues will miss Doug  dearly. He was in every sense a giant among us.
