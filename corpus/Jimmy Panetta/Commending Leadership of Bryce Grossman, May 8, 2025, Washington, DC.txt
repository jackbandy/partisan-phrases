Commending Leadership of Bryce Grossman


Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend students across  California's 19th Congressional District who participate in the Day of  Silence. This is a day in which we highlight discrimination and  harassment of LGBTQ students in our schools all across the country.

This year, I will feature the leadership of Bryce Grossman, an eighth  grader from Santa Cruz, who founded and is organizing the We Will Not  Be Erased walk on May 13, a demonstration to defend and remind us about  the rights of the LGBTQ community.

With encouragement from their parents, Amy and Kevin, Bryce is  furthering our democracy by stepping up and speaking up. As Bryce said:  ``We will be loud. We will be proud--for our rights, for our families,  and for our LGBTQ community.''

Mr. Speaker, the actions of Bryce and all students and allies on the  Day of Silence demonstrate that our youth understand that when we  engage, that is how we endure as a community, as a country, and, most  importantly, as a democracy based on liberty, justice, and equality for  all.
