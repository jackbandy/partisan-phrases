Housing is A Human Right

Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I recognize the 40th anniversary of the  Saka Nakodar massacre where four unarmed Sikh students, Ravinder Singh,  Jhilman Singh, Harminder Singh, and Baldhir Singh Multani, were shot  and killed while peacefully protesting the desecration of the sacred  Scripture of Sikhs.

The killing, which took place in the Punjab region of India on  February 4, 1986, was absolutely abhorrent, but the investigation was  definitely deplorable.

The victims' bodies were disposed of in secret. No perpetrator was  ever brought to justice, and reports, commissions, and other inquiries  on the massacre received absolutely no action.

The Saka Nakodar massacre continues to be a dark day for Sikhs in  Punjab but also for Sikhs right here in America.

That is why I recognize the Saka Nakodar massacre and the justice  that awaits not just for the four students and their families but for  the Sikh communities at home and abroad.
