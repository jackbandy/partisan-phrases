Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, the military intervention in Venezuela left  us with uncertainty, instability, and insecurity. As a veteran, I  commend the military operation to remove Maduro on January 3, but as an  American, it left uncertainty for the day after. By replacing one  despot with another, we are uncertain as to the government, to the oil,  to the cartels, and to the future of democracy in Venezuela.

This type of military adventurism can also create instability not  just in Venezuela, but in the region, and that creates insecurity for  the United States.

As we saw this week about Greenland, the President wants spheres of  influence rather than stability from a rules-based order. Instead of  standing up to China and Russia, the President just wants to impress  them by acting like them, rather than being better than them.

That is what happens when we have a President that doesn't just want  his own sphere of influence, he wants his own sphere of governance,  especially when it comes to putting boots on the ground.

This War Powers Resolution would not only prevent that in Venezuela  without further congressional approval, it will also demonstrate that  this Congress can actually act like a coequal branch of government and  fulfill our responsibilities under the United States Constitution.
