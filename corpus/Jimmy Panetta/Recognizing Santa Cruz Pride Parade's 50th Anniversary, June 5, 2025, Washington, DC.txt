Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 50th anniversary of  the Santa Cruz Pride Parade, one of the oldest Pride events in the  Nation and the first of any small American city.

Since 1975, Santa Cruz Pride embodies the spirit of resistance and  persistence. Even though it was California, back then, it was just a  small gathering of a few brave and determined people standing in  solidarity.

Today, as we saw this past weekend, Santa Cruz Pride is a multiday,  community-wide event that brings together thousands for a celebration  of Pride.

As we celebrate, we also appreciate and commemorate that we stand on  the shoulders of those who got us here. It is with that realization  that we are reinvigorated in our push for equal rights.

We in Santa Cruz and throughout the 19th Congressional District of  California understand that Pride is more than just flags and parades.  It is also about creating policies, putting in place protections, and  the persistence of a community to achieve equality.

Yes, we are proud of the past 50 years of Santa Cruz Pride, but we  are also determined now more than ever to continue our march forward.
