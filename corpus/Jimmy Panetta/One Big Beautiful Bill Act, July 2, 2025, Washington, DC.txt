One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, this partisan tax bill will be our Nation's  single-largest self-inflicted wound to working families and our  economy.

It is the largest unfunded tax break for the wealthiest families and  will lead to the largest number of working families losing healthcare.  What is worse is that you are fooling yourselves into believing it is  paid for. Instead, it adds trillions to our debt that will drag down  our economy and our credibility.

Rather than negotiating with Democrats, Republicans are just  placating the President.

I am voting ``no,'' Mr. Speaker, on this partisan bill to stand up to  the President, to stand with working families, and to stand for the  financial stability of our country and the credibility of this  institution.
