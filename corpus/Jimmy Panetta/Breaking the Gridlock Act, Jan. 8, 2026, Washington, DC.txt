Breaking the Gridlock Act


Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, for the past year we have been talking  about the damage done by not extending tax credits for the Affordable  Care Act. Now this year, no longer is it theory. It is fact. It is no  longer talk. It is pain.

The fact is 20 million people are feeling the pain with their  healthcare costs going up. Millions more are losing health insurance.  In my district, tens of thousands are going to be paying more for  healthcare.

Today, the fact is that we can do our jobs and, rather than take  healthcare away, we can actually help fix it. I commend all of my  Democratic colleagues and, yes, even a few on the Republican side that  signed the discharge petition and will vote for this bill today, a day  in a week that has been absolutely hectic.

Rather than constantly responding to the craziness from this  administration, by voting ``yes,'' Congress can finally focus on the  substance of fixing healthcare. The fact is this bill is a short-term  fix for extending tax credits. It is also a vehicle for our Senate  colleagues to use so that we in Congress can provide a long-term fix to  provide people with affordable and accessible healthcare.
