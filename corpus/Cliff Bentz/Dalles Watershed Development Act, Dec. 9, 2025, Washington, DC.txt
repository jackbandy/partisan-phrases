Dalles Watershed Development Act

Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation,  H.R. 655, the Dalles Watershed Development Act.

The City of The Dalles, located in my district, depends on its  municipal watershed for almost all of its supply of drinking water.  Protecting and managing this watershed is vital to the health, safety,  and future of The Dalles community.

Today, that task is complicated by the fact that critical  infrastructure, the Crow Creek Reservoir and the surrounding timbered  area, is located on both City-owned and federally managed Forest  Service lands.

The City operates these facilities under a special use permit, which  is inefficient and costly and limits the City's ability to  expeditiously expand and modernize this water supply.

The City of The Dalles is a growing City. It is an important City,  and it is one that deserves this kind of help and attention. I am happy  to bring this bill to achieve this purpose.

This bill offers a practical solution by transferring 150 acres of  Forest Service land within the watershed of the City into the City's  ownership. This transfer will allow the City of The Dalles to  officially upgrade the Crow Creek Dam, increase its reservoir capacity  by 2,100 acre-feet, eliminate the need for ongoing special use permits  with Forest Service, and allow implementation of a comprehensive  watershed management strategy. We would also save tens of thousands of  dollars in administrative costs for both the City and the Forest  Service.

Mr. Speaker, this is a narrowly tailored, community-driven proposal  that directly supports clean water, public safety, economic growth, and  good government.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Westerman and the members of the committee  for their support of this bill, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 655.
