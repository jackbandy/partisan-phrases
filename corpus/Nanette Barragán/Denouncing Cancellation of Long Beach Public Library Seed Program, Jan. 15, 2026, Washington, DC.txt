Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration continues to take  away access to STEM education from students across the country,  including hundreds of middle school students in my district.

For years, the Long Beach Public Library's Youth SEED program  delivered hundreds of workshops in science, technology, engineering,  and math to students in Long Beach, California.

Educators, mentors, and community partners in these programs spark  students' curiosity and help them build real-world skills. It is a  place where students dream of developing the next cure or the latest  cutting-edge technology.

These funding cuts mean less investments in American innovation, less  opportunities for kids to pursue STEM careers, and less investment in  the next generation.

Don't cut programs like SEED. Expand them so every child has a fair  chance to thrive and excel.
