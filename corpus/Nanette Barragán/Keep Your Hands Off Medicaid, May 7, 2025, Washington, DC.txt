Keep Your Hands Off Medicaid

Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, don't believe the lies. House Republicans  are trying to pass a budget that kicks people off healthcare.

Today, the Congressional Budget Office released an analysis that  Republicans' proposals that they are considering would slash Medicaid  spending that would lead to millions of people losing healthcare  coverage.

Behind every Medicaid recipient is a person whose life depends on it.

Brian Gutierrez, a constituent from South Gate, California, lives  with spina bifida, a lifelong disability. He says: For many of us,  these cuts are not abstract numbers. They are the difference between  stability and crisis, between life and death. I am healthy today  because Medicaid stood by me. I am thriving because I have had  consistent, reliable access to the care I need.

Medicaid makes independence possible. It makes survival possible. It  makes dignity possible. Any threat to Medicaid is a threat to our  lives.

The Republican budget is a threat to millions of lives. That is why  House Democrats are fighting to protect Medicaid.

Please, keep your hands off Medicaid.
