Millionaires' Tax Breaks in Big, Ugly Bill

Ms. BARRAGAN. Madam Speaker, I rise because Donald Trump and House  Republicans lied to Americans when they promised to lower costs.

Now, they are even trying to rebrand their so-called big, beautiful  bill with a new name about working families. No matter what label they  slap on it, the facts don't change. Trump and Republicans' big, ugly  law makes the cost of healthcare go up and takes away healthcare from  working families.

Republicans hand out an average of $80,000 in tax breaks to every  millionaire. Where do they get this money from? Each millionaire tax  cut is paid for by taking away insurance from four people. Republicans  are stealing from the American people to fund these tax cuts.

What does it mean when four people lose their coverage? It means a  mom with diabetes may have to skip her insulin or a dad ignores chest  pains because he can't afford the ER visit. It means your child missing  their asthma treatments and struggling to breathe in class. These are  real lives on the line.

Overall, the big, ugly bill will take away healthcare coverage from  16 million people. When people lose coverage, they get sicker, there  are longer wait times, hospital visits rise, and costs skyrocket for  families and the entire system.

House Democrats are fighting for a different vision. We are fighting  to make sure that if you work hard, you and your family should have  healthcare and should be able to afford to see a doctor, fill a  prescription, and get the care you need without going bankrupt.

While Republicans protect tax breaks for billionaires, Democrats are  working to protect affordable coverage, lower prescription drug costs,  and expand access to healthcare for working families because in our  America, healthcare is not a privilege for the wealthy few. It is a  right for every American.
