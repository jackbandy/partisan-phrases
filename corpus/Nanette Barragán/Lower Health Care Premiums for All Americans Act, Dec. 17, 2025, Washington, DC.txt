Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, Americans should run away as far and as  fast as they can from Republicans' last-minute mess of a healthcare  plan.

Under the Republicans' plan, millions of Americans will not be able  to afford health insurance because Republicans don't provide money for  Americans to pay for the healthcare under the Affordable Care Act.

Americans don't have an extra $1,000 or $2,000 in their pockets every  month to pay for health insurance. They shouldn't have to choose  between being able to afford a doctor's visit or feeding their family.

House Democrats' discharge petition will extend the tax credits that  lower costs and help Americans buy health insurance. Mr. Speaker, four  Republicans just joined our efforts. We welcome more.

Speaker Johnson should bring the bill to the floor immediately. Don't  send Congress on holiday without making sure that we protect healthcare  for over 20 million Americans.
