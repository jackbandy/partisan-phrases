Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I oppose H.J. Res. 24 and H.J. Res. 75  because these resolutions roll back common-sense energy efficiency  standards for commercial refrigerators, freezers, and walk-in coolers-- standards that were rigorously developed by the Department of Energy  (DOE) to save businesses money while cutting energy waste. These  updated regulations are technologically feasible, economically  justified, and essential for reducing long-term costs for small  businesses like restaurants, grocery stores, and convenience  stores. The DOE estimates that businesses using these appliances would  save over $11 billion in energy costs over the next 30 years--savings  that would go back into local economies. I urged the Biden  administration to finalize these rules last Congress, and I remain  committed to protecting energy efficiency initiatives that reduce costs  and pollution.
