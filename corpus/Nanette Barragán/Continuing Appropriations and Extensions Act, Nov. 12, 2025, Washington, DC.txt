Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026

Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the Republican spending bill that  makes healthcare more expensive for hardworking Americans.

While Republicans were on their 7-plus week vacation, all of our  constituents were receiving notices of premium increases. A constituent  of mine, a lifelong educator, has been told that her premiums will jump  from $383 to nearly $1,000.

Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans can find money for a fancy ballroom.  They can give tax breaks to billionaires. They even included millions  of dollars in cash payments in this bill for eight Republican Senators.  If anyone else in government gave themselves millions in taxpayer  money, they would go to prison. For Americans trying to afford  healthcare? Not $1 in tax credits.

House Democrats are united against this corrupt bill and will keep  fighting to protect America's healthcare.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill.
