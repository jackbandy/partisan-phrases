Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R.  3898.

Clean water used to be something we all agreed upon. The Clean Water  Act was originally passed by an overwhelmingly bipartisan majority  because we understood that clean water is not a luxury. It is really a  basic right. Now, Republicans in this Chamber are doing everything they  can to roll back and repeal what is left of the Clean Water Act.

Among the many disastrous provisions in this bill, the PERMIT Act  would give President Trump the authority to declare any body of water  exempt from Clean Water Act protections. It is just a stunning betrayal  of the American people.

Outside these walls, Americans overwhelmingly support the Clean Water  Act. Survey after survey has found that Americans believe the  government should do more to protect our lakes, rivers, and streams,  not less.

This should not be a hard vote. I urge my colleagues to protect clean  water and urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 3898.
