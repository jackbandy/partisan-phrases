Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, today we will vote on the Destroying  Unnecessary, Misaligned, and Prohibitive (DUMP) Red Tape Act, which  would require the SBA's Office of Advocacy to codify a Red Tape Hotline  to receive submissions on burdensome regulations and to report on those  submissions. I will vote ``no'' because this bill is redundant--there  is already a hotline in place for reporting red tape. Rather than  improving the process, this bill would create an unnecessary layer of  bureaucracy that would hinder, not help, the ongoing work of the SBA's  Office of Advocacy.
