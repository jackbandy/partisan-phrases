Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families

Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the impacts of Republicans'  big, bad bill.

I don't want us to forget that healthcare is a matter of life and  death, and the proposed Medicaid cuts are a death sentence for people  like Jessica, who lives in my district.

Jessica fled an abusive relationship when she was 25. Then she found  out she was pregnant. Only through Medicaid, Jessica was able to access  prenatal care.

Then, late in her pregnancy, her doctor discovered a knotted  umbilical cord. She was rushed into surgery. Thankfully, Jessica gave  birth to a healthy baby.

Without Medicaid, Jessica might not be a mom today. She and her  daughter might not have survived. These massive cuts will force  hospitals and birthing facilities to close. That means that no one has  a safe place to give birth.

The result is a tragic domino effect for moms and kids.
