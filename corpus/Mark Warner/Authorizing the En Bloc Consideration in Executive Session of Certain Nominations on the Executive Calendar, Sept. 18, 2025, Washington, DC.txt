Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I don't normally come to the floor to give  somewhat lengthy remarks, but today I am doing so because of a deep  and, frankly, rising concern for the future of our intelligence  community and, in turn, the security of the United States.

For months now, we have watched President Trump's administration, led  in this arena by his handpicked Director of National Intelligence Ms.  Gabbard, systemically undermine the men and women whose mission is to  keep this country safe. These are professionals who serve under  Republican and Democratic administrations alike. They are career  officials who put duty before politics, who swear an oath not to any  President but to the Constitution of the United States.

Yet as this administration fires and denigrates these very men and  women, as expertise that takes literally decades to build is being  thrown away as it conflicts with political talking points, as  assessments grounded in fact are being shelved in favor of conspiracy  theories, our adversaries are conspiring, sharing intelligence and  military capabilities and strategizing over how to weaken the United  States while advancing a very different authoritarian vision for the  world.

At the same time, I fear the integrity of our intelligence is being  sacrificed on the altar of partisan convenience.

This is not some kind of inside-the-beltway turf battle, and it is  not another partisan disagreement. I believe at stake is something much  more fundamental: whether America will continue to have an intelligence  community free to speak truth to power or whether political pressure  will blind us to the very real threats our Nation faces.

(Mr. BUDD assumed the Chair.)

History shows us what happens when intelligence is ignored,  manipulated, or kept from those who need it most. In 1941, the U.S.  Navy intercepted communications showing that Japan was planning to  attack Pearl Harbor. That knowledge ended up being of little use  because it was not communicated to the people who could have taken  action to protect the fleet. The result was the devastating surprise  that cost thousands of American lives.

In the aftermath, Congress resolved that we could never again afford  to be blindsided. So in 1947, in a bipartisan way, Congress created the  Central Intelligence Agency, the modern Department of Defense, and  other institutions to ensure that unfiltered, unbiased intelligence is  provided to the President, to Congress, and to our military. These  institutions are meant to protect us from surprises and to give  policymakers the truth, even when it is inconvenient or uncomfortable.

Now, for the most part, this system has worked, and all of us who  work up here know it has never been perfect. The abuses revealed by the  Church Committee in the 1970s made clear why strong congressional  oversight is essential. That is why the Senate Intelligence Committee  was established in 1976 and our House counterpart the following year.

Today, while not flawless, these committees--of which I know the  Presiding Officer is a member--remain the best check we have to ensure  that intelligence Agencies uphold American values and laws and avoid  repeating past mistakes--and hopefully learning from them when they do  occur. Even with our modern system of congressional oversight, we have  seen tragic failures. Intelligence failed to predict the collapse of  the Soviet Union. We failed to connect the dots before 9/11. And  perhaps most foreboding, in the runup to the Iraq war, intelligence was  distorted to fit policy preferences. Intelligence about weapons of mass  destruction and Saddam Hussein's ties to al-Qaida were inflated and  cherry-picked. Analysts who even at that time raised doubts were  ignored.

The result was a devastating war in Iraq, fought under false  pretenses, that cost literally thousands of American servicemembers  their lives and limbs. But we learned from those failures.

After the September 11 attacks, Congress placed additional safeguards  and created a new position: the Director of National Intelligence. The  objective was to better coordinate our intelligence Agencies, to avoid  the so-called  groupthink, to remove silos amongst our now 18, 19 intelligence  Agencies, and to ensure that analysts could provide thorough, candid  assessments--again, even when the truth was uncomfortable or unwelcome.

That was the commitment I asked President Trump's nominee and the  current Director of National Intelligence, Ms. Gabbard, to make during  her confirmation hearing, and she assured our committee and the  American people that she would protect the independence of the  intelligence community to ensure that the IC is never politicized. She  even pointed to the runup to the war in Iraq as the clearest example of  what happens when intelligence is bent to fit policy and the President  is told only what he wants to hear. She pledged that she would never  allow those mistakes to be repeated on her watch.

Mr. President, but in only 6 months, we have seen the opposite from  this administration. We have seen career FBI agents, people who have  risked their lives for this country, forced out of their positions  simply for investigating crimes committed in the January 6  insurrection. These were professionals following the law, performing  their sworn duties, and yet their service was treated as disloyalty.  Careers were ended and decades of expertise were discarded just for  doing the job they were entrusted to do.

We have seen the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the National  Intelligence Council dismissed because their well-documented, evidence- based assessment of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua criminal network did  not align with the administration's preferred narrative. These analysts  presented carefully sourced intelligence showing that the gang of bad  guys acted, actually, independent of the Venezuelan Government, not at  the behest of foreign officials. Yet their findings were rejected and  their leadership positions removed simply because the truth didn't fit  a politically convenient story.

And again, to be clear, there is no question that Maduro's regime in  Venezuela and the TDA are ruthless actors who pose real threats, but  punishing officials--punishing intelligence officials in particular-- for telling the truth only weakens our ability to confront them.

We have seen the three-star general leading the Defense Intelligence  Agency pushed out after analysts produced a straightforward, evidence- based assessment showing that Iran's nuclear program had not been  obliterated, as President Trump so loudly claimed. Rather than face  those facts, the administration decided to punish the messenger, and he  was let go from DIA.

We have seen, more recently, analysts, literally with decades of  experience on Russia, stripped of their security clearances or  reassigned at the very moment that their years of expertise is needed  most.

More recently, DNI Gabbard has personally revoked the clearances of  at least 37 individuals in a transparently political act of vengeance  in a single stroke of a pen and, at least in one case, exposing an  official working undercover. That alone--putting someone who has  worked undercover and identifying that identity--in past  administrations would have been grounds for firing.

We have seen statutory requirements to keep Congress fully and  currently informed ignored, oversight stymied and obstructed, and  inspectors general who are supposed to keep their eyes on these  Agencies--inspectors general and their personnel silenced, forced out,  or removed.

And I remind my colleagues, in terms of oversight for the  intelligence community, that is not a right that all 100 Senators have.  There are literally 17 of us. As chair or vice chair over the last few  years, I am part of the so-called Gang of 8. If we don't do our jobs,  nobody is watching all of these intelligence Agencies.

Even more damaging, we have seen highly sensitive intelligence  declassified and released, clearly for political purposes, without  proper coordination with the Agencies responsible for protecting  sources and methods--that is how we do our work and who are the people  involved. The disclosures actually risked revealing the identities of  assets--and those are human beings--and the techniques we rely on-- those are the technology and skills we have--and the credibility of  ongoing operations, all for the sake of advancing a political  narrative. The very tools that protect lives and maintain America's  strategic advantage are being treated as leverage in a partisan game.

Let's remember, the so-called Russia hoax and that assessment, which  this administration continues to disparage, was a coordinated,  unanimous finding by the entire intelligence community. Our committee-- on a bipartisan, unanimous basis--reviewed it and validated it  extensively. Not a single one of my Republican colleagues objected to  its findings, including the current Secretary of State, then-committee  chairman Senator Rubio.

And what did that assessment actually conclude? I think every one of  us understood that Russia conducted a sweeping, systematic campaign to  interfere in our 2016 election; that Moscow's goal was to sow chaos, to  undermine faith in American democracy, and specifically to boost Mr.  Trump's candidacy. These findings were not partisan talking points;  they were sober judgments of career professionals, backed by evidence,  and affirmed by both parties in Congress.

And during the first Trump administration, they responded to that  report appropriately and put resources to make sure the 2020 election  was the safest election on record. Kudos to the first Trump  administration in doing that.

But with all of this happening, as troubling as all of this is, what  may be most astonishing is who seems to be calling the shots now: not  seasoned national security leaders, not career intelligence  professionals, but conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, a figure who has  called the 9/11 terrorist attacks an inside job, who described herself  as a ``pro-White nationalist'' and a ``proud Islamophobe,'' and who has  made openly racist and anti-Muslim statements. This is not someone with  even a shred of credibility, let alone the experience or judgment we  should demand from those influencing U.S. national security decisions.

Yet, time and again, we have seen senior officials pushed out of  their posts because Ms. Loomer decided they were not sufficiently loyal  to the President. National Security Council staffers, people well-known  and respected on both sides of the aisle, including staffers who worked  for my Republican colleagues in the Senate, were shown the door at her  demand; the two top officials at the National Security Agency,  including a well-respected four-star general, Timothy Haugh, forced  out, along with the Agency's general counsel, again at Loomer's behest.

These are critical posts in one of our most important intelligence  organizations, vacated not because of misconduct or failure but because  of the whims of a political provocateur whose public record is filled  with hate and conspiracies. And don't take my word on these actions.  Ms. Loomer's own social media feed claims all of these firings and  dismissals almost as trophies.

And just a few weeks ago we saw something that I believe should  trouble every Member of this body, regardless of which party you belong  to. My staff and I had arranged a visit to the National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency located in my State of Virginia so that I could go  ahead and do my constitutional duty of oversight and, in that meeting,  meet with intelligence professionals who also happened to be my  constituents. Yet, at the last minute, that visit was blocked--again-- and apparently, as she claimed, by Laura Loomer.

What does it say about the state of our national security when a  self-proclaimed White nationalist and Islamophobe with a personal  vendetta against U.S. Government officials--and, by the way, no  security clearance, no sworn duty to defend the Constitution--can  dictate who serves in critical intelligence positions and even prevent  Members of this Chamber from conducting basic oversight?

I have to ask again: Why is this administration going to war against  the very professionals sworn to keep our country safe? Why are decades  of service and sacrifice being tossed aside?

Why? Because they think they are still obliged to provide the truth  and speak truth to power. But, instead, it appears that sometimes those  truths  are inconvenient because sometimes their assessments are not what the  DNI and the President want to hear.

These safeguards we put in place and the oversight this body  provides--again, only 17 of us have seen these classified programs-- these safeguards only work if intelligence officers know that they can  tell the truth without losing their jobs. If analysts who analyze the  facts and try to come up with conclusions believe their careers will be  destroyed for offering inconvenient assessments, then we will only get  intelligence the White House wants.

Imagine the consequences if our intelligence community is forced to  spend its time chasing down conspiracy theories instead of monitoring  terrorist networks, cyber threats, or foreign adversaries. Imagine if  analysts stop flagging real dangers because they fear political  retaliation. Imagine if experienced officers walk away from service  altogether because they know their expertise will be diminished or  punished. That kind of environment doesn't just weaken our intelligence  community, it puts every American family at risk.

Again, this is not some kind of partisan point. Democrats and  Republicans alike have relied on the intelligence community to keep the  country safe. Every President, whether they liked what they were  hearing or not, has depended on accurate, independent analysis to make  decisions that affect millions of lives.

That is what makes this current moment so alarming. We are  dismantling trust in institutions that literally took generations to  build. We are eroding morale among some of the most dedicated  professionals in public service. And I fear that we are sending a clear  message to young officers, whether they are at the CIA or any of the  other intelligence Agencies: Don't bother building a career in  intelligence if you plan on telling the truth.

Meanwhile, these aren't actions in a vacuum. Our adversaries aren't  slowing down. Cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, nuclear  proliferation, terrorist attacks, transnational criminal  organizations--these threats are real, and they are not going to wait  for us to get our house in order.

If we continue to allow politics to dictate what intelligence is  acceptable, we are effectively flying blind. That is why, again, I urge  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Please, for God's sake, take  this seriously. We can disagree about policy, but we cannot allow the  facts themselves to be corrupted.

The intelligence community must remain independent, professional, and  committed to the Constitution above all else.

I have had the opportunity in my tenure on this committee to work  with a lot of these men and women. I didn't know many of them before I  was on the Intelligence Committee. They are dedicated professionals. I  never asked a single one what their party affiliation was. They  oftentimes put their lives in harm's way and, candidly, never get the  attention that our military does. They work in secret.

The truth is, these professionals and the work they do deserve to be  respected, honored, and listened to because if you corrupt the  intelligence and bend it to political wills, we have seen constant  examples of what happens.

The truth is, the American people deserve nothing less.
