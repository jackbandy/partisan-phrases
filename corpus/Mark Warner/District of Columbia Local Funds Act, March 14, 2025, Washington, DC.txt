Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I also want to thank my dear friend from  Maine. She is moving back up much higher on all of our lists for being  willing to step up and help correct this.

You know, we all want what the President wants. The President wants  our Nation's Capital to be the safest, cleanest, most welcoming city.  DC gets 26 million tourists every year. In 2026, we are going to  celebrate 250 years. We want to show off DC and the whole region. If we  allow this mistake to take place, DC will lay off cops. It will close  schools. It will shut down our trash removal. For those of us in the  region who use the Metro, there will be dramatic cutbacks.

Let's correct this mistake. Let's make sure that we show on our 250th  anniversary the cleanest, safest city in America. This will be a giant  step toward that.
