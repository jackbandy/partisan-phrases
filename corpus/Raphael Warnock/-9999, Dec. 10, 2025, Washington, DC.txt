I can tell you that as I move across the State of Georgia, which is a  non-expansion State, much like Texas, people are trying to figure out  how they are going to keep their healthcare.

In about a month, folks will see their healthcare premiums double, on  average. For some, it will triple. For others, it will quadruple.  People will lose their healthcare, and some people will die as a result  of that.

A healthcare policy in general is a matter of life and death. We have  seen the Republicans through their ``Big Ugly Bill'' cut $1 trillion  out of Medicaid, and 15 million people lost their  healthcare. Now 22 million people are going to see their healthcare  double, on average. That is the problem we are confronting right now.

I have not heard a solution from that side of the aisle about how to  fix that.

It is particularly harmful for nonexpansion States. Some may  reasonably ask: Why these zero-dollar premiums? Georgia, like Kansas,  is a nonexpansion State. The truth is, a lot of these folks who have  the zero-dollar premium plans, they would have zero dollars if they  were in an expansion State.

So for me, it is a matter of fairness. I am standing up for the  people in my State of Georgia. There are 500,000 Georgians in the  healthcare coverage cap. If they lived in California, if they lived in  New York, if they lived in North Carolina, they would be covered.
