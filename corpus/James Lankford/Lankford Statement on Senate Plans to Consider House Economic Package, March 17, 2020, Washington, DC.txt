Lankford Statement on Senate Plans to Consider House Economic Package


Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today issued a statement following an announcement by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on plans to vote on the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which the House passed late last Friday:

"This morning, the Senate received the House-passed economic package to address the financial impacts of the coronavirus outbreak, after holding the bill over the weekend to fix a number of errors from putting the text together so quickly last week. There are good ideas in the bill that address SNAP benefits, unemployment insurance, and how we can quickly respond and help our most vulnerable in a time of need. 

"As the economy struggles and Americans are rightly concerned, we must act with expediency. However, I'm also reminded of the Hippocratic oath in these seasons--first do no harm. When Americans and our communities experience real pain, whatever we do should not make things worse for families and employment opportunities in the future. I will consider all legislative proposals through this lens. I am confident the Senate will work together to help Americans who need rapid and effective action."
