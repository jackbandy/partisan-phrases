USMCA Heads to President's Desk


Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today voted in support of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which, with its passage in the Senate in a bipartisan vote of 89 to 10, finally sends the agreement to update North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to the President's desk. Lankford recently supported the USMCA when it was considered and passed on January 7th in the Senate Finance Committee and on January 14th when it passed the Senate Appropriations Committee. Lankford also highlighted the USMCA's benefits to Oklahoma in a speech on the Senate floor on January 9.

"Oklahoma agriculture, manufacturing, and supply chains will all benefit from the revised trade agreement with Mexico and Canada," said Lankford. "This agreement will help Oklahoma consumers, workers, and businesses. I am grateful the Senate was able to bring the USMCA across the finish line today after the Trump Administration successfully negotiated a significant update to NAFTA. The final product benefits Oklahoma agriculture, Oklahoma manufacturing, and the intellectual property of Oklahomans and all Americans. We should continue to improve our trade relationships and agreements around the world and ensure US interests remain at the forefront of our negotiations."

Lankford has been actively engaged with US Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer and his team to address concerns and ensure Oklahoma voices were heard in the negotiations. Beginning in May 2018, Lankford joined a letter to USTR Lighthizer to urge him to consult with Congress to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) into what would become the USMCA. In July 2018 and June 2019, Lankford questioned USTR Lighthizer in Senate Finance Committee hearings to further consider the USMCA. Lankford also recorded two episodes (Episodes 2 and 8) of his podcast, The Breakdown with James Lankford, covering trade negotiations and the USMCA.
