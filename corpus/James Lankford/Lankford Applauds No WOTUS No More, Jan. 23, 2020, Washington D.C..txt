Lankford Applauds No WOTUS No More


Senator James Lankford issued the following statement to applaud the Trump Administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Navigable Waters Protection Rule. This rule replaces the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, which removes burdensome regulation from America's farmers, ranchers, and landowners:

"Oklahomans want clean, safe water in our rivers, lakes, and streams. Unfortunately, previous administrations used an extreme interpretation of the Waters of the United States rule which significantly impacted how farmers, ranchers, and developers could use their land, and how much money and time they had to spend to get an answer of what is permissible under the onerous rule," said Lankford. "The Trump Administration has finally provided clarity and certainty with the new Navigable Waters Protection rule that will allow landowners, farmers, ranchers, and developers to put their resources in their community, not fighting a federal agency."

 Background:

In 2015, Lankford and Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) sent a letter to the EPA to seek further clarification regarding compliance for the WOTUS rule, and Lankford was a cosponsor of a Senate resolution to nullify the expanded WOTUS definition. He also voted for a resolution of disapproval of the EPA's WOTUS rule in November 2015. In 2017, Lankford applauded an Executive Order issued by President Trump that required the EPA and other applicable departments to review the WOTUS rule, ensure it promotes economic growth and minimizes regulatory uncertainty.
