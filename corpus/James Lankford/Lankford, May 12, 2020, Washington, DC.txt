Lankford, Rosen Statement Condemning News of Anti-Semitism in Ukraine


Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV), co-chairs of the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism, released the following statement in response to reports that a senior Ukrainian police officer requested a list of all Jewish residents in the city of Kolomyya, including their personal information.

"As co-chairs of the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism and strong supporters of the US-Ukraine bilateral relationship, we are gravely concerned by reports that a high-ranking Ukrainian police official requested a list of all Jews in the city of Kolomyya as part of an inquiry into organized crime," said the Senators. "Targeting an entire Jewish community is an ugly manifestation of anti-Semitism and evokes darker times when European Jews were forced to register their personal information. We urge the Government of Ukraine to  investigate this incident, hold those responsible accountable, and recommit to joining us in countering anti-Semitism in all its forms."

Last October, Lankford and Rosen launched the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism.
