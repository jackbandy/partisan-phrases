Senator Lankford Statement on Death of Iranian General Soleimani


Senator James Lankford (R-OK) issued the following statement regarding an operation that killed Iranian General Soleimani:

"For years, the Iranian regime has pursued a reckless strategy of intimidation, fear, and aggression. Its acts of terrorism have destabilized the entire Middle East. As the leader of the Quds Force, General Soleimani has personally been responsible for killing US military and allied forces in Iraq, including a US contractor just last week. President Trump sent multiple, clear signals that there would be consequences if General Soleimani and his Quds Force killed another US citizen and continued his pursuit of aggression in Iraq and the Middle East. No one wants a war with Iran or with the millions of peaceful Iranian people. Unfortunately, the Iranian regime has impoverished its people while pursuing brutal aggression throughout the Middle East. I pray for all of our military and foreign service personnel around the globe as they continue to keep our nation safe and secure."
