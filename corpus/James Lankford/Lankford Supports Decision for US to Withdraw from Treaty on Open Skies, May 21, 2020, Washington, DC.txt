Lankford Supports Decision for US to Withdraw from Treaty on Open Skies


Senator James Lankford (R-OK) issued the following statement in support of an announcement made from the US Department of State that the US will withdraw from the Treaty on Open Skies:

"President Trump made the right decision to pull the US out of the Treaty on Open Skies. Russia has taken advantage of this decades-old agreement numerous times. It disadvantages nations like ours that follow the rules. Open Skies has allowed Russian spies to gather intelligence in the air and on the ground in many American communities. By pulling out of the Treaty on Open Skies, we protect the safety and national security of our nation from Russia's malign efforts to map our critical infrastructure and gather intelligence on our military and commercial enterprises. I have encouraged the Administration multiple times to withdraw the United States from this agreement to protect our nation from Russian spies. I am grateful that President Trump has taken the bold stand to do what other administrations should have done a long time ago."
