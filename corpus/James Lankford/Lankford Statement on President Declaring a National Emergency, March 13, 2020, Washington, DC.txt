Lankford Statement on President Declaring a National Emergency


Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today issued a statement following President Donald Trump's declaration of a National Emergency in response to the coronavirus outbreak:

"President Trump's national emergency declaration provides the federal government additional resources to continue to respond to the coronavirus and remove unnecessary barriers to receiving access to care.  Yesterday, I expressed my frustration to the Administration on the lack of communication and availability of testing. Today, I was encouraged by the public-private partnership to speed up the ability to provide tests to Americans who need them and have additional access to get tested through a drive-up clinic in the days ahead.

"It was also good news to hear that the Administration is filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a means to address the oil markets and the actions by foreign countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia who are manipulating the energy markets in the time of a crisis."
