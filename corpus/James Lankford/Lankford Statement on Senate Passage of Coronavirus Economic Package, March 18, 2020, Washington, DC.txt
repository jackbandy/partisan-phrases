Lankford Statement on Senate Passage of Coronavirus Economic Package


Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today issued a statement following the vote on the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which is the second bill addressing the coronavirus outbreak: 

"I just voted against the second COVID-19 bill in the Senate. I supported the $8.3 billion health care bill three weeks ago, but this bill has a new government mandate on small businesses, which was intended to help, but I fear it will make a bad situation worse for many Oklahoma businesses. We have an opportunity to fix this issue in a third bill that the Senate is currently working on, and the American people are counting on us to get it right."

On March 5, the Senate approved $8.3 billion in supplemental funding to give states and the federal government resources to address coronavirus, which Lankford supported. $6,925,000 was made available to Oklahoma on Monday, March 16. Yesterday, Lankford expressed his concerns about the bill. Lankford is providing resources and updates for Oklahomans on his website, www.lankford.senate.gov/issues/.
