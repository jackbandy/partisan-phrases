Inhofe, Lankford Praise Senate Confirmation of Oklahoman John Heil


U.S. Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) today praised the Senate confirmation of Oklahoma attorney, Mr. John F. Heil, III, to serve as a U.S. District Judge for the Northern, Eastern and Western Districts of Oklahoma.

"John Heil will do a fantastic job serving Oklahoma in this new capacity and I am glad the Senate chose to confirm him today," Inhofe said. "With more than 25 years of law experience in Tulsa County, John truly understands what it takes to serve his fellow Oklahomans. I am proud that, under the direction of President Trump, we continue to confirm judges on the floor quickly and efficiently. Let's keep it up."

"I am grateful for the Senate's attention to Mr. Heil's nomination to fill this vacancy in the US District Courts for all areas of Oklahoma," said Lankford. "Mr. Heil will serve Oklahomans and our judicial system well, and his placement will ensure the courts he serves can continue to expeditiously serve the families on their dockets. I am grateful for Mr. Heil's willingness to serve our state and nation and know he will bring integrity and hard work to the federal bench. Congratulations to John and his family for finally reaching this milestone after a long process together."

Heil was nominated by President Trump on November 6, 2019. Inhofe introduced Heil at his nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January of this year and applauded the Senate Judiciary Committee's advancement of his nomination in March.
