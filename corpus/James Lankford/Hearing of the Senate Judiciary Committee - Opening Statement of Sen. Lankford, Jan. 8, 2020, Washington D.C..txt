Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for allowing us to be able to come and to be able to present John Heil to this body. I stand wholeheartedly with Senator Inhofe as well in recommending John Heil to this position. He's received a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association. He has an impressive legal career, and has been one that's been exceptionally respected. Now this is a very unique position in Oklahoma is that he is what I affectionately called the peripatetic judge that is moving around from location to location. So he won't be in one specific area, though he'll probably spend the majority of his time in Muskogee, but he'll cover several different areas of our districts in Oklahoma. And there is a tremendous need right now as we have some folks that are retiring in the Eastern District, and we absolutely need some additional judges in that spot. So we're grateful that not only he's gone through this very long process, but that he is willing to be able to serve in this as well. And I'm grateful to this Committee to be able to take up his nomination quickly and to be able to move him through the process because there is a real need for him in that role in that spot. So thank you again for your leadership, and I have no question of the quality and respect that he carries in Oklahoma.
