Lankford, Rosen Statement Commemorating Holocaust Remembrance Day


Today, Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), co-chairs of the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism, released the following statement in commemoration of Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day. 

"During the horrors of the Holocaust, six million Jews and millions of others were taken from us," said the Senators. "Today, communities across the globe look back on this dark chapter of history in remembrance of those who were lost, with admiration for those who stood up to the Nazi regime, and with hope for a brighter future. In order to achieve that future, we must all work to fulfill the promise of the words "Never Again.' On this day we commit ourselves to stand together, across faiths and across party lines, against anti-Semitism and hate and in the pursuit of a more peaceful world -- for the survivors, for those we lost, and for future generations." 

BACKGROUND: Last October Senators Rosen and Lankford launched the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism.

In January, Senators Rosen and Lankford introduced a resolution commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp by Allied Forces during World War II. The resolution unanimously passed the Senate in February.
