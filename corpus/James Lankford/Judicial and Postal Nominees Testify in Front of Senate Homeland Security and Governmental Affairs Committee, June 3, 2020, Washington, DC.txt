Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today chaired a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) hearing to consider five nominations; three to be an Associate Judge on the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and two to be United States Postal Service Governors. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management, Lankford was asked to chair today's full committee hearing as his subcommittee has jurisdiction over the District of Columbia and the federal workforce. 

"The nominees before us today are critical to our nation's judicial branch and to the functions of our US postal service," said Lankford. "Today's hearing was for members of the committee to question each nominee on their qualifications, their experience, accomplishments, and how they intend to bring those qualifications to the District of Columbia's Superior Court and the United States Postal Service Board of Governors. The nomination process for any position is a long road--we are grateful for each nominee's willingness to serve their nation in each position."
