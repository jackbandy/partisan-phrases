75 Years after the Liberation of Auschwitz, Senators Lankford, Rosen Speak at US Holocaust Museum ahead of National Prayer Breakfast


Today, as a part of National Prayer Breakfast week, Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV)) spoke at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, discussing the need to combat anti-Semitic hate and highlighting the work of their Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism. Lankford was an honorary co-chair of the 2019 National Prayer Breakfast.

"The Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, is a somber but powerful testament to the millions of lives lost in the Holocaust and our resolve to never forget the consequences of hate and apathy," said Lankford. "During this important week of prayer and unity in our nation's capital that will culminate in the National Prayer Breakfast, I am proud to join Senator Rosen to continue to highlight the need for people everywhere to stand against anti-Semitism and pray for peace for our nation and world." "We must be the ones to ensure that the term "never again' means never again for anyone," said Rosen. "That's why last year, Senator James Lankford and I launched the first ever Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism. Together, with over 30 fellow senators, from both sides of the aisle, we're taking on one of the most disturbing trends of our time." In January, Lankford and Rosen, along with Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Ben Cardin (D-MD), introduced a bipartisan resolution commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp by Allied Forces during World War II. Last year, Lankford and Rosen launched the first-ever Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism.
