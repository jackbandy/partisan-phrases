Lankford Comments on Planned Parenthood Accessing PPP Loans


Senator James Lankford (R-OK) issued the following statement on the in response to news that Planned Parenthood applied for and received loans through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which it was not eligible for: 

"The Paycheck Protection Program was designed to support small businesses, non-profits, and their employees through the health crisis currently facing our nation. Planned Parenthood's budget of over one billion dollars a year and the explicit Small Business Administration affiliation rules made it clear from the start of the program that Planned Parenthood was not and is not eligible for a small business Paycheck Protection Program loan. Like other large organizations that returned monies they were not eligible for, Planned Parenthood should immediately repay the American people the money they took from deserving small businesses and non-profits. Every dollar Planned Parenthood took from the Paycheck Protection Program was a dollar that did not get to legitimate small businesses that were eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program."
