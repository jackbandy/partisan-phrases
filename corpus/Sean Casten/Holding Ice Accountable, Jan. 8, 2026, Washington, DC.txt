Holding Ice Accountable


Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday ICE murdered an American citizen.  Renee Good was a wife and a mother who has now become ICE's latest  victim. To those at DHS and in this Chamber who have created and  rewarded a culture of murder, I ask the same question that God asked  Cain:

What have you done? You have slain your sister who gave you no  offense. The voice of her innocent blood cries out from the ground  where it was spilled, where you try to cover and hide. But we saw what  was done.

What kind of monster shoots an unarmed, fleeing woman in the head?  What kind of monster watches the video of that crime and chooses to lie  to the American people as they defend the murderer and defame the  victim? How do we prevent ourselves from descending to their monstrous  depths?

Mr. Speaker, I will tell my colleagues how. We prosecute the murderer  with  the due process he denied Renee and demand accountability up the entire  chain of command. Our job is not to bear their sins. Our job is to make  sure this never ever happens again.
