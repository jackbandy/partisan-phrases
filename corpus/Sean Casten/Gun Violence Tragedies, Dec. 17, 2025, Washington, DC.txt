Gun Violence Tragedies

Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, over the weekend, two different countries  experienced gun violence tragedies. In one they targeted a Hanukkah  celebration, and at another they targeted students in an engineering  classroom.

Both of these countries were founded by Europeans who landed on a  large land mass, took control from the Natives with their superior  arms, and developed a cowboy culture at the heart of their national  ethos.

One of those countries responded by acting like an adult. Having  initiated gun buyback programs after their last tragedy, they are now  working to further tighten gun regulations.

The other one of these countries acted like a child. Our FBI Director  and President shared misinformation. The Vice President suggested that  the politics of one of the victims was the real tragedy. The Republican  Party remained committed to defending the rights of people who think it  is fun to play with things that go bang, bang.

Gun violence is still the number one cause of death among actual  American children. They are dead because Members of this Chamber, who  claim to be adults, keep acting like children.

I would point out that the Brown University shooting was the 389th  mass shooting in America this year.
