Fired By President Trump

Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the story of a Federal  scientist who, in his own words, was fired by President Trump and Elon  Musk.

Here are his words:

I worked for the U.S. Geological Survey. I was a small       aircraft operator and captain of a research vessel. As the       only captain at my science center, my termination effectively       shuts down a vessel that is required for a number of ongoing       projects. I am also the engineer on the boat and I am not       sure my vessel will survive termination.

That is Federal money and Federal research that is being lost.
