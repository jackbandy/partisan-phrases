Recognizing Sondra Lapointe


Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sandra LaPointe, a  seventh grade teacher at Westview Hills Middle School in Willowbrook,  Illinois.

I recently had the pleasure of surprising Mrs. LaPointe during her  social studies class to honor her with our constituent spotlight award.  We started making these awards after the last election to try and  uplift people who are bringing hope and joy and making us feel good  about being Americans because, goodness knows, we need these voices  right now.

There is not a person in this Chamber who doesn't owe a debt to the  great teachers they had along the way who taught them things, but more  importantly, who taught them how to learn, made them excited to learn,  who challenged them to ask questions about the world because as James  Baldwin said: No society progresses without those kind of teachers  around them.

Mrs. LaPointe's nomination came from a former student who said:  ``Mrs. LaPoint's class was the one I looked forward to the most each  day. Her spunky personality always brought out the best in all of the  students.''

From your students and from your Congressman: Thank you, Mrs.  LaPointe. You make us all better.
