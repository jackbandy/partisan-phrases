Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act

Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak for the 186 Americans who  have lost their lives today, not because of disease or illness, but  because they did not have access to the health insurance they needed to  get treatment.

Every year, 68,000 Americans die because they do not have health  insurance, and Republicans have chosen to turn their backs on these  Americans and make this crisis worse.

Not only does their bill fail to extend the ACA tax credits,  something that helps 88,000 folks in my district afford health  insurance, it abandons financial assistance for middle-class families  when they are already struggling to make ends meet. It strips away  protections for patients, opening them up to discrimination and  predatory practices. It restricts access to abortion care which, by the  way, is healthcare, putting the government, not a woman and her doctor,  in charge of her body.

People are dying, Mr. Speaker, and it is time Republicans take this  crisis seriously. Republicans need to wake up. Have some compassion.  Our constituents cannot wait. Let's vote ``no'' on  this awful Republican bill, Mr. Speaker.
