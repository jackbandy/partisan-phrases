Fighting Dhs Immigration Raids

Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, my community of Charlotte was under siege by the  Department of Homeland Security's campaign of terror last month. They  called it Operation Charlotte's Web.

Border Patrol agents engaged in extreme racial profiling, excessive  force, and brutal tactics, spreading fear in our community.

It was fear that shattered the car window of a U.S. citizen born in  Honduras. He was thrown on the glass-covered ground in handcuffs after  he already identified himself to agents.

It was fear when more than 30,000 Charlotte-Mecklenburg students, 21  percent of the student body, were absent from school on the Monday  after the raids began because parents were terrified that their  children would be victims of CBP's brutality.

It was fear as businesses shuttered their doors to try and protect  their customers and employees from being wrongfully targeted by these  Federal agents.

Cruelty was the point of their operation, but Charlotte never caved  in to their cruelty. Instead, citizens packed churches for training to  empower themselves to respond to Border Patrol agents. Parents band  together to safely get their children to school, and businessowners  patrolled the streets to protect their neighbors, their customers, and  their employers.

CBP's actions in Charlotte were deplorable and absolutely  unacceptable. I have already reached out to DHS and demanded  transparency on exactly what Border Patrol was doing in Charlotte. I am  still waiting for answers to my questions.

Make no mistake about it. My constituents want answers. I do, too.  They deserve the answers, and I am going to keep fighting for them.

Congress must end these unlawful, un-American, and unnecessary raids  on our communities.
