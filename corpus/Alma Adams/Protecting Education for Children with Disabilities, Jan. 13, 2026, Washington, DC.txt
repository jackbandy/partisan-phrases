Protecting Education for Children with Disabilities

Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Mrs. Hayes) for yielding time. I thank her for her unwavering support  of children and for having been the National Teacher of the Year. I  thank her so much.

Mr. Speaker, I rise because dismantling the Department of Education  is not just bad policy. It is dangerous for North Carolina's children.  In my State, more than 60 percent of students rely on Pell grants and  Federal aid to afford college. Nearly 1.5 million K-12 students depend  on title I IDEA school nutrition and other Federal supports.

In Charlotte-Mecklenburg, over 70 percent of students benefit  directly from programs administered through the Department. When the  Department is gutted, when staff are fired, grants are frozen, and  financial aid systems break, it is our most vulnerable young people who  feel it first. These are low-income students, first-generation  students, students with disabilities, and families who cannot afford  disruptions.

This isn't efficiency. It is an educational disarmament. I am proud  to defend the Department of Education because protecting the Department  means protecting opportunity.
