Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to recognize the eighth  anniversary of Black Maternal Health Week, founded by Black Mamas  Matter Alliance.

I want to take a moment to honor the life and legacy of my  constituent, Fatima Carter.

I share with you a stunning portrait of her painted by Omari Maynard  of the ARIAH Foundation.

Through an initiative called ``In Her Honor,'' the ARIAH Foundation  and Mothering Justice uplift the lives of women like Fatima, Black  mothers who should still be with us today.

A proud member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., Fatima worked for  Abbott Nutrition and was a devoted stepmother to her teenage daughter,  China Carter.

After multiple heartbreaking miscarriages, Fatima and her family were  preparing to welcome her daughter, Cameron Carter.

Because Fatima lived with type 1 diabetes, her pregnancy was  considered high risk. After a medical appointment with concerns about  preeclampsia were raised, Fatima went to sleep, and she never woke up.

The coroner listed sudden cardiac death as the cause, but we know it  was more than that. It was the result of our healthcare system that too  often ignores Black women's pain.

We will not allow her story to be forgotten. We will not stop until  justice, safety, and dignity in birth are guaranteed for all.
