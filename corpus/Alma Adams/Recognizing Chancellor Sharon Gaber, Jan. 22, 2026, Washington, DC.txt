Recognizing Chancellor Sharon Gaber


Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chancellor Sharon  Gaber and the exceptional work that she has done leading the University  of North Carolina at Charlotte.

Under Chancellor Gaber's leadership, UNC Charlotte has experienced  record enrollment, achieved the coveted R1 status, and made investments  that are transforming Charlotte's education landscape and our  community.

UNC Charlotte has become a powerful engine for economic growth,  driving innovation, workforce development, and research partnerships  that benefit Charlotte and North Carolina.

I am also proud to see her work recognized as Charlotte Business  Journal's 2025 Business Person of the Year.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Chancellor Gaber and the entire UNC  Charlotte community on the transformative impact the university has had  on Charlotte-Mecklenburg and our State.

This is a proud moment for the 49ers and Queen City.
