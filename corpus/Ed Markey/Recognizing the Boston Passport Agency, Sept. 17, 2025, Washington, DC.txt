Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  the Boston Passport Agency on its 100th anniversary. For a century, the  dedicated public servants at the Boston Passport Agency have connected  the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts--and travelers from  across New England--to the wider world. Today, the agency continues to  safeguard the integrity of the U.S. passport and ensure families,  students, servicemembers, business leaders, and humanitarian workers  can safely travel across the globe.

I celebrate the Boston Passport Agency's centennial milestone on  September 17, 2025, which marks Constitution Day and Citizenship Day.  On this day, every year, we recognize the adoption of the U.S.  Constitution and celebrate those who have become, or are on their path  to becoming, U.S. citizens. Every American--whether they were born on  U.S. soil or immigrated to our shores--offers their own unique story,  traditions, faith, and values to the fabric of our Nation. For the last  100 years, the Boston Passport Agency has taken part in the incredible  task of honoring American stories--one passport at a time.

The Boston Passport Agency tirelessly serves the public trust. Day in  and day out, agency professionals uphold the highest standards of  security, while delivering the responsive, compassionate service  Commonwealth residents have come to know and appreciate. Whether it is  assisting a college student preparing for a semester abroad, a  grandmother traveling to welcome a new grandchild, or a family  navigating the urgency of a medical or humanitarian emergency, the  agency meets the moment with expertise, diligence, and care.

Over the decades--and especially in recent years--the Boston Passport  Agency has displayed remarkable resilience and innovation. During  periods of unprecedented demand and global uncertainty, including  public health disruptions that strained travel systems worldwide, the  agency's personnel adapted operations and devised creative ways to  serve the public, all without compromising security. In partnership  with local communities, elected officials, and Department of State  leadership, the agency's staff helped reduce backlogs, protect against  fraud, and strengthen processes essential to both national security and  individual liberty.

The economic and cultural impact of the Boston Passport Agency's work  reverberates far beyond the walls of its office. By powering  international research collaborations, trade and tourism, and  educational exchanges, the  Boston Passport Agency enriches our region's institutions, industries,  and communities. The agency enables small businesses to reach new  markets, assists families in cultivating bonds across borders, and  supports Americans in representing our Nation's values abroad.

We also honor the great people who make up this institution; their  professionalism and diligence have made possible the extraordinary  journeys of so many. On behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I  extend my heartfelt gratitude to the leadership and staff of the Boston  Passport Agency--past and present--for a century of exemplary service  and stewardship.

I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Boston Passport  Agency on its 100th anniversary and in wishing its team continued  success in the years ahead.
