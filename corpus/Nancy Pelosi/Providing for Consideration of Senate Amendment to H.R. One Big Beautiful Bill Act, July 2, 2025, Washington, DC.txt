Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern) for his leadership.

Mr. Speaker, the gentleman just ended by asking us to vote for the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder,  the GOP has a very blurred vision of what America is about.

Is it beautiful to cut off food from seniors and children? Is it  beautiful to cut off 17 million people from healthcare? Is it beautiful  to do this to give tax cuts to billionaires in our country? Is it  beautiful to take money from education and the rest? The list goes on  and on.

Nearly 60 years ago, Dr. King said: ``Of all the forms of inequality,  injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman because  it often results in physical death.''

We come to this floor with the moral force of Dr. King's words in our  hearts. Let us not with this bill turn the American Dream he talked  about into a nightmare for America's seniors, the disabled, and our  children. Let us vote ``no'' on this shameful bill and throw a punch  for the children.
