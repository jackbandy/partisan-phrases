One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his exceptional leadership, recognizing that the budget should be the  statement of values of our country and how we allocate our resources  reflecting those values.

I asked to speak because I hear Members on the other side talking  about spending on the part of the Democrats, spending for education,  healthcare, food, and all the needs for our children.

I want to remind all of them--speaking to you, Mr. Speaker--that tax  cuts are expenditures. They are the biggest spending in this bill, to  the tune of $5 trillion added to the national debt to give tax cuts to  the wealthiest people in the country at the expense of feeding our  children, healthcare for our people, and the education of our children.

Nothing brings more money to the Treasury than the education of the  American people from early childhood through lifetime learning and  every phase of it in between.

You should be ashamed of yourselves to mock spending on education.  The best dollars we spend are on educating the American people and the  investments in scientific research. The Biblical power to cure that  science provides for us is cut in this bill to spend $5 trillion for  the wealthiest people in America.
