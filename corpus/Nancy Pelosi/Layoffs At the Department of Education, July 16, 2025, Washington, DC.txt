Layoffs At the Department of Education


Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court's ridiculous decision this  week to allow the President to proceed with mass layoffs at the  Department of Education is a grave blow to the rule of law and defies  congressional authority.

Justice Sotomayor's dissent warns that the Court is enabling the  executive branch to undermine Congress' power of the purse, and she is  absolutely right.

Perhaps the Republicans in the House and in the Senate and the White  House do not understand that nothing brings more money to the U.S.  Treasury than the education of the American people, early childhood  education, K-12, higher education, post grad, and lifetime learning for  our workers. They are cutting education to give tax breaks to the  richest people at the expense of America's future, the education of the  American people.

The Court's disregard for the authority of the legislative branch  empowers executive overreach at the expense of accountability and  democracy. My colleagues should take pride in being a Member of the  House, support this institution and our constitutional right of the  power of the purse.
