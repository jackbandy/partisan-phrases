Shameful Hernandez Pardon

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with deep concern at the  President's outrageous and shameful pardon of Juan Orlando Hernandez, a  man an American jury convicted of trafficking tons of cocaine into the  United States and of corrupting his own government in the process.

I saw this firsthand when I brought a bipartisan delegation to  Honduras when he was President. We refused to meet with him because he  is/was a thug.

This is not a minor case. This is not a close call. This was a  decisive conviction for crimes that have devastated American families  and fueled violence and instability abroad. Yet, President Trump chose  to use one of the most powerful powers of the Presidency to wipe it all  out.

This is so hypocritical as he is bombing small boats that he  describes as full of drugs coming to the United States. Perhaps they  are, and that is a different thing. However, if he is doing that, why  would he pardon a thug?

Hernandez once boasted at a meeting of narcotraffickers that  ``together they were going to shove the drugs right up the noses of the  gringos.'' What message does pardoning this criminal send to parents  who have lost children to narcotics, to law enforcement officers  risking everything to stop the flow of deadly drugs?

This disgraceful pardon should be met with bipartisan condemnation as  an affront to our values, our safety, our rule of law, and our  democracy.

Those who do not join in that condemnation are either pro-crime or do  not care. It is another reminder the American people must be vigilant.
