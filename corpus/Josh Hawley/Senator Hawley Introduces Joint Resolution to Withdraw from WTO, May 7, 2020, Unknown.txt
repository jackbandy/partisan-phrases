Senator Hawley Introduces Joint Resolution to Withdraw from WTO


Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a joint resolution to withdraw the United States from the World Trade Organization (WTO). Earlier this week, Senator Hawley penned an op-ed in the New York Times calling for the United States to lead the way to abolishing the WTO as the Chinese Communist Party has weaponized the WTO to its benefit at the expense of American workers.

"The coronavirus pandemic has exposed deep, long-standing flaws in our global economic system that demand reform. International organizations like the W.T.O. have enabled the rise of China and benefitted elites around the globe while hollowing out American industry, from small towns to once-thriving urban centers. We need to return production to America, secure critical supply chains, and encourage domestic innovation. Pulling out of the W.T.O. is a good first step."

BackgroundIn 1994, Congress passed HR 5110 Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) that established the World Trade Organization (WTO). Section 125 of URAA requires a report to Congress every 5 years on the effects of the WTO on the United States economy and provides for a joint resolution to revoke Congressional approval of the United States' participation in the WTO within 90 days of the report being received.
