Sen. Hawley: In Light of Coronavirus Spreading, Time to Consider Travel Restrictions to and from China


As the spread of coronavirus continues, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is calling for the U.S. government to consider restricting "all US commercial travel to and from China."

This follows his recent letter to numerous government agencies on the need to weigh travel restrictions and outline their decisions as the situation develops.

Last week, I asked federal health & security officials about travel to & from #China given #coronavirus. With worsening conditions since then, it's time to consider restricting all US commercial travel to and from China. Public health must be paramount https://t.co/cMkngC7mQy
