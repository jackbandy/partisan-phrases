Sen. Hawley Announces Resolution to Condemn China's New National Security Law in Hong Kong


U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced he will introduce a resolution condemning China's proposed "sweeping national security law" in Hong Kong that would ban subversion, sedition, and succession.

Last fall, Senator Hawley joined pro-democracy protestors in the streets of Hong Kong and called for Chief Executive Carrie Lam to resign. He was an original cosponsor of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. Senator Hawley has also introduced the Hong Kong Be Water Act and called upon the United Nations to pass a resolution condemning Beijing's abuse of the people of Hong Kong.
