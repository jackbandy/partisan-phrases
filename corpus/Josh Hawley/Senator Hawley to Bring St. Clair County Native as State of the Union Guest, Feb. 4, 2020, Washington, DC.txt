Senator Hawley to Bring St. Clair County Native as State of the Union Guest


U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) will bring Keith Marquis, a native of St. Clair County, Missouri, as his guest of honor to President Donald Trump's State of the Union Address tonight. Senator Hawley met Keith and the Marquis family in Collins, Missouri, at the first stop on his tour of economically distressed Missouri counties in August.

Keith grew up near Collins, working at Buzz's Market, the local grocery store his grandparents started in 1961. A son of rural Missouri, Keith worked hard toward becoming a professional bull rider. He was well on his way when he began a 10-year struggle with methamphetamine addiction which landed him in jail. With the help of his faith, family, and community, Keith turned his life around. Today, Keith is a proud husband and father, and the third generation to work in his family business. He and his brother Kyle give back to the community by traveling to local high schools to share their stories of overcoming addiction with children of rural communities.
