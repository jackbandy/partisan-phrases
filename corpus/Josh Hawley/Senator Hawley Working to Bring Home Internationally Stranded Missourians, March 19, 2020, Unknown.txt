Senator Hawley Working to Bring Home Internationally Stranded Missourians


U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is working with the State Department to facilitate the swift and safe repatriation of dozens of Missourians stranded internationally in the midst of COVID-19 travel restrictions. He is in contact with Missouri families and groups of travelers -- including a church group -- currently stranded in Guatemala, Honduras, the Philippines, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Peru.

"We have been in contact with these Missourians, many of whom were trying to help and spread the gospel on a mission trip. My staff and I continue to do everything we can to bring them home immediately."

The State Department has been advising U.S. citizens to find a place to stay in country and register at step.state.gov. Doing so provides the federal agency with updated contact information for travelers and is the most effective way to communicate any updates to them. Constituents are also advised to monitor the websites of embassies and other country-specific information on travel.state.gov. Constituents are encouraged to reach out to Senator Hawley's staff in Washington, D.C. and Missouri for further guidance and assistance.
