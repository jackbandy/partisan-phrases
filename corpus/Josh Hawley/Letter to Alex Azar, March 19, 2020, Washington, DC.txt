Letter to Alex Azar, Secretary of the Dept. of Health and Human Services, Peter Gaynor, Admin. of FEMA - Senator Hawley Asks HHS, FEMA for Plan to Assist Missouri Hospitals During Coronavirus Pandemic


Dear Secretary Azar and Administrator Gaynor,

As Missouri reports its first death due to COVID-19 (coronavirus) and the state begins implementing state-wide precautionary measures, I write to you both concerning preparations for staffing shortages and disruptions in the state's healthcare and hospital systems.

The Golden Valley Memorial Hospital in Clinton, Missouri, is no longer accepting new patients after treating one with coronavirus. Springfield, Missouri, has a limited number of hospital beds and draws patients from a broad geographic area, raising concerns that space and care might be further restricted amid responses to coronavirus.

These circumstances must be seen in light of the already troubling trends for the state's healthcare system. A report published by the Missouri Hospital Association noted that 32 rural counties in the state do not have licensed hospitals, requiring their residents to travel large distances. In 2014, 9% of the state's licensed physicians practiced in rural areas, reflecting a 15% drop since 2011, and six rural hospitals have closed over the last five years (with three of those between 2018 and 2019).[3]

In light of these difficult circumstances, I would like to know what kinds of options HHS and FEMA are considering to address potential workforce shortages and stresses on Missouri's healthcare system. In particular, please let me know of any plans HHS and FEMA might have to deploy medical response teams, such as Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs) and/or the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, or other contingency measures to help augment the healthcare needs of Missouri's communities.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
