Defense Health Agency's New "703 Report' Protects Military Hospital at Fort Leonard Wood


The Defense Health Agency (DHA) released its "703 report" this week, detailing the agency's recommendations for changes to military treatment facilities across the nation. Following pressure from U.S. Senator Josh Hawley and other members of the Missouri delegation, DHA's recommendations make sure that the General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital (GLWACH) will be able to continue providing beneficiaries with the health care they need. The pressure from Senator Hawley and others came in response to reports that DHA planned to cut the services available at GLWACH.

"The 703 report validates what we already knew--that General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital is essential to Fort Leonard Wood and the region, and the services it provides are irreplaceable. I look forward to continuing to work with the Pentagon to make sure our servicemembers and communities get the quality care they deserve."

Senator HawleyNot only will GLWACH continue to provide necessary care at Fort Leonard Wood, the Department of Defense's FY 2021 budget request includes $40 million for ongoing construction of new GLWACH facilities. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Hawley will continue to work with his colleagues and the Pentagon to keep this project on track.
