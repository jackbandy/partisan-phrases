Senator Hawley Statement on Navigable Waters Protection Rule


Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released the following statement on the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, a new definition of the Waters of the United States Rule:

"I applaud the Trump administration for replacing the burdensome Waters of the United States rule with new guidelines that put Missourians -- not big government -- in control. The Navigable Waters Protection Rule gives farmers and ranchers more clarity and states more flexibility in determining how to best to manage their land and water, just as Congress intended with the Clean Water Act. It's a straightforward approach to protecting our beautiful lakes and rivers without burying everyone in federal regulations."
