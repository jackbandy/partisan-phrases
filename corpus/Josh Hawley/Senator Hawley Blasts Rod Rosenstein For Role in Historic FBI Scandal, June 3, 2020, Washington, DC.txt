Senator Hawley Blasts Rod Rosenstein For Role in Historic FBI Scandal


Today during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) grilled former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about his role in the FBI's investigation of President Trump and his staff during the 2016 election and subsequent surveillance after he assumed office. Senator Hawley sharply criticized Rosenstein for testifying that he did not read an FBI wiretap application before signing off on it and that he failed to ensure that it was accurate before rubberstamping it.

"Of course, now my Democrat friends say there's nothing to see here because now we have one of the largest scandals ever to engulf the FBI and the DOJ," said Senator Hawley. "These circumstances simply are not acceptable, Mr. Chairman. And that's why I'm glad we're doing this. But we've got to hold somebody accountable for it."
