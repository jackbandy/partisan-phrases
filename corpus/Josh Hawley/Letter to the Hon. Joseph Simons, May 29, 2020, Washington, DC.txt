Rebecca Slaughter, Commissioner of the FTC, and the Hon. Christine Wilson, Commissioner of the FTC - Senator Hawley, Colleagues Call for Investigation into TikTok's Children's Privacy Practices


We write to call upon your agency to investigate new evidence suggesting that the popular videosocial media platform TikTok is violating legal obligations to protect kids' privacy and urge youto hold the company accountable for any illegal activity. As the coronavirus pandemic continuesto keep kids at home and young people's screen time skyrockets,1 it is imperative that theFederal Trade Commission (FTC) upholds its obligation to protect children's privacy andenforce the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).TikTok has a clear record of failing to adequately protect young users' privacy. On February 27,2019, the FTC fined TikTok (previously Musical.ly) and negotiated a consent decree afterfinding that the company had repeatedly violated COPPA. According to the FTC, TikTok collected information about children without receiving the requisite consent from parents.2 TheCommission also found that TikTok had not provided parents with notice of its data collection,as COPPA requires, and failed to delete children's information from the platform at the requestof their parents.3These alleged violations showed a blatant contempt for COPPA's fundamentaltenets, and laid bare a dangerous disregard for children's privacy in today's online ecosystem. Aspart of a settlement mandating the institution of new privacy safeguards, TikTok agreed to pay athen-record $5.7 million penalty.On May 14, 2020, however, a coalition of over 20 children's advocacy groups filed a 55-pagecomplaint with the FTC over TikTok's continuing privacy abuses. This investigation --conducted by leading children's privacy legal experts -- found damaging evidence to suggest thatTikTok likely violated the FTC consent decree and may have further infringed upon child users'privacy.First, the researchers presented evidence suggesting that TikTok has failed to delete all personalinformation collected about all the platform's users or delete all information collected aboutusers under age 13, two options stipulated under the consent decree. TikTok does not appear tohave deleted the personal information of all its users, and screenshots taken directly from theTikTok platform show that children's data, including video and images of children who areclearly under age 13, were still available on the application months after the FTC's consentdecree took effect.4 This evidence suggests that TikTok has not fulfilled its legal obligations toprotect children's privacy, as mandated under the company's settlement with the FTC.Second, TikTok still fails to follow multiple legally binding regulatory transparencyrequirements, according to researchers' findings. The FTC's regulations under COPPA requireTikTok to provide "direct notice" to parents about its data practices before collecting informationabout children.5 However, researchers found that TikTok does not at any point contact a child'sparent when that young user signs up to use the app.6 Additionally, the COPPA Rule requiresTikTok to have a "prominent and clearly labeled" link to its privacy policy on its homepage, butTikTok's policy is by no means easily found within the app. The policy also appears to lackessential information, including a description of the data that the app collects about children, anomission which leaves parents in the dark on whether they can opt-out of objectionable datasurveillance practices.Finally, TikTok does not appear to give parents the option to review and delete their children'sdata from the platform. The FTC order mandates that TikTok let parents remove their children'sinformation from the app.8 The COPPA Rule itself requires TikTok's privacy policy to clearlycommunicate to parents that they may "review or have deleted" their children's information.9Yet researchers have demonstrated that TikTok's general notice to all users on how they mayseek data deletion does not offer information about how parents specifically may ask thecompany to delete child users' data.10 These findings cast further doubt on TikTok's compliancewith important children's privacy safeguards.Federal privacy laws, regulations promulgated under those laws, and consent decrees resultingfrom privacy violations are effective only if they are vigorously enforced. As the ongoing publichealth crisis continues to catalyze children's increased tech use, the FTC must increase itsattention to the dangers that minors encounter online, including the manipulation of kids'attention and their data for advertising dollars. Already this year, the TikTok app has beendownloaded 307 million times, surpassing any other app in the world, and has many young usershooked.11 Faced with compelling evidence that this wildly popular social media platform isblatantly flouting binding U.S. privacy rules, the FTC should move swiftly to launch aninvestigation and forcefully hold violators accountable for their conduct.Thank you for your attention to these important matters.
