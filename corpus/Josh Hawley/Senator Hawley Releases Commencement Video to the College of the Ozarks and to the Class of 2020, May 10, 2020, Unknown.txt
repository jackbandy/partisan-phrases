Senator Hawley Releases Commencement Video to the College of the Ozarks and to the Class of 2020


Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released a video commencement address for the College of the Ozarks and the Class of 2020. Senator Hawley was scheduled to give the commencement address to College of the Ozarks' Class of 2020 today. Due to commencement being cancelled, Senator Hawley released a video for the students.

"If this emergency is taking things from us, from you, maybe it's also revealing something to us worth considering about our lives and our life together," Senator Hawley said. "Turning points like graduation reveal to us a bedrock truth about our lives. We are not meant to be alone. We don't become who we are alone. Our accomplishments are not ours alone. Our hardships and our heartaches are not ours to bear alone. We were made to be together, and we are who we are because of those who have loved us and whose love has empowered us to give and to serve in return."
