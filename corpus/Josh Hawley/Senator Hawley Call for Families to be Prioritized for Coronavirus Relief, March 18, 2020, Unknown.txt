Senator Hawley Call for Families to be Prioritized for Coronavirus Relief


After reports that the White House Coronavirus plan may include $2,000 to many Americans and industry bailouts, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is calling for families to be prioritized in the relief process.

Yesterday, Senator Hawley announced he would introduce the Emergency Family Relief Act of 2020 to provide families facing uncertainty during the coronavirus outbreak a guarantee of financial relief from looming economic hardship. The legislation sends relief to families based on the number of children that they have and their income.
