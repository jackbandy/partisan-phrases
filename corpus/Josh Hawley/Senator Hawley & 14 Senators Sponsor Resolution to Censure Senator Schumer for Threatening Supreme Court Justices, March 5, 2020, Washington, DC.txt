Senator Hawley & 14 Senators Sponsor Resolution to Censure Senator Schumer for Threatening Supreme Court Justices


Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley introduced a resolution to censure Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for threatening two U.S. Supreme Court Justices. The resolution, cosponsored by 14 Senators upon introduction, condemns the Senate Minority Leader's remarks at a pro-abortion rally in front of the Supreme Court yesterday, noting that political violence has increased in the United States over the last decade, including the targeting and murder of federal judges and their family members.

They resolution comes after Senator Schumer threatened Justices by name yesterday, saying, "I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions."

The resolution reads, "Senator Schumer has acknowledged that threatening statements can increase the dangers of violence against government officials when he stated on June 15, 2017, following the attempted murder of several elected Members of Congress, "We would all be wise to reflect on the importance of civility in our [N]ation's politics' and that "the level of nastiness, vitriol, and hate that has seeped into our politics must be excised.'"

U.S. Senators Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), David Perdue (R-Ga.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), and Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) are all original cosponsors of Senator Hawley's resolution.
