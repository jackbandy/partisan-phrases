Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ted Pouliot for a  lifetime of service supporting our Minneapolis community.

As a senior at DeLaSalle High School in Minneapolis in 1952, Ted  first started volunteering at House of Charity's dining hall to help  feed Minnesotans going hungry. This was just the start of his decades  of service.

Later in life, Ted founded the Minneapolis affordable housing  nonprofit, Project for Pride in Living, helping folks find stable  housing.

Now, at 91, Ted paints to raise funds for nonprofits throughout  Minneapolis. This past weekend, he raised $12,000 at his art sale to  benefit nonprofits working to end homelessness and address hunger for  Agate Housing and Services, Groveland Emergency Food Shelf, and  Sabathani Food Shelf.

Ted truly embodies what it means to live a life of service. It is  truly an honor to recognize him here today.
