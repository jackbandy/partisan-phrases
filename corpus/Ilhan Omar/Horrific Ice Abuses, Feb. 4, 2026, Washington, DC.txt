Horrific Ice Abuses

Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, two of my constituents, Renee Good and Alex  Pretti, beloved neighbors and community members, were murdered by  Federal immigration enforcement agents.

These are not distant headlines. These were beloved community members  fighting to protect their neighbors.

Alex Pretti was a 37-year-old ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA who  cared for veterans. He was a healer, and he should be alive.

Renee Good was a 37-year-old beloved wife, mother, and community  member. She should be alive.

Kristi Noem's DHS must be held accountable. We cannot continue to  operate as if this terror is acceptable. We cannot allow a Federal  agency--one that was created for the purpose of terrorizing--to  function as an occupying force in our communities.

Real accountability starts with abolishing ICE, impeaching Kristi  Noem, and rethinking how we enforce immigration policy in this country.  We cannot stop there. We must demand that those who are responsible for  terrorizing our communities are investigated thoroughly, not by the  agencies that oversee them but by truly independent authorities.

We have seen Federal agencies block State investigators and stonewall  accountability. That is unacceptable. Our system of justice cannot  tolerate a situation where people are killed and the only response is  silence, spin, or justification from the administration's officials.

Minnesota was once known as a place of refuge. It has now been turned  into a war zone by a Federal Government that has lost sight of the  values that make America great.

Everything we love--our communities, our rights, our Constitution,  and our humanity--is on the line right now. We have to fight like our  future depends on it because it does.
