Stock Trading Ban for Members of Congress

Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress should not be allowed to  trade stock. This should be a no-brainer. Members of Congress should  not be allowed to profit off of their service. When Members are in a  position of directly benefiting from the manipulation of the stock  market, and they profit off of their position, it is corruption, plain  and simple.

Just last month, numerous Members and Cabinet officials profited off  of Donald Trump's tariff chaos announcement. This should not be  acceptable. I know a majority of Americans agree. Nearly 90 percent  support a ban.

Every time a Member cashes in, it undermines public trust. That is  why I have always supported a ban for elected officials and their  families, because exploiting inside information to enrich yourself  should never be allowed. It is time we come together to stop this  corruption and pass an immediate stock trading ban.
