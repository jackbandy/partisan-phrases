Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize John and Amy Higgins  and their work to host the Fourth Annual Lake of the Isles Pencil  Sharpening.

In 2022, after high winds damaged a 180-year-old oak tree near the  historic Bull Higgins house, John and Amy commissioned local sculptor  Curtis Ingvoldstad to shape it into a piece of art that folks of all  ages can identify with: the No. 2 pencil.

Since then, John and Amy have welcomed the Minnesota community to  join them on the first Saturday in June for an annual ceremonious  pencil sharpening, complete with music, coordinated dance, and ice  cream.

Through this annual event, John and Amy present the community with a  story of renewal--a symbolic sharpened pencil to write new love letters  or thank-you notes with--and invite folks to reflect on all of the  things they have done in the past year and welcome in the next.
