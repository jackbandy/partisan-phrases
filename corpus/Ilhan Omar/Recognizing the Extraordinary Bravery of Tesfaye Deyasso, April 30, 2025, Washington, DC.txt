Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate and recognize the  extraordinary bravery of Tesfaye Deyasso, who was named the 2025  National Hero of the Year by the National Association of Letter  Carriers.

On April 18, 2024, Mr. Deyasso witnessed a car drive off the highway  and crash into a barrier, erupting into flames. Without hesitation, he  rushed to the scene. Joined by a group of Good Samaritans, Mr. Deyasso  worked tirelessly to pry the car door open, fighting against intense  heat and smoke from the burning car to save the driver trapped inside.

Mr. Deyasso has been a proud member of the Minneapolis Branch 9 of  the National Association of Letter Carriers for over 4 years. His  heroism is a testament to the strength and compassion found in our  community. I am proud to have Mr. Deyasso as a constituent, and I am  honored to commend his bravery.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Tesfaye  Deyasso on his remarkable and well-earned honor.
