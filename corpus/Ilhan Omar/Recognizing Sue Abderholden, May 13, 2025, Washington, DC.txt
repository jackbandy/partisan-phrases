Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sue Abderholden for  her transformational leadership and advocacy for accessible mental  health services in Minnesota.

During her 24 years of service as the executive director for the  National Alliance on Mental Health Illness Minnesota, she helped pass  over two dozen landmark laws that reshaped education, healthcare,  housing, and criminal justice to better serve people living with mental  illness.

Sue championed legislation to require mental health training for  teachers and expanded crisis and early intervention services. Thanks to  Sue's unwavering commitment to expanding culturally responsive, person- centered mental health care, our communities are safer and healthier.

Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for her years of service, and I hope she  has a wonderful retirement.
