Minneapolis First All-Native Fire Crew


Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Minneapolis Fire  Department for the historic assembly of their first all-Native fire  crew.

Manned by Captain Michael Graves, fire motor operator Jessie Strong,  and firefighters Johnny Crow and Bobby Headbird, the new crew operates  Engine 10 out of Fire House Number 6 in Minneapolis.

The four firefighters share one goal: to build trust between the  department and the communities it serves.

Beyond responding to fire and emergency medical calls across south  Minneapolis, the crew makes a diligent effort to attend community  events and ensure young kids see their identities represented in public  service.

I am incredibly grateful for the work they do to keep our city safe  and inspire future generations to give back to their communities.
