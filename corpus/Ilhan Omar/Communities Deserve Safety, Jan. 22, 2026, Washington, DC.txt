Communities Deserve Safety


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699381/communities-deserve-safety


Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, instead of holding ICE accountable for their  horrific behavior, including their violent occupation of American  cities like Minneapolis, Republicans voted on giving ICE billions of  dollars to terrorize our communities. It is beyond shameful.

ICE operates with no meaningful oversight and continues to act with  impunity, even as it carries out violent operations that have cost  lives.

I am sick and tired of seeing Republicans reward a rogue agency that  inflicts harm on our communities. Congressional Republicans greenlit  sending $400 million more to ICE detention and $370 million more to ICE  enforcement. This is on top of the unprecedented $170 billion the  agency received in Trump's big, ugly bill.

ICE has tormented our communities. Let's be clear: What we are  witnessing from ICE is not law enforcement. It is State-sanctioned  violence. A woman was killed by ICE.

Mr. Speaker, our communities deserve safety and justice, not  militarized crackdowns and murder.
