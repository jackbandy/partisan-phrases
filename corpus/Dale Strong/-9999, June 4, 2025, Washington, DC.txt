Mr. STRONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of  an exceptional U.S. Army entity at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville,  Alabama, the prototype integration facility, also known as the PIF.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention this facility is named after  Dr. Larry O. Daniel, the beloved late grandfather of one of my district  staffers.

Operating out of the DEVCOM Aviation and Missile Center, the PIF has  been the Army's premier provider of rapid prototyping and integrated  hardware for aviation and missile programs since opening its doors in  June 2002.

The PIF personifies fast and efficient contracting, benefiting from  its unique government-owned, government-operated, and contractor- supported model.

I encourage the Army to keep this effort going and to apply this same  contracting concept more broadly.

Lastly, I thank the PIF team and wish them a happy anniversary.
