Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act of 2025

Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise as a co-lead of the  Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act with my Republican colleague  Representative Flood from the great State of Nebraska.

Our bill will unlock capital for entrepreneurs and small business  owners who have been left out for far too long.

Current law allows only millionaires to invest in the markets that  fuel small businesses, shutting out countless Americans, especially  women, veterans, and people of color, based on wealth, not knowledge.

Our bill addresses this by creating an exam to assess your ability to  understand financial risk when investing in private markets, enabling a  more diverse group of people to invest responsibly, regardless of their  net worth.

This legislation creates a new path for capital to reach more hands.  In my State, the Delaware Black Chamber of Commerce has told me that  the legislation would help close the capital gap for diverse  businessowners. Small business leaders say that it is not lack of ideas  but a lack of capital that holds them back.

This bill opens up new sources of funding from a pool of investors  more reflective of the community so that these founders can turn their  vision into jobs and economic growth.

I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this commonsense,  bipartisan legislation today. I thank Representative Flood, Chair Hill,  and Ranking Member Waters for their leadership.
