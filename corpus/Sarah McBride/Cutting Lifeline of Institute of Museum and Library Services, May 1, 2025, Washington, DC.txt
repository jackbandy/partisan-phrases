Cutting Lifeline of Institute of Museum and Library Services


Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn this  administration's harmful and illegal efforts to gut  the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

Let's be clear. This is a direct attack on rural families, veterans,  caregivers, and children, including thousands of Delawareans who rely  on libraries not just for books but for help with job applications,  disability forms, and housing assistance.

In Dover, librarians are helping my neighbors navigate Social  Security delays. In Lewes, they are supporting unhoused jobseekers. In  Harrington, they are guiding caregivers through pages of red tape just  to access basic support.

This isn't just morally wrong. It is a violation of the law. Congress  appropriated these funds. This administration is not only defunding  vital community programs. It is defying the will of the American  people.

With just $1.93 million per year, Delaware libraries are able to  preserve our history, strengthen our workforce, and meet people where  they are to deliver critical services. Cutting this lifeline isn't  efficiency. It is cruelty.

Mr. Speaker, I urge the administration to reverse course, and I stand  with my colleagues in demanding full funding for the services our  communities need and deserve.
