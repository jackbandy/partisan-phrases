https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699001/recognizing-ashellarien-addison


Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Lieutenant  Colonel Chaplain Reverend Dr. A'Shellarien Addison on her recent  promotion at the Delaware Army National Guard.

Earlier this month, I was honored to attend her promotion ceremony  and celebrate her historic role as the first woman to hold this rank at  the Delaware National Guard, and I was moved hearing about her  commitment to her fellow National Guardsmen.

Before her time at the Delaware National Guard, she served as the  first woman chaplain at the National Guard Bureau in Arlington,  Virginia. Her devotion to spiritual empowerment and trauma-informed  healing has made her an indispensable leader to Delaware's Army  National Guard.

I look forward to seeing the work that she will continue to do in  shaping the spiritual lives of those around her.

Well done, Lieutenant Colonel Addison.                            Closing of GrassRoots

Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the closing  of GrassRoots, a gift shop in Newark, Delaware, after 50 years in  business.

What started as a small shop on Newark's Main Street grew into a  Delaware institution, with locations across our State from Wilmington  to Hockessin to Rehoboth Beach, but its heart always stayed in Newark.

GrassRoots weathered changing times. It survived recessions, and it  adapted as retail shifted online. Through it all, it remained a  constant presence, helping to define the character of downtown Newark  for a generation.

Marilyn Dickey, who cofounded GrassRoots in 1975, poured more than  half of her life into the store. GrassRoots wasn't just a business. It  was part of the rhythm of Newark, a reminder that local businesses  create connections and build community.

As GrassRoots closes this chapter and Marilyn begins a well-earned  retirement, Delaware wishes her all the best and thanks her for her  years of community service and creativity.                         Recognizing Dreams of Faith

Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the voices of my  Delaware constituents, Dwain and Karen Johnson, who turned the  unimaginable loss of their daughter, Faith Deanna Johnson, into  lifesaving advocacy through their organization, Dreams of Faith.

Faith was just 26 years old when she died from ovarian cancer. For  years, her symptoms were dismissed or misdiagnosed until it was too  late. Faith's ovarian cancer cut her life far too short. Before she  passed, Faith made one request of her parents: Make sure this doesn't  happen to someone else.

In Delaware, we listened. When I served in the State Senate, I was  proud to help pass House Bill 15, the Faith Deanna Johnson Act, which  requires individual health insurance plans to cover annual ovarian  cancer screenings for women at risk and expand monitoring for  survivors.

That law is already saving lives because it treats women's medical  needs seriously and acts before it is too late. Here is why this  matters: Ovarian cancer is often caught too late, but when detected  early, survival rates dramatically increase. Early detection isn't just  good medical practice; it is the difference between life and death.

Today, I carry the Johnsons' story with me to Congress. Their  advocacy reminds us that policy is personal and that too often families  are failed not just by delayed diagnosis but by the very system tasked  with caring for our health. It is one that too often puts barriers  between people and the care that they need.

We owe it to Faith and families across this country to keep pushing  for early detection, meaningful insurance coverage, and a healthcare  system that truly puts patients first.
