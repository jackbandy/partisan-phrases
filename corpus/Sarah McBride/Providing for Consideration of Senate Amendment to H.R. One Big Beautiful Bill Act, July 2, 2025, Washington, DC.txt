Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this big, ugly  bill. Let's be clear: This bill is TrumpCare. And TrumpCare means 17  million more Americans will be uninsured and all the rest of us will be  paying higher costs and driving further to get care.

Over the last several months, I have met with hundreds of  Delawareans--parents, patients, providers, hospital leaders, teachers,  nurses, people from all across the State of Delaware--and everyone was  asking us, pleading with us, to kill this bill.

Are my Republican colleagues meeting with their constituents? Are  they ignoring them? Do they even care?

Every ``yes'' vote shows very clearly that they don't. This bill is  trickle-down cruelty, and people will die because of it.
