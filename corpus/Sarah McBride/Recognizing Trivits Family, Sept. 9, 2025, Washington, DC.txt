Recognizing Trivits Family


Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Trivits  family from Hockessin, Delaware.

Recently, Evan Trivits wrote to me about his wife, Angela, who, last  September, was diagnosed with ALS. The slow and progressive impact of  ALS, paired with our devastating lack of clarity about its causes, is a  metaphorical perfect storm of grief.

The Trivits family dreams of a future where ALS is no longer a death  sentence, and I share that dream and echo their resolve.

Evan and Angela are a shining light in our community and are  emblematic of the values that Delaware is built on. They are harnessing  the power of hope to build a collective passion that can do the  important work needed to save lives.

Through strength, resilience, and raising awareness, Evan and Angela  are demanding better from all of us and turning their uncertainty into  action.

The act of caregiving is often shaped by moments of fear,  frustration, and heartbreak, but more than anything else, it is shaped  by purpose, devotion, and grace.

In part because of Evan and Angela, I am proud to join my colleagues  on the ALS Caucus because families deserve urgency, attention,  investment, and real solutions.

I thank the Trivits family for their courage and determination and  for reminding us of the need to advance meaningful, lifesaving  solutions.           Honoring Lieutenant David Moyer and Trooper Brian Nieto

Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two extraordinary  public servants, Lieutenant David Moyer of the Millsboro Police  Department and Trooper Brian Nieto of the Delaware State Police. They  were recently awarded Medals of Valor, the highest honor their  departments can bestow.

On June 22, Lieutenant Moyer responded to a dangerous pursuit that  ended in Lewes, Delaware, where he came under direct fire from a  suspect wielding an AR-15. Under threat, Lieutenant Moyer held the line  and even helped evacuate a wounded resident to safety.

At the same time, Trooper Nieto made a split-second decision. Knowing  an officer was pinned down, he maneuvered into harm's way, drawing the  suspect's attention and likely saving Lieutenant Moyer's life.

These are not routine acts of bravery. They are rare, decisive  moments that speak to the highest ideals of law enforcement. Their  courage, humility, and service remind us what public safety truly  means.

I am grateful to Lieutenant Moyer and Trooper Nieto for their valor,  their leadership, and their sacrifice to our State of neighbors.              Commemorating 75th Anniversary of Sayers Jewelers

Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 75th  anniversary of Sayers Jewelers in Smyrna, Delaware, in August. Sayers  is a small, multigenerational business that has been operating in the  town of Smyrna since 1950.

Sayers has been supporting their neighbors throughout Kent County  year in and year out, consistently standing alongside their community  and demonstrating that successful small businesses are the bedrock of  our small towns.

Sayers is one of many examples in Delaware and beyond that reminds us  how essential it is that we support small businesses, innovation,  entrepreneurs, and the folks in our communities who employ our  neighbors and drive success and investment in their community. Small  businesses are the backbone of our economy, and Delaware is the State  of small businesses.

Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for Sayers Jewelers and congratulate them  on their continued success. I thank them for continuing to pour into  Smyrna, Kent County, and the greater central Delaware region one family  heirloom at a time.                        Congratulating Robbie Stephens

Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Robbie  Stephens on becoming the new fire chief of the Lewes Fire Department.

Chief Stephens brings nearly two decades of experience to this role,  having served as lieutenant, captain, training officer, assistant  chief, and deputy chief. He is also a firefighter with Wilmington's  Squad 4, where he is known for his skill, humility, and deep dedication  to public safety.

This is more than a title. It is a vote of confidence from a  department and community that knows leadership when they see it. Chief  Stephens' service reflects the very best of Delaware: commitment to  neighbors, courage under pressure, and a heart for giving back.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Chief Stephens and thank him for stepping  up, once again, this time to lead.
