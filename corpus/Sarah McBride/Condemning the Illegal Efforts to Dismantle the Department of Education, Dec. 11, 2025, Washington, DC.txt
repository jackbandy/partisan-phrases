Condemning the Illegal Efforts to Dismantle the Department of Education


Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the Trump  administration's illegal efforts to dismantle the Department of  Education.

The President and the Secretary of Education can call this plan  whatever they want, but the bottom line is that this is about defunding  public education and putting taxpayer dollars into the hands of private  institutions who do not face the same standards and protocols as public  schools.

The Department of Education protects students with disabilities,  supports rural and low-income schools, and helps make college more  affordable for students across the country.

In Delaware, $530 million in Federal education funding supports  teachers across our State. Removing that funding would mean students  without teachers, schools without support, and communities left behind.

I have stood arm in arm with Delaware educators, parents, and  students who are pushing back. They are asking for a fair shot, and we  should be investing in their future, not abandoning them.
