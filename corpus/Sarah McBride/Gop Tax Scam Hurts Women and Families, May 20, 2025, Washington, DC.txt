Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the story of a mother from  Delaware whose daughter lives with a condition that means she cannot  eat food without getting sick. Her daughter relies on Medicaid to pay  for the formula that keeps her alive.

Without it, she won't just struggle. As her mother wrote plainly to  me: ``If she loses Medicaid, she will die.''

Mr. Speaker, we must not gut Medicaid to give tax breaks to  billionaires while moms are begging for their children to survive. This  mom's story is not an outlier. This is a daily reality for thousands of  my constituents.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: Protect Medicaid and protect this  child. This is a lifeline.
