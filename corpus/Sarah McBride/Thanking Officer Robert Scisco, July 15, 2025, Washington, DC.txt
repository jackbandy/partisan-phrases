Thanking Officer Robert Scisco


Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Officer Robert  Scisco, a school resource officer at Rehoboth Elementary, who has been  named Delaware Mentor of the Month.

For the last 3 years, Officer Scisco has mentored Yanziel Rodriguez,  a rising fourth grader, meeting weekly to talk, play checkers, and  build a bond grounded in trust and encouragement. Before every move,  Officer Scisco reminds Yanziel to stop, take a moment, and think,  advice for a game of checkers and for life.

This is what public service looks like: presence, patience, and  purpose.

Officer Scisco is helping build a culture of safety and connection in  our schools, one relationship at a time. I thank him and the Cape  Henlopen School District.                      Honoring North Shores Beach Patrol

Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary  heroism of the North Shores Beach Patrol lifeguards who, while off  duty, sprang into action to save a swimmer in distress off the coast of  Delaware.

On the evening of July 3, lifeguards received an alert of a  distressed swimmer and immediately texted one another, racing back to  the beach. Luke McDermott and five others searched beyond their patrol  zone and swam over 300 yards in dangerous, choppy water to rescue a  woman who had been adrift for 2 hours without a life jacket.

Their swift response, courage, and deep sense of duty saved a life,  and Delaware is indebted to them.                       Devastating Food Assistance Cuts

Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, last week, I stood alongside Senators Coons  and Blunt Rochester at the Food Bank of Delaware, joined by advocates,  providers, and families, to speak out against the devastating food  assistance cuts in the Republican budget. The most powerful voice that  day was my constituent, Elizabeth Morales.

Elizabeth is a biochemist, a widow, and a mom from Newark. After an  unexpected layoff in 2023, SNAP gave her just enough support to keep  food on the table for her daughter while she got back on her feet. It  wasn't a handout. It was a lifeline. Now, that lifeline is being ripped  away from families like Elizabeth's.

Under this budget, Delaware will lose tens of millions of dollars in  SNAP support, putting more than 37,000 families at risk. These cuts  don't just stop at the grocery store. They reach into our classrooms.

Up until this budget, kids were automatically enrolled in school meal  programs through SNAP, but this budget breaks that link, creating a  mountain of paperwork for families and schools and putting thousands of  students at risk of going hungry.

We know that a hungry child cannot learn. Nutrition fuels focus,  growth, and lifelong success. These cuts don't just take away meals;  they take away potential. As Elizabeth put it: This is theft, plain and  simple.

It is cruelty disguised as policy. It punishes families not for  failing to work, but for living through a hard season. I will not stop  fighting until we restore this funding so that no one in Delaware goes  hungry.
