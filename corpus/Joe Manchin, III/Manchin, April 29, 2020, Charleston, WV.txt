Manchin, Capito Announce $750K in Scholarships for Food and Agricultural Studies Students at West Virginia State University


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $752,632 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to provide scholarships for students studying food and agricultural sciences and related fields at West Virginia State University.

"West Virginia State University continues to be a leader in innovative research and world-class academics and plays an important role in our state as the alma mater for Katherine Johnson who helped send astronauts to the moon. This funding will provide more opportunities for our students to receive a quality education in the Mountain State. I look forward to seeing the students of West Virginia State University who are interested in food and agricultural sciences thrive with this opportunity," said Senator Manchin.

"It is great news to see this funding heading to our state to support the 1890 Scholarship Program at West Virginia State University," Senator Capito said. "Supporting programs like this one provides our students with the opportunity and ability to pursue degrees in growing industries. This is not only an important aspect to the success of our students, but can also positively impact our work force here in West Virginia. I am thankful for the USDA and their investment in West Virginia, and I look forward to the positive results from this scholarship program."
