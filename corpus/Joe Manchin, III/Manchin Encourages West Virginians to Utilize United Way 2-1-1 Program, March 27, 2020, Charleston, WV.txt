"United Way of West Virginia provides an important service to West Virginians by helping users navigate the vast number of resources available to aid with healthcare issues, food shortages, mental health questions and more. This program is more important now than ever as we battle the COVID-19 pandemic and I commend United Way for continuing to serve their fellow West Virginians through this time," Senator Manchin said.

"United Way's new 2-1-1 will make information on a wide variety of local support services more accessible across our entire state," said United Way of Central WV President, Margaret O'Neal. "Whether it's information for locating a health clinic, finding child care programs, or getting housing assistance, 2-1-1 is an easy-to-remember, go-to resource for individuals and families."
