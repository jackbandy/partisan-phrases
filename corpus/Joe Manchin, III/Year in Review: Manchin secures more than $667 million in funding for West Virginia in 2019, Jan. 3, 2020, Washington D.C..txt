U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured $667,037,403 in funding from 467 awards for top West Virginia priorities in 2019. The grants included funding to combat the opioid epidemic, economic and rural development, education and health services, transportation and housing, and Veterans services.

"As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I fight every day to make sure West Virginia receives the funding we need to support our communities. The awards this year include funding for priorities like the combatting opioid epidemic and improve health services for rural communities, with additional funding to provide resources to homeless children across our state," said Senator Manchin. "I also worked to ensure these grants included investments in education and economic development, infrastructure awards to improve our roads, and highways and airports in order to better connect rural West Virginians and improve tourism for our state. One of my biggest priorities is ensuring that West Virginia receives the funding and support we need. I'm excited to see the positive impact this funding has in our communities and will continue to advocate for West Virginia."
