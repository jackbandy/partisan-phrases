Manchin Applauds Senate Approval of $8.3 Billion for Coronavirus Emergency Funding


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today applauded the Senate's approval of $8.3 billion in emergency supplemental funding, including $500 million in Medicare funds, to prepare and respond to the coronavirus outbreak. The House of Representatives approved this funding earlier this week.

"Congress has approved $8.3 billion in emergency funding to help ensure that the United States is prepared for the coronavirus outbreak and funds the development of new treatments, boosts funding to purchase and ship medical supplies, and allocates more than $950 million in grants to states and localities for testing and preparedness. I have been closely monitoring the coronavirus disease outbreak and have received several Senate briefings with officials from the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration and others. I will continue to monitor the outbreak and provide as much information as possible to West Virginians so they can help stop the spread of the coronavirus and other infectious diseases. The most important thing West Virginians can do right now is take preventive actions to help stop the spread of germs and follow the advice of our public health professionals," said Senator Manchin.
