Manchin Recognizes West Virginia Law Enforcement During National Police Week


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) led a resolution designating the week of May 10-16 as National Police Week which is an annual event honoring law enforcement officers and their families and the 185 police officers that died in the line of duty in 2019.

"Our law enforcement officers risk their lives every day, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. West Virginia's law enforcement officers protect their communities with strength and integrity. We must continue to support our brave officers and provide them with the support they need to protect West Virginians from harm. Gayle and I thank all law enforcement officers across the Mountain State for their service and will continue to support them as they work tirelessly to keep their fellow West Virginians safe," said Senator Manchin.
