Manchin, Capito Announce $260K for African American Civil Rights Preservation in West Virginia


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $264,600 from the National Park Service (NPS) to preserve historical sites that are significant in the fight for civil rights in America.

"I am pleased to see the NPS understands the importance of recognizing West Virginia's role in American history. Last month I sent a letter in support of the projects to restore two civil rights buildings in Charles Town and in December I sent a letter in support of the Carter G. Woodson Memorial Foundation project in Huntington. Understanding our history is vital because it reminds us of the hard-fought battles for human rights we have won throughout our history. Places like Charles Town and Huntington have long been influential in the fight for civil rights and we must work to preserve the landmarks of Garrison House, the First Free Black School, and Star Lodge No. 1. I applaud NPS for recognizing the civil rights landmarks in West Virginia and I look forward to continuing the work to preserve the history of West Virginia," said Senator Manchin.

"Conserving and protecting historic sites in West Virginia is incredibly important, especially those that revolve around our nation's civil rights movement," said Senator Capito. "It is great to see this funding coming to Huntington and Charles Town to restore several historic and cultural landmarks that highlight West Virginia's pursuit of civil rights. Last year, I wrote a letter to NPS in support of African American Civil Rights Grant funding for these locations, and I am glad to see that becoming a reality. I am thankful for all those whose hard work went into the application process and to NPS for providing this support for our state and our citizens. Protecting the rich history of our state must remain a priority."

"Celebrating and preserving our heritage in Charles Town with this National Park Service funding will help us continue our local endeavors to ensure that all people have equality and opportunity in our community," said George Rutherford, President of the Jefferson County branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. 

"We are thrilled to be receiving this funding from the NPS to preserve the civil rights history in Huntington that is an important piece of West Virginia's history and the American civil rights movement. I would like to thank Senators Manchin and Capito, other Congressional members, state legislators, and local leaders for their help in securing this grant, their efforts have been tremendously helpful. We look forward to completing our project at the Garrison House and preserving our history for generations to come," said David Harris, President of the Carter G. Woodson Memorial Foundation.
