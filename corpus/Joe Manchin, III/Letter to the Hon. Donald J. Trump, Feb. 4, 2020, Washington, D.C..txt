Letter to the Hon. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States - WV Delegation Asks President Trump to Approve Federal Cost-share Increase for Natural Disaster Recovery Projects


Dear Mr. President:

As members of the West Virginia Congressional Delegation, we write to request a federal cost-share increase for recovery projects associated with the severe storms, flooding, landslides and mudslides that occurred in June 2016. It was one of the deadliest floods in our state's history, claiming the lives of 23 people. This catastrophe was tied to the major disaster declaration, DR-4273, on June 25, 2016.

The recent approval of $132 million for the replacement of Richwood Middle School, Richwood High School, and Summersville Middle School brings the total funding provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance (PA) grant program to $307,392,538. This exceeds the $253,860,178 threshold associated with the current statewide per capita indicator for recommending cost share adjustments which currently stands at $137. If granted, this cost share adjustment would modify -- prospectively and retroactively -- the federal cost share from 75 percent to 90 percent for all PA projects resulting from the June 2016 floods.

We commend the tireless efforts of the local citizens and first responders who have worked diligently to assist in rescue recovery efforts, and we urge you to do everything in your power to make sure that our communities have the federal support that they will need to recover.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
