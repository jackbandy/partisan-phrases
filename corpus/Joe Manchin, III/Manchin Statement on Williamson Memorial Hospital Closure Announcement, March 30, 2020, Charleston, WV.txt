Manchin Statement on Williamson Memorial Hospital Closure Announcement


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today released the following statement on the announced closure of Williamson Memorial Hospital in Mingo County.

"It is impossible to overstate how essential our rural hospitals are in West Virginia. Williamson Memorial Hospital is the only hospital in Mingo County. As the COVID-19 pandemic increases the need for medical facilities we must do everything possible to keep our rural hospitals running. It is unconscionable that during a pandemic we are closing any hospital or health center that can provide the care West Virginians need. I will continue to work with hospital leadership and state and local officials on next steps to ensure that Mingo County will not go without treatment during this terrible pandemic," said Senator Manchin.
