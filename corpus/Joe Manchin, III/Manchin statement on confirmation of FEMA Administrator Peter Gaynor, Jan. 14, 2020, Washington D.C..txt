Manchin statement on confirmation of FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today released a statement on the confirmation of Peter Gaynor as Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator.

"Today the Senate confirmed Peter Gaynor as FEMA Administrator by a vote of 81-8 after passing out of committee with bipartisan support. As a state that has been ravaged by natural disasters like the flooding in 2016, FEMA has been instrumental in ensuring that West Virginians recover and build resilience for the future. Because of Administrator Gaynor's more than 11 years of experience in emergency management, I believe that he will be a great leader for FEMA and help the agency correctly assess and manage disasters across our nation so that communities can receive the help they need to get back on their feet quicker," said Senator Manchin.
