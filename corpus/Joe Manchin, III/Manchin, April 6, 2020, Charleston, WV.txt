Manchin, Capito Announce More Than $2.3 Million for Support Services


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced $2,381,858 through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program for the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR) to provide support and services to West Virginians living with HIV/AIDS.

"West Virginia has been ravaged by the opioid epidemic and every West Virginian has been affected by this terrible crisis. One of the consequences of this epidemic has been the rise in infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, and because of the COVID-19 pandemic, West Virginians' ability to seek the care they need is more difficult. This funding will provide more access to treatment and testing as we fight against the opioid epidemic and provide care for those affected. Our state still has a long way to go in this fight and I will continue to do everything I can to help West Virginia overcome the opioid epidemic," said Senator Manchin.

"As our state continues to battle the opioid epidemic, we have seen an increase in a variety of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS. For West Virginians with HIV/AIDS, these grants are critical in helping them get the services they need," said Senator Capito. "Increased support for our state agencies will foster better care and treatment in these medical and support services. During this uncertain time as we face the COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more important that we ensure the proper medical resource are available for our state's residents, especially those at greater risks. West Virginians take care of West Virginians, and I will continue to fight for the resources we need back home."
