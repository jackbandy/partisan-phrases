Manchin Praises USDA Approval of West Virginia Food Assistance Pandemic EBT Application


Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) praised the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) approval of West Virginia's application for Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT) cards which provide families with support to feed their children throughout the summer while children are not in school. On April 23, Senator Manchin sent a letter to USDA Secretary Perdue advocating for West Virginia's application for this program. 

"I am pleased the USDA approved West Virginia's application for the P-EBT program which is great news for our students and their families. The P-EBT program will ensure that families of children who receive free or reduced price school meals during a traditional school year will be able to provide food for their children during the COVID-19 pandemic and during the summer. Over 200,000 students in West Virginia rely on the school system to receive meals. While our students are learning from home and not physically in the classroom, we must do everything possible to ensure those students have food to eat. I will continue to fight to ensure all West Virginia children have food to eat and a roof over their heads during this pandemic," said Senator Manchin.
