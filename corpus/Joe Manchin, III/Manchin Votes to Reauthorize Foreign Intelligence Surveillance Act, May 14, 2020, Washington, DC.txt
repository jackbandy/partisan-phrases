Manchin Votes to Reauthorize Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today released the following statement on his decision to support H.R. 6172, USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act of 2020, which reauthorizes the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The Senate passed the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act 80-16.

"Every day, the United States faces immense threats and we are only able to defend ourselves because of the incredible work of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies. As foreign and domestic threats continue to threaten our nation, this legislation will ensure that our intelligence agencies can do their jobs effectively and thoroughly to protect us. Today, I voted for the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act because this bipartisan, bicameral legislation ensures our national security needs are met and includes important reforms to address privacy concerns. I will always support our military, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies as they put their lives on the line to protect Americans every day."
