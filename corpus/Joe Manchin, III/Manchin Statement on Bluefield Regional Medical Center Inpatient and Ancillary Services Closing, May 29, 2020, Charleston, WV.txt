Manchin Statement on Bluefield Regional Medical Center Inpatient and Ancillary Services Closing


Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on the announced closure of Bluefield Regional Medical Center (BRMC). BRMC will be closing all inpatient and ancillary services by July 30th. Princeton Community Hospital (PCH) has stated that the emergency department will remain open.

"The announcement that Bluefield Regional Medical Center will close is another painful loss for southern West Virginia -- especially as we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Today's news marks the fourth West Virginia hospital to shut its doors in the last 18 months. This devastating trend makes accessing quality and affordable healthcare more difficult for communities across Appalachia and West Virginia by forcing them to travel unreasonable distances to receive the quality care they need. In a state that has been identified as being the most at-risk for COVID-19, that is simply unacceptable. I will work closely with the leadership team at PCH, which acquired BRMC last year, to ensure no West Virginian goes without the care they need."
