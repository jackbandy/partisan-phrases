Manchin: Senate Should Consider PPP Deal Act After House of Representatives Pases PPP Loan Deadline Extension


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on the U.S. House of Representatives voting to extend the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness period from 8 to 24 weeks and amend the rehire date from June 30th to December 31st. This is consistent with Senator Manchin's PPP DEAL Act which would also extend the coverage period for the loan forgiveness program and amend the rehire date.

"I'm excited to see the House of Representatives pass this bipartisan, commonsense fix similar to my PPP DEAL Act to extend the PPP forgiveness period and change the rehire date. These changes don't cost taxpayers a dime, and they give small business owners the flexibility they need to adapt to this new and uncertain business climate. I urge the Senate to consider the PPP DEAL Act and extend the PPP forgiveness period from 8 to 16 weeks and rehire date from June 30th to 16 weeks after the loan is awarded, providing West Virginians and Americans a better opportunity to get back on their feet and bring back their employees in a reasonable timeframe. This would be a huge relief for many of our small businesses across the Mountain State and I hope the Senate will move quickly to pass the PPP DEAL Act when we are back in session next week," Senator Manchin said.
