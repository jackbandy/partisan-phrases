After Manchin Advocates for Extension of National Guard Orders, President Trump Extends Through Mid-August


Today, after U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) advocated for an extension of the Title 32 502(f) orders for the National Guard servicemembers responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump announced his decision to extend the orders through mid-August. This extension is necessary to ensure those servicemembers on the front lines of the pandemic receive full GI bill and retirement benefits for their service.

"I am pleased President Trump has listened to my call for an extension of the Title 32 orders for our servicemembers on the front lines of this terrible pandemic. They deserve to receive GI bill and retirement benefits for their service. While I appreciate President Trump's actions, I urge him to also support my bipartisan, bicameral bill, the Support Our National Guard Act, which ensures transitional healthcare benefits for our servicemembers after they complete their service. We cannot leave our National Guard servicemembers without healthcare after they bravely served during this global health crisis. We must ensure those on the front lines caring for our fellow West Virginians and Americans who are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are taken care of during and after their service."
