Manchin Introduces Resolution to Honor 75th Anniversary of Iwo Jima


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) introduced a Joint Resolution to honor the 75th Anniversary of the Battle for Iwo Jima during World War II. The resolution recognizes the gallantry and heroism demonstrated seventy-five years ago during the victory that was led by the United States Marine Corps over Imperial Japan on the island of Iwo Jima. A companion resolution was introduced in House.

"Seventy-five years ago today our brave Marines led America to victory over the Japanese forces in the pivotal Battle of Iwo Jima, and eventually secured the surrender of Japan. Today we celebrate the heroism of the Veterans who fought for our safety and security during World War II, including the brave efforts of our own West Virginian, Woody Williams, who fought during the Battle of Iwo Jima and received the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions. Their dedication should forever be remembered and honored, which is why I am honored to help introduce this resolution to honor our brave Marines and Corpsmen for their service," said Senator Manchin.
