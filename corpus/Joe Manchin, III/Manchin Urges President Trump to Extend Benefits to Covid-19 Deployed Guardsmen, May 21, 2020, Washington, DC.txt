Manchin Urges President Trump to Extend Benefits to Covid-19 Deployed Guardsmen


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) issued the following statement on President Trump's policy to end National Guard federal deployments on June 24th. As a result, these service members will be one day short of the 90-days necessary to qualify for early retirement and education benefits under the Post-9/11 GI bill.

"The men and women of the West Virginia National Guard are the best our nation has to offer. Right now they are deployed to areas hard hit by COVID-19 to administer tests and supply safety equipment. As they always have, they are risking their safety to protect us. It's unfathomable they would be denied the benefits they have earned because the Administration chooses to end deployments one day early. I urge the President to reconsider this decision and ensure every one of our nation's brave members of the National Guard get the benefits they have earned," Senator Manchin said.
