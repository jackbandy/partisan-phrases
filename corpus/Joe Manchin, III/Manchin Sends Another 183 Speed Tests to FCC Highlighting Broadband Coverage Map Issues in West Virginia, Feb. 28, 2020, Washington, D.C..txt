Manchin Sends Another 183 Speed Tests to FCC Highlighting Broadband Coverage Map Issues in West Virginia


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), has sent 330 speed test letters submitted by constituents from across West Virginia to Ajit Pai, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), including 183 letters sent recently, since July 2019. These speed tests highlight incorrect broadband coverage maps and support the need for the formation of a public feedback system to better assess broadband coverage across rural states like West Virginia. These speed test results are from West Virginians in 50 counties who do not have reliable broadband service. On February 10th, Senator Manchin launched a new webpage, manchin.senate.gov/speedtest, for constituents to easily submit speed tests to the FCC and to learn more about the fight to bring reliable broadband to rural communities across West Virginia.

"In 1935 President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the rural electrification program to bring electricity to communities across America. Now, the fight to bring reliable broadband to rural communities across the nation is just as important. Without access to the internet, citizens can't learn, apply for jobs, or become members of society who can give back to their communities. That's why I'm asking all West Virginians to submit their internet speed tests, so we can prove to the FCC that our broadband coverage is well below the stated coverage. We must ensure that rural communities like those in West Virginia have access to reliable broadband, which is why I have sent 330 letters and counting to Chairman Ajit Pai to show the actual broadband speeds available on the ground in West Virginia," said Senator Manchin.
