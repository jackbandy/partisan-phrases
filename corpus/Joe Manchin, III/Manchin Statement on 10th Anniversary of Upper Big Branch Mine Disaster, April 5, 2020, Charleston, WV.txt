Manchin Statement on 10th Anniversary of Upper Big Branch Mine Disaster


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today issued the following statement on the tenth anniversary of the tragedy that killed 29 miners at the Upper Big Branch (UBB) mine disaster in Whitesville, West Virginia.

"Not a day goes by that I don't think of those we lost ten years ago when 29 brave West Virginia coal miners were killed in the UBB mine disaster. Today, as we remember them ten years later, our hearts are heavy with the sad memory of that unspeakable tragedy. My heart goes out to their families who lost their loved ones during that terrible disaster. This day reminds us that we must always put safety first. Fighting for the safety and security of our miners has always been a top priority for me as Governor and now as your Senator. No family or community should never have to endure an avoidable tragedy like the UBB mine disaster. Our hearts are still broken ten years later and Gayle and I join all West Virginians in honoring those miners and never forgetting the families they left behind," said Senator Manchin.
