Manchin Votes Against Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery Nominee


Today U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on his opposition to the nomination of Brian Miller to be the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every American and West Virginian and has changed the way we go about our daily lives. This terrible virus has killed more than 100,000 Americans and 78 West Virginians in the past few months. The Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery is tasked with evaluating how the federal government executed COVID-19 pandemic response efforts. I cannot in good conscience vote to confirm Brian Miller to be the Special Inspector General because I believe his current role in the Office of White House Counsel and relationship with the President makes it impossible for him to remain independent as he investigates the Administration's response to the pandemic."
