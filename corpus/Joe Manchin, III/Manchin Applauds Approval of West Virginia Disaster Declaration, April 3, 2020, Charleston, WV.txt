Manchin Applauds Approval of West Virginia Disaster Declaration


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today applauded President Trump's approval of a major disaster declaration for West Virginia due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The disaster declaration allows West Virginia to access funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

"We know our population in West Virginia is among the most vulnerable to complications from the coronavirus. Our healthcare professionals need all the help they can get when it comes to providing the care necessary to get us through this time. They need personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, and tests to be able to protect themselves while they are caring for others. This disaster declaration will help West Virginia receive the funding and assistance we need to fight this terrible virus. I thank President Trump for his approval of West Virginia's major disaster declaration, and I will continue to fight for West Virginia to receive more funding that supports our state and citizens," said Senator Manchin.
