Manchin Urges Caution as Coronavirus Spreads


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today released the following statement urging West Virginians to exercise caution in the coming weeks as the coronavirus spreads throughout the United States.

"I am urging West Virginians to take deliberate precautions to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus, otherwise known as the coronavirus. Out of an abundance of caution, I have decided against holding any public events next week. After a Senate staffer from a different office tested positive for the virus and following the recommendation of Dr. Brian Monahan, the Attending Physician of the United States Congress, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, I have encouraged my Washington staff to telework until further notice, and have directed my West Virginia staff to be prepared to telework if necessary. Public health experts have made it clear that we must take action to mitigate the spread of this virus from now until April 1st, or else risk severe consequences like we are seeing in Italy and China," Senator Manchin said. "We all share the responsibility to prevent the spread of this virus and exercise responsible choices, including social distancing, frequently washing your hands with soap and water, wiping down surfaces with products that contain at least 60 percent alcohol, avoiding crowded places, canceling nonessential domestic and international travel and staying home if you are feeling under the weather. I will continue to monitor the outbreak and provide as much information as possible to West Virginians as the situation develops."
