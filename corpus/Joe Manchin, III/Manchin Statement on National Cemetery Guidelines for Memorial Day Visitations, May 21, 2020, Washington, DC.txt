Manchin Statement on National Cemetery Guidelines for Memorial Day Visitations


Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on the guidelines for the national cemetery in Grafton.

"My heart goes out to the Veterans groups across the state who are not able to place flags or lay wreaths at West Virginia's national cemetery in Grafton.  It is my understanding that while family members and individuals are permitted to visit and place flowers and flags at Grafton, no group flag or wreath ceremonies will be permitted. While I will miss walking in this year's parade to honor the Fallen, I understand the importance of social distancing so we are able to continue slowing the spread of COVID-19. Laying wreaths and flags is an individual and solemn gesture that could be accommodated by using health and safety guidelines. I urge the VA to reconsider this policy and work towards finding a resolution that allows for this solemn tradition to continue while protecting our health and safety."
