Manchin Questions VA on Veteran Testing Issues and Clarksburg VAMC Investigation


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) questioned Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Robert Wilkie and Dr. Richard Stone, Executive in Charge of the Veterans Health Administration on Veterans having issues with receiving and paying for drive-through and mobile COVID-19 testing as well as an update on the Clarksburg Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) investigation into the deaths of up to 11 Veterans in 2018.

"Veterans are having a hard time, they're confused about the testing, they're told they have to pay for it or being preapproved and going through all the red tape. Have you been able to work through that to clarify this for them to make sure that our Veterans can get tested as needed?" Senator Manchin said, "On the VA in Clarksburg, it's been two yearsÂ… do you see any end in sight? These families being left in limbo is awful."

Secretary Wilkie and Dr. Stone promised to work with Senator Manchin's staff to correct any drive thru testing locations that were not in the VA's network to ensure no Veteran receives a bill for COVID-19 testing. Senator Manchin also received confirmation that the person of interest in the Clarksburg VA investigation is not working at the VAMC in any capacity and they are working to resolve the investigation.
