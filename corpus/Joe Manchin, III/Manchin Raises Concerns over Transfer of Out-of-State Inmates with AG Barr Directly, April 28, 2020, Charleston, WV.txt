Manchin Raises Concerns over Transfer of Out-of-State Inmates with AG Barr Directly


During a call today with U.S. Attorney General (AG) William Barr, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) raised concerns about the transfer of new out-of-state inmates to the FCC Hazelton and FCI Gilmer facilities in West Virginia. Senator Manchin also sent a letter to AG Barr on Saturday urging him to immediately halt these transfers.

"This morning I had a productive call with Attorney General Bill Barr to discuss the situation at FCC Hazelton and FCI Gilmer, and my opposition to the transfer of new out-of-state inmates to West Virginia. He understands the concerns we have raised and is sympathetic to the situation. Despite a court order requiring increased social distancing at Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facilities in the D.C. region, I am hopeful the Department of Justice and BOP will take into account that these West Virginia facilities have no COVID-19 cases and that West Virginians have worked very hard to adhere to guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the state. The safety of our brave correctional officers and their families, citizens and inmates during this healthcare crisis must be our top priority," Senator Manchin said.
