Manchin Asks West Virginia Business to Send Him SBA Assistance Experiences


Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) asked West Virginia businesses who are receiving Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans or other financial assistance from the Small Business Administration (SBA) to send their experiences and feedback to his office at common_sense@manchin.senate.gov.

"West Virginia businesses are being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. The SBA programs are meant to help businesses across America, but the rural small businesses like ours in West Virginia aren't getting the help they need. I've been fighting for dedicated funding for small rural businesses in the next COVID-19 emergency funding package and getting feedback from West Virginia businesses will help me advocate in Washington for funding that will help our state and communities," said Senator Manchin.
