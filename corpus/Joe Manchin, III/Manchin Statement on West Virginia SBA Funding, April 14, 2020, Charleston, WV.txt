Manchin Statement on West Virginia SBA Funding


Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement after the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) announced $1,054,712,809 has been awarded to 5,211 West Virginia businesses.

"I'm glad to see financial relief being issued to West Virginia businesses. West Virginia small businesses are the heart of our economy and they support families and communities throughout our state. But I continue to hear from West Virginia business owners that they are waiting for this relief. There are commonsense, bipartisan fixes we can enact now to improve this program. For example, several of my Republican colleagues and I agree on a simple change that would allow government-owned hospitals like the one in Webster County to apply for these loans. If we don't include commonsense fixes like this in the next bill, it doesn't matter how much money we put into this program. It won't get to the people and the places that need it most," Senator Manchin said.
