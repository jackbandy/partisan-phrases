Manchin Secures Floor Time For Great American Outdoors Act


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, released the following statement after he successfully secured floor time for the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) when the Senate returns from legislative recess in June.

"I am excited to get to work on passing the Great American Outdoors Act when we return from recess in June. The GAOA is an example of the important, bipartisan work that can be accomplished when we put politics aside and work together for the American people. In West Virginia, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is responsible for much of the access to the Gauley and New rivers. GAOA will permanently fund this important program. It will also finally address the gigantic maintenance backlog in our national parks.

"As we all navigate the new reality of the COVID-19 pandemic, our outdoor spaces are more important than ever. They also offer critical economic opportunities at a time when many are out of work through no fault of their own. This bill will be a historic achievement, an economic stimulus when we desperately need one and protect our most treasured outdoor lands for generations to come."
