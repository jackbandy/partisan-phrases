Manchin praises Clorox investment in West Virginia


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today released a statement praising Clorox's estimated $190 million investment in Berkeley County, West Virginia.

"Clorox has been a great partner with West Virginia for many years and I am proud that they are planning to expand their business in our state. This new, high-tech manufacturing facility will provide over 100 jobs and create an economic investment of $190 million for Berkeley County which is a great economic boost for not only the area but our entire state. I've said many times before, if businesses give West Virginia a chance we'll prove to them that West Virginians are some of the hardest working people and they'll return investments tenfold. I look forward to working with Clorox and providing assistance at a federal level as well as job fairs to ensure a continued successful partnership between Clorox and West Virginia," said Senator Manchin.
