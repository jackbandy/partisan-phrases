Manchin Applauds Amtrak for Re-Staffing Charleston Station Ticket Agents


Today U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) applauded Amtrak's announcement of their intent to re-staff the Charleston Amtrak station, following through on a provision Senator Manchin authored in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 federal appropriations bill requiring Amtrak to re-staff stations with ticket agents that were removed in 2018, including Charleston. Senator Manchin has been fighting to restore staffing at the Charleston station since 2018 when Amtrak announced it was removing ticket agents from 14 stations across the country, including West Virginia's last ticket agent in Charleston.

"I am very pleased that Amtrak is re-staffing the Charleston station. This announcement is welcome news for West Virginia and the Charleston area, and will continue to keep our state connected to cities across America, benefitting the tourism industry and our local economies. In 2018, Amtrak removed the last ticket agent in our state. With limited internet access and cell phone service in our state and working class families and elderly residents who are less likely to purchase tickets remotely, removing the ticket agent hurt our communities who rely heavily on the train as an alternative to driving or flying. They deserve at least one manned station in the state. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I authored language that instructed Amtrak to re-staff the station in Charleston. I am proud that Charleston will once again have a ticket agent, and I will continue to fight for West Virginia in Washington to ensure we receive a fair shot for federal programs and funding."
