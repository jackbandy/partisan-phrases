Manchin Applauds Williamson Health and Wellness Acquisition of Williamson Memorial Hospital


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today applauded the acquisition of Williamson Memorial Hospital in Mingo County by Williamson Health and Wellness.

"On Monday I received notification that the Williamson Memorial Hospital would be closing their doors by the end of April due to financial issues. Closing any of our rural hospitals, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, is unacceptable and irresponsible, so I worked with the administration at Williamson Memorial Hospital to keep their doors open. I am pleased to see an agreement between Williamson Memorial Hospital and Williamson Health and Wellness to ensure Mingo County residents will not lose access to healthcare in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic. I look forward to seeing Williamson Memorial Hospital continue to provide West Virginians with care for years to come," said Senator Manchin.
