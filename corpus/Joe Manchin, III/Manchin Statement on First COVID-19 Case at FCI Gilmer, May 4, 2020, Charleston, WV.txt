Manchin Statement on First COVID-19 Case at FCI Gilmer


Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on the first positive COVID-19 case at FCI Gilmer after the transfer of new out-of-state prisoners to the facility.

"When the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) announced their plans to send additional inmates to facilities in Glenville and Hazelton this was what we feared would happen. This reckless decision on the part of BOP has endangered our hardworking correctional officers and their families, the entire community and the other inmates in the facility. I have asked BOP to conduct a thorough investigation and am awaiting the results of that investigation. I hope this will deter the BOP from transferring additional out-of-state inmates to West Virginia," Senator Manchin said.
