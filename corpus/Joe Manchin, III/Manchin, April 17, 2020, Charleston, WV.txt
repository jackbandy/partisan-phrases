Manchin, Capito Announce NASA Research Award for West Virginia University


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Commerce, Justice and Science, and Related Agencies subcommittee, today announced an award of $100,000 to West Virginia University (WVU) for space research from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). This funding was made available under the Rapid Response Research program and will help WVU develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based framework for real time radio-frequency interference detection and mitigation.

"West Virginians have always played a role in NASA's developments and achievements, from the contributions of "Hidden Figures' Katherine Johnson and "Rocket Boys' Homer Hickam to the work at the Katherine Johnson IV&V Facility in Fairmont. With its rich history, it is no surprise that NASA has chosen to partner with West Virginia University, and I am pleased that our state has another opportunity to contribute to space exploration," said Senator Manchin.

"WVU continues to establish itself as an institutional pillar of research in the higher education community. Our state has such a rich history in our country's pursuit of knowledge of outer space, and I am very pleased that this funding will help continue that tradition. We should be proud that the work being done at WVU can have such an incredible impact, and I'm proud to support their ingenuity and out-of-this-world science research," said Senator Capito.
