Manchin, Capito Announce More Than $2.2 Million for Maternal and Child Health Services in West Virginia


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $2,228,429 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR) for maternal and child health services in West Virginia.

"Access to healthcare is essential for West Virginians and Americans, especially during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic we are currently experiencing. This funding will help ensure that West Virginia mothers and children have access to quality healthcare in rural areas across our state. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue to fight for funding that will help provide quality healthcare for all West Virginians, especially our mothers and children," said Senator Manchin.

"Supporting our mothers, children, and young families in West Virginia is crucial, especially during these uncertain times," Senator Capito said. "This funding from HHS will bolster our healthcare system and help our state agencies respond to the needs of families across West Virginia. I am thankful for this support in our state, and will continue to advocate for these resources."
