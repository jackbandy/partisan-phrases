Manchin, Capito Announce Rural Development Investment in Monroe County


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Business and Development Loan Guarantee for the West Virginia Great Barrel Company's (WVGBC) Audrina Mill in Monroe County. This USDA Rural Development loan of $4.9 million will help the sawmill manage manufacturing and flooring costs, as well as save 47 jobs.

"West Virginia is home to many small businesses like the West Virginia Great Barrel Company Audrina Mill in Monroe County which are vital to our economy and communities. This rural development investment is essential to boosting the economy and securing jobs for West Virginians, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. I am proud to see the USDA investing in our state and will continue to fight for West Virginia businesses to receive funding to improve and grow our local businesses," said Senator Manchin.

"Keeping jobs for hard working West Virginians is always a priority of mine, especially in areas like Monroe County that were hit hard by the devastating floods in 2016. The people of our state are incredibly resilient; they work hard and support each other when times get tough. This USDA Rural Development loan will provide a needed boost to the region, as well as our state's value-added forest product industry," said Senator Capito. "During these uncertain and unsettling times, we need to make sure our industries in West Virginia have our support and access to the resources they need to be successful. I will continue to make sure our government works for the people of our state and that our citizens are given the opportunities they deserve."
