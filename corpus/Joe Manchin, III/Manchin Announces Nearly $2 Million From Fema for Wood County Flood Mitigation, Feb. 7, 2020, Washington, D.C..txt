Manchin Announces Nearly $2 Million From Fema for Wood County Flood Mitigation


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $1,922,410 in funding provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the acquisition and demolition of 11 flood-prone residential structures in Wood County.

"West Virginia has endured multiple weather-related disasters in recent years that continue to impact our infrastructure. West Virginians have bounced back from the pain and destruction the 2016 floods caused, but we still have more to do. I have been continuously working with FEMA to advocate for West Virginia to receive funding so that we can rebuild our communities, and now we are advocating for the Administration to approve the new cost-share agreement so West Virginia can begin to receive more funding to help our state recover. I will continue to fight to ensure that the federal government is a reliable partner in our ongoing recovery efforts across the state," said Senator Manchin.
