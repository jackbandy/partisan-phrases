Manchin Statement on Stay-At-Home Order for West Virginia


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement after Governor Justice declared the stay-at-home order for West Virginia.

"This afternoon Governor Justice made the decision to place West Virginia under a stay-at-home order beginning at 8pm on Tuesday, March 24th. I urge every West Virginian to abide by this order. We must come together to do the difficult things required to slow the spread of COVID-19. This outbreak is serious and the only option is to fight it together. West Virginians have always taken care of one another and right now that means staying at home unless absolutely necessary," said Senator Manchin.
