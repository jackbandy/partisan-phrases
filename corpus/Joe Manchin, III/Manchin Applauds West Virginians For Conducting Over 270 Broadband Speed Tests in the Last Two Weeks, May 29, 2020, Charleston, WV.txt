Manchin Applauds West Virginians For Conducting Over 270 Broadband Speed Tests in the Last Two Weeks


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) applauded the efforts of West Virginians who have submitted over 270 broadband speed tests in the last two weeks to prove the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) broadband coverage maps are incorrect. If a school or organization is interested in joining Senator Manchin to conduct speed tests, please email speedtest@manchin.senate.gov.

"Two weeks ago, FCC Commissioner Rosenworcel and I teamed up with the students of Lewis County High School to conduct broadband speed tests to prove that the FCC's broadband coverage maps are incorrect. I am proud of the over 270 West Virginians who have submitted tests over the past two weeks that prove the FCC maps are just plain wrong," said Senator Manchin. "I set a goal this year to submit 1000 speed tests to the FCC by the end of the year. To date we have received over 700 speed tests, which is a testament to the incredible effort West Virginians are willing make to get better broadband access for the Mountain State. I will continue to submit speed tests to the FCC, urging them to create a public feedback system for the broadband coverage maps and to fix their incorrect coverage maps before millions of dollars in federal funding is distributed to expand broadband across America.
