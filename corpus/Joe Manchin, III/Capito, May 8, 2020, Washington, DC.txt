Capito, Manchin Lead Bipartisan Resolution to Honor Our Nation's Teachers


U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) introduced a bipartisan resolution to honor our nation's teachers and commemorate National Teacher Appreciation Week for May 4th -- 8th.

"I think just about everyone can name a teacher who has made a difference in their life," Senator Capito said. "When the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States, teachers around the country stepped up and adapted to new teaching methods to ensure our students wouldn't fall behind. The care and dedication they give to students everyday goes well beyond academic knowledge. Our teachers are helping to raise the next generation of leaders in our country and should be commended for their incredible work."

"West Virginia teachers have stepped up during these challenging times to provide our students with education and support. They are innovative and adaptive and we are so proud of their continued work during the COVID-19 pandemic and every day. Their work does not go unnoticed and we are forever grateful to our teachers for educating and preparing generations of West Virginians," said Senator Manchin.
