Manchin Statement on Closure of West Virginia Schools Due to Coronavirus


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today released the following statement on the closure of West Virginia schools due to the coronavirus outbreak.

"The decision by Governor Justice to close West Virginia schools due to the coronavirus outbreak was the most prudent decision based on the advice we have received from public health experts, including the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci. They have made it clear that the most effective way we can mitigate the spread is to minimize large gatherings and social contact for the immediate future," Senator Manchin said. "I remain concerned about the safety and well-being of the more than 10,500 homeless and all at risk students in West Virginia. I am working with state and local officials to ensure there are plans in place to provide the necessary resources to these students. The safety and well-being of every West Virginian must remain our top priority and we all share the responsibility to prevent the spread of this virus and exercise responsible choices, including social distancing, frequently washing your hands with soap and water, wiping down surfaces with products that contain at least 60 percent alcohol, avoiding crowded places, canceling nonessential domestic and international travel and staying home if you are feeling under the weather. I will continue to monitor the outbreak and provide as much information as possible to West Virginians as the situation develops."

Late last night following the request of Senator Manchin, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved West Virginia's waiver application to provide meals to students during this outbreak so no child will go hungry while schools are closed.
