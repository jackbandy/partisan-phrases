Letter to the Hon. Robert Wilkie, Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs - Manchin, Capito Urge VA to Cover Mobile Testing Sites


Dear Secretary Wilkie,

We are writing to urge the Department of Veterans Affairs to authorize mobile testing sites in the same manner as the Department's urgent and emergency services policies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As you know, the VA MISSION Act expanded urgent and emergency care services, but it did not factor in unforeseen circumstances such as a global pandemic. It is critical that the VA covers COVID-19 mobile testing sites in the same manner as urgent and emergency care, so veterans can access these testing sites, without being stuck with the bill. This is especially important for rural veterans who currently have to choose between traveling to their nearest VA facility or paying for a test out of pocket, if they go to a site within their community.

We applaud the VA's efforts in caring for veterans during these difficult times, but it is imperative that all veterans have access to COVID-19 testing and urge you to authorize mobile testing sites in the same manner as urgent and emergency care services. We have also requested a phone call with you to discuss the issue we have identified.
