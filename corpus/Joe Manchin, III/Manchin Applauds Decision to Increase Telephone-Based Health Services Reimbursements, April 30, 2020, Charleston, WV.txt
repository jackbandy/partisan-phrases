Manchin Applauds Decision to Increase Telephone-Based Health Services Reimbursements


Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) applauded the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) decision to increase reimbursement payments for telephone-based health services to equal other audio-visual and in-person visitation reimbursements. This decision comes 24 hours after Senator Manchin led 37 bipartisan Senators in advocating for this exact policy change.

"I am very pleased that HHS and CMS have made the decision to increase telephone-based telehealth services reimbursements. In West Virginia and rural areas across America, many people do not have access to reliable broadband, which is necessary to use video telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead they must turn to telephone-based telehealth services, which until today were not reimbursed at the same level," Senator Manchin said. "This change will increase access to health services for West Virginians and ensures that our healthcare professionals are reimbursed fairly for their hard work taking care of their fellow West Virginians throughout this terrible pandemic."
