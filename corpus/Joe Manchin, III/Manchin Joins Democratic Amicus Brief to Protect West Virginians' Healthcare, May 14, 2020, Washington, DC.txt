Manchin Joins Democratic Amicus Brief to Protect West Virginians' Healthcare


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) joined an amicus brief filed in California v Texas (formerly Texas v United States), the case brought by Republican Attorneys General which aims to strike down the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as unconstitutional.

"I was appalled last week when the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued to double down on their support for this terrible Republican lawsuit to leave 800,000 West Virginians and millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions without health insurance. The DOJ will not back down and the Senate failed to pass my resolution to defend West Virginians and Americans with pre-existing conditions, which is why I joined my Democratic colleagues in filing an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court of the United States. This brief argues that the ACA's individual mandate is constitutional and that if the Supreme Court were to find the mandate unconstitutional, the remainder of the ACA must remain intact. I have continued to state again and again that the ACA is not perfect, but we simply cannot throw the baby out with the bath water, especially during a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The thought of throwing millions off of their health insurance during this pandemic is unthinkable. While the COVID-19 pandemic rages on across our country, I will continue to advocate for Congress to pass my bipartisan, commonsense legislation that will fix our current healthcare system without throwing millions off of their health insurance and will fight to expand healthcare coverage for Americans in future COVID-19 relief packages. I am proud to stand with my colleagues and will continue to fight until every West Virginian's access to quality, affordable health insurance is protected."
