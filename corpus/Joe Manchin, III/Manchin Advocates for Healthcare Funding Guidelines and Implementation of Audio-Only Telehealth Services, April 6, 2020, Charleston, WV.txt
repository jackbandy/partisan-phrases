Manchin Advocates for Healthcare Funding Guidelines and Implementation of Audio-Only Telehealth Services


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today spoke with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan and urged him to issue guidance on the implementation of the $100 billion Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund for hospitals across the nation, which would be a great benefit to West Virginia providers who are in critical need. Senator Manchin also pushed for guidance from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on the implementation of audio-only telehealth services.

"Today I spoke with HHS Deputy Secretary Hargan and urged him to move faster to implement two vital changes in the CARES Act, the $100 billion fund for hospitals and the ability for providers to offer audio-only telehealth services. For hospitals in West Virginia, especially our rural hospitals, they are functioning on a shoe-string budget to provide essential care to West Virginians who have COVID-19 and have lost the majority of their income from elective surgeries, this funding is vital to staying afloat during this pandemic," said Senator Manchin. "With the unprecedented necessity to distance ourselves from one another, telehealth services are also becoming vital to keeping our communities healthy and safe. In a state like West Virginia that has major issues with reliable broadband coverage, the allowance for audio-only telehealth will be a life-changing service for many West Virginians, but providers need guidance on how to deliver these services. Deputy Secretary Hargan assured me that he would get answers to my questions and would work for a speedy implementation of these policy changes."
