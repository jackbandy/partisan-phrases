Manchin, Capito Announce More Than $22 Million for Health Centers Across West Virginia Amid Coronavirus Pandemic


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced $22,161,110 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for 28 health centers across West Virginia. This funding, which was made possible following President Trump's signing of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), will help community health centers battle the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) by detecting and preventing the virus, as well as increase health capacity and staffing levels of the facilities.

"Health centers play a vital role in West Virginia's healthcare system and are even more essential now as we deal with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Most healthcare facilities have limited the procedures they are performing to try to control the spread of COVID-19 and to ensure their beds are open to patients with the coronavirus. This severely reduces their cash flow and with many rural facilities already on a shoestring budget before this pandemic, our healthcare system is in dire need of support. This funding will greatly help our health centers stay afloat during these difficult times so they can continue to provide West Virginians with the care they need. However, we need more dedicated funding for rural hospitals and healthcare providers which is why I will continue advocating for rural states to receive this dedicated funding in the next emergency response package," said Senator Manchin.

"In a rural state like West Virginia, our community health centers provide a robust portion of our health services. It's absolutely critical that our health centers are equipped and prepared with the resources and tools necessary to meet the challenges of the coronavirus outbreak," said Senator Capito. "This funding will help strengthen the response efforts of these health centers across our state, and will help make sure West Virginians have access to the vital care that they need. We are at a crucial point in this outbreak, and must do all we can to protect not only ourselves and those around us, but all of our fellow West Virginians and Americans as well. I am very pleased to see this much needed funding coming to our state, and will continue to advocate for the fast delivery of the support we need in West Virginia."
