Manchin Statement on Nationwide Social Justice Action


Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on the social justice actions across America over the past several days.

"My heart aches. Far too many African American men and women have been wrongfully killed, and those responsible have not been held accountable. The tragic death of George Floyd has evoked collective outrage and pain. I thank my fellow West Virginians for taking social justice action in communities across West Virginia and ensuring their voices are heard on these tragedies. One thing is clear: What we have done in the past is not enough. Our country must address systemic injustices and do the hard work required to move forward. Transformative change is possible but it requires collective action. Nearly 53 years ago, Martin Luther King Jr. said that social rallies such as these were the language of the unheard. I urge lawmakers on the local, state, and national level to hear the cries of their constituents and take meaningful action to end these injustices. I am listening."
