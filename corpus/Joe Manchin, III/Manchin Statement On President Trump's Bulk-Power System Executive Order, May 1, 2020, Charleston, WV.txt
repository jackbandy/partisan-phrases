Manchin Statement On President Trump's Bulk-Power System Executive Order


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today released the following statement on President Trump's Executive Order to secure America's Bulk-Power System. The Bulk-Power System is vital to the Nation's energy security, supporting national defense, emergency services, critical infrastructure, and the economy. 

"Today President Trump took an important step towards safeguarding the nation's electric grid from possible security attacks from foreign actors -- a step Senator King and I called for over a year ago.  I'm pleased that the President has directed agencies across the federal government to work together to make sure we have safe and secure supply chains for critical infrastructure like the bulk power system."
