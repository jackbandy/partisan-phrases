Manchin: We Must Support those on the Front Lines with Medical Supplies


Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) is calling for West Virginians to support our medical professionals by making medical supplies they need desperately during the coronavirus outbreak.

"West Virginians have always supported those on the front lines. Right now, our medical professionals are on the front lines. It's more important now than ever to support them as they fight this virus. Today I'm calling on West Virginians and our companies to be creative and do what they can to supply the crucial gear our medical professionals need. I'll be keeping you informed on how to do this in the coming days. If you're in the Charleston area, here's how you can help now," said Senator Manchin.
