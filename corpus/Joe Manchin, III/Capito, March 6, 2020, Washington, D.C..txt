Capito, Manchin Announce More Than $1 Million for Rainelle Storm Water Project


U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced a grant of $1,084,875 for a storm water project in Rainelle. Funding is provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and will reduce major flood risk impacting the town due to the water flow of Little Sewell Creek, Sewell Creek, and Meadow River.

"After the devastating floods in 2016, it is essential that we take the necessary steps to ensure our communities are properly prepared," said Chairman Capito. "Since then, I have continuously worked with FEMA to make sure that our recovery efforts are both effective and fully funded. This grant will help us create solutions in Rainelle that will safeguard the town from further damage and protect the community for future generations. I thank DHS and FEMA for their support in our recovery efforts and look forward to the impact of this project in Rainelle."

"In recent years, West Virginia has endured multiple weather-related disasters that continue to impact our infrastructure. Although West Virginians have bounced back from these awful disasters, there is still more work to do to rebuild our communities, and the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program plays a crucial role in building resiliency against future disasters. I will continue to work with FEMA to bring funding to West Virginia that will reduce flood risk as well as rebuild communities that have been impacted by weather-related disasters and I will continue to fight to ensure that the federal government is a reliable partner in our ongoing recovery efforts across the state," said Senator Manchin.
