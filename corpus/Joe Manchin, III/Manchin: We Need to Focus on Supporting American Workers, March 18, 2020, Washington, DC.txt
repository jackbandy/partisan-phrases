Manchin: We Need to Focus on Supporting American Workers, Small Businesses


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today released the following statement on focusing on medical research and supporting American workers and small businesses.

"My top priority remains the health and safety of every West Virginian as we fight to end the COVID-19 pandemic. The government's main focus right now must be two-fold: investing in medical research to quickly end this pandemic and supporting the average American worker and small business owners who are being financially impacted during this time. We can support American workers by removing the waiting period for those applying for unemployment, raising the dollar amount and creating a small business stimulus. But we do not need to be in the business of sending $1,000 checks to individuals like myself who are continuing to get a paycheck and not seeing negative financial impacts," said Senator Manchin.
