Manchin Applauds Veterans Affairs Committee Passage of Ten Bills Including Landmark Legislation on Veterans Mental Health and Suicide Prevention


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Veterans Affairs (VA) Committee, today applauded the passage of ten bills from the VA Committee. The legislation passed addresses Veterans mental health, including a suicide prevention bill Senator Manchin introduced in March 2019 to help prevent Veterans from dying by suicide. The legislation also includes important legislation for West Virginia Veterans to modernize and expand Veterans rural transportation. The legislation now goes to the full Senate for consideration.

"Today the Senate VA Committee passed ten bills out of committee. This shows that strong, bipartisan legislation is possible when we are willing to compromise and work together in a bipartisan way to better the lives of our Veterans who have bravely served our country and protected the freedoms we hold dear every day. The legislation includes language to prioritize Veterans mental healthcare, improve Veterans rural transportation, and expand telehealth services for our Veterans. I am proud of my fellow committee members who have worked tirelessly to ensure that the committee honored our duty to serve Veterans across America and I look forward to the full Senate and House passing this legislation and seeing the President sign these bills into law," said Senator Manchin.
