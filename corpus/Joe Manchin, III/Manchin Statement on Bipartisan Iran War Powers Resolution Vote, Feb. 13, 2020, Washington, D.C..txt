Manchin Statement on Bipartisan Iran War Powers Resolution Vote


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on his vote to support S.J.Res 68, the bipartisan Iran War Powers Resolution, which requires the President to receive direct authorization or declaration from Congress for the use of military force against Iran.

"The late Senator Robert C. Byrd liked to say he worked with 10 Presidents but he never worked for one because Congress and the President are equal branches of government. I voted to approve S.J.Res 68, the Iran War Powers Resolution, to ensure the President must work with Congress and receive authorization in order to engage in hostilities against Iran. The authority to use military force has always been the responsibility of Congress not one individual. I take that responsibility very seriously. As a U.S. Senator from West Virginia -- which is proud to be the home of so many Veterans -- and a member of the Senate Armed Services and Veterans' Affairs Committees, I am convinced that we must have our allies around the world join with us to work towards achieving peace in the Middle East. When it comes to the security of our country, we should not be Democrats or Republicans -- we must always be Americans first."
