Manchin, Capito Announce More Than $47 Million for Housing Development Across West Virginia


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $47,559,125 from the U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for various housing development programs across West Virginia.

"Every West Virginian deserves to have a roof over their head, regardless of where they live or their background. This funding will help provide that basic necessity for people across our state. I am proud of HUD's investment into our state and our housing programs which help provide affordable housing, developing public housing projects, expanding economic opportunities, and providing permanent housing options for those experiencing homelessness. These are essential programs that benefit many West Virginians, and I will continue to advocate for these HUD programs that provide so much for our citizens," said Senator Manchin.

"It is such great news that HUD is continuing their commitment to West Virginia by providing funding to develop communities in our state. These grants will not only expand economic opportunities and sustainable living environments, but also help those who have stumbled to get back on their feet," Senator Capito said. "I will continue to fight for funding that provides housing support and work with HUD to help those in need."
