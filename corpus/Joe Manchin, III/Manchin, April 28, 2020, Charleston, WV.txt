Manchin, Capito Announce More than $3 Million from HUD for Public Housing Relief in West Virginia Amid Coronavirus Outbreak


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $3,044,576 for local housing authorities across West Virginia in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. This funding is made available through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Public Housing Operation Fund, which received additional funding in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) that was signed into law on Friday, March 27. This funding will provide West Virginia communities with financial resources to manage and maintain resident services, as well as support and respond to the coronavirus pandemic in public housing.

"Everyone deserves to have a roof over their head, no matter their circumstances. Affordable housing is essential and the COVID-19 pandemic has only made things more difficult for the hard-working people of West Virginia. I am pleased that public housing authorities across West Virginia are receiving this funding to help ensure that every West Virginian has a safe place to rest. I will continue to fight for funding that helps everyone in the Mountain State have a roof over their head and a chance to get back on their feet," said Senator Manchin.

 "The coronavirus pandemic has impacted so many aspects of our communities, including public housing in our state. As part of our response, we must ensure that residents of the Mountain State have access to affordable and safe housing, especially as we adjust to social distancing measures and increased times in our home. The Trump Administration and HUD have been steadfast partners with West Virginia and our public housing sector in our response to the coronavirus outbreak, and I am thrilled to see this additional funding coming to support our resident services. West Virginians have done a fantastic job stepping up to the challenges that COVID-19 imposed on our state, and I could not be more proud of our courage and resourcefulness. I will continue to fight for the resources our state needs in our response to this pandemic," said Senator Capito.
