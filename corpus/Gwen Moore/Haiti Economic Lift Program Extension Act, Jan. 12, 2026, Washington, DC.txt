Haiti Economic Lift Program Extension Act


Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, let me just thank the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for yielding.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the reauthorization of the  Haiti-specific U.S. trade preference programs. Haiti, of course, is  suffering from grave instability and security risks.

As we know, the ransom that Haiti paid to colonial France for its  freedom continues to be at the cornerstone of its instability. I am  telling you, Madam Speaker, that the least and the minimum that the  United States can do to help stabilize the incredibly precarious  situation in a land a stone's throw away from our shores, is to  reauthorize these programs.

President Trump has lifted up the need to fortify economic and  security interests in our hemisphere, and I can think of no better way  to buoy these interests than support the bipartisan HOPE/HEALTH  programs.

Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. These programs are not without need of  reform. However, reauthorization is crucial to the economic growth and  stability and to protect our economic security and interests in our  hemisphere.

Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation.
