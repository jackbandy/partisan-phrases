Social Security Child Protection Act of 2025

I certainly think that H.R. 5348, the Social Security Child  Protection Act of 2025, which passed the Ways and Means Committee with  overwhelming bipartisan support, deserves to be supported by this body.

As has been indicated, this legislation would direct the SSA to issue  a new Social Security number to a child under 14 if it was stolen in  the course of being mailed.

The current policy brings nothing but misery upon a child and a new  family, and I think that this is a commonsense effort to mend this  grievous bureaucratic conundrum that parents have to face.

Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill, and it will strengthen  customer service for children whose Social Security card has been lost  or stolen in the mail.

While Mr. Smucker described this as a very simple, commonsense bill,  I think the importance of this is it demonstrates that on a bipartisan  basis we can solve problems. You always start with the little things  and work yourself forward.

If providing greater customer service through the Social Security  Administration is a goal that has strong bipartisan support, I think  that that really gives us a runway to do bigger things.
