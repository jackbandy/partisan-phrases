Recognizing Milwaukee's Severe Flooding

Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in agony about the  severe flooding that recently struck southeastern Wisconsin, hitting my  district and my constituents hard.

On August 9, the so-called 1000-year flood dumped record rainfall  across Wisconsin, bringing flooding and sewage backup that cost  millions of dollars in damage, left thousands without power, and forced  many from their homes.

Recent reports indicate that this flooding has been responsible for a  loss of life. I have no doubt that many more lives would have been lost  were it not for the tireless work of our brave first responders.

The fire department from Milwaukee, for example, responded to over  600 calls, rescuing people from their cars who were trapped by the  surging floodwaters.

At Governor Tony Evers' request, FEMA teams have worked alongside  State and county authorities to fully assess the damage wrought by this  flooding. With that work largely done now, the Governor has requested a  major disaster declaration that would unlock Federal assistance for  many households, businesses, and the public.

We are still trying to put this all together and figure out how to  pay for this. I urge our President to immediately approve Governor  Evers' request for a Federal disaster declaration, a request supported  by the entire delegation on both sides of the aisle.

Mr. Speaker, this just shows us the irreplaceable role of the Federal  Government in helping to put victims' lives back together.
