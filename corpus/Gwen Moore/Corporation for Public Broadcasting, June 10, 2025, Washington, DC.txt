Corporation for Public Broadcasting


Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, did you grow up watching  ``Clifford the Big Red Dog,'' or ``Sesame Street,'' or ``Reading  Rainbow?''

Did you spend time in ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,'' Mr. Speaker?

Mr. Speaker, maybe you enjoyed watching ``Finding Your Roots'' with  Dr. Henry Louis Gates, or ``FRONTLINE'' documentaries.

If so, Mr. Speaker, you have the Corporation for Public Broadcasting  to thank.

However, now Republicans are trying to take them down. Yes,  Republicans are trying to get rid of your favorite PBS stations, Mr.  Speaker. They are coming for Big Bird again.

Our youngest constituents, our babies, have so much to lose if PBS is  gutted. PBS provides educational programs for our children and locally  tailored content for families. It is free, and it doesn't require  expensive cable or streaming subscriptions.

PBS and its affiliate stations also provide emergency alerts that are  quick and reliable, reaching 97 percent of households during natural  disasters.

Republicans' devastating cuts would mean many PBS stations would be  forced to shutter, especially those in rural areas. They likely won't  be able to fill the gap.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting needs and deserves support  from Congress.
