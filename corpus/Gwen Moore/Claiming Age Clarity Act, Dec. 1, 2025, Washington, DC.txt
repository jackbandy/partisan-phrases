Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5284, the Claiming Age Clarity  Act. I thank my colleagues, Mr. Smucker and Mr. Beyer, for their  leadership on this important legislation.

As Mr. Smith has described, these changes will better help seniors  understand the advantages and disadvantages of claiming at different  ages. I certainly know folks among my constituency who are faced with  this confusion. This bill addresses that.

I want to quote Mr. Beyer, who is not with us. He is an author of the  bill, along with Mr. Smucker. He noted, in our committee report, this  bill ``doesn't solve the big picture on Social Security, which this  committee presides over, nor does it fix the data privacy, customer  service, or staffing disaster that DOGE and this administration have  put on this agency, but it will help on the margins, and I am glad that  this little bill is seeing the light today.''

Mr. Speaker, this bill passed the Committee on Ways and Means with  overwhelming bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to support this commonsense legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I think this is a commonsense bill, and I am so happy  that our colleagues thought it appropriate to bring it forward to help  older Americans make better-informed decisions.

As I indicated, I have had friends who retired at age 62 and thought  that that would be a better time based on the misinterpretation of the  language.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
