History is Watching

Ms. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, we have a President who is corrupt, criminal,  and craven to the core, a President who has declared war on American  cities and flooded the streets with untrained, unqualified, and  unidentified agents.

When agents show up in unmarked vehicles wearing masks without  warrants, without body cams, targeting people based on their race or  the sound of their voice, and detaining people without cause, that is  not law enforcement. That is lawlessness.

The result is a tragedy. Renee Good is dead.

In the days since, there has been no remorse and no accountability  from the White House. Instead, the President doubled down with more  agents and more confrontation. It is violence they want to happen, with  no apologies and no shame; far from it. In fact, they want more.

This is not normal, and it is not right. We must stand united against  this illegal and immoral agenda. History is watching.
