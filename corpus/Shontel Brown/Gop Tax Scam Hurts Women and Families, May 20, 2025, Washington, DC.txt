Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families

Ms. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with Leader Jeffries and  my Democratic Women's Caucus colleagues to oppose harmful cuts to food  and health assistance.

Today, I rise to share the story of Cheryl from Cleveland Heights, a  constituent whose life could be upended by cuts to SNAP and Medicaid.

Cheryl is a retired small business owner who ran an advertising  company with her husband for 25 years. They were forced to close that  business due to their health issues.

Cheryl lives with chronic respiratory issues and arthritis. Her  husband is disabled. She also takes care of her 90-year-old father who  is disabled, too. None of them can work, and they depend on SNAP and  Medicaid to survive. If Congress guts these programs, it will gut a  lifeline for Cheryl and her family.

Mr. Speaker, we must remember who we are here to serve. These are  real people with real lives, and we must stand up for them.
