Ice Coming to Springfield, Ohio

Ms. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, in Springfield, Ohio, families are preparing  for the worst kind of ICE storm, a storm fueled by hate and racism,  years in the making.

In 2024, Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, peddled hateful lies about  Haitians in Springfield. Vance even admitted they weren't true. He  said: ``If I have to create stories . . . that is what I am going to  do.''

Well, those stories dehumanized Haitians who were here legally  working and rebuilding a city. Now the Trump administration is turning  those lies into policy.

Tomorrow, they plan to revoke TPS, despite Haiti's collapse. Legal  status today, illegal status tomorrow. This is the Project 2025  playbook for a morally corrupt mass deportation machine.

For those of us with Black skin, the demonization of Haitian people  is something that we see, we hear, and we feel deeply.

This country must do better, and this President must extend TPS  status and call off the ICE surge now.
