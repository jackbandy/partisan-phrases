Ms. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member McGovern for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and the  underlying bill.

For the first time in history, this bill would force States to pay  for part of SNAP benefits, and it would require States to increase  their share of administrative costs.

This is an unfunded mandate, plain and simple.

Let's be clear. The costs are staggering, the consequences are  devastating, and the cruelty is deeply disturbing.

This policy punishes those who can least afford it: seniors on a  fixed income, veterans, and families already forced to choose between  gas and groceries.

States will be stuck in a corner. They will cut benefits, cut  eligibility, or cut public safety, education, housing, and mental  health programs just to stay afloat.

This isn't just a budgeting decision. It is a values decision, and  for what? All to take from the hungry and give it to the wealthy. To  slash SNAP benefits just $6 per day hands a quarter-million-dollar tax  break to the top 0.1 percent. That is not policy. That is plunder. The  math doesn't lie.

In North Carolina, it is $400 million. That is more than the entire  State budget for child development and early education. In Georgia, it  is $500 million, double what the State spends on child welfare. In my  State of Ohio, it is $300 million, four times the transportation  budget.

My colleagues are writing checks that the government can't cash. When  the money runs out, the food runs out. Children will go hungry. Seniors  will skip meals. Veterans, working moms, and working dads will be  turned down  and turned away all because of a vote taken here today.

This mandate isn't just unfunded. It is unfathomable.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this provision, reject  this rule, and reject this betrayal. Don't reward the rich on the backs  of hungry Americans.
