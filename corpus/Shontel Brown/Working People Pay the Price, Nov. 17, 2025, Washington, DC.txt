Working People Pay the Price

Ms. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, how do we know if this President is working  for us? He is working for us if we make over $4 million and are about  to pocket a new tax cut of $300,000.

He is working for us if we attend Great Gatsby parties at his club or  plan to sip cocktails in his new White House ballroom.

He is working for us if we bankroll his crypto schemes or pony up for  Presidential pardons.

He is working for us if we are wealthy, well-connected, and don't  want the Epstein files to see the light of day.

Mr. Speaker, if we are struggling to afford rent or groceries, if  premiums are breaking our budget, he is not working for us. No, he is  driving up our costs by imposing reckless tariffs and cutting SNAP,  Medicaid, and ACA subsidies. This President works for the wealthy, and  working people are paying the price.
