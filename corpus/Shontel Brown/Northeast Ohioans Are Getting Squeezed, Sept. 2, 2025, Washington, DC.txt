Northeast Ohioans Are Getting Squeezed

Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I have just come back from our  district work period in northeast Ohio, and let me tell you, Madam  Speaker, there is nothing better than being home being in our churches,  in our union halls, and our community centers listening to the people I  serve.

Let me tell you what I heard, Madam Speaker. It was crystal clear.  People are getting squeezed.

Groceries--a very old fashioned word--are too expensive. Gas is too  expensive. Housing is way too expensive, and Trump's chaos and  corruption are making it all worse.

I heard how tariffs are jacking up prices, crushing small businesses,  and threatening workers. I heard how the one big, ugly bill is about to  make utility bills, student loans, and grocery costs skyrocket, all to  give the richest Americans more tax breaks.

I heard how the President's cancellation of community safety funding  will make our neighborhoods less safe, and I heard how his attacks on  unions at the VA and FEMA will ripple right into the private sector,  hurting working men and women everywhere.

Donald Trump's latest stunt, firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa  Cook, is illegal, reckless, and a straight-up power grab designed to  give him control of the Fed and raise costs for families.

An independent Federal Reserve is the bedrock of American prosperity.  If you undermine it, retirement savings vanish, mortgage rates climb,  and life gets more expensive for everyone.

Madam Speaker, this is bigger than economics. This is about freedom.  Take a look around our country. We have military patrols in American  cities, political investigations of the President's critics, mass  detentions without due process, Federal agents hidden behind masks,  museums ordered to rewrite history, the government bullying private  companies and universities, and banners of the President's face that  would even make Kim Jong-un blush.

This is a toxic agenda, and the President knows it. That is why he is  changing the rules in the middle of the game. Need I remind you, 4  years ago, he demanded Georgia find him votes? Now, he is demanding red  States find him more seats in Congress.

All this for what? So Donald Trump can enrich himself and his  billionaire allies while everyday, hardworking Americans pay the bill.

I just have to ask, Madam Speaker: Where are the so-called  constitutional conservatives? Will even one of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle find the courage to stand up? Have they not  learned that cowering before this man only works until he decides you  are expendable?

It may be easy to look away when people are without welfare status,  when they suffer, or when people you don't like are targeted, fired, or  erased. It may be easy when the victims live in places like Cleveland,  Chicago, or Washington, but be clear: It never ends there.

As a Black woman, I know who the cruel and oppressive executive  orders and policies punish first, but I also know this: Once it starts,  everyone is punished.

This is the moment to defend our economy, to defend our Constitution,  and to defend our freedoms and elections.

Madam Speaker, let me close with this. Last week, President Trump  said: I have the right to do anything I want to do. I am the President  of the United States.

He said it and laid it on the table in plain sight for all of us to  see. He wants no checks, no balances, not from the courts, not from  Congress, and not from the voters.

It is time to wake up, America, before it is too late.
