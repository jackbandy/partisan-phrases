Ms. CASTOR of Florida. On behalf of the over half a million  hardworking neighbors back home and across the Tampa Bay area, I rise  in strong support of the extension of the lifesaving and cost-saving  ACA tax credits.

Families are being crushed by inflation and high healthcare costs,  and they need the savings that the ACA tax credits provide. Mr.  Speaker, 4.7 million Floridians, one in five who live in the Sunshine  State, depend on the ACA. It is estimated that without the tax credits,  over 1.4 million Floridians will lose their health insurance entirely.

They are entrepreneurs. They are caregivers. They are cancer  patients. They are part-time workers. They are small-business workers  who have seen their premiums more than double, and they deserve so much  better.

That includes Yohanna, a small business owner in Tampa and the mother  of a daughter with Down syndrome, who without enhanced tax credits  defaults to an insurance plan where every visit will cost her $150 for  a copay. It includes Matthew, a truck driver from St. Petersburg, whose  premiums rose from $64 a month to $736 per month.

We need to extend these tax credits, and we need to do it now.
