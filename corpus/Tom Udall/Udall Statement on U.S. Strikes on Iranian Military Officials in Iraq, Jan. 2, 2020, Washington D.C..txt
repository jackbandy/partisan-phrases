Udall Statement on U.S. Strikes on Iranian Military Officials in Iraq


Today, U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-N.M.), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and author of a bipartisan amendment to prevent an unauthorized war with Iran, issued the following statement after U.S. air strikes killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and other Iranian military officials:

"President Trump is bringing our nation to the brink of an illegal war with Iran without any congressional approval as required under the Constitution of the United States. Such a reckless escalation of hostilities is likely a violation of Congress' war making authority -- as well as our basing agreement with Iraq -- putting U.S. forces and citizens in danger and very possibly sinking us into another disastrous war in the Middle East that the American people are not asking for and do not support. Congress must step in immediately to reclaim its Constitutional war powers. I urge members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to show courage on this issue, and I urge the Trump administration to change course and pursue diplomacy before we are entangled in yet another war in the Middle East with no end in sight."
