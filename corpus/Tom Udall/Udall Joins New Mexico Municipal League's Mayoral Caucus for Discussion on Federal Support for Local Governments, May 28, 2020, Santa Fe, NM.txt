Udall Joins New Mexico Municipal League's Mayoral Caucus for Discussion on Federal Support for Local Governments


Today, U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-N.M.) joined the New Mexico Municipal League's weekly caucus call with mayors to discuss the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their communities. During the call with approximately 60 mayors from around the state, Udall outlined measures the U.S. Senate should take in its next COVID-19 relief bill to support local government and New Mexico communities.

 

"I realize your plates are full now," Udall said. "You're on the frontlines as your communities confront the dual health and economic crises we now face. Your residents' health and safety is at risk. Your local economies are threatened. And your revenue streams are taking a terrible dive.

 

"Congress needs to make sure local governments remain fiscally sound so you can continue to provide essential services to your communities," Udall continued. "That is one reason why I supported the CARES Act: it provides aid to state and local governments. 

 

"I want to see a bipartisan bill coming from the Senate that supports local governments -- with $375 billion dollars, distributed based on city and county populations; establishes a Heroes' Fund for essential workers to receive hazard pay; and supports testing, tracing and treatment of COVID-19."

 

Udall said, "It's critical that we hear from you about the impacts you're seeing in your communities as we continue to work on funding formulas for upcoming legislation."

 

As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Udall has been pushing federal agencies to meet the needs of communities in New Mexico and around the nation by expeditiously implementing Congress's COVID-19 relief measures and by advocating for local and state governments to be allowed to use CARES Act funding to make up for revenue lost due to coronavirus impacts on the economy.
