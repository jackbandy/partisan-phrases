Letter to Colleagues - Udall, Paul Call for Vote on Bipartisan Bill to Prevent Unconstitutional War with Iran


Dear Colleague,

As the New Year began, President Trump entered the United States into hostilities against Iran without Congressional approval. Last year, Congress took a stand against such actions when a bipartisan majority of members in both the House and Senate voted in favor of our amendment to the Fiscal Year 2020 Defense Authorization to Prevent an Unconstitutional War with Iran.

With tensions in the region continuing to escalate, we urge all Senators to join as cosponsors of S. 1039, The Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act. Introduced on April 4, 2019, this legislation prohibits the military operations against Iran without approval from Congress.  This important bipartisan bill would work to restore the Constitutional balance between the Congress and the executive and curtail this administration's reckless actions in the Middle East against Iran. S. 1039 is currently cosponsored by 27 members of the Senate. I urge you to cosponsor this important legislation, and I call on Senate leadership to bring this legislation to the floor immediately.
