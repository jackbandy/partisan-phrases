Udall Statement on Need for Comprehensive Plan to Tackle Global Coronavirus


U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-N.M.) released the following statement urging the Trump adminstration to develop and implement a comprehensive response to the novel coronavirus:

"The United States needs a full and detailed plan -- with the necessary resources behind it -- to confront this global health crisis before states like New Mexico are impacted. I'm concerned that President Trump and his administration have not taken the threat of coronavirus seriously up to this point, and I'm especially concerned that the administration has continually proposed major cuts to public health and the Centers of Disease Control budget. In the absence of real leadership from the White House, Congress should act swiftly to provide the desperately needed resources to prepare for this imminent threat. My office is working with the state of New Mexico to ensure we have the necessary resources to protect all of our state's communities. I appreciate the hard work of medical and public health experts at the New Mexico Department of Health and the CDC, and I encourage New Mexicans to rely on these agencies for accurate, reliable and up to date information. Importantly, the president must be reminded that it is highly irresponsible to peddle any misinformation for political purposes like protecting his re-election fortunes, and the White House must not silence or meddle with the unbiased medical advice and scientific information the public deserves. The White House needs to put in place the plan and personnel needed to make sure that the U.S. is adequately prepared to combat spread of the virus, and I am going to work to ensure that Congress provides the necessary resources."
