Udall Applauds Senate Passage of Legislation to Increase Access to Drinking Water in Indian Country, Health Care for Native Veterans and Teachers


Today, U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-N.M.), vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, released the following statement on Senate passage of a Udall-led Senate Committee on Indian Affairs package including the Health Care Access for Urban Native Veterans Act, sponsored by Udall; the Tribal School Federal Insurance Parity Act, co-sponsored by Udall; and the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Completion Act, sponsored by Udall. The Senate package that passed unanimously last week also included the Navajo Utah Water Rights Settlement Act and other Tribal water settlement-related provisions.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a disheartening reminder that basic needs remain unmet for far too many in Indian Country," Udall said. "These bills will provide Native communities with more tools, including improved health care access and safe, reliable sanitation infrastructure, to address this unprecedented public health crisis."

"I am pleased that the Senate was able to work in a bipartisan manner to pass my bills that ensure the United States meets its obligation to provide benefits to those teachers and veterans who serve their communities, recognizes Tribal water rights, and lives up to our trust and treaty obligations," Udall continued. "While much more work needs to be done to address the chronically underfunded Indian health system, ensure Native schools can recruit and retain world-class educators, and secure the water rights of Indian tribes, the passage of these bills is an important step forward. I look forward to working with the House of Representatives to make sure this package is enacted into law as soon as possible." 

The package of bills includes:
