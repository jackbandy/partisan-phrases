Udall Statement on Trump LWCF Tweet


Today, U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-N.M.), ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, released the following statement on President Trump's tweet that he is "calling on Congress to send [him] a Bill that fully and permanently funds the LWCF," despite his administration cutting funding for LWCF by 97 percent in its latest budget:

"I welcome the president's apparent newfound support for the Land and Water Conservation Fund -- and I hope that someone will show him his own budget request, which once again cuts LWCF by a shocking 97 percent. If the president truly supports our bipartisan action to fully fund the LWCF, he should quickly amend his own budget proposal, and I look forward to his support of our bipartisan bill for permanent, mandatory LWCF funding that has the strong support of Senate Democrats. The president is right to sense that this is a popular issue--a recent Conservation in the West poll found that 70 percent of westerners, including majorities of both parties, support full funding of the LWCF.  If the president is sincere in abandoning his administration's previous attempts to gut the LWCF, I'd be eager to work across party lineswith him to get this done for the American people and for future generations. But if today's announcement is only a political ploy, voters across the West will see through any such charade and hold him accountable."
