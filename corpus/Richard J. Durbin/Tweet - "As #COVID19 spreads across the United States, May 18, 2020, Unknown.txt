"As #COVID19 spreads across the United States, @ChuckGrassley & I asked the DOJ Inspector General to assess how the Bureau of Prisons was handling the situation. Last week, DOJ IG Horowitz sent us his response."

"I'm grateful that IG Horowitz committed to expanding his investigation & making his findings public so that the American people can have an independent assessment of what is being done to stem #COVID19 outbreaks in federal prisons, which are hotbeds for infection."

"Congress acted quickly to equip DOJ & BOP w/the tools to release or transfer to home confinement incarcerated individuals at high risk for suffering complications from #COVID19. BOP must use these tools to protect the health & safety of inmates, BOP staff, & local communities."
