"ICMYI: Last night, I went to the Senate floor to share the story of Dr. Ram Alur - an immigrant physician at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Marion, IL, and one of the many #ImmigrantHealthHeroes helping our nation battle #COVID19."

"Dr. Alur is also one of thousands of doctors stuck in the green-card backlog, forced to wait decades for the certainty of citizenship. If anything were to happen to him in the meantime, his family would lose their immigration status and be forced to leave the United States."

"I introduced the bipartisan Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act with @sendavidperdue to help #ImmigrantHealthHeroes like Dr. Alur. Under our bill, Dr. Alur & thousands like him, & their families would quickly receive the permanent immigration status they deserve."

"We must do more to help the hundreds of thousands of #ImmigrantHealthHeroes who are helping our nation stop the spread of #COVID19 & saving lives. I hope that even in these divided times we can come together in Congress to quickly aid these immigrant health heroes."
