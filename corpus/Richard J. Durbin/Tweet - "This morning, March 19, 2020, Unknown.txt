Tweet - "This morning, I spoke with  @GovPritzker  -- he told me IL is still desperate for testing kits, and we don't have anywhere near the number of tests we'd need to accurately measure the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in IL. That is an unacceptable failure by this Administration."

"Until we get the test kits we need, it will be next to impossible for IL to measure or contain the spread of this virus. 

We need these test kits, and we need them TODAY. With every passing moment, this virus is spreading throughout our state and putting more lives at risk."
