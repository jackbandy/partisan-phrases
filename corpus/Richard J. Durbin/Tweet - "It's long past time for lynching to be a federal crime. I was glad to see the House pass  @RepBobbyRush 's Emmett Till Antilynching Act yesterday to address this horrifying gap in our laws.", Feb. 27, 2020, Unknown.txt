"It's long past time for lynching to be a federal crime. I was glad to see the House pass @RepBobbyRush's Emmett Till Antilynching Act yesterday to address this horrifying gap in our laws."

"I hope we can swiftly move this legislation in the Senate, after we passed @SenKamalaHarris, @SenBooker, and @SenatorTimScott's similar Justice for Victims of Lynching Act last year, which I was proud to cosponsor."

"It's important that we enact this legislation into law as quickly as possible. We must finally recognize our nation's painful past, and this bill is an important step toward long-overdue justice."
