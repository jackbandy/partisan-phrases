"We lose nearly 100 Americans every day to gun violence. Closing background check loopholes will help keep guns out of dangerous hands & save lives--something Americans overwhelmingly support. Yet Sen. McConnell is still sitting on #HR8. The costs of this inaction are devastating."

"Mass shootings are happening almost every day. Just last night, we saw another horrific mass shooting in Milwaukee. How much longer will Senate Republicans sit there and do nothing? Enough is enough. #HR8 is ready to go. Let us vote. #BackgroundChecksSaveLives #EndGunViolence"
