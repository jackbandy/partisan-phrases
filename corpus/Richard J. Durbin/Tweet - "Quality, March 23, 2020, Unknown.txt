"Quality, affordable health insurance for every American has never seemed as important as it does right now. 

And yet today, as the Affordable Care Act turns 10 years old, Republicans continue to fight in court to dismantle the ACA & kick 20 million Americans off their insurance."

"The coronavirus outbreak has exposed serious weaknesses in our health care system. Our ability to stop or slow a pandemic (like the one we currently face) is very much reliant upon our ability to ensure health care for every American - especially our most vulnerable communities."

"We must not let Republicans succeed in their efforts to undo the ACA and undermine health care for millions of vulnerable Americans. We must #ProtectOurCare & protect the ACA. #ACA10"
