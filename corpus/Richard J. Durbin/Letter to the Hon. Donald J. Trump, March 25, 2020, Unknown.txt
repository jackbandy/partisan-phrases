Letter to the Hon. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States - Durbin, Duckworth Urge President Trump To Support State's Request For A Major Disaster Declaration In Response To COVID-19 Pandemic


Dear Mr. President:

We write in support of Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's request for a major disaster declaration for the State of Illinois to help the State respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Governor Pritzker has indicated that this pandemic is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and local governments.  The pandemic has required extreme response efforts from the State, and federal assistance will be necessary to ensure the well-being of Illinoisans.  This disaster has placed an unprecedented economic burden on not only communities across the State, but families and individuals. 

As such, Individual Assistance (IA) is requested for all 102 counties in the State of Illinois to support people of Illinois as the pandemic remains ongoing, and to assist them on a long road to recovery; this includes access to Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Disaster Legal Services, Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program, Individuals and Household Program Assistance, Mass Care and Emergency Assistance, and Voluntary Agency Coordination.

Thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this important request.  We stand ready to assist in any way appropriate.
