Durbin Discusses Impact Of Coronavirus With AAR CORP CEO


U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today discussed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic with Illinois-based AAR Corp CEO John Holmes.  AAR Corp operates two maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facilities in Illinois, one at Rockford International Airport and one in Wood Dale, Illinois. On a call with Holmes, Durbin promised to push for financial help for airline suppliers like AAR in any federal stimulus package.

"As Congress negotiates the specifics of a financial relief package that includes support for the airline industry, we must ensure that any bill includes financial assistance to all workers in the industry.  That includes companies and employees at AAR, who are essential manufacturers and suppliers that support airlines across the country," Durbin said.
