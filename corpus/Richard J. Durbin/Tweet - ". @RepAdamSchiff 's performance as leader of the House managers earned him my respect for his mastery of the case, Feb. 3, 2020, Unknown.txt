"White House lawyer Jay Sekulow spews conspiracy theories like a late night cable TV show. Thanks to @RepJeffries for deflating the conspiracy vendors parroting Russian disinformation in the Senate."

"Special thanks to my friend, House manager @RepZoeLofgren, for her compelling analysis of the Nixon, Clinton, and Trump impeachments. Pitch perfect and persuasive."

"The House managers made clear, compelling, and thorough arguments throughout this process. I want to thank Reps. Nadler, Demings, Garcia, & Crow for their hard work. Their dedication to the truth stood in stark contrast to much of what we heard from the President's defense team."
