"Last night, I had the honor of speaking with 100 Black Men of Chicago, the Chicago chapter of 100 Black Men of America, a 25,000-member volunteer organization that works to enhance quality of life and educational and economic opportunities for African Americans."

"I was originally asked to speak about gun violence and its impact on our youth, but the conversation naturally turned to Minneapolis and the death of Mr. George Floyd. His death was a reprehensible, heartbreaking moment."

"The images of Mr. Floyd on the ground, with an officer with a knee on his neck, broke my heart and it enraged me at the same time. And we cannot forget that his death followed the recent brutal killings of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, & far too many..."

"...more people of color across the nation. We cannot call ourselves a land of justice until we honestly deal with issues of racism and the enforcement of justice in our country."

"My conversation with 100 Black Men of Chicago was moderated by CNN reporter @OmarJimenez. Just hours later, he would be arrested by the Minnesota state police for simply doing his job."
