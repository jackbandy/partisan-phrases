"Federal prisons are hotbeds for #COVID19. Testing inmates before transfer will help BOP limit the spread of this disease between facilities & to local communities. BOP made the right decision by taking our bipartisan, bicameral advice."

"As a next step, BOP must extend this policy and test every inmate in its custody and confirm they are negative for #COVID19 prior to transferring them to another BOP facility, whether from a quarantine site or other BOP institution."

"I am also glad to see that USP Thomson in IL will no longer serve as a quarantine location for newly-admitted inmates. This decision will help protect the Thomson community."
