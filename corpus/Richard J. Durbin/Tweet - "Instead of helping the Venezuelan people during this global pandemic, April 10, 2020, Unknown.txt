"Instead of helping the Venezuelan people during this global pandemic, Nicolas Maduro & his Cuban enablers are arresting & torturing those who oppose their tyranny, including aids to interim President Juan Guaidó -- Demóstenes Quijada, Maury Carrero, Rómulo Garcia, & Victor Silio."

"Quijada was reportedly tortured to try and force the location of other Guaidó colleagues.  

They must be immediately and unconditionally released along with any other political prisoners or health workers caught up in Maduro's nightmare."
