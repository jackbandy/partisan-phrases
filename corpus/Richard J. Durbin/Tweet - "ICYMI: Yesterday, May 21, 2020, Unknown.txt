"ICYMI: Yesterday, I went to the Senate floor to share the story of one of many #ImmigrantHealthHeroes helping our nation get through this #COVID19 pandemic -- Javier Quiroz Castro is a #Dreamer & nurse in Houston, TX."

"Javier works at Houston Methodist Hospital and is a part of the team treating #COVID19 patients. He wrote to tell me that "thanks to #DACA, I have been able to save a lot of lives." But Javier is also risking his own life every day that he goes in to work."

"I want to thank Javier Quiroz Castro for his service. He is a hero -- one of the many #ImmigrantHealthHeroes who are putting themselves & their families at risk to save American lives. None of them should have to worry about being deported."

"We must do better by Javier and thousands of other #DACA recipients just like him. They are counting on those of us who serve in the Senate to solve this crisis that President Trump created by repealing DACA."
