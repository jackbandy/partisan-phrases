"Thanks to John Bott, a longtime CPS teacher & Vietnam veteran, for joining me today to share his story. He's one of 190,000+ Vietnam veterans who are suffering as a result of this Administration's decision to deny these veterans their well-earned health care benefits."

"The Trump Administration must step up to provide these veterans--who have done so much for this country--with this urgently-needed support. There is no excuse for denying long suffering veterans their health care benefits & disability compensation."
