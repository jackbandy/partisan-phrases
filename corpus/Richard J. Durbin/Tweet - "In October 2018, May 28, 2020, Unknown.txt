"In October 2018, I brought together 10 of the largest hospitals serving Chicago to launch the Chicago HEAL Initiative, a 3-year project to address the root causes of violence & health disparities in our communities with the highest rates of violence, poverty, & inequality."

"Under the Chicago HEAL Initiative, these 10 hospitals are using their economic & community footprint to partner with local leaders to uplift their neighborhoods through hiring, purchasing, job training, housing, hunger, and mental health programs."

"Unfortunately, the racial and ethnic health disparities that we are striving to address have only been magnified by the #COVID19 public health crisis. The role of our leading hospitals to reach these vulnerable populations and address health inequity has never been clearer."

"Today, I am joining with these 10 hospitals to release the one-year report on the progress of the Chicago HEAL initiative. You can read the full report here:"
