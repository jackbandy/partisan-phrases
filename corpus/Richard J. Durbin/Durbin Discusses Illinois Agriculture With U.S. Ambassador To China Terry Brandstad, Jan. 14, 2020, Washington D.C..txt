Durbin Discusses Illinois Agriculture With U.S. Ambassador To China Terry Brandstad


U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, met with U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa Governor Terry Brandstad today to discuss Illinois agriculture, including President Trump's recently announced "Phase One" trade deal with China. Durbin shared his concerns with the Trump Administration's haphazard trade approach with China, and how soybean farmers in Illinois previously enjoyed a productive trade market with Chinese partners.

"As Ambassador Brandstad certainly knows, uncertainty is one of the worst enemies to a farmer," Durbin said. "I agree that China must be held to account for unfair practices. But, the President's unpredictable trade war has done serious harm to farmers, and it's time to give them the certainty they need to rebound from an incredibly difficult 2019. I appreciated Ambassador Brandstad's commitment to helping our farmers succeed."
