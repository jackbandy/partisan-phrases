U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today discussed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic with CEO and President of Darden Restaurants, Gene Lee.

"The coronavirus pandemic will undoubtedly have a serious impact on the restaurant industry as the country changes our social norms and daily lives to fight this virus. Congress must provide employees relief, including increased paid sick leave, in order to support workers and families during this coronavirus crisis," Durbin said.
