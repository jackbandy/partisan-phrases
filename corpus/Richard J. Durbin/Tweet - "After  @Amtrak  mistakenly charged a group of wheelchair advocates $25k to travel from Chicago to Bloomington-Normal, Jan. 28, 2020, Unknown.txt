"After @Amtrak mistakenly charged a group of wheelchair advocates $25k to travel from Chicago to Bloomington-Normal, @SenDuckworth & I met with Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson today to express our disappointment & urge him to improve Amtrak's disability and accessibility policies."

"During the meeting, Mr. Anderson committed to implementing much needed changes to its accessibility policies. It's imperative Amtrak updates its policies to ensure that Americans with disabilities are treated fairly & are able to access Amtrak trains w/out facing discrimination."
