"For many families in Illinois & across the U.S., SNAP is an all-important lifeline that helps puts food on the table. But under the Trump Administration's new requirements, hundreds of thousands of Americans could lose benefits. That is unacceptable."

"SNAP serves rural America just as much as urban America -- and taking food off the table won't help anyone get a job. With this "get tough" new rule set to take effect soon, many in Illinois will face new paperwork hurdles as they struggle to make ends meet."

"We must be more caring and considerate than that. While I believe that we should be incentivizing people to move towards jobs, training, & employment, we should not be withholding their food to do so. I urge the Administration to rethink this harmful SNAP policy."
