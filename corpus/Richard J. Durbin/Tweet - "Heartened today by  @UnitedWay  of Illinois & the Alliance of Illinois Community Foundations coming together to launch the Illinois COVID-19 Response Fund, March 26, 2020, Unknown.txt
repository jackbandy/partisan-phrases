"Heartened today by @UnitedWay of Illinois & the Alliance of Illinois Community Foundations coming together to launch the Illinois COVID-19 Response Fund, a statewide fundraising effort to uplift nonprofits that support Illinoisans who have been impacted by this pandemic."

"With this response fund, nonprofits can double down on efforts to offer interim housing, health services, utility assistance, and food & household necessities to people across Illinois. Proud to see our communities looking out for one another. We're in this together."
