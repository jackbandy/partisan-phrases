Durbin Meets With Illinois Corn Growers


U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, met with the Illinois Corn Growers Association to discuss agriculture priorities in Illinois, including crop conditions, trade, lock and dam infrastructure, ethanol and biofuels, and refinery waivers.

"Corn growers are an integral part of Illinois' agriculture economy, and we need to ensure they have certainty from the federal government as we head into the 2020 planting season.   Additionally, the small refinery waivers being issued by the Trump Administration have hurt the biofuel market many of the corn growers depend on.  It's time for the President to support our biofuels industry, and stop giving a break to large oil companies."

Durbin has introduced a bipartisan bill with Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Deb Fischer (R-NE) that would require the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to provide transparency with small refinery hardship waivers.
