Tweet - "The Trump Administration announced today that it will ban the sale of some flavored e-cigarette pods and cartridge products, such as those used in JUUL devices. While this is a step in the right direction, this policy still has a number of gaping holes."


"The Trump Administration announced today that it will ban the sale of some flavored e-cigarette pods and cartridge products, such as those used in JUUL devices. While this is a step in the right direction, this policy still has a number of gaping holes."

"We should be removing all e-cigarette flavors from the market--including menthol. And we should not be exempting flavored nicotine products that kids can access in vape shops. There is simply no public health benefit to allowing these flavors to remain on the market."

"While I believe that today's announcement is a positive step, it is far from a comprehensive one. We must continue working to develop a national strategy to end the youth vaping epidemic that has already impacted the lives of five million kids."
