"That's why I'm introducing the bipartisan Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act w/@sendavidperdue. Our bill will provide a temporary stopgap to quickly address our nation's shortage of nurses & doctors by re-directing unused visas to those who can aid in the fight against #COVID19."

"Our bill strengthens our health care workforce & improves access to care for Americans. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me & @sendavidperdue in support of these vital health care workers."
