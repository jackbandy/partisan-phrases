Durbin Meets With The Illinois Farm Bureau


U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, met with the Illinois Farm Bureau to discuss agriculture priorities in Illinois. During the meeting, farmers expressed concerns with the Trump Administration's uncertain trade approach with China and the Trump Administration's abuse of small oil refinery waivers that have hurt the biofuels market.

"The decision by the Trump Administration to effectively shut down the biofuels industry has hurt farmers.  When you add that to the uncertain approach the President has taken with China, Illinois farmers are taking a serious hit.  It's time to get our agriculture economy back on track and that starts with fulfilling the promises the Trump Administration made to farmers on trade aid, biofuels, and much more," Durbin said.
