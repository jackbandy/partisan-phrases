"This #BlackHistoryMonth, I'm celebrating Helen Octavia Dickens, the daughter of a former slave who went on to graduate from the @uiccom & become the first African American woman admitted to the @AmCollSurgeons."

"Dr. Dickens's work to help heal and guide women of all ages is nothing short of inspiring. Her efforts shine a light on a troubling issue the U.S. struggles with today. America has a long history of medical inequality and sadly, that history is far from over."

"From premature births to premature deaths, people of color disproportionately bear the brunt of America's troubled health care system. On average, they live sicker, die sooner, and go without needed medical care more often. That is unacceptable. We have to be better."

"Congress must fix the inequality in our health care system. I introduced the MOMMA Act to address one of the many health issues disproportionally affecting communities of color--the racial disparity in infant & maternal care. Read more about my bill here:"
