"No one should have to worry about missing a paycheck if they or a loved one becomes sick - especially during this unprecedented coronavirus pandemic. 

But sadly, every single Senate Republican voted against a bill to give all workers paid family leave yesterday."

"The PAID Leave Act would provide 14 emergency paid sick days in a public health emergency, 12 weeks of emergency paid family & medical leave, ensure workers 7 paid sick days, & more. 

Let's get this bill into the next relief package. Working families need to be our top priority."
