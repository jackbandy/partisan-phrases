"Thanks to ACA, health insurance companies can no longer deny coverage or charge higher premiums to Americans w/ pre-existing conditions, impose annual or lifetime caps on benefits, or drop someone from coverage if they get sick. Pres. Trump wants to eliminate these protections."

"Today I joined @ErieFamHealth & @Thresholdsctrs in Chicago to discuss these critical protections and call on the President to end his attacks on the ACA and instead side with Americans with pre-existing conditions."
