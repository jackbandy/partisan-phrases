"Public health experts are rightfully telling people to stay home if they're sick. But for many Americans, staying home means losing their job or a paycheck that helps them afford rent, food, & medication. We must provide these workers with assurances during these uncertain times."

"I'm proud to have introduced legislation last week with @PattyMurray that would immediately provide 14 days of paid sick leave to workers in light of coronavirus. As we work to address this public health crisis, we must not forget America's working families and small businesses."
