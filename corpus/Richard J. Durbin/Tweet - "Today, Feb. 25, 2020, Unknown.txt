"Today, HHS Sec. Azar came before the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Services Appropriations Subcommittee, where I urged him to reconsider the Trump Administration's decision to allow cheap, disposable e-cigarette flavors to stay on the market."

"Over the past two years of this presidency, our nation has seen a 135% increase in the number of children using e-cigs. 5 million of them are now vaping--that's 1 in 4 high schoolers and more than 1 in 10 middle schoolers. That is absolutely unacceptable."

"The President's promise to remove all flavored e-cigarette products from the market never happened. But it's not too late. I hope Sec. Azar will reconsider this policy and finally remove the cheap, disposable e-cig flavors that are designed to target our children from the market."
