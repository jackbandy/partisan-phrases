"In contact with @GovPritzker about arriving passenger delays at @fly2ohare of up to eight hours waiting for luggage, immigration, customs, & possible medical screening. Appears source of delays all federal and Admin was unprepared after Presidential ban on travel from Europe."

"Mixed reports from travelers today. Some facing unheard of delays on arrival waiting for health questions, baggage, and government clearance. Others walk through without even a question. Administration clearly operating without consistent and clear guidelines."

"I'm calling for additional federal resources to be immediately allocated to @fly2ohare and the other dozen airports designated to receive passengers from Europe in order to reduce wait times and help avoid having so many people in close proximity to each other."
