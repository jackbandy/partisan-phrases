Durbin Pushes For More Coronavirus Test Kit Supplies On Call With CDC Director


U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today spoke to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Robert Redfield to push for more coronavirus test kit supplies for the State of Illinois.  Durbin has urged the Trump Administration repeatedly to provide more test kit supplies and personal protective equipment as soon as possible. 

"On my call with CDC Director Redfield, I expressed my concern about the coronavirus test kit situation in Illinois.  The State is worried about running out of supplies in the near future if the CDC doesn't provide more clarity about what it is doing to ensure that won't happen. I'll continue to stay in close contact with Director Redfield about any issues Illinois faces as it continues to address this pandemic," Durbin said.
