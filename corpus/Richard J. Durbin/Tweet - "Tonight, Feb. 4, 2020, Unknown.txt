"I met De'Andre last October at a Chicago HEAL Initiative roundtable through the Northwestern Medicine Scholars Program where he shared his goals of studying medicine & giving back to his community. It is an honor to have him join me tonight."

"I started the Chicago HEAL Initiative to help hospitals & local organizations address the root causes of violence & health disparities in their communities. Having young people like De'Andre serve as role models in their neighborhoods is just one way to accomplish that goal."
