Durbin Discusses Worker Protections With National Domestic Workers Alliance Amid COVID-19 Pandemic


U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) discussed the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on domestic workers with the Executive Director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, Ai-Jen Poo. During the call, Durbin spoke about the importance of enacting hazard pay for essential workers, including domestic workers, and ensuring that mixed-status households and undocumented workers receive Economic Impact Payments and have access to COVID-19 medical treatment.

"In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, domestic workers are still showing up to care for our loved ones. We cannot forget about the health and safety of these workers," said Durbin. "I'm proud to work alongside the National Domestic Workers Alliance to fight for stronger labor protections and economic security for domestic workers and their families."

Durbin is a cosponsor of the Coronavirus Immigrant Families Protection Act, which would expand eligibility of Economic Impact Payments to those with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number and increase access to COVID-19 testing and treatment regardless of immigration status.
