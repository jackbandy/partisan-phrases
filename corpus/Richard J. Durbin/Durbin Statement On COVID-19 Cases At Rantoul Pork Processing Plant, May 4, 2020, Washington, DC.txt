Durbin Statement On COVID-19 Cases At Rantoul Pork Processing Plant


Today, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, issued the following statement after reports that 20 employees tested positive for COVID-19 at Rantoul Foods in Rantoul, Illinois:

"The President's recent executive order would require this plant in Rantoul to stay open, even after 20 employees have fallen ill to COVID-19.  That ignores the health and safety realities of this pandemic. Meat plant workers--like so many others--are risking their lives working shoulder to shoulder at these plants, and it's imperative we do everything we can to keep them safe in light of the President's mindless mandate."
