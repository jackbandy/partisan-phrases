Durbin Discusses COVID-19 Relief Bill With AAR Corp CEO


U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today discussed the COVID-19 pandemic's continued impact on airline manufacturers and suppliers with Illinois-based AAR Corp CEO John Holmes.  AAR Corp operates two maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facilities in Illinois, one at Rockford International Airport and one in Wood Dale, Illinois. On a call with Holmes, Durbin shared how the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provides eligibility for the air maintenance (MRO) industry, and approximately $61 billion in federal grants and loans for the airline industry. This would apply to AAR Corp.

"I fought to ensure the CARES Act included financial assistance to all workers in the airline manufacturing and supply industry.  AAR employs many Illinoisans in Rockford and Wood Dale, and it was important to provide relief to those workers during this unprecedented crisis for the airline industry," Durbin said.
