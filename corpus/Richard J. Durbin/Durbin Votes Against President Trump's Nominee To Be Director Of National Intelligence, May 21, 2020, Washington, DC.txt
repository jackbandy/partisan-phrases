Durbin Votes Against President Trump's Nominee To Be Director Of National Intelligence


U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Vice Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, today released the following statement after voting against Congressman John Ratcliffe (R-TX-04), President Donald Trump's nominee to be Director of National Intelligence:

"Several months ago, the White House withdrew John Ratcliffe's name to serve as Director of National Intelligence.  There were serious concerns about his experience, his resume claims, and his ability to handle this sensitive national security position in a non-partisan way.  Today, those serious concerns still remain."
