"If the Senate Republican fishing expedition into the vague conspiracy theory Pres Trump calls 'Obamagate' was on the up & up, then they'd allow witnesses with info relevant to how the Russia investigation started.  Today they did everything they could to block those witnesses."

"In the Judiciary Cmte. today I proposed subpoenas for 6 people w/relevant knowledge about the contacts between the Trump Campaign & Russia that predicated the FBI/Mueller investigations: Michael Cohen, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, Jerome Corsi, & Roger Stone."

"Senate Judiciary Republicans voted down all six subpoena amendments. They want to ignore every predicate that led up to the investigation into Russian election interference.  Frankly, this decision shows that this is not a credible exercise."
