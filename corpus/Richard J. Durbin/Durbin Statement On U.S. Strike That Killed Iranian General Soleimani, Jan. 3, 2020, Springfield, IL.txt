Durbin Statement On U.S. Strike That Killed Iranian General Soleimani


U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Vice Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, today released the following statement after the Pentagon confirmed that a U.S. strike killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad:

"The killing of Iranian General Soleimani invites even further escalation by a President who has a poor record of judgment in dealing with world powers. 

"While President Obama successfully negotiated a nuclear arms agreement with Iran that included Russia and China, President Trump walked away from the agreement and promised confrontation with Iran.  Now Iraq -- a country where America has invested thousands of American lives and trillions of taxpayer dollars -- has sided with Iran. 

"Before my Senate colleagues reflexively back the Administration, remember the Constitutional responsibility of Congress to authorize war; ask the critical questions of what led us to this point and where we are headed, and be a reliable source of support for the men and women who bear the burden of battle."
