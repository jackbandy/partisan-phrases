"We have come a long way in the last 30 years--smoking has been banned from public buildings, schools, hospitals, and restaurants. But today, Big Tobacco is pushing kid-friendly e-cigarettes in an attempt to hook a new generation on nicotine. We can't let that happen."

"I'm disappointed that Pres. Trump's promised e-cig flavor ban never materialized. In the last 2 years of his Presidency, we've seen an 135% increase in the number of kids using e-cigs, with 5 million kids now vaping. But I won't give up--the fight against Big Tobacco goes on."
