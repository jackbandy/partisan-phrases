Durbin, Duckworth Statement On Confirmation Of Second Case Of Coronavirus In Illinois


U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today released the following statement after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the second case of novel coronavirus in Illinois, the sixth confirmed case in the United States:

"Despite the risk to Americans remaining low, the CDC expected that the novel coronavirus could spread from one person to another in this country, as it has in other countries.  Federal and state officials have been closely monitoring those who have come in contact with all confirmed cases in the United States, and have now confirmed another case in Illinois.  As with the first case, we are thankful to our local medical personnel for identifying this case quickly, swiftly acting to limit exposure, and providing immediate care.  We continue to be in the earliest stages of measuring the impact of coronavirus, but we--as well as our public health agencies--are taking it very seriously.  We will remain in close contact with them as they work to address this situation."

Yesterday, Durbin and Duckworth received an update on the novel coronavirus outbreak from CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat.  On a call with Dr. Schuchat, the Senators asked about the agency's response to the coronavirus outbreak and asked for information on the steps being taken to keep Illinois families safe, including steps being taken by CDC to get lab results to Illinois quickly in order to inform the state's decision-making efforts.

On Tuesday, Durbin and Duckworth joined Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), and 28 of their Democratic Senate colleagues, in sending a letter to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar requesting updates on the Administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak.
