"I reintroduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act w/ @RepSchneider today to ensure that the federal government steps up to address these threats. We must ensure that more Americans are not violently attacked because of who they are or what they believe."

"And last week I wrote, yet again, to AG Barr & @FBI Dir. Wray calling on them to take the initiative in leading a coordinated effort by federal, state, & local law enforcement to disrupt & prevent these violent domestic terrorism & hate crime incidents before they take place."
