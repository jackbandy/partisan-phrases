"From day one, we have learned that Senator McConnell's political loyalty to this President is more important than respect for the Constitution, the integrity of the Senate, and common decency."

"With his resolution outlining the course of the trial, Sen. McConnell & those who enable him demonstrate that Republicans believe that the American people are not entitled to judge for themselves whether Pres. Trump abused the power of his office & obstructed this Congress."

"Senator McConnell and those who enable him believe that if they hurry the proceedings, restrict the evidence, limit the witnesses, and force the whole enterprise into the midnight hour, they can conceal any misconduct by the President."

"Sen. McConnell & his enablers believe the American people will not take notice. They are wrong. Americans are not asleep at the wheel of this democracy. They are wide awake to any Senator or President who disrespects their constitutional duties or claims to be above the law."

"As of this morning, a majority of the American people are calling for this President to be impeached and removed from office. If Senator McConnell has his way, critical moments in this trial may not see the light of day. But they will not escape the light of history."
