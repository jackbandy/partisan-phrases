"Instead of focusing on #COVID19, Sen. McConnell has brought Senators back to Washington to consider the nomination of his 37-year-old family friend Justin Walker to the second highest court in the land."

"Mr. Walker's record, ironically, is one of strident opposition to the Affordable Care Act, which seeks to extend health insurance coverage to more Americans. Last year he was found not qualified to serve as a district court judge in the Commonwealth of Kentucky."
