"This story in the @chicagotribune is alarming. It reveals an apparent cover-up by ArcelorMittal of its pollution of the Little Calumet River, which would be a clear violation of federal law."

"By falsifying its tests, ArcelorMittal has lied to state regulators and everyone who lives in the Lake Michigan watershed. Strong enforcement from the U.S. EPA is required. The Clean Water Act makes it clear that ArcelorMittal must be held accountable."

"I represent Lake Michigan--which the Little Calumet River feeds into--and the countless constituents who could be affected by this pollution. I will be demanding accountability. Big corporations must not be allowed to destroy our environment without repercussions."
