"Today marks the 55th anniversary of #BloodySunday, a day to honor the remarkable courage of the men and women who marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL on March 7, 1965, for the fundamental right to vote."

"Those brave men & women--including @repjohnlewis--were attacked and beaten that day, but they were not broken. Within months of the march, Pres. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, prohibiting discriminatory restrictions on the right to vote."

"Sadly, SCOTUS gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013. States across the country have since enacted numerous barriers to the ballot box. On this 55th anniversary of #BloodySunday, I hope my colleagues in Congress are reminded of what is at stake here--we must #RestoreTheVote."
