"The United States & South Korea confirmed their first #COVID19 cases on the same day. 12 weeks later, U.S. cases have spiked & South Korean cases have not.

"Right now, the US is only testing 150,000 people a day. Experts say we need to be testing at least 500,000 people a day to control this outbreak - it is the only way we will ever be able to end our nationwide shelter-in-place."

".@SenateDems understand the importance of testing. That's why we are laying out a bold, comprehensive plan to ensure #COVID19 testing is everywhere, and for everyone. You can read more about our plan here:"
