Durbin Discusses COVID-19 Relief With 10th District Residents & Cook County Commissioner Gainer


U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today joined a community conference call with 10th District residents and Cook County Commissioner Bridget Gainer to discuss COVID-19 relief and how the pandemic is continuing to affect local governments, small businesses, and essential services.  Durbin also discussed his support for an extension of the 2020 Census, food insecurity, unemployment insurance, and helping communities of color access testing.

"Illinois' local governments are facing incredible challenges responding to this public health and economic crisis. I will continue to listen to the local leaders, like Commissioner Gainer, to hear how the federal government can support their efforts to keep people healthy and financially afloat during these unprecedented times," Durbin said.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act included a State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, which provides $150 billion in direct federal grant funding to states, local governments, and tribes to help fund COVID-19 response and free up state and local funding for essential services and payroll.  Cook County received $430 million from the program.

Durbin is leading the effort to automatically extend work authorizations of DACA and TPS recipients and other impacted immigrants.  He is also cosponsoring the Coronavirus Immigrant Families Protection Act, which would help protect immigrants -- including undocumented immigrants and mixed status families -- from the COVID-19 pandemic.
