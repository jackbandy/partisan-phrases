Letter to the Hon. Pete Gaynor, Acting Admin. of the Federal Emergency Management Agency - Illinois Congressional Delegation Urges FEMA To Support State's Request For Extension Of Flood Damage Assessment In Cook And Lake Counties


Dear Administrator Gaynor:

We are writing in support of Governor JB Pritzker's request for an extension from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the State conducting a Preliminary Damage Assessment of the flooding event that occurred from January 10-11, 2020.

As you may know, severe storms brought rain, snow, ice, and high winds in excess of 50 miles per hour to Cook and Lake Counties.  This caused Lake Michigan water levels to reach an all-time January high--four inches above the previous January high set in 1987.

Given damage the flood has inflicted upon the lakefront and its communities, it is of the utmost importance that the State of Illinois submits an accurate Preliminary Damage Assessment from county-compiled information.  However, the conditions in the aftermath of the severe storms and flooding will require additional time for local governments to conduct their initial damage assessments.

We respectfully request that FEMA grant the extension request for this purpose, to ensure these counties have the opportunity to report all damages endured to their communities.

Thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this important request.
