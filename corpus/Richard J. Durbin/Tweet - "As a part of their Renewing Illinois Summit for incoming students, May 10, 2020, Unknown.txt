"As a part of their Renewing Illinois Summit for incoming students, the @PSimonInstitute asked me to provide the five books I would assign if I were teaching an Illinois 101 class.  Though it was hard stick with the 5-book limit, here are some my personal favorites:"

"1. Frontier Illinois by James E. Davis -- a treasure of information about our great state. 2. Elijah Lovejoy: Martyr to Freedom by Paul Simon -- Sen. Simon's first book tells the story of a murdered abolitionist publisher in Alton, a clear inspiration for his own life."

"3. City of the Century by Donald L. Miller -- the story of when Chicago became a world class city. You'll never look at the city in the same way after reading this one. 4. Bloody Williamson by Paul Angle -- gangland murders, blood rivalries, and corruption in Little Egypt."

"5. Henry Horner and the Burden of Tragedy by Tom Littlewood -- a respected journalist tells the story of our first Jewish governor. Enjoy!"
