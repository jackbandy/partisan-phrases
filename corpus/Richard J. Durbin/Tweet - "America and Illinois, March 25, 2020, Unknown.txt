"America and Illinois, help is on the way.

After two emergency bills were enacted with strong, bipartisan support, I'm glad the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, passed this third, historic funding bill."

"Like all compromises, this bill is not perfect. However, because @SenateDems insisted on strengthening this bill, we can now say it is a bill that puts our hospitals and health care professionals first."

"Keeping working families strong during this crisis; giving small businesses the means to re-open; & reimbursing our state and local governments for the extraordinary sacrifices they are making were our goals from the start. We have responded strongly to all of these priorities."

"As we continue to face this unprecedented public health crisis, I urge the House to pass this legislation quickly and for the President to sign it without delay."
