Durbin Discusses COVID-19 Response With Cook County Board President Preckwinkle


U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today on a call with Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Cook County Board members discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Illinois and how hospitals are fighting the pandemic on the ground.  Durbin discussed the CARES Act and provisions he fought to include that provide vital federal funding to our nation's hospitals, including John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County.  President Preckwinkle and Board members outlined how that federal funding has benefitted patients and providers in Cook County, and outlined their priorities for future coronavirus relief packages.  

"Our hospitals and their heroic workers are making incredible sacrifices as they provide tremendous treatment to help those sickened by COVID-19.   And sadly, Cook County has been hit harder than any other county in the country when it comes to this virus," Durbin said. "I will continue my work to bolster the health care workforce, expand our testing capacity, increase access to personal protective equipment for providers, and continue to provide direct assistance to hospitals throughout Illinois so they can stay on sound financial ground and continue serving their patients as we get through this national public health crisis."

Durbin promised to continue to push for additional hospital funding targeted to hospitals on the front lines, as well as policies to support the health care workforce, and increase the personal protective equipment, testing kit supplies, ventilators, and other medical resources health workers need.
