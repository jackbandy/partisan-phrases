Durbin Statement On Humanitarian Crisis In Idlib, Syria


U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today released the following statement in regards to the ongoing violence and humanitarian crisis in Idlib, Syria:

"The renewed violence directed at the civilians in Idlib by the Assad regime and its Russian enablers is an affront to our common humanity.  It is long overdue that the Trump Administration step up, along with our European allies, to foster a credible ceasefire and sustained access to humanitarian aid.  

"President Trump cannot sit silently while his friend, Russian President Vladimir Putin, openly abets the slaughter and displacement of so many innocent people in Syria.  And President Trump's UN Ambassador Kelly Craft and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo must similarly step up and put the full diplomatic weight of the United States behind a ceasefire effort and pursuit of the violence as crimes against humanity."
