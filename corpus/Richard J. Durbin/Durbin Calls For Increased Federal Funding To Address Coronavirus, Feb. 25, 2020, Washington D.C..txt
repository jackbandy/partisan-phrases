Durbin Calls For Increased Federal Funding To Address Coronavirus


U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today called on the Trump Administration to do more to address the coronavirus epidemic following the President's minimal and long overdue coronavirus funding request.  In a speech on the Senate floor, Durbin called out President Trump's continued years-long efforts to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)--two federal health agencies that our nation relies upon to respond and prepare for public health challenges.  In his fiscal Year 2021 proposed budget, President Trump advocated for cutting the CDC's budget by nine percent and the NIH's budget by seven percent. 

"When you look at the efforts that are being made here in the United States and around the world, we can and should do more.  I support [Senator Schumer's] request for a dramatic increase in funding for this purpose now before it spreads across the United States," Durbin said.

This morning, Durbin attended a Congressional briefing from the Trump Administration about the ongoing response to the coronavirus.  Last night, the Trump Administration requested an emergency supplemental funding request of $2.5 billion to combat the spread of coronavirus in the United States -- a funding level that both Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer have called inadequate.
