Durbin, Duckworth Announce $3.6 Million In Federal Funding To Help Illinois Health Centers Respond To COVID-19 Pandemic


U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today announced that Illinois received $3.6 million in federal grants to support 45 Community Health Centers (CHCs) in their COVID-19 response efforts. This funding comes from the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which was signed into law on March 6, 2020. Health centers will now be able to use the funding to help increase COVID-19 screening and testing needs, acquire medical supplies and protective equipment, and boost telehealth capacity.

"Community Health Centers are a critical resource for millions of Americans -- particularly low-income families or those without health insurance. I'm pleased this federal funding will help health centers throughout Illinois respond to and prepare for additional coronavirus cases in our communities," Durbin said.  "Senator Duckworth and I will continue to fight for additional funding to support CHCs during this unprecedented public health pandemic."

"Lives are at stake across Illinois and our country because of COVID-19 and Community Health Centers are on the front lines," Duckworth said. "I'm proud to join Senator Durbin in announcing this federal funding to help our state's health centers continue to serve their communities during this public health crisis."
