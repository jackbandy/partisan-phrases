  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Nevada.  Anna's story is so touching. This young girl, concerned about her own  future, worried about deportation, gets into a giving, caring  profession and risks her life in caring for those who may be suffering  from COVID-19. To think someone would question whether we want that  kind of person in America's future is beyond me. 

  Thank you for telling that story. It is an important part of the  Record
