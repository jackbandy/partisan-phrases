"I am joining with @SenSherrodBrown, @RepMarkTakano, @SenWarren, & @RepJayapal to announce a plan to grant full student loan discharges to three specific emergency categories of defrauded student borrowers in the next #COVID19 relief package."

"Our Coronavirus Emergency Borrower Defense Act will cover borrowers who have been defrauded according to findings by the Dept. of Education & State attorney general group applications, & who have been waiting years for the relief to which they are legally entitled."

"Too many of these defrauded student borrowers are unable to participate in our economy or complete their education because of ruinous credit & worthless debt. Congress acting to expedite their discharges & ensure full relief is commonsense during this unprecedented crisis."
