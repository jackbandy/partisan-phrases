Durbin Discusses Midway Air Traffic Control Tower With FAA Administrator


U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) spoke with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Stephen Dickson to discuss the continued closure of the air traffic control tower at Midway Airport after two FAA tower employees tested positive for COVID-19.  Durbin asked Dickson for an update on the air traffic control tower and when FAA plans to reopen and resume normal operations.

"I urged Administrator Dickson to quickly resolve the operations issues ongoing at Midway and ensure the FAA is testing air traffic controllers at the tower.  The FAA must be ready to respond to outbreaks at our airports, should they occur, so we can continue to safely operate essential travel needs," said Durbin.
