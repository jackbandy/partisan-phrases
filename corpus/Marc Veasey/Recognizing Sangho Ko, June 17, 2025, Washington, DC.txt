Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Mr. Sangho Ko, Vice  President of the Dallas Taekwondo Association, for his steadfast  dedication to Taekwondo as a vehicle for cultural diplomacy and  community empowerment.

Mr. Ko has long championed Taekwondo not only as an athletic  discipline but as a cultural bridge that fosters mutual understanding  and global citizenship. His work has nurtured countless students who  carry with them the values of humility, cooperation, and perseverance.

His leadership in the 23rd Annual Korean American National Sports  Festival helped showcase the richness of Korean culture and the  unifying power of sport.

We thank Mr. Ko for his vision, his commitment to excellence, and his  role in bringing communities together through shared purpose.
