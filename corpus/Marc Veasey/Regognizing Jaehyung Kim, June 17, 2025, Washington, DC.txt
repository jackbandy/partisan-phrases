Regognizing Jaehyung Kim


Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize President Jaehyung  Kim of the Dallas Taekwondo Association, a dedicated leader whose work  has advanced both sport and community across North Texas and beyond.

Through his leadership at White Tiger Taekwondo and the Dallas  Taekwondo Association, Mr. Kim has elevated the practice of Taekwondo  while instilling discipline, pride, and cultural identity in  generations of students. His efforts have created a community rooted in  respect and unity.

Mr. Kim's passion for youth development and multicultural outreach  has helped foster deeper understanding across communities, and his role  in bringing the 23rd Annual Korean American National Sports Festival to  North Texas underscores his commitment to cultural celebration and  civic engagement.

We honor Mr. Kim for his service, his vision, and the inclusive  spirit he brings to our region.
