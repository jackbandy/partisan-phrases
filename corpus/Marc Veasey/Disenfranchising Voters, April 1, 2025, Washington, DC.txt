Disenfranchising Voters


Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the so-called  SAVE Act.

This bill, coupled with the President's executive order on elections,  is a crazy, disgusting, thinly veiled attempt at disenfranchising legal  citizens from voting.

It claims to make it illegal for noncitizens to vote, which we  already know is not a problem, but this bill would also disenfranchise  millions of Americans who don't even have a passport. Millions of  Americans do not have a passport.

It also hurts people who were born in rural America, people who were  born during a time when births were recorded in family Bibles.

This would just really be devastating. It would also hurt women whose  legal names do not match their birth names.

It would end automatic voter registration, voter registration by  mail, and other reforms many States have adopted, overriding federalism  and State control over elections.

This bill is part of a long-term effort by Republicans to literally  make it harder to vote.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, when this bill comes up, to vote  ``no'' because it will be a disaster for America and a disaster for  democracy.
