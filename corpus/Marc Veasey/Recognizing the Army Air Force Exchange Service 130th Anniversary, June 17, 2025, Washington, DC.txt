Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Army & Air  Force Exchange Service, the Department of Defense's largest retailer,  as it marks its 130th year of serving our military community with  distinction.

Since its founding in 1895, the Exchange has brought a piece of home  to Soldiers, Airmen, and Guardians around the world, staying true to  its motto: ``We Go Where You Go.'' From providing uniforms and meals to  managing stores, wellness services, and online retail, the Exchange has  stood as a pillar of support for those who serve.

Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, the Exchange continues to reinvest in  military families--returning $15 billion in value to the community over  the last decade alone.

As we reflect on its 130-year legacy, we celebrate not only its  longevity but the critical role it plays in supporting readiness,  morale, and quality of life.

I congratulate the Exchange. Here's to many more years of dedicated  service.
