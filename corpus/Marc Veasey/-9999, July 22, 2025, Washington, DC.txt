Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Robert  ``Bob'' LeGrand, a pioneering figure in Texas basketball who passed  away on July 19.

From 1976 to 1987, Coach LeGrand, also known as ``Snake,'' led the  UTA men's basketball team, guiding them to their first 20-win season  and a historic NIT berth in 1981.

Snake was known for his energy, his drive, his showmanship, and his  humor. His legacy goes far beyond the wins. He helped the University of  Texas-Arlington Movin' Mavs wheelchair basketball program start, and he  was also very active in the Fort Worth chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi.  Coach LeGrand, or Snake, as everybody affectionately called him, was  someone everyone loved.

Madam Speaker, you would see him in downtown Fort Worth, and you  would see him in Arlington holding court with his sense of humor.  Regardless of your background, Snake was someone whom you embraced. He  is going to be missed. He was figuratively and literally speaking a  towering figure in our community. He will be greatly missed.

I send my condolences to his wife, Gloria, his children, and his  grandchildren.
