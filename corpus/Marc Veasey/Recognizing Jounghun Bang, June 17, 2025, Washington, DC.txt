Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Mr. Jounghun Bang,  Vice President of the Dallas Taekwondo Association, whose leadership  and mentorship have left a lasting mark on youth and families  throughout North Texas.

Through his commitment to training the next generation of athletes,  Mr. Bang has fostered excellence on and off the mat. His students'  success in national competitions reflects not only technical mastery  but the values of perseverance and discipline that he instills.

Mr. Bang's contributions extend beyond the dojang. His support for  the 23rd Annual Korean American National Sports Festival exemplifies  his broader mission to highlight cultural pride and build community.

For his tireless dedication to sport, culture, and the development of  young people, we extend our heartfelt thanks and congratulations.
