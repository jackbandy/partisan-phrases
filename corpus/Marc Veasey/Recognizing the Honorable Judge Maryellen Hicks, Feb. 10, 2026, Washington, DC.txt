Recognizing the Honorable Judge Maryellen Hicks


Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Honorable Judge  Maryellen Hicks and to recognize the renaming ceremony held in her  name, a tribute to a trailblazing jurist whose legacy has profoundly  shaped Tarrant County and the State of Texas. This historic occasion,  led by the Black Women Lawyers Association, reflects Judge Hicks's  extraordinary impact on the legal profession and her commitment to  justice and public service.

Judge Hicks's distinguished career stands as a testament to  perseverance, excellence, and leadership. As the first African American  woman to graduate from Texas Tech University School of Law in 1974,  Judge Hicks broke numerous barriers in Tarrant County, serving as the  first Black female Municipal Judge, Chief Municipal Judge, Probate  Court Master, District Judge of the 231st Court, and later on the  Second Court of Appeals. Her service on the bench was defined by  integrity, and a deep respect for the rule of law, earning her the  trust and admiration of colleagues and community members alike.

Beyond her judicial service, Judge Hicks has been a dedicated mentor  and role model, investing in the growth and advancement of future legal  professionals. Her influence extends far beyond the courtroom, leaving  an enduring mark on the legal landscape through her advocacy, guidance,  and commitment to ensuring equal access to justice for all.

The decision by the Black Women Lawyers Association to formally  change its name in honor of Judge Hicks reflects the magnitude of her  contributions and the lasting legacy she leaves behind. This renaming  not only celebrates her accomplishments but also serves as a powerful  reminder of the importance of representation, leadership, and service  in the pursuit of justice.

Today, as we gather to commemorate this momentous occasion, we  celebrate and extend our deepest gratitude to the Honorable Judge  Maryellen Hicks for her lifetime of service and the profound difference  she has made in our community. Her legacy will continue to inspire  generations of attorneys, judges, and leaders who strive to build a  more just and equitable society.
