Recognizing Sharon Lavonne Harris Rischer


Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I honor Sharon Lavonne Harris Rischer, a  beloved member of our Fort Worth community, who passed away on February  12, 2025, at the age of 70. Sharon was a dedicated daughter, mother,  sister, aunt, and friend, whose impact will be felt for generations to  come.

Born on October 7, 1954, in Fort Worth, Texas, Sharon was a proud  graduate of the Lake Como Class of 1973, having attended both Lake Como  High School and Western Hills High School. She further pursued her  education at Tarrant County College before beginning a distinguished  career that spanned several decades. Sharon worked with unwavering  commitment at Standard Meat Company from 1979 to 1993 and then with  Tarrant County MHMR from 1993 until her retirement in 2014.

Sharon's faith was an integral part of her life. She was baptized at  an early age and remained a devoted member of the Lake Como Church of  Christ, where she was a constant source of love and encouragement to  those around her. Beyond her professional and spiritual dedication,  Sharon found joy in the simple pleasures of life. She was an avid cook,  enjoyed shopping, and brought warmth and laughter to family gatherings,  particularly during friendly card games that brought her loved ones  together.

Her life was characterized by her deep care for others, and she will  be deeply missed by all who had the privilege of knowing her. I would  also like to extend the family's gratitude to the Advanced Heart and  Lung Disease Center at Baylor Scott & White Fort Worth Campus and Dr.  Salmon Gohar for their compassionate care during Sharon's final days.

Sharon Lavonne Harris Rischer was truly a pillar of our community,  and her legacy of kindness, faith, and family will endure in the hearts  of those she leaves behind. May she rest in peace, and may her memory  continue to inspire all who knew her.
