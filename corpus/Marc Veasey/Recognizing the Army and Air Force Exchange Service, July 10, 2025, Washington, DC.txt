Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I honor the Army & Air Force Exchange  Service, the Department of Defense's largest retailer, as the  organization reaches a tremendous milestone, 130 years of serving the  military community.

Since July 25, 1895, the Exchange has lived out its motto of ``We Go  Where You Go,'' providing the best tastes of home to Soldiers, Airmen  and Guardians around the world. The Exchange, also known as the PX or  BX, is a thriving tax-free benefit that strengthens our nation's  military lethality. The Exchange serves those who serve with department  stores, restaurants, malls, wellness services, combat uniforms at cost,  school meals for military children overseas, a robust presence at  ShopMyExchange.com, a leading credit option and more.

At 130, the Exchange, now based in Dallas, Texas, is among the oldest  U.S. retailers in America--and remains a vital part of military  readiness. 100 percent of Exchange earnings support critical Quality- of-Life programs. In the last 10 years, the Exchange delivered $15  billion in value to the military community.

Congratulations to the Exchange on 130 years of serving those who  serve. Here's to ``going where you go'' for many more years to come.
