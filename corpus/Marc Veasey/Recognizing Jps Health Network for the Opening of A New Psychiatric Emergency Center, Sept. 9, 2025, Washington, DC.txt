Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Leadership and Staff  of JPS Health Network.

On the occasion of the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new  Psychiatric Emergency Center, I extend my deepest congratulations and  recognition on behalf of the people of the 33rd Congressional District.

This remarkable facility represents more than bricks and mortar--it  is a testament to vision, leadership, and an unwavering commitment to  meeting one of our community's most urgent needs. By tripling capacity  and providing 24/7 specialized behavioral health services for both  adults and adolescents, JPS is not only expanding access to care but  also affirming the dignity, safety, and hope that every individual  deserves.

As Tarrant County's only psychiatric emergency center--and one of the  busiest in the Nation--the opening of this center is a milestone in  advancing compassionate, high-quality care. It reflects the dedication  of the JPS leadership team, the skill and perseverance of the staff,  and the broad collaboration that made this achievement possible.

I commend them for their service to our community, and I look forward  to the positive impact this facility will have on countless patients,  families, and first responders in the years to come.
