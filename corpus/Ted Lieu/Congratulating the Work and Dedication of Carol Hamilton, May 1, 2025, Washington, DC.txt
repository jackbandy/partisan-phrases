Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the work and dedication  of Carol Hamilton, who is retiring on May 1, 2025, from her role as  Group President for Acquisitions, Business Development, and West Coast  Headquarters at L'Oreal. Carol has been a business leader and a  champion of philanthropic causes for decades.

Carol started her career at L'Oreal in 1984, joining the Consumer  Products Division as Marketing Director for L'Oreal Paris in the United  States. She continued to foster her passion and built the L'Oreal  flagship brand from a small indie brand in the 80's into the No. 1  global beauty brand worldwide, behind the iconic phrase ``Because I'm  Worth It.''

In 2008, Carol transitioned from mass to the world of luxury beauty,  taking the helm as U.S. President of L'Oreal Luxe. During her tenure,  Lancome became the No. 1 luxury beauty brand in the U.S., surpassing  the established market leader.

Alongside her acquisition role, in 2020, Carol was charged with a new  responsibility: the creation of and leadership over L'Oreal USA's new  corporate office in El Segundo, California, which brought L'Oreal's  west coast brands under one roof for the first time.

Beyond her professional achievements, Carol has been a tireless  champion for women's empowerment and philanthropic causes. In 2009, she  spearheaded the Armani Acqua for Life program with UNICEF and  subsequently joined both the National Board and New York Regional  Board. In 2013, Carol created the Women in Power course in gender  equality for L'Oreal executives with the Harvard Women's Leadership  Board.

With retirement, Carol will have the time to continue doing what she  loves: travel around the world with her husband Rodney, gardening, and  spend time with her cats, Rosie and Elvis.
