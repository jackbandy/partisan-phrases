Release the Epstein Files

Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, in February of this year, Attorney General Pam  Bondi went on national TV and told the American people that Jeffrey  Epstein's client list was ``sitting on my desk right now.''

Why won't she release that client list?

Why won't House Republicans vote to release that list?

In fact, House Republicans are shutting down Congress early. Shortly  after my speech, Congress is going to shut down until September because  House Republicans want to avoid voting on releasing the Epstein files.

Why? I will tell you why.

The Wall Street Journal just confirmed that in May of this year the  Department of Justice told Donald Trump to his face that he is in the  unreleased Epstein files.

House Republicans are facilitating a coverup of epic proportions.

Release the Epstein files.
