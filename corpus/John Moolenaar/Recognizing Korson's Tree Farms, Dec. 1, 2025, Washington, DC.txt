Recognizing Korson's Tree Farms


Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Korson's Tree  Farms in Michigan's Montcalm County for being selected to provide the  2025 White House Christmas tree.

Under the leadership of Rex and Jessica Korson, Korson's earned this  honor by winning the National Christmas Tree Association's grand  champion title, a recognition that reflects years of dedication, family  tradition, and the highest standards of Michigan agriculture.

To commemorate this accomplishment, this afternoon, I am introducing  a resolution congratulating Korson's Tree Farms.

It has been 41 years since a Michigan-grown Christmas tree was  displayed in the White House, and bringing this tradition back  highlights the strength and quality of Michigan's growers.

Korson's has been recognized before, winning Michigan's Grand  Champion Tree contest and even providing a tree for the Vice  President's residence, but this selection marks the pinnacle of their  work. Their family-run operation represents the excellence and  tradition that define Michigan's growers and exemplifies the First  Lady's Christmas theme: Home is where the heart is.

Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to honor this achievement and celebrate  the role Michigan will play in bringing Christmas spirit to our  Nation's Capital.
