Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  Representative Pfluger's bipartisan bill, H.R. 881, the DHS  Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern  Act.

Mr. Speaker, this legislation is about one thing, and that is  protecting American students, American research, and America's future  from malign foreign influence, especially from the Chinese Communist  Party.

The CCP is engaged in a persistent strategic campaign to influence  every corner of American life, and one of their most dangerous efforts  is to target our education system.

Often disguised as cultural exchange programs, the CCP efforts to  infiltrate America's universities are intended to manipulate  curriculum, suppress academic freedom, and monitor Chinese students  here in the United States.

Let's be clear. The Chinese Government isn't investing in these  programs to teach language. They are trying to shape how young  Americans see the world and to rewrite the story of the Chinese  Communist Party one classroom at a time.

This is part of a broader effort by Beijing to manipulate the next  generation, whether through TikTok on their phones or authoritarian  propaganda on their campuses, and it is working. That is why this bill  matters.

H.R. 881 makes it simple. If a university wants DHS funding, it  cannot maintain ties to CCP influence operations. If we want taxpayer  dollars, we cannot partner with a foreign adversary.

We have already made real progress. The number of Confucius  Institutes in the U.S. has dropped from over 100 to just a few.  However, too many Confucius Institutes are rebranding or maintaining  quiet ties behind the scenes.

As chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, I  can  tell you the threat is real, and the evidence is overwhelming. This  isn't about blocking cultural exchange. It is about blocking foreign  exploitation. Academic freedom is not for sale. It is not for sale to  Beijing and not on our watch.

Let's stand together, Republicans and Democrats, to protect our  students, safeguard our campuses, and push back on foreign influence. I  ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 881.
