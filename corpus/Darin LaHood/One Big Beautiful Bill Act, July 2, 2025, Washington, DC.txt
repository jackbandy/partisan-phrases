https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693196/one-big-beautiful-bill-act


Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the  gentleman from Missouri regarding the termination of the commercial  clean vehicles credit in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Is it your understanding and intent, Chairman Smith, for the purposes  of this provision, vehicles shall be treated as ``acquired'' as of the  date on which a written binding contract is entered into for their  acquisition and a payment has been made?

Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with the comments of the  managers. I am pleased to know their legislative intent.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support this  commonsense legislation.
