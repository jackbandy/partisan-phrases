Congratulating Mike Oltman on His Retirement with the Woodford County Emergency Management Agency


Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Mike Oltman for  more than 40 years of public service with the Woodford County Emergency  Management Agency. Throughout his career, Mike has demonstrated  unwavering commitment, technical expertise, and a deep devotion to  protecting and serving his community.

Mr. Oltman began his service as a senior at Roanoke Benson High  School when the agency was known as the Emergency Services and Disaster  Agency. Throughout his career, he has held key roles in emergency  preparedness and response, including serving as Deputy Director, chief  storm spotter, and a member of the damage assessment team. In these  pivotal positions, he worked closely with the IEMA and FEMA to map  disaster areas and support response operations that benefited the  county, first responders, and residents.

His extensive experience in emergency operations uniquely equipped  him to guide the county through major crises, including his leadership  during the activation of the Emergency Operations Center in the COVID  pandemic. This expertise made him an essential leader at the county and  state levels, where he successfully coordinated emergency procedures  and supported critical public safety decisions during one of Woodford  County's most challenging periods.

Throughout his service, Mr. Oltman has dedicated himself to  strengthening emergency response capabilities and supporting those  around him. As a driver and Emergency Medical Responder with the  Roanoke ambulance service and as a staff member with the Salvation  Army, he has extended his commitment far beyond EMA. His dedication and  leadership were further recognized in 2017 when he received the  Volunteer of the Year Award from the Illinois Emergency Services  Management Association, leaving a lasting impact on the agency and the  community he has faithfully served.

Woodford County is fortunate to have a volunteer whose service,  professionalism, and passion for public safety have spanned more than  four decades. Mike's commitment to his community is truly inspiring,  and his retirement marks the conclusion of a remarkable career devoted  to serving others. I am honored to recognize him for his extraordinary  service and congratulate him on his well-earned retirement. I wish Mike  and his loved ones the very best in the years ahead.
