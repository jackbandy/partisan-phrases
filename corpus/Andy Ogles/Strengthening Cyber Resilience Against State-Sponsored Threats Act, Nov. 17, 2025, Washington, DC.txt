Strengthening Cyber Resilience Against State-Sponsored Threats Act


Mr. OGLES. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  2659, the Strengthening Cyber Resilience Against State-Sponsored  Threats Act.

Earlier this year, I introduced this legislation because the United  States is facing an increasingly coordinated and persistent effort by  malicious cyber actors linked to the Government of the People's  Republic of China, the PRC. These groups represent one of the most  serious national security challenges confronting our Nation today.

Reports from Federal agencies and private-sector partners over the  past several years have shown that Chinese state-sponsored cyber  actors, including Volt Typhoon, Salt Typhoon, and other PRC-affiliated  groups, have been targeting the systems and services that Americans  rely on every single day.

In committee, there has been testimony that 98 percent of our  municipalities operate under cybersecurity poverty, meaning they don't  have the resources to defend themselves. These intrusions have affected  communication providers, energy operators, water systems,  transportation networks, and other sectors that are fundamental to  public safety and economic stability.

What has become clear is that these actors are not simply trying to  collect information. In many cases, they have attempted to position  themselves inside sensitive systems for long periods of time, for  years, in some cases, before being discovered.

Their activity indicates preparation for the possibility of major  disruption during a time of crisis, including potentially over Taiwan.  This is a serious strategic concern, and it demands a serious national  response.

These groups often use advanced techniques that allow them to operate  quietly within everyday system activity. They rely on legitimate tools  and access privileges to conceal malicious behavior. This makes  detection extremely difficult and allows intrusions to remain unnoticed  until long after a compromise has taken place.

While Federal agencies have taken important steps to respond, the  overall effort has revealed significant challenges in the way our  government organizes its cybersecurity responsibilities. Multiple  agencies share roles in protecting critical infrastructure, but they  operate under different missions, structures, and authorities. Through  fast-moving or complex incidents, these differences can slow the  exchange of information and create uncertainty about responsibility and  response actions.

H.R. 2659 addresses these gaps by directing the creation of a joint  interagency task force led by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Security Agency, CISA, in partnership with the Federal Bureau of  Investigation. This task force will bring together the agencies that  serve as sector risk management agencies, along with the intelligence  community and other Federal partners with responsibility for critical  infrastructure security.

The goal is straightforward: Federal actions must be aligned,  coordinated, and based on a shared understanding of the threat  environment.

The legislation also requires the task force to provide Congress with  a detailed initial assessment, followed by annual reports for 5 years.  These reports will offer insight into the tactics used by PRC- affiliated cyber actors, vulnerabilities across sectors, the potential  impacts of disruptions during a major crisis, and any additional tools  or authorities Federal agencies may need.

Classified briefings will ensure that Congress receives timely and  accurate information necessary to evaluate our nationwide posture.

This bill strengthens unity and effort. It improves coordination. It  increases visibility and accountability. It ensures that the United  States can respond to foreign cyber aggression with preparation rather  than reaction.

H.R. 2659 reflects lessons learned from real-world incidents. It  elevates our national approach to cybersecurity, and it helps protect  American communities from adversaries who are actively working to  compromise the systems that support our way of life.

We cannot let a bureaucracy stand in the way of defending our  Nation's cybersecurity. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  important legislation.
