Protect America's Workforce Act


Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge us to pass this  discharge petition.

Earlier this year, Donald Trump did an illegal executive order,  stripping a million Federal workers from their collective bargaining  rights, rights they have had since 1962.

We have seen this in my home State. In 2011, Governor Scott Walker  launched one of the most aggressive attacks on workers' rights,  stripping collective bargaining rights.

What happened? Our School of Education had a two-thirds drop in  people applying to be teachers. We lost long-term public employees.  That affected services.

This bill will restore longstanding collective bargaining protections  and ensure that any future administration cannot demolish these rights  again.

We hear our Federal employees across the country. We value them, and  we are fighting with them. We stand on behalf of the Federal workers  that are negatively affected by the President's actions.
