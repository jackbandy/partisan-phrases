Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today,  alongside my colleagues in the New York delegation and many of our  other cherished colleagues, to mourn the loss of a giant of the House  and a trailblazer for women in public service, Chairwoman Nita Lowey.

For more than three decades, she represented her constituents in  Westchester and Rockland Counties with unwavering dedication, fierce  advocacy, and an unbreakable spirit.

As the first woman to serve as chair of the Appropriations Committee,  Nita shattered glass ceilings with dignity and determination.

As the former dean of the New York delegation, Nita fought tirelessly  to secure resources for the Empire State, leading the charge after  September 11, Superstorm Sandy, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nita's commitment to global security and education also left an  indelible mark beyond our borders. As the top Democrat on the  Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, she championed critical  global health and education initiatives.

Mr. Speaker, Nita was more than a colleague. She was a mentor and a  friend to many of us. She was a voice of compassion and reason. She  believed in the power of government to do good, and her legacy will  endure through the lives she touched and the barriers she broke. May  her memory be a blessing.

Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lawler for those kind  words.

Mr. Speaker, I now ask that all Members and staff throughout the  Capitol rise for a moment of silence in remembrance of Chairwoman Nita  Lowey. May her memory be a blessing.
