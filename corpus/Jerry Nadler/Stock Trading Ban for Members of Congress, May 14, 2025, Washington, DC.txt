Stock Trading Ban for Members of Congress


Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the American people expect and deserve to  know that their elected officials are working for them, not lining  their own pockets.

When Members of Congress trade individual stocks while in office, it  fuels distrust, undermines public confidence, and casts a shadow over  the work of this institution. Even the perception of impropriety  weakens the bond between the government and the governed.

Members of Congress have unparalleled access to market-moving  information and the ability to shape laws and regulations that can  impact entire industries. That power must never be used to enrich  ourselves or our families.

There is simply no legitimate reason for Members of Congress, their  spouses, or their dependent children to be trading individual stocks,  period. This bipartisan legislation would close that dangerous loophole  once and for all. It would require lawmakers to place certain  investments into qualified blind trusts, prevent conflicts of interest,  and restore accountability where it is so desperately needed.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor the TRUST in Congress Act, and I  thank Representatives Magaziner and Roy for their leadership on this  critical bipartisan legislation. It is a long overdue, commonsense step  toward restoring integrity in public service and rebuilding the trust  of the American people.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in both Chambers to join us in  passing this essential reform.
