First Amendment is Keystone of Our Liberties

Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, a few minutes ago, four Republicans saved  this House from disgrace. We almost passed a resolution to remove a  Member from committees for the sin of exercising free speech.

Charlie Kirk was a prominent figure, beloved by many, disliked  heartily by others.

If the First Amendment means anything, it means the ability to say  anything we want, short of actionable libel, with respect to any  subject. It even means, according to the Supreme Court in the  Brandenburg decision in 1969, the ability to advocate violence except  in a manner calculated to induce immediate violence.

We forget the First Amendment at our peril. It is the keystone of our  liberties, and we almost disgraced ourselves by traducing it a few  minutes ago. I am glad we did not.
