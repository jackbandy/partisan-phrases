Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  legislation because I cannot, in good conscience, vote to spend one  more cent on ICE. I will not fund an agency that acts like an American  gestapo.

The Trump administration has launched a brutal and reckless campaign  to strike fear in immigrant communities across the country, and ICE is  on the front lines, using aggressive and violent tactics that too often  end in tragedy. I cannot support one more cent for an agency that would  recklessly take the life of Renee Good, an innocent and defenseless  young woman.

I cannot support one more cent for masked agents arresting U.S.  citizens, pulling people out of their homes, tearing children away from  their parents,  and stating that it is exempt from the constitutional requirement for  search warrants. I cannot support one more cent for detention  facilities with the highest death rate in decades and that fail to meet  the basic medical needs of detainees. No wonder they refuse to allow  access to Members of Congress.

To support one more cent for an agency with such disregard for the  rule of law and basic human decency would be a moral outrage.

Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on this legislation.
