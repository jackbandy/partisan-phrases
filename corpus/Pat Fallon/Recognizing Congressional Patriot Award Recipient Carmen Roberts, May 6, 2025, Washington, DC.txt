Recognizing Congressional Patriot Award Recipient Carmen Roberts


Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Carmen Roberts  of Celina, Texas, and present her with the Congressional Patriot Award.  Carmen has dedicated herself to faithfully serving our community.

Carmen was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, and immigrated to the United  States at a young age. She attended school in Rosemead, California, and  became a naturalized citizen at 18 years old. Carmen began her career  as a night attendant for American Airlines and worked as a ticket  office manager. She co-founded Steve Roberts Custom Builders, a very  successful home design and construction company based in North Texas.  Carmen earned her license in real estate and has worked for over two  decades as a realtor for Ebby Halliday specializing in luxury homes.

In addition to her real estate portfolio, Carmen has served as the  Mayor Pro Tempore of Celina and as a member of the Celina City Council  and Celina Economic Development Corporation Board. For her outstanding  contributions, Carmen has received the City of Celina's Distinguished  Public Service Award, the Governor's Recognition Award, and the State  of Texas' Certificate of Appreciation. I am pleased to commend Carmen  for her dedication to serving and representing the City of Celina with  distinction, and I wish her continued success for many years to come.

It is an honor to bestow Cannen with the Patriot Award for her  exceptional service to the people of North Texas.
