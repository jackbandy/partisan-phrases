Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize James Branch of  Royse City, Texas.

For more than two decades, Mr. Branch has been a devoted and highly  visible leader in the Rockwall County and Royse City communities. Since  moving to Royse City in 2001, he has served as a committed public  servant, volunteer, business owner, and devoted family man. He and his  wife, Katie, have three sons, all of whom graduated from Royse City  ISD. Throughout their time in the district, Mr. Branch has been a  constant presence--calling football games on NFHS, helping set up the  run-through for varsity football games, preparing pre-game meals,  coaching youth football, and later volunteering as an announcer for  youth games. Supporting young people and families has long been a  defining part of his life and legacy.

Mr. Branch's record of civic service is both extensive and  distinguished. He has made lasting contributions to the City of Royse  City through his work on the Parks and Recreation Board and the  Planning and Zoning Commission, where his leadership earned him  positions as vice chairman and chairman. In 2009, he was elected to the  Royse City Council, where he went on to serve as Deputy Mayor Pro Tem  and Mayor Pro Tem. Today, he continues to serve as a steadfast and  engaged councilman, working tirelessly to support and represent his  community with dedication, integrity, and care.

His commitment extends beyond the city limits. He serves as secretary  of the Rockwall County Emergency Services Corporation and represents  Royse City and Precinct 4 on the Rockwall County Transportation  Consortium Board, providing a strong and reliable voice for the people  he has long served.

In his professional life, Mr. Branch has spent more than 25 years  owning and operating multiple businesses that serve Royse City, Caddo  Mills, and the greater Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Throughout his  career, he has earned widespread respect for his openness,  transparency, and steadfast dedication to doing what is right,  regardless of popularity.

It is my honor to recognize James Branch for his integrity, his  decades of service, and his enduring commitment to strengthening the  Royse City and Rockwall County communities.
