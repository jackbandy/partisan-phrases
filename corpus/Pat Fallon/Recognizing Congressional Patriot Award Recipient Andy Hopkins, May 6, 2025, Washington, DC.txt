Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Andy ``Hop''  Hopkins of Celina, Texas, and present him with the Congressional  Patriot Award. Andy has dedicated himself to faithfully serving our  community and country.

Andy was born in Columbus, Ohio, and he attended Plano Senior High  School. After graduating in 1983, he joined the United States Army as  an infantryman, where he demonstrated discipline, leadership, and duty  to serving our nation. After his Army service, Andy built and managed  several successful businesses, including a national natural products  distribution company and one of the top-performing UPS franchise in  North Texas. He was also elected to the Celina City Council in 2015,  where his leadership as Mayor Pro Tempore and councilmember has played  a critical role in the city's rapid economic growth and development.

In addition to his public service, Andy is very involved in the North  Texas community. He is a founding member and the current Commander of  American Legion Post 145 in Celina and serves on the Board of Directors  for the Celina Chamber of Commerce, Rodeo Celina, and the Celina Local  Business Alliance. Andy regularly attends the First United Methodist  church in Celina and previously served on the church council. For his  remarkable contributions to the City of Celina, Andy has received the  2022 Business of the Year  award from the Greater Celina Chamber of Commerce. I am pleased to  recognize him today for a lifetime of public service and continued  commitment to advancing our community and nation.

It is an honor to bestow Andy with the Patriot Award for his  exceptional service to the people of North Texas.
