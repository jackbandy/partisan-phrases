Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate Mr.  Gary Singleton of Bowie County, Texas, and to present him with the  Congressional Patriot Award. Gary has dedicated his life to faithfully  serving his community and country.

In  1990, he married the love of his life, Lisa Singleton, with whom he has  shared many pets, memories, and accomplishments.

After graduating, Gary began his professional career at the Lone Star  Army Ammunition Plant, where he served for 26 years, advancing from IT  Programmer to Senior Systems Analyst and ultimately Manager of IT  Operations. He later worked for Alcoa Inc. as Site Conversion and  Development Lead, overseeing software conversions, and for Cooper Tire  and Rubber Company as a Systems Analyst. Gary applied his expertise in  healthcare technology at the Collom & Carney Clinic in Texarkana and  Willis Knighton Health System in Shreveport, Louisiana, before  returning to Collom & Carney Clinic, where he is currently employed.

Beyond his professional career, Gary has demonstrated exceptional  dedication to civic and political engagement. Beginning in the 1980's,  he served as Precinct Chair, later Vice Chairman, and ultimately  Chairman of the Bowie County Republican Party. He served for over 15  years as a Board Member and Vice President of the Bowie County  Republicans PAC and held leadership roles with the National Management  Association--LSAAP Chapter. Among his proudest achievements, Gary was  honored as a Presidential Elector from Texas' 1st Congressional  District in 2024, casting his vote for Donald J.
