Recognizing Congressional Patriot Award Recipient John ``johnny'' Rothfus


Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. John  ``Johnny'' Rothfus of Prosper, Texas, and present him with the  Congressional Patriot Award. Johnny has dedicated himself to faithfully  serving our community and country.

Johnny was born in Sachse, Texas, and moved with his family to  Prosper at a young age. In 1943, he graduated high school and joined  the United States Army Air Forces the following year. Johnny served as  a tail gunner on a B-24 bomber and was briefly stationed overseas for  six months. As a result of his meritorious service, he received the  Purple Heart, an Air Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the European-African- Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one silver battle star, and the Good  Conduct Medal with one overseas bar. Johnny completed his service in  1947 and later fulfilled an advertisement recruiting firefighters. For  two decades, he drove a fire engine, and he retired in November 1974.

Johnny's incredible career as an aviator turned first responder is  remarkable to witness. After returning from overseas, he married in  1945. Johnny has one daughter and many more grandchildren and great- grandchildren. He enjoys spending time with his family and building and  painting homes in his free time. Johnny has remained a devoted man of  faith, and he regularly attends First Christian Church in Celina. I am  proud to commemorate Johnny for a lifetime of contributions to our  country, as he has been steadfast in his service to his community, be  it at the senior center or drug store. I wish him good health for many  years to come.

It is an honor to bestow Johnny with the Patriot Award for his  exceptional service to the people of North Texas.
