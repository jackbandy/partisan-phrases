Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate Mr.  Steve Ledwell of Texarkana, Texas, and to present him with the  Congressional Patriot Award. Steve has dedicated his life to faithfully  serving his community and country.

Born and raised in Texarkana, Steve has spent his life building up  others and strengthening his community. From a very young age, he has  always been the first to lend a hand to anyone in need--and often to  those who never even had to ask. Steve has also built a loving, faith- filled family with his wife, their three children, and grandchildren.

Professionally, Steve has had a long and dedicated career at Ledwell  & Son Enterprises. Through his work, he has extended his generosity to  the entire community--refurbishing and providing trucks for countless  local nonprofits and schools. Steve has supported nearly every sports  team in town, contributed to Watersprings Ranch, and served as the go- to man behind the scenes whenever help was needed. He even advocated  directly with the Army Corps of Engineers to advocate improvements to  local flood control and levee systems.

Steve counts among his greatest blessings, his wonderful parents,  devoted family, his incredible community, and the opportunity to make a  positive difference in so many lives.

Steve Ledwell's lifelong commitment to his community, his profession,  and his Nation truly exemplifies what it means to be a patriot. It is  an honor to recognize his exceptional contributions and to present him  with the Congressional Patriot Award in appreciation of his steadfast  service to the people of Texarkana and the United States of America.
