Recognizing Congressional Patriot Award Recipient Beth Terrell


Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Elizabeth  ``Beth'' Terrell of Burr Ridge, Illinois, and present her with the  Congressional Patriot Award. Beth has dedicated herself to faithfully  serving our community and country.

A native of Lake Forest, Illinois, Beth attended Saint Mary's College  in Notre Dame and graduated in 1989 with a bachelor's degree in  communication. She earned her master's degree in public administration  from Western Michigan University. Beth started her professional career  as a Communication and Training Specialist for the Elkhart County  government. She later became Director of Marketing for the Center for  Eye Care and Coldwell Banker Sammis in New York state. Since then, Beth  has devoted much of her time to growing her family and caring for their  children along with her husband, Pat. Together, Beth and Pat launched a  family business, Terrell Materials, a leading concrete manufacturing  company that services major airports.

In addition to her career, Beth has continued to stay involved in  numerous community service initiatives. She served as President of the  Carolina Panthers' Women Association, a member of the Hornets' Nest  Girl Scout Council Board of Directors, and Girl Scout Leader with the  Girl Scouts Council of Greater Chicago and Northwest. Moreover, Beth  co-founded Team Terrell alongside Pat to help promote and fundraise for  the American Diabetes Association. Her most cherished accomplishment is  raising a wonderful family with  seven children, all of whom were instilled with the values of  compassion, faith, and kindness. I'm pleased to recognize Beth today  for her important contributions to our community, and I wish her  continued success.

It is an honor to bestow Beth with the Patriot Award for her  exceptional service to our Nation.
