Recognizing Congressional Patriot Award Recipient Mark Kipphut


Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Mark Kipphut  of McLendon-Chisholm, Texas, and present him with the Congressional  Patriot Award. Mark has dedicated himself to faithfully serving our  community and country.

After graduating from The Citadel with a political science degree in  May 1979, Mark commissioned into the United States Air Force. He served  as a Command Intelligence Officer during the Gulf War and Global War on  Terrorism for many years. In his last assignment, Mark became the  Director of Intelligence for the Pacific Air Forces at Hickam Air Force  Base. He later received a master's degree in management from Embry- Riddle University.

When he retired from the military as a Colonel, Mark served as the  Director of Strategy for Raytheon Missile Systems in Tucson, Arizona.  In 2010, he and his family moved to Texas, where he became the Program  Director of Tactical Intelligence Systems for Raytheon. In this role,  Mark oversaw hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales and  government contracting. He currently works as a Senior Advisor for BCE  Consulting, in which he focuses on enhancing our operational  capabilities to defend against cyber and unmanned threats. In addition  to protecting our national security, Mark is passionate about giving  back to his community and supporting our veterans. He is the Commander  of the Rockwall Terry Fisher American Legion Post, where he created  college scholarships for the children of veterans. Moreover, Mark  organizes annual trips for students to attend the Youth Leadership  Conferences. I am proud of Mark's contributions to our community, and I  am sure he will continue to make a positive impact on the world around  us for many years to come.

It is an honor to bestow Mark with the Patriot Award for his  exceptional service to our Nation and the people of North Texas.
