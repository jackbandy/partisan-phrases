Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions  of Mrs. Trellis Maddalena of Flower Mound, Texas.

A native of Georgia, Mrs. Maddalena has dedicated more than 13 years  to the United States Postal Service, beginning her career as a mail  carrier in Flower Mound. Demonstrating a commitment to professional  growth, she completed the Customer Service Associate Supervisor Program  in 2019 and went on to serve in supervisory and leadership roles across  multiple Texas stations, including as OIC Postmaster.

In 2022, Mrs. Maddalena was appointed Manager of Consumer Affairs for  the Southern Area, Texas One. In this role, she excels at overseeing  customer policies, managing interactions with government offices,  analyzing surveys and CRM systems, while fostering cooperative  relationships. Her ability to work seamlessly with congressional  offices, staff, constituents, and local boards of elections has made  her an indispensable partner in addressing the needs of the community.

Her dedication has been recognized through multiple awards, including  the USPS Outstanding Supervisor Award from the Coppell Post Office in  the spring of 2022, the USPS Customer Service Award from the Consumer  Advocate Headquarters in September 2022, and the USPS Chief FOIA  Officer's Award in May 2023. Beyond these honors, Mrs. Maddalena has  consistently gone above and beyond for our office and district,  ensuring that passports are retrieved from the mail in urgent  situations or assisting with time-sensitive casework requests. Her  unmatched availability and commitment have directly improved customer  experience for countless constituents.

I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's  Capitol in recognition of Mrs. Maddalena's extraordinary achievements  and contributions. I thank her for all she has done.
