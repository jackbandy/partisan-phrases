Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Nate Pike of  Prosper, Texas, and present him with the Congressional Patriot Award.  Nate has dedicated himself to faithfully serving our community.

A native of Denison, Texas, Nate attended Denison High School and  graduated from Baylor University in 2003 with his Bachelor of Business  Administration. He began his career out of college as a financial  advisor and sales representative for multiple firms. In 2014, Nate  joined the Utter, Pike, & Dobbs Private Wealth Management Group of  Wells Fargo Advisors, where he currently serves as a partner and  managing director. In addition to his work in the financial industry,  he was elected to serve as the mayor of Anna, Texas, in which his  robust leadership transformed the city into one of the fastest growing  regions in Texas and the country.

Currently, Nate is the President of the Anna Education Foundation and  Treasurer of CASA of Grayson County. He previously served as the  President of numerous advocacy organizations, including Grayson County  Children's Advocacy Center, the Anna Community Development Corporation,  and the Grayson Collin Municipal Alliance. For his important  contributions, Nate was named the Paul Harris Fellow by Rotary  International and listed in the Dallas Business Journal and Grayson  County's Top 40 Under 40 Business Professionals. He was also named  Citizen of the Year in 2024 by the Anna Chamber of Commerce. I am  pleased to recognize Nate today for a lifetime of servant leadership,  and I wish him continued success.

It is an honor to bestow Nate with the Patriot Award for his  exceptional service to the people of North Texas.
