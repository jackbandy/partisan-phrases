Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Kay Akin of  Decatur, Texas, and present her with the Congressional Patriot Award.  Kay has dedicated herself to faithfully serving our community.

Kay is originally from Brownwood, Texas, and she earned her  bachelor's degree in education from East Texas A&M University. She  began her extensive teaching career in 1987 as an elementary school  teacher for fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students. Since 1972, she  has also been married to her high school sweetheart, Sheriff Lane Akin,  and they raised several children and have many more grandchildren.

After retiring early from teaching, Kay has continued to remain  involved in our community through numerous initiatives. She is a  longtime volunteer with the Helping Hands program to provide clothing  for those in need in the Wise County community, as well as helping to  keep our roads clean from litter. Moreover, Kay is a member of the  Decatur Church of Christ and has taught Sunday School for many years.  As a result of her efforts to advance student learning and achievement,  she  has been recognized as Bible School Teacher of the Year and Rookie of  the Year at Lindale Elementary School. A devoted follower of Jesus, Kay  is most proud of supporting Sheriff Lane's career as a public servant  and being a role model for her children and grandchildren. I am pleased  to commend Kay for her distinguished career as an educator for our  youth, and I wish her continued success.

It is an honor to bestow Kay with the Patriot Award for her  exceptional service to the people of North Texas.
