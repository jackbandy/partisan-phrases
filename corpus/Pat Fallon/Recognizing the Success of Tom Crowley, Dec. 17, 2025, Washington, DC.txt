Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tom Crowley of  Royse City, Texas. Tom Crowley has been a resident of Royse City since  2006 and has dedicated much of his life to public service, community  engagement, and leadership. He was first elected to the Royse City  Council in May 2010, building on earlier experience serving on the  Royse City Zoning Board of Adjustment, as well as similar service in  other communities. In 2013, he served on the Royse City ISD Strategic  Planning Committee and on the Board of Directors of the Royse City  Chamber of Commerce. He also chaired the Military Affairs Committee for  the San Angelo Texas Chamber of Commerce.

A veteran of the United States Air Force, Tom served 22 years,  including 18 years in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance  (ISR) collections and analysis platforms. His service took him to eight  ground and airborne units across Europe, Asia, the Mediterranean, and  the Middle East, as well as two units within the continental United  States. He later became a platform instructor, training airmen entering  the airborne reconnaissance career field. During his distinguished  military career, Tom was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, eight  Air Medals, two Meritorious Achievement Medals, the Combat Readiness  Medal, and numerous other decorations. Later in his Air Force career,  he cross-trained in journalism, working in public relations and  advertising and coordinating with local officials for USAF Thunderbirds  aerial demonstration performances.

Tom's commitment to community extends beyond elected office. He is a  former member of the Rockwall County Appraisal Review Board, past  president of his homeowner's association, and a member of the Royse  City chapter of Rotary International. In addition to his civic  involvement, Tom spent 26 years in the real estate business, serving on  six local Texas Realtor association committees and three statewide  committees before retiring from active participation. During a hiatus  from real estate, he also served as a law firm area manager for eleven  years, overseeing operations across three West Texas counties.  Throughout his life, Tom has demonstrated a consistent dedication to  improving the communities he serves.

It is my honor to recognize Tom Crowley for his decades of dedicated  service to his community, his country, and his family, and for his  lasting commitment to strengthening Royse City and Rockwall County.
