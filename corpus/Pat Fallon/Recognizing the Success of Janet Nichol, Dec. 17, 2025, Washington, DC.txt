Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Janet Nichol, of  Royse City, Texas.

For almost three decades, Ms. Nichol has been a devoted and highly  visible leader in the Rockwall County and Royse City community. A  lifelong resident of Rockwall County, she has dedicated her life to  public service, community development, and civic engagement. Throughout  her career, she has demonstrated a deep commitment to her hometown,  earning the trust and respect of residents across the county.

Ms. Nichol's record of civic service is both extensive and  distinguished. She began her public service on the Royse City Council,  serving from 1995 to 2005 and again from 2009 to 2015. Her steady  leadership and dedication to progress led the people of Royse City to  elect her mayor--a position she proudly held from 2015 to 2021 and to  which she was triumphantly returned in 2025. Between those terms, she  served as Rockwall County Commissioner for Precinct 4 from 2021 to  2023, where she championed infrastructure improvements, responsible  growth, and fiscal stewardship.

Her commitment extends far beyond elected office. Ms. Nichol has  served on numerous boards and committees that shape the county's  future, including 14 years on the Rockwall County Road Construction  Board, 15 years on the Royse City Main Street Board, and 13 years on  the Royse City Parks Board. She has also contributed to the Rockwall  County Historical Commission, helping preserve the county's heritage  for future generations. Her dedication to children and education is  evident through her service on the Rockwall County Children's Advocacy  Center Board, the Royse City ISD Education Foundation, and her active  role on the RCISD Rebranding Plan Committee, as well as the Royse City  Main Street and Parks Planning Boards.

Throughout her career, Ms. Nichol has exemplified servant  leadership--marked by humility, dedication, and a deep love for her  community. Her lifelong service has strengthened the fabric of Royse  City and Rockwall County and continues to inspire others to serve with  purpose and heart.

It is my honor to recognize Janet Nichol for her integrity, her  decades of selfless service, and her enduring commitment to  strengthening the Royse City and Rockwall County communities.
