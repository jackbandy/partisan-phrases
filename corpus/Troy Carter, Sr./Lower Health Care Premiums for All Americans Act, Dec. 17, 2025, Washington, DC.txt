Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, for months, Democrats have  urged Republicans to come to the table to work together on a clean  extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Now, we are just days  away from the deadline, and Republicans are scrambling to push through  an unserious proposal at the eleventh hour. People aren't stupid. They  can see this.

Their so-called Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act  would have the exact opposite effect than what it claims to do.

Most importantly, it does nothing to extend the ACA tax credits. The  tax credits have been a lifeline for countless hardworking families,  small business owners, and seniors in Louisiana and across our country,  helping them afford coverage in a time when the cost of living  continues to climb. This is something that we, as Members of Congress,  should do. Without these extensions, their premiums will skyrocket.

Healthcare is not a luxury. It is a fundamental human right.

Mr. Speaker, I stand with Leader Jeffries and House Democrats as we  continue our fight for affordable, quality healthcare in this country.
