Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend a warm  welcome to His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the  spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians and the head of the  Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.

As the spiritual leader of the second-largest Christian Church in the  world, His All-Holiness carries a message of peace, reconciliation, and  interfaith dialogue that resonates deeply across all faith traditions.  His enduring commitment to religious freedom, environmental  stewardship, and global unity has earned him recognition as a moral  voice not only for Orthodox Christians but for people of all faiths.

Many of my constituents in the Greek Orthodox community, and Orthodox  Christians across the United States, look forward to his visit to  Washington, D.C. with great pride and reverence. They view his presence  here as an opportunity to celebrate the rich spiritual and cultural  heritage of Orthodox Christianity and to reaffirm the strong bonds  between the United States and the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

It is my honor to welcome His All-Holiness to our Nation's capital  and to recognize his tireless efforts in promoting peace, human  dignity, and spiritual leadership across the globe.

I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this important visit and  in celebrating the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.
