Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an  issue that affects men of all ages, races, and socioeconomic  backgrounds: prostate cancer.

Just last week, I introduced a resolution designating September as  Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. As co-chair of the bipartisan Men's  Health Caucus, this issue is close to my heart.

Every year, the Black community is disproportionately affected by  prostate cancer. Specifically, Black men are twice as likely to die  from prostate cancer as their White counterparts. This alarming trend  highlights an urgent need for action.

To address the disparities in prostate cancer outcomes, we must  ensure at-risk populations have access to prevention, early detection,  and treatment options.

This disease does not have to be a death sentence, and this disparity  isn't written in stone. We have the tools to close that gap.

Together, we can increase awareness through campaigns like Prostate  Cancer Awareness Month and beat prostate cancer once and for all.  Together, let's end this scourge on our community.
