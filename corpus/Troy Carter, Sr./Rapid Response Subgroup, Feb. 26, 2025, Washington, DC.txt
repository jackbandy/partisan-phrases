Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, President Trump has falsely  suggested that Ukraine was responsible for the war with Russia and  should have resolved the conflict years ago. This claim is not only  unfounded, but it dangerously misrepresents the facts.

Russia is the invading nation, the aggressor, and the perpetuator of  war crimes. Louisiana's own Republican Senators agree. Senator Kennedy  went further, calling Russia's dictator, Vladimir Putin, a gangster  with a black heart, a figure responsible for unprovoked war and  atrocities on a sovereign nation.

It was Russia's invasion that shattered Ukraine's peace, beginning  with the invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014 and through the  full-scale invasion that began just over 3 years ago. Russian forces  are committing horrific and documented war crimes against Ukrainian  soldiers and innocent civilians. Senator Cassidy called it out for what  it was: A war of aggression initiated by Putin, not Ukraine.

Senator Kennedy also rightly emphasized that negotiating with Russia  without Ukraine at the table is problematic. Republicans are saying  this. They are speaking up because they recognize that these are lies  and that we should stand firm in our support and push back against  communism and against the hate of Russia and support Ukraine.

Mr. Speaker, I urge us to do the right thing.
