Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families

Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, last week, I had the privilege  of welcoming the Corkern family to the Capitol. They traveled all the  way from Louisiana to join me for the Energy and Commerce Committee's  budget reconciliation markup because they, like so many Americans, are  proof that Medicaid saves lives.

Connor Corkern was born 18 years ago with a congenital brain  malfunction. At 6 weeks old, Connor's parents were told that his brain  malfunction was so significant that he would need one-on-one care for  all aspects of his life.

After nearly a decade of being on a waiting list for home- and  community-based disability waivers, Connor was given an emergency New  Opportunities Waiver, or NOW, in 2015. It changed their lives.

Medicaid funding and waivers like the New Opportunities Waiver, NOW,  have been and continue to be the lifeline for the Corkerns. His  Medicaid waiver is the reason he is able to live today.

When Republicans attack Medicaid, they attack families like the  Corkerns. Cutting Medicaid means that a little boy born today with  Connor's medical needs might not make it to his high school graduation.  Connor and so many others need this service to live.

Mr. Speaker, if the Republicans like their big, beautiful bill so  much, I beg this question: Why are they displaying it at 1 o'clock in  the morning?
