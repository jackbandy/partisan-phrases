Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight the completion  of Tombigbee Electric Cooperative's commitment to bring reliable, high- speed fiber internet access to more than 100,000 residents in Northwest  Alabama.

Tombigbee Electric Cooperative was established to meet the need for  electricity among citizens in the rural areas of Northwest Alabama.  Since its founding in 1941, Tombigbee has demonstrated an unwavering  dedication to serving its community and strengthening the area it  surrounds. Over the decades, the cooperative has provided safe and  provide safe and reliable electric power and fiber-to-the-home  internet.

In 2017, Tombigbee Electric Cooperative set forth an ambitious goal  to provide high-quality, high-speed internet service to 100,000 people  across Northwest Alabama. Today, that goal has been achieved.

Through the installation of more than 4,200 miles of fiber and a  total investment of $145 million, made possible by $37 million in state  and federal grants, as well as a $100 million investment by the  cooperative itself, Tombigbee Electric Cooperative has delivered on its  promise to bridge the digital divide for rural Alabamians.

Mr. Speaker, this milestone represents more than the completion of a  project, it signifies a lasting investment in the prosperity and  potential of rural communities. Thousands of citizens will now reap the  benefits of this achievement, including expanded educational  opportunities, strengthened economic development, improved access to  health care, and an enhanced quality of life for countless families and  businesses.

Tombigbee Electric Cooperative has demonstrated that when vision,  leadership, and commitment to community are combined, meaningful  progress can be made.

This accomplishment serves as a reminder that rural America must  never be left behind. I commend Tombigbee Electric Cooperative for its  steadfast dedication and leadership, and I look forward to seeing the  continued benefits this investment will bring to the people of  Northwest Alabama.
