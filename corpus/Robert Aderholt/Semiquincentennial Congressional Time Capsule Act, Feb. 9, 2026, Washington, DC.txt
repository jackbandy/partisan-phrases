Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on the bill, S.  3705, the Semiquincentennial Congressional Time Capsule Act, as led by  Congresswoman and fellow commissioner on the Semiquincentennial  Commission, Bonnie Watson Coleman, and also by Senator Thom Tillis of  North Carolina.

This bill, of course, makes technical changes to Representative  Watson Coleman's bipartisan House-passed bill, H.R. 469, to create a  congressional time capsule in commemoration of the semiquincentennial.  I think it should be clearly pointed out here that this bill is truly  bipartisan, and it is bicameral. It is a piece of legislation  that requires the four corners of congressional leadership to agree on  the contents of the capsule including a joint letter.

I look forward to the final product of this legislation and look  forward to seeing what will be in it. Again, this will be something  that we all can agree on, and it is great to be working at a time when  we can all work together and celebrate our Nation's birthday for this  250th celebration.

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  legislation.
