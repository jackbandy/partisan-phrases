Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, this month, our friend and partner, the  Republic of Azerbaijan marks the 36th anniversary of ``Black January.''

This period symbolizes the beginning of the end of Soviet rule over  Azerbaijan, an occupation that lasted for much of the 20th Century.  This was a time of oppression and horror. But uncowed by the evil of  communism, the people of Azerbaijan yearned for freedom.

On January 19, 1990, violence erupted in Azerbaijan's capital city of  Baku where Soviet troops killed over 100 Azeri demonstrators and  wounded another 700. Undeterred, the people of Azerbaijan continued  their peaceful protests until declaring independence from the U.S.S.R.  on October 18, 1991.

Now, 36 years on from this tragedy, Azerbaijan can celebrate this as  the first year of sustained peace since gaining its independence. With  the assistance of the American President, the end of the Armenia- Azerbaijan conflict promises to be a turning point for the region.

I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the events of Black  January in Azerbaijan and honoring those who lost their lives in  pursuit of freedom. Further, please join me in thanking President  Donald J. Trump for his work to secure peace and prosperity with our  friend and partner. The United States continues to stand with the  people of Azerbaijan and their right to live free.
