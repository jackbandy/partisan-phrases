Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today here on the House floor of  the United States House of Representatives to recognize an  extraordinary American and a dear personal friend, Mr. Roy Drinkard of  Cullman, Alabama, who just celebrated his 105th birthday this past  weekend, on July 12.

Born in 1920, Mr. Drinkard is a proud veteran of the Second World  War, who served his country with courage and continues to inspire all  those who know him. He is the oldest living marine in the United States  of America.

After the war, he returned to Alabama and built a legacy as a  successful businessman, civic leader, and helped shape the growth and  character of Cullman, Alabama, as well as the State.

At the age of 105, Mr. Drinkard remains active in his business. He  still serves on the board of trustees at Troy University, demonstrating  that age is no barrier to leadership, commitment, or purpose.

Mr. Speaker, Roy Drinkard is a living example of American grit and  grace. My wife, Caroline, and I are proud to call him our friend. I ask  my colleagues to join me in wishing Mr. Drinkard a very happy 105th  birthday and in thanking him for a lifetime of service to his community  and to his Nation.

May God bless Roy Drinkard and his family, and may God bless the  United States of America.
