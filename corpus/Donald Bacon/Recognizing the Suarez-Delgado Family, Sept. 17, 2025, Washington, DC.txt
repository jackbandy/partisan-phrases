Recognizing the Suarez-Delgado Family


Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Suarez-Delgado  family from my district for Hispanic Heritage Month. Their story is one  of resilience, devotion, and the pursuit of opportunity, one that  reminds us of the enduring promise of the American Dream.

Father Jaime Suarez-Reyes, born in Mexico, visited Disneyland as a  child, and it lit a spark in his heart. He decided then and there that  America would be his home. In 1981, he began raising a family with his  wife, Patricia Delgado de Suarez, and set his dream in motion.

The path was anything but easy. The process of immigrating took 7  years of perseverance, paperwork, and determination. In 1990, Jaime was  able to bring Patricia and their four children, Jaime Jr., Adrian,  Lorena, and Paulina, to Omaha, Nebraska.

Life in America demanded courage and adjustment. The Suarez children  entered school, learning English and embracing the culture of their new  home. With the support of kind neighbors and welcoming friends, the  family grew in confidence and faith in the promise of freedom and  opportunity.

Jaime worked tirelessly to support his family. His early jobs  included shifts in a meatpacking plant, cleaning offices, and selling  cars at H&H Ford. As his English improved, new doors opened. He became  a Realtor, an insurance agent, and a banker. Yet, his true calling was  entrepreneurship.

Jaime ventured into the restaurant business and steadily expanded  into other enterprises, building a foundation of a legacy that his  children will carry forward.

Jaime's success was never about business. It was about service.  Together with Patricia, he served Our Lady of Guadalupe Church,  teaching pre-marriage classes. In 1995, they became ordained family  life ministers.

Jaime volunteered in Millard Public Schools as a translator, mentor,  and soccer coach. He helped Hispanic students attend national  leadership conferences, ensuring that opportunity extended beyond his  own family and to a broader community.

From Jaime's example of faith and sacrifice, the Suarez children  forged remarkable paths of their own.

Son Jaime Jr., a Creighton Prep and UNO alumnus, stayed in Omaha to  continue the family's entrepreneurial tradition. Today, he operates 13  restaurants and cofounded real estate development and construction  companies with his brother Adrian. He serves on nonprofit boards, to  include OneWorld Community Health. He has been appointed to the  Nebraska Latino Commission and the Omaha Landmarks Heritage  Preservation Commission.

His brother Adrian also remained in Omaha. A graduate of Creighton  Prep and Creighton University, Adrian currently runs the family  business, managing more than 100 employees. He has served on the board  of trustees of the Omaha Public Library.

Their sister Lorena, a graduate of Marian High School, the University  of Rochester, and UNMC, became a surgeon specializing in oncology.  Today, she serves as a faculty member at the University of Nevada, Las  Vegas.

Finally, Paulina chose a career in nursing. Now a registered nurse in  Warren, Ohio, she and her husband run  two gyms and manage an office building that supports nonprofits.

The story of the Suarez-Delgado family reflects the best of the  American spirit. From humble beginnings to professional achievements,  their legacy is one of faith, family, and community. It is proof that  the American Dream is alive, that it endures, and that the American  Dream can be fulfilled through generations to come through resilience,  devotion, hard work, a love of family, and faith.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the Suarez-Delgado family for pursuing their  American Dream.
