Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Bellevue-Papillion  Rotary Club of Nebraska on the celebration of their 50th Anniversary.

Since its founding on January 15, 1975, the Bellevue-Papillion Rotary  Club has exemplified the values of Rotary International by promoting  peace, advancing education, and delivering vital services to the  community. Over the past five decades this organization has remained a  steadfast force for good in Eastern Sarpy County and beyond.

The club's service includes providing college scholarships to local  students, honoring outstanding educators, and awarding community  grants, their work has supported organizations such as the Bellevue  food Pantry. Habitat for Humanity, and a local shelter for survivors of  human trafficking. The club has also funded the installation of police  dash cameras, contributed to holiday food programs, and invested in  public amenities such as the gazebo at the Eastern Nebraska Veterans  Home and benches at Papillion Landing.

In moments of crisis, the Bellevue-Papillion Rotary club has stepped  up, including providing direct assistance to children affected by the  2019 floods. The club also supports global initiatives, including polio  eradication and health assistance in Africa.

The rotary motto, ``Service Above Self'', is more than a guiding  principle--it's a commitment the Bellevue-Papillion Rotary Club has  lived every day for 50 years. Its members have made immeasurable  contributions to the community and have set an example of civic  responsibility and service.

I commend the Bellevue-Papillion Rotary Club for its remarkable  legacy and congratulate its members on this milestone anniversary.
