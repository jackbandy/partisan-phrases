Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.J.  Res. 75, legislation to repeal the Biden administration's energy  efficiency standard for commercial refrigerators and freezers.

This regulation was implemented as a last-ditch effort by the Biden  administration to force its Green New Deal agenda on the American  people without regard to the impact that it will have on small  businesses.

Drastically changing efficiency standards, without input from the  American public, hurts both businesses and consumers. This will cost  American businesses $8 billion to meet the new standards, and it will,  indeed, take over 90 years for businesses to recapture that loss.

After 4 years of President Biden's inflation, business owners and  consumers are searching for relief. Repealing this out-of-touch energy  regulation will keep costs low for the American consumer and allow  small businesses to reinvest and to expand instead of being forced to  meet bureaucratic regulations.

Let me put it very simply. This is exactly the type of regulation  that the American people voted against in November. Americans want less  red tape. Americans want lower costs.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 75  which delivers results for the American people.
