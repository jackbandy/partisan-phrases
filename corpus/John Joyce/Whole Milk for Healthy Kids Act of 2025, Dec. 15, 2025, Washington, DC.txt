Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025


Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025.

Whole milk needs to be offered in schools as part of a healthy  childhood diet. This Congress, I am proud to be an original cosponsor  of the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act to bring whole milk back into  schools.

As a doctor, I recognize that as a source of nutrition, whole milk  provides 13 key nutrients that are vital to bone development, brain  development, and muscle development, all important to a growing child.

Obama-era policies that have banned whole milk in schools have caused  students to turn to highly caffeinated sugary drinks rather than  healthy whole milk and other dairy products that are crucial to a  child's development.

Under current law, schools are only permitted to offer fat-free or  low-fat milk. The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025 will allow  schools to offer students a variety of healthy choices that include  whole milk.

We must give our kids healthy options in schools, and by allowing  whole milk to be offered as a part of school lunches, this legislation  will support kids' development while encouraging young students to make  healthy choices.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.
