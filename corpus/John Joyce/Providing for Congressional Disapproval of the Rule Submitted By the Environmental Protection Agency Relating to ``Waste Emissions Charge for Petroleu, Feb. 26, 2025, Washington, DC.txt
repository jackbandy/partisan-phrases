Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Environmental Protection Agency Relating to ``Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems: Procedures for Facilitating Compliance, Including Netting and Exemptions''


Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly  support H.J. Res. 35, legislation to repeal the Biden administration's  waste emissions charge.

During President Biden's term in office, he and his administration  waged war on our domestic energy producers, limiting their production  and expanding regulations that raise prices on the American consumer.

The waste emissions charge implemented by President Biden through the  failed Inflation Reduction Act does nothing but shackle our energy  producers, raising costs for consumers, and forcing our allies into the  hands of adversaries.

By repealing the Biden administration rule, we can deliver on the  mandate that Americans voted for in November and unleash American  energy production. This will allow us to support hardworking  constituents and our allies abroad, by producing more affordable and  cleaner energy.

By simply repealing this overreaching regulation, our Nation can step  forward, fully utilizing the energy resources that are underneath the  feet of my constituents.

Soon, with the help of H.J. Res. 35, we will once again be energy  dominant. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important  legislation.
