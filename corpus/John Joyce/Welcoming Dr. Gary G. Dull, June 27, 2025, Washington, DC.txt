Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the  pastor of the Faith Baptist Church of Altoona, Pennsylvania, and the  president of the Way of Truth Ministries, Pastor Gary Dull.

Pastor Dull has been preaching the Gospel since he was 12 years old.  By the time he was a senior at Washington Bible College, Pastor Dull  was already preaching at Morningside Baptist Church in Suitland,  Maryland, right outside of Washington, D.C.

Since then, Pastor Dull has had an incredible life. He has served at  four churches in Pennsylvania and Florida and is currently in his 29th  year as the pastor of the Faith Baptist Church of Altoona.

Pastor Dull also founded the Way of Truth Ministries, which has  missionaries on three continents. Pastor Dull has evangelized by  preaching the Gospel and serving those in need in 25 different  countries.

Pastor Dull has devoted his life to spreading the Word of the Lord  and serving those less fortunate. Whether in his community or  throughout the world, he has embodied the selfless service of Jesus  Christ, his Savior.

It is a privilege to welcome Pastor Gary Dull and his wife of 50  years, Nancy, to Washington to open the floor of the United States  House of Representatives in prayer.
