Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of the HALT Fentanyl Act, critical legislation to crack down on  the criminals who produce, traffic, and sell fentanyl and fentanyl- related substances.

Earlier this year, we were able to hear powerful testimony from two  of my constituents, Ray and Deb Cullen, who tragically lost their son,  Zach, to fentanyl poisoning. Unfortunately, they are not alone in this  pathway to pain. Last year, one Pennsylvanian died from an overdose  every 2 hours, with the overwhelming majority of these resulting from  fentanyl poisoning.

We owe it to our future generations to end this plague on our society  by passing the HALT Fentanyl Act.

Our courageous Border Patrol and law enforcement officers will be  more effective in removing fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances  that come across our border, end up in our communities, and poison our  children, friends, and neighbors.

Additionally, this legislation will also result in harsher penalties  for the criminals and cartel members who are responsible for the spread  of this poison. As a nation, we can no longer sit by while future  generations of American workers, parents, and community leaders are  taken away from us.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this legislation today and to save the lives of so many  throughout this great country. It is time to halt fentanyl.
