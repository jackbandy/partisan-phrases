Recognizing the Dedicated Public Service of Betty Bucher


Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the  dedicated public service of Betty Bucher, who recently concluded a 16- year tenure as a member of Littlestown Borough Council in Adams County.

During the December meeting of the borough council, Betty was honored  for the steady and reliable leadership that she provided to the  community.

Serving in the role of Council Vice President, Betty was presented a  proclamation that highlighted her service on the borough's union and  police contract committee and a design committee that facilitated the  creation of a mural for the new borough building.

Betty's servant leadership in the borough stretches from the mid- 1960s, when she was instrumental in the creation and early operation of  the former Littlestown Swimming Pool.

With professionalism and integrity over the last 16 years, Betty has  most certainly personified the ideals of representative governance.

On behalf of constituents throughout Pennsylvania's 13th  Congressional District, I thank Betty for her faithful public service.
