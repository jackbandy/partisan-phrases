Terminating the National Emergency Declared with Respect to Energy


Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to deliver two statements on the two  resolutions that are before us. First let me comment upon the proposal  S.J. Res. 71, led by my colleagues Senator Kaine and Heinrich, to  overturn President Trump's sham energy emergency.

You would think that, in an energy emergency, the President would be  pursuing the all-of-the-above energy policy his administration has  touted, but instead he is throwing up roadblocks at more than 90  percent of the power set to come online, as his Energy Secretary has  acknowledged. Meanwhile, President Trump has invoked emergency powers  to fast-track dirty fossil fuel projects, primarily to reward the Big  Oil donors whom he reportedly asked to donate a billion dollars to his  campaign.

The fact is, energy prices are a real emergency for the American  people, and we need more energy on the grid to keep up with the  proliferation of AI and data centers. But the truth also is, President  Trump and the harmful actions his administration is taking are actually  restricting supply, killing good-paying jobs, and increasing energy  prices, which have risen at more than twice the rate of inflation this  year under President Trump.

I will highlight two examples of President Trump's reckless actions  in my home State of Rhode Island. Right now, the Rhode Island AFL-CIO  is leading a critical lawsuit against President Trump's cancelation of  the $7 billion Solar for All Program, which was designed to help low-  and middle-income families install solar panels on their homes, saving  those families about $400 each year on electricity costs.

Rhode Island received nearly $50 million under this program to help  thousands of Rhode Island households install and utilize solar energy  while supporting hundreds of good-paying jobs in the State.

President Trump claims to support workers, but he is actually killing  good jobs that would bring affordable energy online for our  constituents. And just weeks after canceling the Solar for All Program,  the Trump administration paused work on Revolution Wind, a nearly  complete offshore wind project off the coast of Rhode Island. This  project is 80 percent constructed, with over $5 billion invested and 45  turbines already installed in the Atlantic Ocean. It supports more than  1,000 local union jobs and is poised to deliver enough low-cost energy  to power 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. State officials  estimate that losing this project could cost New England ratepayers up  to $500 million a year.

I am encouraged that a Federal court in Washington, DC, granted a  motion allowing work on Revolution Wind to proceed and that work has  restarted, but these cynical moves show that the President doesn't  really care about energy prices or supply or jobs; he cares, really,  about pleasing his Big Oil donors.

He is also pleasing China, which is becoming the global leader in  clean energy technology, building almost three-quarters of the world's  solar and wind projects, according to the Global Energy Monitor. And  despite President Trump's claims that China is simply exporting these  technologies and not utilizing them, the New York Times reported that  ``In China, more wind turbines and solar panels were installed last  year than in the rest of the world combined.''

At the same time, President Trump is trying to keep the United States  hooked on expensive oil and gas and dependent on OPEC and other foreign  actors with interests opposed to our own; and while he is doing that,  China is launching into a new age of relatively cheap energy that will  power their data centers and their infrastructure.

Rhode Islanders deserve infrastructure that creates good jobs;  provides affordable, clean power; increases our energy independence;  and reduces climate-destroying greenhouse gases in the process. And it  is clear Trump's energy emergency is a sham, and I am proud to join my  colleagues' efforts to overturn it.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to move to the topic before the  Senate with respect to the War Powers resolution regarding Caribbean  military operations.

I rise to express my deep concern about the Trump administration's  ongoing military operations in the Caribbean and to voice my strong  support for the War Powers Resolution introduced by Senators Schiff,  Kaine, Wyden, and Sanders.

Over the past month, the United States has carried out four lethal  strikes on boats in the Caribbean, reportedly killing 21 individuals.  These attacks have been retroactively explained by the President's  unilateral declaration that the United States is in ``armed conflict''  with unnamed ``non-state armed groups'' throughout the Western  Hemisphere.

He has deployed thousands of U.S. forces, ships, and aircraft to  conduct  these operations--all without congressional authorization and without  any credible explanation to the American people.

Let me be clear. The drug cartels that traffic poison across our  borders are violent and reprehensible. They have devastated families  and communities across our country. We must do everything in our power  through law enforcement, intelligence, and international cooperation to  bring these organizations down. But that is not what this is all about.  These are not police actions or defensive operations; these are  targeted, lethal military strikes using weapons designed for warfare,  not interdiction or law enforcement.

The administration has offered no positive identification for those  killed, nor any information linking the boat crews to cartels. In fact,  they have not proven that these vessels were engaged in drug  trafficking, nor even that they were destined for the United States.

I would note that even if this evidence had been provided, that would  only justify interdiction by law enforcement, not lethal military  strikes.

The justification thus far has relied entirely on the President's  word, and that is not good enough. Our Constitution does not vest the  power to wage war on one man's word. The White House has claimed that  these strikes are allowable under the President's article II powers as  Commander in Chief, but article II is not a blank check. The Framers of  our Constitution deliberately separated the powers of war and peace  between the branches.

James Madison warned:

The executive is the branch most prone to war; therefore       the Constitution has, with studied care, vested that power in       the legislature.

The War Powers Resolution exists for moments like this. It ensures  that before we send American forces into hostilities, the people's  representatives have debated and voted on that decision. It ensures  accountability. It ensures legitimacy.

If we allow these unauthorized operations to continue unchecked, we  will have surrendered Congress's most solemn constitutional duty. We  will have set the precedent that the President--any President--may  initiate military action at will, without oversight, without  transparency, and without the consent of the governed.

We have seen this pattern before. Over the past several years, this  administration has repeatedly tested the limits of Executive power-- ordering strikes in Iran and Yemen and now the Caribbean, while  refusing even a brief consultation with Congress. Each time, the lines  blur a little further. Each time, the balance of power tilts a little  more toward the Executive.

This body, the U.S. Senate, cannot afford to shrug and move on. The  slow erosion of congressional oversight is not an abstract debate about  process; it is a real and present threat to our democracy.

The War Powers Resolution before us does not tie the President's  hands in responding to genuine threats; it simply requires him to do  what every Commander in Chief should: come to Congress, present the  facts, and seek authorization from the people's representatives before  initiating hostilities. That is not weakness. That is constitutional  strength. It is the principle that has guided our Republic for nearly  2\1/2\ centuries.

Finally, I will say this: Even setting aside the constitutional  questions, this campaign is deeply unwise. The notion that we can bomb  our way out of a drug trafficking crisis is not strategy; it is wishful  thinking. Using the U.S. military to conduct unchecked strikes in the  Caribbean risks destabilizing the region, provoking confrontation with  neighboring governments, and drawing our forces into yet another open- ended conflict without a clear mission or exit strategy.

Conflict in the Caribbean or with Venezuela is entirely avoidable,  but the risk that we stumble into war because of one man's impulsive  decision making has never been higher. Our troops deserve better--much  better.

This War Powers Resolution would restore that balance. It reaffirms  that the Constitution has always required that decisions of war and  peace belong to the legislature, not the Executive.

Mr. President, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution and to reassert the fundamental role of Congress in matters  of war.
