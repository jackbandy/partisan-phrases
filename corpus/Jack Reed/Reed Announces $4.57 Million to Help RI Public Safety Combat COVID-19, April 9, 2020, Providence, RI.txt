Reed Announces $4.57 Million to Help RI Public Safety Combat COVID-19


In an effort to help public safety agencies across Rhode Island effectively combat the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), U.S. Senator Jack Reed today announced $4.57 million in federal funding for the state.  The funds are made available through the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) Act.  Nine cities and towns, including Central Falls, Cranston, East Providence, Newport, Pawtucket, Providence, Warwick, West Warwick, and Woonsocket are eligible to receive a share of $1,347,968 in federal public safety funds to combat COVID-19.  Additionally, the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety is scheduled to receive $3,226,449 from the fiscal year 2020 Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental funding allocations.

This flexible funding may be used for overtime and equipment, including personal protective equipment (PPE) for law enforcement to help keep themselves safe as they assist others.  States and localities may also hire personnel, conduct training, and address the medical needs of prisoners.

Senator Reed urged all eligible state and local governments to apply immediately for these critical funds, which will be awarded on a rolling basis by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Justice programs.

"Our public safety officials and first responders are doing a remarkable job and these funds will bolster their efforts to serve, protect, and combat COVID-19.  These federal funds will go directly to state and local governments with no match required and may be used to pay overtime costs, purchase personal protective equipment, and ensure our first responders have the tools they need to protect themselves and the communities they serve from COVID-19," said Senator Reed, a member of the Appropriations Committee who helped include $850 million for the Byrne-Justice Assistance Grant Program (Byrne-JAG) in the CARES Act.  "I'm pleased to work with my colleagues in the delegation to make these funds available and join United States Attorney Aaron Weisman in encouraging our state and local law enforcement agencies to apply."

Senator Reed said under the CARES Act, Rhode Island should receive the following allotments from these Justice Assistance Grants:

Central Falls: $82,659

Cranston: $76,518

East Providence: $42,975

Newport: $47,140

Pawtucket: $199,958

Providence: $661,923

Warwick: $49,331

West Warwick: $42,317

Woonsocket: $145,146

Rhode Island Department of Public Safety: $3,226,449

TOTAL: $4,574,417

Eligibility and allocation levels for these grants are based on each locality's past applications for the Byrne-JAG Grant Program. 

The due date for Rhode Island's applications is no later than May 30, 2020.  The funding solicitation for jurisdictions can be found at: https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/bja-2020-18553.pdf
