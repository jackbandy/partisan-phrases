S.J. Res. 10


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688190/sj-res-10


Mr. REED. Mr. President, initially, I want to make a very brief  comment on the legislation my colleagues Senator Heinrich and Senator  Kaine are advancing and which will be voted on later this afternoon. I  am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution, which would overturn  President Trump's really sham energy emergency.

At a time when the United States is already producing record amounts  of oil and gas, the President wants to bypass laws and explore eminent  domain to fast-track fossil fuel projects--not alternate energy  projects, fossil fuel projects--and really not to lower prices or  create jobs but to benefit his Big Oil donors, whom President Trump  reportedly asked to donate $1 billion to his campaign. It sounds  awfully like quid pro quo, which in the past was frowned upon by  Presidents.

The truth is, the President's Executive orders on energy, including  his unlawful pause on investments from the Inflation Reduction Act,  threaten to raise prices, kill good-paying American jobs, and cede  economic opportunities to China.

This is true in my home State of Rhode Island, where offshore wind  companies worked hand in hand with the local communities, labor  leaders, and local officials to invest in good-paying jobs for Rhode  Island. The President's actions threaten that process.

So I look forward to voting in favor of this resolution when it comes  up later today.
