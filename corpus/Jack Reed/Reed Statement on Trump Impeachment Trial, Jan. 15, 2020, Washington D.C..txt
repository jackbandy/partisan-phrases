Reed Statement on Trump Impeachment Trial


Today, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to transmit two articles of impeachment against President Donald J. Trump for "abuse of power" and "obstruction of Congress," formally setting the stage for the president to be tried in the U.S. Senate. 

U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) issued the following statement:

"President Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for the serious charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress.  Now, the U.S. Senate must conduct a full and fair process.  It must be a pursuit of the facts and truth above all else, and that means relevant documents and witnesses as in any other trial."
