Senate Passes Collins, Reed Resolution Declaring Today "Read Across America Day"


U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Jack Reed (D-RI) renewed their commitment to encouraging healthy reading habits among young Americans by introducing a bipartisan resolution designating today, March 2, 2020, as "Read Across America Day."  The resolution was unanimously passed by the Senate.

 

"Read Across America Day is an opportunity for Americans of all ages to appreciate the joys of reading and recognize the important role reading has in helping students achieve academic and lifelong success," said Senator Collins.  "Through my visits to more than 200 Maine elementary and secondary schools, I have seen firsthand how reading is the best way for children to love learning and can help unlock young people's full potential.  I commend parents and educators for teaching children how enjoyable reading can be and instilling enduring reading habits."

 

"Today is a day to celebrate books and inspire a love of reading.  Literacy is the foundation of learning, and this resolution highlights the importance of reading for children's development and academic success," said Senator Reed.  "Each year, Read Across America Day also inspires adults to set a good example by picking up a book and helping instill a love of reading."

 

Now celebrating its 23rd year, Read Across America is an annual event sponsored by the National Education Association (NEA) and partner organizations that seeks to motivate children and teens to improve their literacy skills.  The event coincides with the birthday of Theodor Geisel, better known by his pseudonym "Dr. Seuss," who was a prolific writer of popular children's stories.  On the weekday closest to Geisel's birthday, the NEA helps organize events and activities in schools throughout the U.S. that emphasize the importance of reading and the enjoyment it brings year-round.
