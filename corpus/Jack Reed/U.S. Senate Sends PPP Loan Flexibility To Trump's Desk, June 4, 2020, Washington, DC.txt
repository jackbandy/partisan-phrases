U.S. Senate Sends PPP Loan Flexibility To Trump's Desk


In an effort to help struggling small businesses and promote economic recovery, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives passed the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act.  The bill, which now goes to the President's desk to be signed into law, extends the PPP loan forgiveness period from 8 weeks to 24 weeks, and allows businesses and non-profits to spend more money on other business expenses, such as utilities and rent by altering the threshold that must be directed to employee wages from 75 percent to 60 percent.

U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) is one of nine Senate cosponsors of the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act.  Reed, a proponent of PPP reform, says stronger Congressional oversight, better implementation by the Trump Administration, and increased transparency are still required to ensure the law works.  And Reed is calling for additional support to help workers, businesses, and communities recover.

"This was a critical step toward revamping the Paycheck Protection Program.  It will help provide small businesses with increased certainty and flexibility to cover necessary costs like rent.  But Congress and the Administration still have a lot of work to do to get this program working properly and get our economy working again.  There has to be meaningful accountability and oversight of PPP and sustained, bipartisan commitment to broad-based economic recovery.  There should be a public audit of PPP so the American people can see where their money is going and who it is going to.  Right now the Trump Administration is keeping that information to itself which could result in abuse of the program.  There needs to sunlight and oversight to ensure PPP works properly for taxpayers," said Senator Reed.

The U.S. Senate unanimously approved the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act late Wednesday after Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) dropped his hold on the bill.  The measure had previously passed the House on a vote of 417-1.  Without passage of this law, the old eight-week period to spend the loan money would have lapsed within days for some businesses.  This compressed time period limited the U.S. Senate's ability to consider more comprehensive fixes.

Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (Public Law No. 116-136) and appropriated an initial $349 billion for the program, which was intended to be a lifeline for small businesses and workers.  PPP offers forgivable small business loans to cover two months-worth of payroll and overhead costs.  But PPP has been plagued by problems, mismanagement, and lack of sound guidance from the Trump Administration.  After the first round of PPP funding lapsed, Senator Reed sought important legislative fixes and updates to the program.  Unfortunately, Congressional Republicans blocked any legislative fixes from being included in the second round of PPP funding, which increased the overall allocation to $659 billion.

And instead of addressing known problems with the bill during the May legislative session, Senate Republican leaders failed to bring PPP improvements up for a vote before the Memorial Day recess.

"The Trump Administration's mismanagement of PPP has created significant confusion and hindered economic recovery.  And instead of passing legislative fixes and focusing on COVID-19 relief, Congressional Republicans have prioritized a partisan agenda that focuses more on confirming out of the mainstream judicial nominees over helping working families.  Meanwhile, the economic hole is getting deeper for Main Street businesses, employees, and out of work Americans.  Congressional Republicans should set partisanship aside and join us to help get the economy working," said Reed.

The bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act was led by U.S. Senators Angus King (I-ME) and Steve Daines (R-MT) and cosponsored by Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Jack Reed (D-RI).

The Trump Administration has indicated President Trump will sign the bill into law.
