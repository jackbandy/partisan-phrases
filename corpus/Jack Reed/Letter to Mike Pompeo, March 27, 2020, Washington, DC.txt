Letter to Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State - Reed Presses Pompeo Over Failures to Help RIers Stranded Abroad Amid Coronavirus Pandemic


Dear Secretary Pompeo,

I write to express my continued concern at the inability of many Rhode Islanders to return to the United States due to current and expected travel restrictions and reduction in flights as a result of efforts to combat the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).  During times of crisis, American citizens expect their government to assist them and to provide timely information.  As has been widely reported, that has not always occurred. 

Further, my office has been contacted by constituents who are stranded overseas and who often express frustration with the lack of information from the State Department.  In particular, my office has been contacted by more than two dozen constituents who remain overseas and wish to return home.  These Rhode Islanders are currently located in Liberia, Samoa, Indonesia, Cape Verde, Guatemala, Peru, Syria, Honduras, Thailand, Philippines, and Australia.  

Lastly, I would like additional information related to the State Department's efforts to ensure that my constituents can return from Liberia, Indonesia, Samoa, and Cape Verde.  Information related to these countries has been particularly scarce.  

The State Department must do everything it can to assist Americans abroad who wish to return home -- including the provision of emergency flights. 

As my previous correspondence indicated, I stand ready to work with you to assist Americans and the dedicated State Department staff working across the globe. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,
