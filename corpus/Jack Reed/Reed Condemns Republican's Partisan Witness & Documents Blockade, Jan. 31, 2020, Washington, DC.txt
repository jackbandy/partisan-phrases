Reed Condemns Republican's Partisan Witness & Documents Blockade


Today, after Senate Republicans voted down an effort to subpoena witnesses and documents in the impeachment trial of President Donald John Trump, U.S. Senator Jack Reed issued the following statement:

"The Republican vote to block witnesses and documents is a travesty.

"Our constitutional obligation is to conduct a fair trial and you can't have a fair trial without relevant documents and witnesses.  New evidence continues to emerge and witnesses have come forward with additional information.  I do not understand why my Republican colleagues are afraid to see and hear this information.  Why deny readily available firsthand testimony that can help senators, and the American people, make an informed decision based on facts?

"Today's precedent is bad for the Senate and a major setback for those who want to get at the truth."
