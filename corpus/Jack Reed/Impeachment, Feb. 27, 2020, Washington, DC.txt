Impeachment


   Reed in the              Impeachment Trial of President Donald John Trump                                 I. FINDINGS  

       Based on the evidence in the record, the arguments of the       House Impeachment Managers, and the arguments of the       President's Counsel, I conclude as follows: The President has       violated his constitutional oath to ``take care that the laws       be faithfully executed'' and placed his personal and       political interests above the interests of the United States.       The House Impeachment Managers have proven that the       President's abuse of power and congressional obstruction       amount to the constitutional standard of ``high Crimes and       Misdemeanors'' for which the sole remedy is conviction and       removal from office.                          II. STATEMENT OF THE FACTS  

       On December 18, 2019, the United States House of       Representatives passed H. Res. 755,\1\ ``Impeaching Donald       John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes       and misdemeanors.'' H. Res. 755 contains two Articles of       Impeachment. The first Article declares that the President       abused his power by soliciting foreign interference to help       his bid for reelection in the 2020 United States presidential       election and conditioning United States government acts of       significant value on the foreign power's cooperation. The       second Article declares that the President obstructed       Congress by directing the categorical, indiscriminate       defiance of subpoenas for witness testimony and documents       deemed vital to the House Impeachment inquiry. 

       Pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of the United States       Constitution, the United States Senate convened as a Court of       Impeachment on January 16, 2020, and each Senator took an       oath to ``do impartial justice according to the Constitution       and laws.'' \2\ Alexander Hamilton spoke about the Senate's       role in an Impeachment trial in Federalist Paper No. 65, when       he wrote, ``What other body would be likely to feel       confidence enough in its own situation, to preserve unawed       and uninfluenced the necessary impartiality between an       individual accused and the representatives of the people, his       accusers?'' \3\ 

       The obligation of the Senate is to accord the President, as       the accused, the right to conduct his defense fairly, while       respecting the House's exclusive constitutional prerogative       to bring Articles of Impeachment. At the core of the Senate's       task is the fundamental understanding that our system of laws       recognizes the rights of defendants and the responsibilities       of the prosecution to prove its case. Such a basic tenet of       our law and our experience as a free people does not       evaporate in the rarified atmosphere of a Court of       Impeachment, simply because the accused is the President and       the accuser is the House of Representatives.               III. THE CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT  

       ``The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all       Impeachments.'' \4\ With these few words, the Framers of the       Constitution entrusted the Senate with the most awesome power       within a democratic society: whether to remove an impeached       President from office.      A. High Crimes and Misdemeanors 

       The Constitution states, ``The President, Vice President       and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed       from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason,       Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \5\ 

       ``Treason'' and ``Bribery'' are foundational impeachable       offenses. No more heinous example of an offense against the       constitutional order exists than betrayal of the nation to an       enemy or betrayal of duty for personal enrichment. A       President commits treason when he levies war against the       United States or gives comfort or aid to its enemies.\6\ As       the House Judiciary Committee explains, a President engages       in impeachable bribery when he ``offers, solicits, or accepts       something of personal value to influence his own official       actions.'' \7\ 

       In interpreting ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' we must       not only look to the       Federalist Papers and the records of the Constitutional       Convention, but also to the contemporary and foundational       writings on Impeachment available to the Framers. 

       Sir William Blackstone, whose influential Commentaries on       the Laws of England were published from 1765-1770, discussed       a classification of crimes he termed ``public wrongs, or       crimes and misdemeanors'' that he defined as breaches of the       public duty that an individual owed to their entire       community.\8\ Blackstone viewed treason, murder, and robbery       as ``public wrongs'' not only because they cause injury to       individuals but also because they ``strike at the very being       of society.'' \9\ 

       Richard Wooddeson, a legal scholar who began giving       lectures on English law in 1777, defined impeachable offenses       as misdeeds that fail to clearly fall under the jurisdiction       of ordinary tribunals. These wrongs were ``abuse[s] of high       offices of trust'' that damaged the commonwealth.\10\ 

       Much the same as Blackstone and Wooddeson, Alexander       Hamilton included the dual components of abuse of public       trust and national harm in his definition of impeachable       crimes and misdemeanors. In Federalist Paper No. 65, Hamilton       defined an impeachable offense as ``those offenses which       proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other words       from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of       a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated       POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done       immediately to the society itself.'' \11\      B. The Constitutional Debates 

       Adding impressive support to these consistent views of the       meaning of the constitutional term, ``high Crimes and       Misdemeanors,'' is the history of the deliberations at the       Constitutional Convention. 

       The convention delegates considered limiting Impeachment to       treason and bribery. However, they concluded that these       enumerated offenses alone could not anticipate every manner       of profound misconduct that a future President might engage       in.\12\ George Mason, a delegate from Virginia, declared that       ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' would be an apt way to       further capture ``great and dangerous offences'' or       ``[a]ttempts to subvert the Constitution.'' \13\ 

       This wording would also set the necessarily high threshold       for Impeachment that would be proportional to the severe       punishment of removing an elected official and       disqualification from holding future public office. 

       Further insight is provided by James Iredell, a delegate to       the North Carolina Convention that ratified the Constitution,       who later served as a Justice of the United States Supreme       Court. During the Convention debates, Iredell stated: 

       The power of impeachment is given by this Constitution, to       bring great offenders to punishment . . . This power is       lodged in those who represent the great body of the people,       because the occasion for its exercise will arise from acts of       great injury to the community, and the objects of it may be       such as cannot be easily reached by an ordinary tribunal.\14\ 

       Iredell's understanding sustains the view that an       impeachable offense must cause ``great injury to the       community.'' Private wrongdoing, without a significant,       adverse effect upon the nation, cannot constitute an       impeachable offense. James Wilson, a delegate to the Federal       Constitutional Convention and, like Iredell, later a Supreme       Court Justice, wrote that Impeachments are ``proceedings of a       political nature . . . confined to political characters, to       political crimes and misdemeanors, and to political       punishments.'' \15\ 

       Later commentators expressed similar views. In 1833,       Justice Joseph Story quoted favorably from the scholarship of       William Rawle, who concluded that the ``legitimate causes of       impeachment . . . can have reference only to public       character, and official duty . . . In general, those       offenses, which may be committed equally by a private person,       as a public officer, are not the subject of impeachment.''       \16\ 

       This line of reasoning is buttressed by the careful and       thoughtful work of the House of Representatives during the       Watergate proceedings. The Democratic staff of the House       Judiciary Committee concluded that, ``Because impeachment of       a President is a grave step for the nation, it is to be       predicated only upon conduct seriously incompatible with       either the constitutional form and principles of our       government or the proper performance of constitutional duties       of the presidential office.'' \17\ 

       The deliberations at the Constitutional Convention also       demonstrate a conscious movement to narrow the terminology as       a means of raising the threshold for the Impeachment process       to require an offense against the State. 

       Early in the debate on the issue of presidential       Impeachment in July of 1787, it was suggested that       Impeachment and removal could be founded on a showing of       ``malpractice,'' ``neglect of duty,'' or ``corruption.'' \18\       By September of 1787, the issue of presidential Impeachment       had been referred to the Committee of Eleven, which was       created to resolve the most contentious issues. The Committee       of Eleven considered whether the grounds for Impeachment       should be ``treason or bribery.'' \19\ This was significantly       more restricted than the amorphous standard of       ``malpractice,'' too restricted, in fact, for some delegates.       George Mason objected and suggested that       ``maladministration'' be added to ``treason and bribery.''       \20\ This suggestion was opposed by Madison as being       ``equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.''       \21\ Mason responded by further refining his suggestion and       offered the term ``other high crimes and misdemeanors against       the State.'' \22\ The Mason language was a clear reference to       the English legal history of Impeachment. Mason's proposal       explicitly narrowed these offenses to those ``against the       State.'' The Convention itself further clarified the standard       by replacing ``State'' with the ``United States.'' \23\ 

       At the conclusion of the substantive deliberations on the       constitutional standard of Impeachment, it was obvious that       only serious offenses against the governmental system would       justify Impeachment and subsequent removal from office.       However, the final stylistic touches to the Constitution were       applied by the Committee of Style. This Committee had no       authority to alter the meaning of the carefully debated       language, but could only impose a stylistic consistency       through, among other things, the elimination of redundancy.       In its zeal to streamline the text, the words ``against the       United States'' were eliminated as unnecessary to the meaning       of the passage.\24\ 

       The weight of both authoritative commentary and the history       of the Constitutional Convention combines to provide       convincing proof that the Impeachment process was reserved       for serious breaches of the constitutional order that       threaten the country in a direct and immediate manner.      C. An Impeachable Offense is Not Limited to Criminal           Liability or A Defined Offense 

       In the case before us, the President's Counsel wholly       reject a longstanding understanding of Impeachment, by       arguing that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense and       by positing that ``the Framers restricted impeachment to       specific offenses against `already known and established       law.' '' \25\ 

       This assertion is clearly wrong. Article I, Section 3 of       the United States Constitution provides that ``Judgment in       Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal       from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any       Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but       the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject       to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to       Law.'' \26\ As Delegate James Wilson wrote, ``impeachments,       and offenses and offenders impeachable ``[do not come] within       the sphere of ordinary jurisprudence. They are founded on       different principles, are governed by different maxims, and       are directed to different objects: for this reason, the trial       and punishment of an offense on an impeachment, is no bar to       a trial and punishment of the same offence at common law.''       \27\ The independence of the Impeachment process from the       prosecution of crimes underscores the function of Impeachment       as a means to remove a President from office, not only       because of criminal behavior, but because the President       poses a threat to the constitutional order. Criminal       behavior is not irrelevant to an Impeachment, but it only       becomes decisive if that behavior imperils the balance of       powers established in the Constitution. 

       The assertion that an impeachable offense must be       predicated on a criminal act goes against the well-      established consensus of the legal community. For example,       the argument by President's Counsel is undercut by the       President's current Attorney General, William Barr. Mr. Barr       wrote in a 2018 memo to the Department of Justice (DOJ) when       he was still in private practice, that the President ``is       answerable for any abuses of discretion and is ultimately       subject to the judgment of Congress through the impeachment       process [which] means that the president is not the judge in       his own cause.'' \28\ As Mr. Barr makes clear, Impeachment       does not need to be based on a crime. 

       Furthermore, the assertion that an impeachable offense must       involve the violation of an ``already known or established''       law, even if not criminal, is not supported by the       constitutional record. In advocating for the inclusion of       Impeachment at the Constitutional Convention, James Madison       made the case that the country must be protected against any       number of abuses that a President could engage in and which       might cause permanent damage to the country. Madison wrote       that: 

       [It was] indispensable that some provision should be made       for defending the Community [against] the incapacity,       negligence or perfidy of the chief Magistrate. The limitation       of the period of his service, was not a sufficient security .       . . He might pervert his administration into a scheme of       peculation or oppression. He might betray his trust to       foreign powers.\29\ 

       Confining Impeachment to criminal or even codified offenses       goes against the mainstream consensus on the meaning of       ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' and would fail to capture       the universe of harms to the constitutional order in which a       President could engage.      D. Impeachment as a Remedy for Corrupting Foreign Influence 

       The Founders were also gravely concerned about the dangers       of foreign influence corrupting our elections and interfering       with the rule of law.\30\ The United States was then a       fledging union that had just gained independence from       Britain, with help from the French during the American       Revolution. As       such, the Founders rightly feared that foreign governments       might try to exploit American politics in order to further       their own interests. During the Constitutional Convention,       Elbridge Gerry, a delegate from Massachusetts, warned that       ``[f]oreign powers will intermeddle in our affairs, and spare       no expence to influence them.'' \31\ 

       The Founders were also acutely aware of the potential for       public officials to betray their office to a foreign power,       if the temptation were strong enough. Hamilton conceded in       Federalist Paper No. 22 that ``[o]ne of the weak sides of       republics, among their numerous advantages, is that they       afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption.'' \32\ In       Hamilton's view, when ordinary men are elevated by their       fellow citizens to high office, they ``may find compensations       for betraying their trust, which to any but minds animated       and guided by superior virtue, may appear to exceed the       proportion of interest they have in the common stock, and to       over-balance the obligations of duty. Hence it is that       history furnishes us with so many mortifying examples of the       prevalency of foreign corruption in republican governments.''       \33\      E. Conclusion 

       Authoritative commentary on, together with the structure       of, the Constitution makes it clear that the term, ``other       high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' encompasses conduct that       involves the President in the impermissible exercise of the       powers of his office to upset the constitutional order.       Moreover, since the essence of Impeachment is removal from       office, rather than punishment for offenses, there is a       strong inference that the improper conduct must represent a       continuing threat to the American people and the       Constitution. It must be an episode that either cannot be       dealt with in the Courts or that raises generalized concerns       about the continued service of the President, as is the case       presented here.                            IV. STANDARD OF PROOF  

       In an Impeachment trial, each Senator has the obligation to       establish the burden of proof he or she deems proper.\34\ The       Founding Fathers believed maximum discretion was critical for       Senators confronting the gravest of constitutional       choices.\35\ Differentiating Impeachment from criminal       trials, Alexander Hamilton argued, in Federalist Paper No.       65, that Impeachments ``can never be tied down by such strict       rules . . . as in common cases serve to limit the discretion       of courts in favor of personal security.'' \36\ In this       regard, Hamilton further distinguished Impeachment       proceedings from a criminal trial by stressing that an       impeached official would be subject to the established rules       of criminal prosecution after Impeachment.\37\ 

       During the Clinton Impeachment trial, I believed, as I do       now, that the House Impeachment Managers bear the burden of       proving their case.\38\ In that trial, the House Impeachment       Managers asserted that the Senators should reach a conclusion       utilizing a beyond a reasonable doubt standard before voting       to convict the President. The House Impeachment Managers,       explicitly stated, ``none of us, would argue . . . that the       President should be removed from office unless you conclude       he committed the crimes that he is alleged to have       committed.'' \39\ I chose that standard of proof during that       trial.\40\ As I stated then, ``[h]ad the charges of th[at]       case involved threats to our constitutional order not readily       characterized by criminal charges, I would have been forced       to further parse an exact standard. However, for all       practical purposes, the Managers have themselves established       the burden of proof in [the Clinton Impeachment] case.'' \41\ 

       As the charges in this case against President Trump cut to       the core of our constitutional order, I believe that I am now       required to offer further analysis on which standard of proof       to apply. 

       While the House Impeachment Managers in the current trial       did not provide a single standard of proof required for       conviction and removal, it was clear that the bar they set       was quite high, which is appropriate. However, what exact       constitutional standard should be used remains debatable.       Practical concerns related to utilizing the Impeachment power       should be considered when determining the standard of proof       required. Too low of a standard may lead to removal, even if       significant doubts exist. A ``. . . high `criminal' standard       of proof could mean, in practice, that a man could remain       president whom every member of the Senate believed to be       guilty of corruption, just because his guilt was not shown       `beyond a reasonable doubt.' '' \42\ 

       When uncertain about the standard of proof to apply, it is       worth reviewing the writings of eminent scholars. In doing       so, I have found a closer approximation to what the standard       should be in many Impeachment trials as compared to those       used in general legal practice: `` `[o]verwhelming       preponderance of the evidence' . . .'' \43\ Yet, I believe       that the severity of removing a President of the United       States warrants an even higher bar. As such, a definition       slightly modified, but modeled on that proposed standard, is       more applicable: overwhelmingly clear and convincing       evidence. 

       This standard more closely comports with historical       analysis of the Founders' desire to separate criminal law and       Impeachment, and the arguments made by scholars, while       reflecting the serious constitutional harms alleged in the       Articles of Impeachment before the Senate. Further, after       review of substantive differences between the Articles of       Impeachment that allege President Trump's dire and ongoing       threat to our constitutional order and the Articles of       Impeachment levied against President Clinton--which could be       more readily applied by analogy to criminal law--a different       standard is clearly warranted. In a future case, if Articles       of Impeachment contain a set of facts or allegations not       contemplated in either the Clinton Impeachment trial or in       this case, I will likely have to revisit this analysis. 

       The Articles, embodied in H. Res. 755, accuse the President       of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. After reading       the materials and hearing the arguments presented at trial, I       conclude that the evidence presented at trial was more than       compelling. Indeed, it was overwhelmingly clear and       convincing. Having concluded that the charges of abuse of       power and obstruction of Congress rise to the level of ``high       Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' an analysis of the specific       charges is necessary.                         V. ARTICLE I: ABUSE OF POWER  

       Article I of House Resolution 755 provides that, in the       conduct of his office, the President abused his presidential       powers, in violation of his constitutional duty to take care       that the laws be faithfully executed, through a scheme, or       course of conduct, to solicit interference of a foreign       government, Ukraine, in the 2020 U.S. presidential election       for personal political gain. The scheme included President       Trump soliciting the Government of Ukraine to publicly       announce investigations that would influence the 2020 U.S.       presidential election to his advantage and the disadvantage       of a potential political opponent in that election. Article I       provides further that President Trump, for corrupt purposes,       used the powers of the Office in a manner that injured the       vital national interests of the United States by harming the       integrity of the democratic process and compromising U.S.       national security. As I will further explain, the conduct       described in Article I amounts to an abuse of power and shows       that President Trump remains an ongoing threat to the       national interest if allowed to remain in office.      A. Abuse of Power Is an Impeachable Offense 

       A cardinal American principle that emerged during the       drafting of the Constitution is that no one is above the law.       As discussed in the previous section, this principle was a       chief subject of debate at the Constitutional Convention. The       Framers understood that power corrupts and they would need to       build guardrails to protect the public good from a would-be       authoritarian. The Framers were reacting to the overreach of       King George III. 

       Yet, the President's Counsel argue that Impeachment is not       an appropriate remedy for abuse of power, arguing that the       Framers were not concerned about violations of the public       trust. The President's Counsel instead argue that the Framers       were primarily concerned about an Executive that would be       beholden to a heavy-handed legislature. Indeed, during the       debates at the Constitutional Convention, this fear was       raised by opponents of Impeachment. Rufus King, a delegate       from Massachusetts, said ``[impeachment by Congress] would be       destructive of his independence and of the principles of the       Constitution. He relied on the vigor of the Executive as a       great security for the public liberties.'' \44\ Clearly,       King's arguments did not carry the day. 

       In drafting the Constitution, the Framers had carefully       calibrated the powers between Congress and the Executive.       Ultimately, they decided that they could not leave the nation       without any recourse against a President who would be in a       unique and potent position to engage in any number of abusive       acts. Without a mechanism to keep an out-of-control President       in check, there was little binding him to the law. Hamilton       underscored the importance of the Impeachment process for       holding the President liable by drawing a contrast with the       British monarchy, for whom ``there is no constitutional       tribunal to which he is amenable.'' \45\ 

       George Mason, a delegate from Virginia, underscores abuse       of power as one of the key reasons for the need for       presidential Impeachment, asking ``Shall any man be above       Justice? Above all shall that man be above it, who can commit       the most extensive injustice?'' \46\ Edmund Randolph, another       delegate from Virginia, concurred, noting that ``[t]he       Executive will have great opportunitys of abusing his       power[,]'' and in such instances ``[g]uilt wherever found       ought to be punished.'' \47\ 

       The Framers debate on these matters was prescient, as       public officials have, in fact, been found to have committed       impeachable offenses including abuse of power. Most well-      known, President Nixon resigned after the House Judiciary       Committee (hereinafter known as ``Judiciary Committee'')       found he had abused his powers on multiple occasions.\48\       Three district judges were also impeached during the 20th       century for abusing their power. In impeaching these judges,       the House used ``abuse of power'' to describe misconduct       ranging from the unlawful use of contempt of court, to the       ordering of a jury to find a defendant guilty, to the       improper appointing of an associate to an official       position.\49\ 

       In stark contrast to the positions of the Framers, the       President's Counsel argue that a President who does something       to benefit himself in a reelection, if he thinks it is in the       nation's interest, has not committed an impeachable offense.       This is not a credible argument because under this view, the       President would have free reign to solicit foreign       interference, unlawfully withhold security assistance, use       his powers to target his political opponents and engage in a       whole host of corrupt conduct that might help him get       reelected. This rings all too familiar of President Nixon       when he said ``Well, when the president does it that means       that it is not illegal.'' \50\                     A.1. Definition of Abuse of Power  

       Black's Law Dictionary defines ``abuse of power'' as       including ``The misuse or improper exercise of one's       authority; esp., the exercise of a statutorily or otherwise       duly conferred authority in a way that is tortious, unlawful       or outside its proper scope.'' \51\ 

       In its Impeachment inquiry of President Richard Nixon, the       Judiciary Committee found the President repeatedly abused his       power while in office.\52\ Among its findings, the Judiciary       Committee determined that President Nixon unlawfully directed       or authorized federal agencies, including the Internal       Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to       investigate and surveil American citizens, and used the       resulting information for his own political purposes.\53\ The       Judiciary Committee further found that Nixon then interfered       with investigations into these and other actions to conceal       his misconduct, and stressed that Nixon's actions in all of       these instances ``served no valid national policy       objective.'' \54\ 

       The Judiciary Committee concluded that the ``conduct of       Richard M. Nixon has constituted a repeated and continuing       abuse of the powers of the presidency in disregard of the       fundamental principle of the rule of law in our system of       government. This abuse of the powers of the President was       carried out by Richard M. Nixon, acting personally and       through his subordinates, for his own political advantage,       not for any legitimate governmental purpose and without due       consideration for the national good.'' \55\ 

       In the current Impeachment of President Trump, the       Judiciary Committee has defined abuse of power as occurring       ``when a President exercises the powers of his office to       obtain an improper personal benefit while injuring and       ignoring the national interest.'' \56\ 

       From these sources, I have concluded that an abuse of power       by a sitting President has the following three elements: 

       1) The use of official governmental power; 

       2) For personal or some other corrupt purpose; 

       3) Without due consideration for the national interest. 

       President Trump's conduct in soliciting foreign       interference in the 2020 presidential election meets each of       these elements of the charge of abuse of power. Moreover, the       defenses put forth by the President's Counsel are       substantively deficient when viewed in the context of the       corrupt scheme conducted by President Trump through his       personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, starting in late 2018.      B. The Corrupt Scheme 

       President Trump engaged in a corrupt scheme to solicit       foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election to       tarnish his political rivals and bolster public perceptions       of the legitimacy of his 2016 electoral victory. The corrupt       scheme served to benefit the President in a personal,       political manner, and was contrary to the national interest.       President Trump repeatedly misused the powers of the       presidency to increase pressure on Ukraine to further the       corrupt scheme, including withholding a White House meeting       and U.S. military assistance that the Ukrainians desperately       need to counter Russia. This scheme continued even after a       whistleblower exposed the President's efforts and even       following the launch of the Impeachment inquiry by the House. 

       The scheme directed by the President comprised two separate       efforts--both aimed to damage his political rivals and       benefit his reelection prospects. The first effort was to get       the Ukrainian government to announce an investigation into       baseless accusations propagated by a Russian disinformation       campaign,\57\ that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election to       benefit President Trump's political rival, Hillary Clinton       (hereinafter referred to as the ``2016 campaign theory'').       The 2016 campaign theory comprised numerous unfounded       allegations including that Ukraine colluded with the       Democrats to influence the 2016 election and that the       cybersecurity company Crowdstrike, falsely alleged to be       owned by a Ukrainian oligarch, investigated the hack of the       Democratic National Committee (DNC) computer infrastructure,       and covered up evidence of Ukrainian culpability in the       cyber-attack by hiding the servers from the FBI inside       Ukraine.\58\ 

       President Trump's fixation on the 2016 campaign theory       appears to have been intended to change public perceptions of       President Trump's connection to Russia, in the wake of the       Intelligence Community assessment that Russia interfered in       the 2016 election to support then candidate Trump,\59\ and       the Special Counsel's mandate including to review ``any links       or coordination between the Russian government and       individuals associated with the Trump campaign.'' \60\ The       Special Counsel noted ``several [of President Trump's]       advisors recalled that the President . . . viewed stories       about his Russian connections, the Russian investigations and       the Intelligence Community assessment of Russian interference       as a threat to the legitimacy of his electoral victory.''       \61\ Further, in the spring of 2019, the Special Counsel       affirmed the assessments of the Intelligence Community and       concluded that while there was no direct conspiracy or       coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign, ``.       . . the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a       Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that       the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from       information stolen and released through Russian efforts . .       .'' \62\ In directing this effort of the scheme, the       President was attempting to rewrite history by having a       foreign power make statements to validate his allegations       that it was Ukraine colluding with the Democrats rather than       Russia interfering to benefit then candidate Trump and       exonerate himself of any wrongdoing or ties to Russia. 

       In addition, the 2016 campaign theory sought to implicate       the President's political rival in 2016, former Secretary of       State Hillary Clinton. As Deputy Assistant Secretary George       Kent testified, the President ``wanted nothing less than       President [Zelensky] to go to [a] microphone and say       investigations, Biden, and Clinton.'' He confirmed that       ``shorthand'' for Clinton ``was 2016.'' \63\ 

       The scheme also comprised a second effort to get the       Ukrainian government to announce an investigation into       unfounded corruption allegations against former Vice       President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden (hereinafter       referred to as ``Biden/Burisma theory''). The allegations       associated with this theory surround Vice President Biden's       successful pressuring of Ukrainian President Poroshenko to       remove Ukrainian Prosecutor General Victor Shokin in 2016,       who purportedly was investigating a Ukrainian energy company,       Burisma, on whose board Hunter Biden served.\64\ Vice       President Biden is a potential presidential challenger to       President Trump in the 2020 Presidential election and was       viewed as a frontrunner during the spring and summer of 2019       when President Trump directed such efforts to further the       scheme. The President needed to undercut Vice President       Biden as a candidate to enhance his chances of       reelection.\65\ 

       Successfully pressuring the Ukrainian government to       announce investigations into the 2016 campaign and Biden/      Burisma theories was likely to garner the President several       political benefits including help with his reelection       efforts. As the House Impeachment Managers state in their       trial memo: 

       Although these theories were groundless, President Trump       sought a public announcement by Ukraine of investigations       into them [2016/the Bidens] in order to help his 2020       reelection campaign. An announcement of a Ukrainian       investigation into one of his key political rivals would be       enormously valuable to President Trump in his efforts to win       reelection in 2020--just as the FBI's investigation into       Hillary Clinton's emails had helped him in 2016. And an       investigation suggesting that President Trump did not benefit       from Russian interference in the 2016 election would give him       a basis to assert--falsely--that he was the victim, rather       than the beneficiary, of foreign meddling in the last       election. Ukraine's announcement of that investigation would       bolster the perceived legitimacy of his Presidency and,       therefore, his political standing going into the 2020       race.\66\ 

       President Trump needed to obfuscate what was known and       proven about Russian involvement on his behalf in the 2016       election to bolster the credibility of claims of Ukrainian       Government involvement in the 2016 election and corruption       allegations against Vice President Biden ahead of the 2020       election. By soliciting investigations into the 2016 campaign       and Biden/Burisma theories, he sought to accomplish both of       those goals. 

       Throughout this scheme, which began in late 2018, President       Trump employed Mr. Giuliani as his principal agent,\67\ and       enlisted several U.S. government officials to assist with       efforts to compel Ukrainian officials to launch       investigations into these baseless theories. 

       Mr. Giuliani involved associates in this scheme, including       Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, both of whom have been indicted       in the Southern District of New York for conspiracy to       violate election laws.\68\ Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman       leveraged their Ukrainian connections to facilitate contacts       between Mr. Giuliani and then Ukrainian Prosecutor General       Yuriy Lutsenko and his predecessor Victor Shokin to advance       the scheme. Both Mr. Lutsenko\69\ and Mr. Shokin\70\ were       removed from their positions under a cloud of corruption. 

       The corrupt Ukrainian Prosecutors General Lutsenko and       Shokin were among Mr. Giuliani's sources for the unfounded       allegations in support of the 2016 campaign and Biden/Burisma       theories. During a January 2019 call via Skype,\71\ Mr.       Shokin asserted he had overseen the investigation into       Burisma.\72\ Mr. Shokin alleged that Vice President Biden       forced his resignation to stop further investigation into       Burisma and cover up wrongdoing.\73\ He made additional       allegations including that he had wanted to come to the       United States to share information regarding corruption at       the Embassy, and that U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie       Yovanovitch denied him a U.S. visa because she was close to       Vice President Biden.\74\ Mr. Shokin later provided an       affidavit espousing allegations against Vice President Biden,       which explicitly stated that his sworn statement was made at       the behest of a pro-Putin Ukrainian oligarch.\75\ 

       Also, in January 2019, Mr. Giuliani met in New York with       Yuriy Lutsenko, who was then the Ukrainian Prosecutor       General. During these initial conversations with Mr.       Giuliani, Mr. Lutsenko made multiple allegations that       Ukrainian government officials interfered in the 2016       election to help Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He       also made allegations about corrupt practices at Burisma and       raised the possibility that there could have been improper       payments to Hunter Biden. In addition, Mr. Lutsenko made       false allegations against U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie       Yovanovitch.'' \76\ 

       Using these unfounded allegations, Mr. Giuliani launched a       disinformation campaign on traditional and social media. In       the spring of 2019, Mr. Giuliani and his associates worked       with columnist John Solomon, who wrote a series of articles       in The Hill, amplifying the false allegations of Mr. Lutsenko       and Mr. Shokin.\77\ Through these columns and a related       interview, Mr. Lutsenko announced he was opening       investigations into aspects of both the 2016 campaign and       Biden/Burisma theories.\78\ The President,\79\ his son Donald       Trump Jr.,\80\ and Mr. Giuliani \81\ amplified the false       allegations by retweeting the articles. President Trump \82\       and Mr. Giuliani \83\ also repeated the false allegations       contained in The Hill articles during press interviews. 

       In furtherance of the corrupt scheme, President Trump       directed the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch. As laid out       in the Statement of Material Facts by the House Impeachment       Managers, ``the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch was the       culmination of a months-long smear campaign waged by the       President's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and other allies       of the President. The President also helped amplify the smear       campaign.'' \84\ Ambassador Yovanovitch testified she was       told her removal from post was not for cause.\85\ Mr.       Giuliani later admitted he ``believed that [he] needed       Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way'' because ``[s]he was       going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.''       \86\ Documents obtained by the House Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence further confirm that the       Ambassador's firing was part of the effort to further the       corrupt scheme. A text message from Ukrainian Prosecutor       General Lutsenko warned Giuliani associate Lev Parnas that if       they didn't fire Ambassador Yovanovitch, ``you are bringing       into question all my allegations including about ``B.'' \87\       Mr. Parnas confirmed in a press interview that the ``B''       referred to Hunter Biden.\88\ 

       As previously discussed, both the 2016 campaign and Biden/      Burisma theories are unfounded. The 2016 campaign theory is       an active Russian disinformation campaign.\89\ On December 9,       2019, FBI Director Christopher Wray stated, ``We have no       information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the       2016 presidential election.'' \90\ 

       Further, the President's own national security officials       have rejected the claim that the Ukrainian government       systematically interfered in the 2016 election, including       refuting the theory that Ukraine was behind the hack of the       DNC servers.\91\ Trump Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert       stressed, ``[t]he DNC server and that conspiracy theory has       got to go, they have to stop with that, it cannot continue to       be repeated . . . in our discourse.'' \92\ 

       With regards to the Biden/Burisma theory, no proof of any       wrongdoing has been made to support this claim.\93\ No       evidence has been presented showing Vice President Biden       specifically discussed Burisma with then President Poroshenko       in relation to the removal of the corrupt Prosecutor General.       Furthermore, U.S. diplomats, such as Former Special Envoy to       Ukraine Ambassador Kurt Volker defended Vice President       Biden's actions. In his closed interview with the House       Committees, Volker stated, ``There is clear evidence that       Vice President Biden did indeed weigh in with the President       of Ukraine to have Shokin fired but the motivations for that       are entirely different from those contained in that       allegation.'' \94\ Vice President Biden, acting as the point       person for Ukraine policy in the Obama Administration, was       representing the interests of the United States and the       international community,\95\ promoting increased       transparency, corruption reform, and the rule of law.\96\       Vice President Biden's public statements from the time       reflect such efforts, focusing on combatting corruption and       institutional reform rather than specific companies, such as       Burisma.\97\ 

       The President's Counsel made misleading assertions that       U.S. Government officials warned the Vice President of the       appearance of wrongdoing in an attempt to convince him to       take corrective action. One person they cited was Amos       Hochstein, a diplomat who served in the Obama       Administration.\98\ Mr. Hochstein did raise the matter with       the Vice President but did not recommend that Hunter Biden       resign from the board of Burisma.\99\ 

       By mid-May 2019, Mr. Lutsenko publicly recanted previous       allegations he made to Mr. Giuliani, including admitting that       he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Vice President Biden or       Hunter Biden.\100\ Ambassador Volker explained Mr. Lutsenko's       motivations for making these baseless accusations, ``My       opinion of Prosecutor General Lutsenko was that he was acting       in a self-serving manner, frankly making things up, in order       to appear important to the United States, because he wanted       to save his job.'' \101\ 

       At no point during the trial did the President's Counsel       dispute the facts surrounding the scheme. The record is clear       that the President directed the corrupt scheme to solicit       investigations into the 2016 campaign and Biden/Burisma       theories for his personal political gain.      C. President Trump's Misuse of his Office to Advance the           Corrupt Scheme 

       President Trump used the powers of his office to advance       the corrupt scheme through multiple efforts, violating the       public trust and placing his own personal political interests       above the interests of the nation. In doing so, the President       abused the power of his office.      C.1. President Trump Solicited Ukrainian President Zelensky           to Open Investigations into the 2016 Campaign and Biden/          Burisma Theories 

       President Trump abused the powers of his office in order to       advance the corrupt scheme by attempting to leverage the       Ukrainian desire for an Oval Office meeting and U.S. security       assistance as a quid pro quo for Ukrainian investigations       into his political opponents that would benefit his       reelection in 2020. Starting in May 2019, President Trump       directed a sustained campaign to solicit newly-elected       Ukrainian President Zelensky to undertake investigations into       the 2016 campaign and Biden/Burisma theories.      C.1.a. President Trump conditioned an Oval Office meeting on           investigations into the 2016 campaign and Biden/Burisma           theories 

       President Trump's misuse of his official powers, with       regard to this matter, began shortly after Volodymyr Zelensky       won the Ukrainian presidential election on April 21, 2019. In       early May, Mr. Giuliani announced that he planned to travel       to Ukraine to meet with President-elect Zelensky ``to urge       him to pursue inquiries'' into ``the origin of the Special       Counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the       2016 election'' and Hunter Biden's ``involvement'' in       Burisma.\102\ Mr. Giuliani admitted that he was not       conducting ``foreign policy'' but rather ``meddling in an       investigation,'' \103\ and that President Trump was aware of       his activities.\104\ 

       In trying to arrange a meeting with President Zelensky, Mr.       Giuliani was acting in a private capacity, not as a public       official or to advance official U.S. policy. On May 10, 2019,       Mr. Giuliani wrote to then President-Elect Zelensky, to       request a meeting in his capacity as ``personal counsel to       President Trump and with his knowledge and consent.'' \105\       Mr. Giuliani made clear in the letter he was representing       Donald Trump as a private citizen, not as President of the       United States. While the letter did not state the purpose of       the requested meeting, Mr. Giuliani stated publicly on the       same day that he intended to tell President Zelensky to       pursue investigations into the 2016 campaign and Biden/      Burisma theories.\106\ Then on May 11th, Mr. Giuliani       abruptly cancelled his trip to Ukraine, declaring that       President-Elect Zelensky had surrounded himself with       ``enemies of the President'' (referring to President       Trump).\107\ 

       President Trump intertwined Mr. Giuliani's private mission       and the activities of public officials when he directed U.S.       officials to aid his personal attorney in advancing this       scheme. At a May 23rd meeting in the Oval Office, President       Trump was briefed by Ambassador Paul Volker, Ambassador       Gordon Sondland, and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, who       would subsequently describe themselves as the ``Three       Amigos,'' (hereinafter referred to as the ``Three Amigos'')       on their recent trip to attend the inauguration of President       Zelensky.\108\ Witness testimony indicates that despite their       positive assessments about President Zelensky, President       Trump was unconvinced, and replied that the Ukrainians tried       to ``take me down'' in 2016, referring to the debunked 2016       campaign theory.\109\ The President resisted the       recommendation of the Three Amigos to invite President       Zelensky to the White House, and instead repeatedly directed       these three officials to ``talk to Rudy.'' \110\ Ambassador       Sondland testified that he understood this to refer to Mr.       Giuliani and that ``if we did not talk to Rudy, nothing would       move forward on Ukraine.'' \111\ Ambassador Sondland further       explained that they chose to follow the President's direction       to communicate with Mr. Giuliani, not because they liked it,       but because ``it was the only constructive path open to us.''       \112\ 

       The Three Amigos frequently operated outside regular       diplomatic channels between the United States and Ukraine,       but their activities were not a secret to the President's       national security officials. Ambassador Bill Taylor, Charge       d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, described in his       testimony how, while he operated in the regular channel of       U.S. policymaking regarding Ukraine, beginning on May 23rd       there emerged ``an irregular, informal channel,'' consisting       of Special Envoy Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary       Perry, and Mr. Giuliani.\113\ As Ambassador Sondland       testified, ``everyone was in the loop,'' \114\ further       clarifying that President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, Mr.       Giuliani, and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney were       kept informed of the activities undertaken by the Three       Amigos. Fiona Hill, National Security Council Director for       European and Russian Affairs, concluded that Ambassador       Sondland was correct that he was keeping the relevant       officials informed of his activities because he was       ``involved in a domestic political errand'' while she and       other government officials were conducting U.S. national       security foreign policy, and ``those two things had just       diverged.'' \115\ 

       The purpose of these two channels diverged as well: while       the career diplomats were engaged in promoting U.S. national       security       interests in supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian       aggression, the irregular channel was engaged in pursuing a       quid pro quo to secure Ukrainian investigations into the 2016       campaign and the Biden/Burisma theories for the benefit of       the President's 2020 reelection. At the direction of the       President, as conveyed through Mr. Giuliani and Acting White       House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, the Three Amigos pursued       a quid pro quo--the offer of a politically valuable Oval       Office meeting with President Trump in exchange for President       Zelensky announcing the desired investigations. Ambassador       Sondland testified ``Mr. Giuliani's requests were a quid pro       quo for arranging a White House visit for President       Zelensky.'' \116\ 

       The evidence shows that by early July, the message was       conveyed to Ukrainian officials that investigations were a       prerequisite for their desired White House meeting.       Ambassador Volker testified that when the Oval Office meeting       was not scheduled by late June, he ``came to believe that the       President's long-held negative view toward Ukraine was       causing hesitation in actually scheduling the meeting.''       \117\ At a bilateral meeting in Toronto in early July,       Ambassador Volker testified that he told alerted President       Zelensky that he couldn't get a date scheduled for the White       House meeting. Ambassador Volker relayed to President       Zelensky, ``I think we have a problem here, and that problem       being the negative feed of information from Mr. Giuliani.''       \118\ Ambassador Volker further testified that during the       Toronto meeting, he specifically mentioned investigations       into ``2016'' election and ``Burisma'' with President       Zelensky.\119\ Soon after this warning, President Zelensky's       close aide Andriy Yermak asked to be connected with Mr.       Giuliani.\120\ 

       The President's conditions for securing a White House       meeting were communicated an additional time, during a July       10, 2019, bilateral meeting led by then National Security       Adviser John Bolton and then Ukrainian National Security       Adviser Oleksandr Danylyuk. During the meeting, the Ukrainian       delegation raised their desire to have a White House       meeting.\121\ NSC official Hill testified that Ambassador       Sondland, who was in attendance at the meeting, responded to       the Ukrainian request by stating, ``We have an agreement that       there will be a meeting, if specific investigations are put       under way.'' \122\ NSC official Lt. Col. Vindman testified       that during that afternoon's meetings with the Ukrainian       delegation, Ambassador Sondland ``emphasized the importance       of Ukraine delivering the investigations into 2016 elections,       the Bidens and Burisma.'' \123\ Later, Ambassador Sondland       told Dr. Hill that there was agreement with Mr. Mulvaney that       there would be a White House meeting with President Zelensky       ``in return for investigations.'' \124\ According to Dr.       Hill, Ambassador Bolton was so alarmed that he told her to       inform the lawyers about what happened in the meeting, adding       that he was not be part of ``whatever drug deal that Mulvaney       and Sondland are cooking up.'' \125\            C.1.b. President Trump withheld military assistance  

       President Trump also used the powers of his office to       order, through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the       withholding of congressionally appropriated security       assistance to Ukraine. The evidence shows that the President       fixated on a June 19, 2019 article in the Washington Examiner       announcing the release of Ukraine security assistance as an       additional leverage point to further the corrupt scheme.\126\       By no later than July 12, 2019,\127\ President Trump ordered       a hold on $391 million in security assistance for Ukraine,       consisting of $250 million in Department of Defense Ukraine       Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) funding and $141       million in State Department Foreign Military Financing (FMF).       At an interagency meeting on July 18, 2019, a week before the       Trump-Zelensky phone call, OMB officials instructed relevant       U.S. government departments and agencies to withhold       obligation of the Ukraine security assistance at the       direction of the President.\128\ According to multiple       witnesses, OMB did not provide a reason for the President's       hold on the Ukraine aid.\129\ OMB maintained this hold on       Ukraine security assistance through September 11th, when OMB       lifted the hold, again without providing a rationale for the       change of course.\130\ 

       The President's Counsel claim that the President's hold on       security assistance was because of a policy difference, but       that claim is not supported by the evidence. The manner in       which the White House placed the hold on security assistance       for Ukraine differed significantly from the process in which       holds of assistance to other countries based on policy       considerations had previously occurred. As the House       Impeachment Managers stated, ``What the President did is not       the same as routine withholding of foreign aid to ensure that       it aligns with the President's policy priorities or to adjust       with geopolitical developments.'' \131\ The President began       asking about the hold based on the announcement of the       release of funds, after the Department of Defense had       certified that the Ukrainian government made progress on       corruption reform, showing that the hold was not placed due       to policy considerations. Further, no geopolitical       circumstances had changed in that timeframe to warrant the       placing of a hold on security assistance funds to Ukraine. 

       In addition, despite substantial evidence that U.S.       government officials were deeply concerned about conflicts       with the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), there was no       notification of the delay to Congress as required by this       law, belying the idea that the President harbored legitimate       concerns about policy.\132\ Congress has an established       bipartisan record of robust support for Ukraine. Since 2014,       the United States has provided more than $3.5 billion in       foreign assistance to Ukraine: $1.96 billion in military and       other security assistance and $1.6 billion in political aid       to Ukraine, all illustrating a policy that support to Ukraine       furthers U.S. national security interests.\133\ Interagency       conversations while the hold was in place reflected concerns       that withholding the funds would in fact violate the       ICA,\134\ yet there were no plans to notify Congress or       rescind the funds as required by under the ICA. Further, when       OMB official Mike Duffey directed Acting DOD Comptroller       Elaine McCusker to formally hold the assistance for Ukraine,       he added, ``Given the sensitive nature of the request, I       appreciate your keeping that information closely held to       those who need to know to execute the direction.'' \135\ The       secrecy maintained by Administration officials regarding the       hold on this security assistance differs significantly from       past practice and supports the inference that they were aware       that the hold was contrary to U.S. policy and that they had       no legitimate policy justification for a change in       U.S. policy. 

       In withholding the security assistance for Ukraine, the       President violated his duty to faithfully execute the laws.       Congress enacted the ICA in 1974 as one of many responses to       the abuses of President Nixon in order to require the       President to obligate funds appropriated by Congress, unless       Congress otherwise authorizes the withholding.\136\ The ICA       provides the President with narrowly circumscribed authority       to withhold, or ``impound,'' appropriated funds only in       limited, specified circumstances, and included a requirement       to inform Congress. At no point did the Trump Administration       either assert that it was impounding the Ukraine security       assistance or inform Congress of any deferral or rescission       of funds. In reviewing the OMB's withholding of funds       appropriated to the Department of Defense for Ukraine       security assistance, the Government Accountability Office       concluded that OMB violated the ICA.\137\  C.1.c. President Trump conditioned a White House meeting and Ukrainian                   security assistance on investigations  

       The House Impeachment Managers' record demonstrates       overwhelmingly that President Trump conditioned both a White       House meeting and nearly $400 million in U.S. security       assistance for Ukraine on a commitment by President Zelensky       to conduct investigations for the personal political benefit       of Donald Trump. The President's scheme to secure corrupt       investigations to benefit his reelection efforts converged       with his official duties during a July 25, 2019, phone call       with President Zelensky. The President's actions during that       phone call, understood in the context of the broader corrupt       scheme, are compelling evidence that the President solicited       foreign interference in U.S. elections. 

       The President's own words during the July 25th call, as       summarized in a memorandum of telephone conversation released       by the White House, demonstrate the President's demand for a       quid pro quo.\138\ Far from showing the ``perfect call'' that       President Trump claims,\139\ the memorandum of the telephone       conversation makes clear that the President solicited       politically-motivated investigations from President Zelensky       in exchange for a White House meeting and U.S. military aid.       When the Ukrainian President indicated he would be seeking       additional U.S. military arms that Ukraine desperately needed       for its conflict with Russia, President Trump responded by       requesting that President Zelensky do him ``a favor though.''       \140\ The memorandum of the telephone conversation makes       clear that the favor President Trump sought as a condition       for future military aid was the two investigations into the       2016 campaign and the Biden/Burisma theories. President Trump       went on to espouse many of the allegations associated with       the debunked 2016 campaign theory, including ``Crowdstrike,''       and ``one of your wealthy people,'' falsely insinuating that       a Ukrainian oligarch owned the cybersecurity firm that       investigated the DNC hack.\141\ He then alleged that Ukraine       has the server and added, ``. . . They say a lot of it       started in Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important       that you do it. . .'' \142\ Later in the phone call,       President Trump mentioned ``the other thing'' he wanted       investigated, declaring that there was ``a lot of talk       about'' Vice President ``Biden's son,'' and that Vice       President ``Biden stopped the prosecution.'' \143\ President       Trump told President Zelensky, ``A lot of people want to find       out about that, so whatever you can do with the Attorney       General would be great.'' \144\ In addition, it must be noted       President Trump specifically urged President Zelensky to call       Mr. Giuliani, as well as Attorney General Barr,\145\       regarding investigations into the 2016 campaign and Biden/      Burisma theories.\146\ Given all of the steps taken by Mr.       Giuliani leading up to the call, including his letter to       President Zelensky and public statements urging President       Zelensky to undertake investigations into the 2016 campaign       and Biden/Burisma theories, it is clear that President Trump       was signaling that he wanted these investigations. 

       The President's Counsel disputed the notion that there was       a quid pro quo by claiming that President Zelensky was not       aware       of an arrangement and he felt no pressure during the July       25th phone call. However, evidence shows that the President's       surrogates prepped President Zelensky ahead of the call to       say that he would conduct investigations into the 2016       campaign and Biden/Burisma theories in order to get a White       House meeting. Ambassadors Volker and Sondland had multiple       exchanges with President Zelensky and his aide Mr. Yermak       ahead of the call. Ambassador Volker, after having breakfast       with Mr. Giuliani, told Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador       Sondland via text, ``Most important is for Zelensky to say       that he will help with investigation.'' \147\ That same day,       Ambassador Sondland directed President Zelensky to tell       President Trump, he would ``run a fully transparent       investigation and turn over every stone,'' \148\ which he       indicated in testimony referred to the ``Burisma and the       2016'' investigations.\149\ The morning of the July 25th       call, Ambassador Sondland spoke to President Trump and then       alerted Ambassador Volker to contact him.\150\ Approximately       a half hour later, Ambassador Volker texted Zelensky aide Mr.       Yermak, ``Heard from White House--assuming President       Z[elensky] convinces Trump he will investigate/ `get to the       bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down a date       for a visit in Washington.'' \151\ 

       The memorandum of the telephone conversation shows that       President Zelensky understood the messages that he was told       to convey during the call and followed those instructions.       During the call, President Zelensky said to President Trump,       ``I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the       United States, specifically Washington D.C. On the other       hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious       about the case and will work on the investigation.'' \152\       Lt. Col. Vindman testified that aspects of the call,       including President Zelensky bringing up Burisma, suggested       that he was ``prepped'' for this call.\153\ President       Zelensky knew what ``favor'' President Trump was asking for       as a condition for receiving the White House meeting.  C.1.d. The actions of Administration officials following the July 25th  phone call demonstrate that the President conditioned U.S. military aid  to Ukraine and the White House meeting on President Zelensky announcing  

  the investigations into the 2016 campaign and Biden/Burisma theories  

       The President's Counsel allege that there is no evidence       that the President conditioned U.S. military aid for Ukraine       or the White House meeting on a commitment by President       Zelensky to announce investigations into the 2016 campaign       and Biden/Burisma theories. The President's Counsel assert       that any claims that President Trump made any such linkage,       particularly relating to the military assistance, are       unsupported and based on second or third-hand sources and       speculation. They claim that no one with first-hand knowledge       of the President's thinking came forward and testified that       he conditioned the delivery of these official acts for       Ukraine on the investigations. These claims are both       disingenuous and wrong.\154\ 

       Furthermore, the actions of Administration officials after       the July 25th phone call make clear President Trump's request       was a quid pro quo. Approximately 90 minutes after the       call, OMB official Mike Duffey directed Acting DoD       Comptroller McCusker to formally hold the Department of       Defense security assistance for Ukraine.\155\ 

       In addition, conversations on July 26, 2019, detail that       President Trump appeared solely focused on whether efforts to       pressure President Zelensky to initiate the investigations       had been successful. On July 26th, the day after the phone       call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, Ambassador       Sondland called President Trump from Kyiv. According to       testimony from David Holmes, Counselor for Political Affairs       at the U.S. Embassy who overheard the phone call, President       Trump asked Ambassador Sondland, ``So he's going to do the       investigation?'' referring to the 2016 campaign and Burisma/      Biden theories.\156\ Holmes also testified that he asked       Ambassador Sondland that same day if President Trump cared       about Ukraine. Sondland responded that President ``Trump only       cared about `big stuff' that benefits the President, like the       `Biden investigation' that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.'' \157\ 

       Most telling, President Trump's Acting Chief of Staff Mick       Mulvaney publicly admitted at a press conference on October       17th that withholding the security assistance for Ukraine       provided leverage to convince Ukraine to investigate the       source of the hack of the DNC servers in 2016, an aspect of       the 2016 campaign theory.\158\ Mr. Mulvaney confirmed that       President Trump ``[a]bsolutely'' raised ``corruption related       to the DNC server'' and added that was part of ``why we held       up the money.'' \159\ When a reporter pointed out that he had       just described a quid pro quo, Mr. Mulvaney stated, ``We do       that all the time with foreign policy'' and told everyone to       ``Get over it. There's going to be political influence in       foreign policy.'' \160\ 

       Despite the assertions of the President's counsel, evidence       indicates that the Zelensky Administration knew that there       was a problem with the security assistance well before the       hold was reported publicly on August 28, 2019.\161\ The same       afternoon of the July 25th phone call, Department of Defense       officials learned that diplomats at the Ukrainian Embassy in       Washington had made multiple overtures to the Pentagon and       the State Department ``asking about security assistance.''       \162\ Separately, during that same time frame, two different       officials at the Ukrainian Embassy contacted Ambassador       Volker's special assistant, Catherine Croft, to ask her in       confidence about the hold.\163\ In early August 2019, the       Ukrainians reportedly made further inquiries about the       security assistance funds.\164\ The message sent back was       that the holdup was not bureaucratic in nature, and that to       address it they were advised to reach out to Mick       Mulvaney.\165\ NSC official Lt. Col. Vindman testified that       by mid-August 2019, he had also received inquiries about the       hold on the security assistance from an official at the       Ukrainian Embassy.\166\ 

       Evidence and reporting regarding the President's       interactions with then National Security Adviser John Bolton       further confirms that the President held security assistance       in order to further the corrupt scheme. On August 16, 2019,       Ambassador Bolton reportedly made a personal appeal to       President Trump to release the security assistance for       Ukraine and was ``rebuffed.'' \167\ NSC official Tim Morrison       affirmed this account in his testimony. Mr. Morrison       testified that Ambassador Bolton said President Trump,       ``wasn't ready'' to release the aid.\168\ According to news       reports that emerged during the Impeachment trial, an account       from Ambassador Bolton's forthcoming book reportedly makes       this link even more explicit. 

       Ambassador Bolton stated during the August meeting,       President Trump ``appeared focused on the theories Mr.       Giuliani had shared with him, replying to Mr. Bolton's       question that he preferred sending no assistance to Ukraine       until officials turned over all materials they had about the       Russia investigation that related to Mr. Biden and supporters       of Mrs. Clinton in Ukraine.'' \169\ 

       The record also shows that after the July 25th Trump-      Zelensky phone call, President Trump directed a campaign to       increase the pressure in furtherance of the scheme. Starting       in early August, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, in       coordination with Mr. Giuliani, attempted to get President       Zelensky to publicly announce investigations into the 2016       campaign and Biden/Burisma theories.\170\ Ambassadors Volker       and Sondland worked in conjunction with President Zelensky's       aide Mr. Yermak to generate an acceptable statement.\171\       After the initial Ukrainian draft of the statement contained       only a general commitment from President Zelensky to fight       corruption, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland consulted Mr.       Giuliani who responded that if the statement ``doesn't say       Burisma and 2016, it's not credible.'' \172\ Ambassador       Volker then revised President Zelensky's draft statement to       include specific references to ``Burisma'' and ``the 2016       U.S. elections.'' \173\ No statement was ever released by       President Zelensky, and Ambassador Volker testified that it       was because the Ukrainians realized that making such a       statement was tantamount to a quid pro quo.\174\ 

       Furthermore, witness testimony shows that as the hold on       the security assistance continued through the late summer,       U.S. government officials realized the connection between the       hold and the President's desire for Ukrainian announcements       of investigations into President Trump's political rivals. By       early September, Ambassador Taylor said his ``clear       understanding'' was that President Trump would withhold       security assistance until President Zelensky ``committed to       pursue the investigations.'' \175\ Ambassador Taylor further       testified that his contemporaneous notes reflect that       President Trump wanted President Zelensky ``in a box by       making [a] public statement about ordering such       investigations.'' \176\ Ambassador Sondland explained to       Ambassador Taylor that ``everything'' (the Oval Office       meeting and security assistance) ``was dependent on the       Ukrainian government announcing the political       investigations.'' \177\ Ambassador Taylor responded to       Ambassador Sondland that he thought it was ``crazy to       withhold security assistance for help with a political       campaign.'' \178\ Foreign Service Officer David Holmes       testified that his ``clear impression'' around the same time       was that ``the security assistance hold was likely intended       by the President either to express dissatisfaction with the       Ukrainians who had not yet agreed to the Burisma/Biden       investigations, or as an effort to increase the pressure on       them to do so.'' \179\ 

       Once the hold on the security assistance was reported in       the press in late August 2019, the conditions for releasing       the assistance were soon overtly communicated to President       Zelensky. President Trump's surrogates informed President       Zelensky and his aides that the security assistance was held       up as a result of President Zelensky's unwillingness to       announce the investigations into President Trump's political       rivals. These directions came from the President.\180\       Ambassador Sondland testified that he had passed a message       directly to President Zelensky's aide Mr. Yermak on September       1, 2019, that, ``I believed that the resumption of U.S. aid       would not likely occur until Ukraine took some kind of action       on the public statement that we had been discussing for       weeks.'' \181\ Affirming this account, Ambassador Taylor       testified that Ambassador Sondland told him he had warned       President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak that, ``although this was       not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear       things up in public, we would be at a stalemate.'' \182\       President Zelensky apparently understood the message       because arrangements were made for the Ukrainian President       to go on CNN to announce the investigations.\183\ 

       The President's Counsel argue that there could not have       been a quid pro quo because       the Ukrainians ultimately got the funding without making the       commitment to conduct the investigations. Essentially, they       argue ``no harm, no foul.'' However, the President's       solicitation of the politically-motivated investigations in       exchange for official acts is in and of itself an abuse of       his office and the public trust. Further, President Trump       released the hold on the security assistance only after a       whistleblower's complaint had been provided to Congress and       three House committees had initiated an investigation into       the hold. On August 12, 2019, a whistleblower filed a       complaint with the Intelligence Community's Inspector       General, which stated multiple U.S. government officials had       told him or her information indicating that the ``President       of the United States is using the power of his office to       solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S.       election.'' \184\ The complaint cited the July 25th call       between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, the placing of the       call on a codeword server, and other circumstances       surrounding the call including the role of Mr. Giuliani.\185\       The President was reportedly briefed by White House Counsel       on the existence of a whistleblower complaint in late       August.\186\ On September 9, 2019, the whistleblower       complaint was referred to Congress.\187\ On the same day, the       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the House       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and the House       Committee on Foreign Affairs opened an inquiry into the       circumstances surrounding the hold.\188\ The President       subsequently lifted the hold on September 11, 2019.\189\ 

       Moreover, the corrupt scheme did not end even after the       House Committees began the Impeachment Inquiry. Mr. Giuliani,       at the direction of the President, has continued to travel to       Ukraine to generate compromising material on President       Trump's political opponents,\190\ raising the possibility of       future attempts by President Trump to pressure foreign       leaders to interfere in the 2020 election. 

       Consistent with the first element delineated for abuse of       power, the evidence clearly shows that President Trump       misused his office to advance a corrupt scheme. 

       The fact that President Trump's actions involve the misuse       of the office of the presidency distinguishes the current       proceedings from the circumstances in the 1999 Clinton       Impeachment trial. Based on the historical record, the       constitutional standard I applied in the Clinton proceedings       was that ``private wrongdoing, without a significant adverse       effect upon the nation, cannot constitute an impeachable       offense.'' \191\ On that basis, I concluded that ``Citizens       may well lack confidence in the ability of President Clinton       to be honest about his personal life, this is not however a       threat to our government.'' \192\ The circumstances regarding       President Trump can be distinguished both on the grounds that       his actions involved the misuse of his public office, not       private wrongdoing, and because the nature of President       Trump's abuse of power is an ongoing threat to our systems of       government and our constitutional order.   D. The President's Solicitation of Investigations by Ukraine into the  2016 Campaign and Biden/Burisma Theories Was for his Personal or Other                              Corrupt Purpose  

       The second element of the offense of abuse of power, as       previously delineated, is the use of official governmental       power for personal or some other corrupt purpose. The       President's Counsel have argued that the President had       legitimate policy reasons for withholding the Ukraine       security assistance or the White House meeting. Specifically,       the President's Counsel asserted that President Trump had       longstanding concerns about corruption and burden-sharing by       European allies in support of Ukraine. Upon careful review of       the record, these assertions simply do not square with the       facts. While there is some basis for the assertion that       President Trump cared about these issues, they were not the       basis for the withholding of Ukraine security assistance. 

       Evidence shows that President Trump's solicitation alarmed       Administration officials who listened in to the July 25th       call, and their concerns did not stem from policy       differences. NSC official Lt. Col. Vindman testified that he       was ``concerned'' about the call and ``did not think it was       proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S.       citizen.'' \193\ Vice Presidential aide Jennifer Williams,       who also listened to the July 25th call, testified she found       it, ``unusual because, in contrast to other Presidential       calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared       to be a domestic political matter.'' \194\ Ms. Williams was       informed of the security assistance hold on July 3rd and       stated that the call ``shed some light on possible other       motivations behind a security assistance hold.'' \195\ Lt.       Col. Vindman and NSC official Tim Morrison were sufficiently       concerned that they separately reported the contents of the       call to NSC lawyers, Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Ellis.\196\ The       President's lawyers, in turn, took steps to restrict access       to the rough transcript of the call by placing it on a       highly-restricted classified server.\197\ 

       Furthermore, the President's Counsel's claim that security       assistance for Ukraine was withheld over concerns about       corruption is unfounded. On May 23, 2019, the Department of       Defense certified to Congress that Ukraine had made progress       on defense reform and anti-corruption measures. Congress       required this certification under the National Defense       Authorization Act in order to allow USAI funding to be       provided beyond the first 50 percent of amounts authorized       and appropriated for Ukraine military aid.\198\ Furthermore,       support for providing security assistance to Ukraine was       unanimous among relevant agencies of the United States       government. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura       Cooper testified that there was a consensus within the       interagency that corruption was not a legitimate reason for       the hold.\199\ Ambassador Taylor affirmed Ms. Cooper's       recollection that no agencies raised policy-related concerns       as reason for the hold on security assistance testifying,       ``At every meeting, the unanimous conclusion was that the       security assistance should be reassumed, the hold lifted. At       one point the Defense Department was asked to perform an       analysis of the effectiveness of the assistance. Within a       day, the Defense Department came back with the determination       that the assistance was effective and should be resumed.''       \200\ 

       Nor does the evidence support the claim that President       Trump, himself, had concerns about institutional corruption       that would lead him to withhold military assistance for       Ukraine. There is no evidence that President Trump in his       interactions with his Ukrainian counterpart, raised concerns       about corruption. Indeed, corruption was not raised by       President Trump during the two calls he had with President       Zelensky,\201\ despite that issue being included in his       talking points prepared by NSC staff for both calls.\202\       Further evidence that President Trump was not interested       in institutional corruption in Ukraine came from Mr.       Morrison, who listened to the July 25th call, and       testified that President Trump did not make a ``full-      throated endorsement of the Ukraine reform agenda that I       was hoping to hear.'' \203\ 

       Further, communications by U.S. diplomats to President       Zelensky or other Ukrainian officials do not indicate that       President Trump held Ukrainian security assistance due to       concern about corruption in Ukraine. As discussed earlier,       Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Sondland had multiple       contacts with President Zelensky and his close aide Mr.       Yermak ahead of the July 25th call. No evidence shows that       President Zelensky was advised to outline steps he was taking       to address corruption on the call.\204\ Similarly, previously       discussed diplomatic efforts in August focused on securing a       public commitment by President Zelensky to investigate the       2016 campaign and Biden/Burisma theories specifically, and a       commitment to pursue corruption generally was deemed       insufficient to meet President Trump's request.\205\ 

       The evidence also does not indicate that President Trump       used official auspices to undertake a corruption       investigation in furtherance of official U.S. government       policy. If the President was interested in pursuing a       particular corruption investigation with the Government of       Ukraine, he could have done so through established diplomatic       channels. The President could have directed his Attorney       General to make an official request of Ukraine to initiate       investigations into corruption under the existing Mutual       Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with Ukraine.\206\ In this       instance, President Trump did not take such action. Rather,       in the July 25th call, President Trump asked President       Zelensky to work with both his personal attorney, Mr.       Giuliani, and Attorney General Barr to pursue investigations       into his political rivals.\207\ Further, supporting the idea       that the President did not ask for any official       investigations, the DOJ has denied knowledge of any such       investigations, declaring that ``the President has not asked       the Attorney General to contact Ukraine--on this [the July       25th call] or any other matter.'' \208\ Additionally, Mr.       Yermak asked Ambassador Volker to make any official request       for investigations through formal channels,\209\ but there is       no evidence that the DOJ or officials at the US Embassy Kyiv       followed up on that suggestion.\210\ That the President did       not go through regular inter-governmental channels supports       the conclusion that his interest in Ukrainian investigations       was for his personal political benefit and not legitimate       policy considerations. 

       In addition, there is no evidence to support the claim that       President Trump withheld Ukrainian military assistance out of       concerns about European burden sharing. While President Trump       may be skeptical about European contributions to mutual       defense, European nations contribute significantly more       foreign aid overall to Ukraine than the United States. The EU       is the single largest contributor of foreign assistance to       Ukraine, having provided =15 billion since 2014 versus $1.96       billion in security assistance that the United States has       provided over that same time period.\211\ 

       The rationale that the President withheld security       assistance because he was concerned with Europe paying more       to support Ukraine was not raised until well after the hold       was placed on U.S. security assistance for Ukraine. Witness       testimony indicates that the President began making inquiries       about the aid on June 19, 2019,\212\ and that all security       assistance for Ukraine had been put on hold by July 12,       2019.\213\ OMB official Mark Sandy testified that when the       hold was ordered no explicit reason was provided.\214\ Mr.       Sandy further testified that it wasn't until September, after       the hold became public, that a concern was expressed about       European burden sharing.\215\ 

       Nor is there evidence that the Trump Administration made       any efforts publicly or privately to get additional       contributions       from Europe while the aid was on hold. Mr. Sandy testified       that he was not aware of any other countries committing to       provide more financial assistance to Ukraine prior to the       lifting of the hold on September 11th.\216\ 

       Moreover, as the GAO decision makes clear, the President       does not have the authority to withhold funding that Congress       has appropriated for a specific purpose. The GAO determined       ``the law does not permit the President to substitute his own       policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into       law. OMB withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not       permitted under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA). The       withholding was not a programmatic delay. Therefore, we       conclude that OMB violated the ICA.'' \217\ 

       The OMB continued to implement the President's hold on the       Ukraine security assistance despite repeated warnings       starting in early August from Department of Defense (DOD)       officials that further delays risked violating the ICA.\218\       The OMB-directed hold on the apportionment of funds continued       even after DOD warned that it could no longer guarantee that       the Department would be able to obligate the funds before the       end of the fiscal year, a clear violation of the ICA.\219\       Ultimately, DOD failed to execute $35 million of the $250       million obligated for USAI before the end of the fiscal       year.\220\ 

       The President's Counsel have failed to produce credible       evidence to support the contention that the President       withheld security assistance and an Oval Office meeting from       Ukraine for legitimate policy reasons. Instead, an adverse       inference can be drawn that the President had no legitimate       policy basis for his actions. Further, the House Impeachment       Managers have established that the President acted for his       own personal benefit, specifically to advance the ongoing       corrupt scheme to solicit foreign interference in the 2020       presidential election.      E. The President's Solicitation of Investigations into the           2016 Campaign and Biden/Burisma Theories was Without Due           Consideration of U.S. National Interests 

       The final element of the offense of abuse of power, as       previously delineated, is that the use of official power, for       personal or some other corrupt purpose, is made without due       consideration for the national interest. The evidence       presented at the Senate trial makes clear that in using the       powers of his office to withhold valuable U.S. security       assistance and an Oval Office visit for the newly-elected       Ukrainian President to advance a corrupt scheme to solicit       foreign interference for his personal benefit, President       Trump harmed the national interest of the United States.       President Trump's efforts to leverage two official acts to       advance a scheme to solicit foreign interference in the 2020       election is contrary to the national interests of the United       States in a number of ways. 

       First and foremost, President Trump's misuse of the powers       of his office threatened the heart of the constitutional       order itself, potentially undermining our democratic process.       By pressuring Ukraine to engage in election interference       through the promotion of two unfounded theories, President       Trump's conduct posed an urgent danger to the integrity of       our constitutional system. If the history of the 2016       election can be rewritten at the President's direction to       cast doubt on Russia's interference, it invites Russia and       other adversaries to interfere again in the future knowing       that there will be no consequences. Similarly, it risks       distorting the integrity of our electoral process if the       President can leverage the power of the presidency to       pressure foreign countries to commit their government       resources to dig up ``dirt'' on his political opponents in       order to benefit his reelection. 

       Second, President Trump's corrupt scheme threatened U.S.       national security objectives by advancing a Russian       disinformation narrative that it was Ukraine, and not Russia,       that interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign. The       Intelligence Community unanimously assessed that ``Russian       President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in       2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.'' \221\ That       assessment of the Intelligence Community was affirmed by the       bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,\222\ and       the Special Counsel's investigation.\223\ 

       The perpetuation and promotion of a Russian disinformation       operation undermines U.S. efforts to protect our electoral       institutions from Russian interference and to build the       resilience of the American people against foreign       interference. Former NSC official Dr. Fiona Hill underscored       the importance of countering this Russian information warfare       campaign when she testified before the House Intelligence       Committee on November 21, 2019. She assessed: 

       The impacts of the successful 2016 Russian campaign remains       evident today. Our nation is being torn apart. Truth is       questioned. Our highly professional expert career Foreign       Service is being undermined. U.S. support for Ukraine which       continues to face armed Russian aggression is being       politicized. The Russian Government's goal is to weaken our       country, to diminish America's global role, and to neutralize       a perceived U.S. threat to Russian interests. President Putin       and the Russian security services aim to counter U.S. foreign       policy objectives in Europe including in Ukraine, where       Moscow wishes to reassert political and economic       dominance.\224\ 

       Third, the President's withholding of nearly $400 million       in U.S. security assistance to Ukraine undermined U.S.       national security objectives in the strategic competition       with Russia, a central pillar of the Administration's own       National Defense Strategy. NSC official Tim Morrison stressed       that ``Ukraine is on the front lines of a strategic       competition between the West and Vladimir Putin's revanchist       Russia.'' \225\ He added, ``The United States aids Ukraine       and her people so they can fight Russia over there, and we       don't have to fight Russia here.'' \226\ Ambassador Taylor       also testified on the importance of supporting Ukraine for       U.S. national security interests. He stressed, ``One of our       national security goals is to resolve conflicts in Europe''       and our aid to Ukraine is ``in support of a broader strategic       approach to Europe . . .,'' and is ``to support Ukraine when       it negotiates with the Russians.'' \227\ 

       Ambassador Taylor and other witnesses were particularly       alarmed by the withholding of the security assistance because       of its potential impact on Ukraine at a critical time in its       conflict with Russia. As Ambassador Taylor testified, ``It's       one thing to try to leverage a meeting in the White House.       It's another thing, I thought, to leverage security       assistance to a country at war, dependent on both the       security assistance and the demonstration of support. It was       much more alarming.'' \228\ Ambassador Taylor further       underscored the harm from withholding vital aid for Ukraine:       ``Security assistance was so important for Ukraine as well as       our national interests, to withhold that assistance for no       good reason other than help with a political campaign made no       sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been       trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It       was crazy.'' \229\ 

       President Trump's actions also threatened to undermine one       of Ukraine's greatest assets in its conflict with Russia, the       bipartisan nature of support for Ukraine in the U.S.       Congress. Ambassador Taylor advised President Zelensky's       close aide Yermak, of the ``high strategic value of a       bipartisan support for Ukraine and the importance of not       getting involved in other country's elections.'' \230\       Ambassador Volker also emphasized the importance of the       bipartisan support in Congress for U.S. policy toward       Ukraine.\231\ 

       Finally, the President's efforts to secure investigations       into the 2016 campaign and Biden/Burisma theories undermined       U.S. policy promoting the rule of law and fighting       corruption, which included discouraging partner governments       from launching politically-motivated investigations into       domestic rivals. Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent,       former Deputy Chief of Mission in Ukraine, testified to the       official U.S. policies in place in countries like Ukraine and       Georgia, stating that ``having the President of the United       States effectively ask for a political investigation of his       opponent would run directly contrary'' to these efforts.\232\       As Chairman Schiff restated on December 18, 2019: 

       On September 14 in Ukraine, when Ambassador Volker sat down       with Andriy Yermak, the top adviser to Zelensky, and he did       what he should do. He supported the rule of law, and he said:       You, Andriy Yermak, should not investigate the last       President, President Poroshenko, for political reasons. You       should not engage in political investigations. And do you       know what Yermak said: ``Oh, you mean like what you want us       to do with the Bidens and the Clintons? \233\ 

       Based on the above analysis, I find that there is       overwhelmingly clear and convincing evidence that elements of       abuse of power have been met and that President Trump is       guilty on the first Article of Impeachment.                   VI. ARTICLE II: OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS  

       Article II of House Resolution 755 provides that, in the       conduct of his office, the President directed the       unprecedented and categorical indiscriminate defiance of       subpoenas issued pursuant to the House's ``sole Power of       Impeachment.'' \234\ Article I provides further provides that       President Trump's ordering the White House and other       Executive Branch agencies and Executive Branch officials to       defy House subpoenas sought ``to seize and control the power       of impeachment . . . a vital constitutional safeguard vested       solely in the House of Representatives.'' \235\ I will first       explain how historical and case precedent proves that       obstruction of Congress is an impeachable offense. Next, I       will explain how, through his indiscriminate order, President       Trump sought to vitiate and in fact, did undermine, the       lawful authority of Congress. Finally, I will explain how       each of the arguments that the President's Counsel put       forward during the Impeachment Trial to justify the       President's obstruction do not amount to a lawful cause or       excuse.      A. Obstruction of Congress Is An Impeachable Offense 

       When any one branch of government seeks to obstruct an       essential function of another branch, it threatens a central       feature of our republic: the separation of powers.\236\ In       the case where a President seeks to derogate the authority of       another branch, it can also undermine the President's       constitutional obligation to ``take Care that the Laws be       faithfully executed.'' \237\ 

       President Trump continues to thwart Congress' oversight and       investigative powers, which are essential constitutional       functions of the Legislative Branch. In McGrain v. Daugherty,       the Supreme Court firmly established that such inquiry power       is ``an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the       legislative function'' and included the ability to seek and       enforce demands for information.\238\  

       The need to comply with subpoena-backed requests for       information, including in an Impeachment, has been explicitly       stated. In Kilbourn v. Thompson, the Supreme Court held that,       ``Where the question of such impeachment is before either       [the House or Senate] acting in its appropriate sphere on       that subject [of impeachment], we see no reason to doubt the       right to compel the attendance of witnesses, and their answer       to proper questions, in the same manner and by the use of the       same means that courts of justice can in like cases.'' \239\ 

       Part of Congress' broad oversight authority is the power to       hold sitting presidents accountable for grave misconduct and       abuses of public trust through Impeachment. Indeed, Article       I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution gives the       House of Representatives ``the sole Power of Impeachment.''       \240\ However, an Impeachment inquiry can only be discharged       through the cooperation of the governmental branch being       investigated; only this branch can provide documents and       witness testimony related to its own conduct. By refusing to       provide any information, President Trump is trying to stop       Congress from gathering relevant information and render the       Impeachment process toothless.\241\ As John Quincy Adams       noted, it would make a ``mockery'' of the Constitution's       Impeachment power for Congress to have the power to impeach       but ``not the power to obtain the evidence and proofs on       which their impeachment was based.'' \242\ 

       The Judiciary Committee also confirmed that subverting the       constitutionally vested powers of the Legislative Branch can       be an impeachable offense, when it previously approved       Articles of Impeachment charging President Richard Nixon with       the failure to comply with duly authorized congressional       subpoenas. The Judiciary Committee explained that: 

       In refusing to produce these papers and things, Richard M.       Nixon, substituting his judgment as to what materials were       necessary for the inquiry, interposed the powers of the       Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of       Representatives, thereby assuming to himself functions and       judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of       impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of       Representatives.\243\ 

       Based on the above historical and case precedent, I       conclude that obstruction of Congress can be an impeachable       offense. I also conclude that a sitting President commits       obstruction of Congress by: 

       1) Contravening the lawful authority of the Legislative       Branch; 

       2) By imposing the powers of the presidency; 

       3) Without lawful cause or excuse.      B. The House of Representatives Exercised Its Lawful           Authority in the Impeachment Inquiry 

       As explained in Section V, Subsection A of this Memorandum,       Congress has broad power to conduct oversight and issue       demands for information, and is vested with the sole power to       conduct Impeachment. 

       In this case, the House of Representatives was using both       its lawful investigative and Impeachment authorities, when it       issued lawful subpoenas leading up to and after the adoption       of House Resolution 660 on October 31, 2019, which formalized       the ongoing investigations into whether sufficient grounds       existed for the House of Representatives to impeach President       Donald John Trump.\244\ 

       On September 9, 2019, the House Committees on Intelligence,       Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform (hereinafter       ``Investigating Committees'') first announced that they would       be starting an investigation into reports that President       Trump and his associates might have been seeking assistance       from the Ukrainian government in his bid for reelection.\245\       As part of this inquiry, the Investigating Committees       requested that the White House provide documents related to       the President's July 25th call with the Ukrainian       President.\246\ 

       Speaker Nancy Pelosi subsequently announced on September       24, 2019 that the House would be commencing ``an official       Impeachment inquiry.'' \247\ The Investigating Committees       then subpoenaed documents and witness testimony from the       White House,\248\ the Department of State,\249\ the       Department of Defense,\250\ the Office of Management and       Budget,\251\ the Department of Energy,\252\ and Rudy       Giuliani.\253\ 

       Once H.Res. 660 was approved by the House on October 31st,       the subpoenas issued as part of the ongoing investigations       leading up to the adoption of H.Res. 660 remained in full       force.\254\ In addition, the House Intelligence Committee       issued new subpoenas for witness testimony to officials at       the National Security Council,\255\ White House,\256\ Office       of Management and Budget,\257\ and the Office of the Vice       President.\258\ 

       As such, I conclude that there is overwhelmingly clear and       convincing evidence that the House used its lawful authority       in conducting its Impeachment inquiry.      C. President Trump Used the Powers of the Presidency to           Subvert the Powers of Congress 

       President Trump used the vast powers of his office to       prevent the House of Representatives from exercising its       oversight authority and sole power of Impeachment. The       President did so by ordering the entire Executive Branch not       to cooperate with the House Impeachment inquiry. White House       Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi and the       Investigating Committees on October 8, 2019, declaring that       ``President Trump cannot permit his Administration to       participate in this partisan inquiry under these       circumstances.'' \259\ It is notable that, even before       sending the October 8th letter, President Trump had made his       intentions clear to obstruct any and all oversight by       Congress, proclaiming, ``We're fighting all the subpoenas.''       \260\ President Trump further asserted, ``As the President of       the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a       duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and       that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries       help us out!'' \261\ 

       The President's sweeping directive on October 8th had the       foreseeable effect of obstructing, and in fact, did       materially thwart, the House Impeachment inquiry. Following       President Trump's categorical order, the Department of       State,\262\ the Office of Management and Budget,\263\ the       Department of Energy,\264\ and the Department of Defense       \265\ failed to produce a single document in response to       requests or demands for records in their possession. To date,       the only documents the Executive Branch has released are       summaries of President Trump's phone calls with President       Zelensky on April 21, 2019 \266\ and July 25, 2019.\267\ Even       these documents are not complete. The President claimed the       July 25th call is, ``an exact word for word transcript of the       conversation.'' \268\ However, witness testimony from the       House Impeachment inquiry shows that there were key       omissions. NSC official Lt. Col. Vindman, who listened to the       calls, testified that edits that he provided to the draft       July 25th document based on his notes were not included in       the transcript that was released. Lt. Col. Vindman's edits       included a reference to Burisma and President Trump telling       President Zelensky that there are recordings of Vice       President Biden.\269\ 

       Additionally, as a result of the October 8th directive,       multiple Trump Administration officials have defied       congressional subpoenas and refused to testify in the       Impeachment proceedings.\270\ Overwhelming evidence of the       President's abuse of power has come to light, despite the       President's obstructionist efforts, largely because key       Administration officials risked their jobs and careers to       comply with subpoenas and requests issued by the House. Even       in those cases, agency leadership worked to ensure that these       officials would only be able to give limited testimony. In       particular, the Department of State,\271\ the Department of       Defense,\272\ and the Department of Energy \273\ prevented       Executive Branch employees who did participate as witnesses       from accessing documents that they identified as directly       relevant to the Impeachment inquiry--including their phone       records, emails, notes, and memoranda. As a result, these       witnesses were denied the opportunity to have documents that       could have helped them give more specific testimony, and some       had to rely on their own notes and recollections.\274\ 

       President Trump personally sought, through intimidation or       influence, to impede the testimony of officials that       cooperated with the House Impeachment inquiry. He       specifically sought to interfere with the testimonies of       Ambassador Gordon Sondland,\275\ Ambassador William       Taylor,\276\ Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch,\277\ Lt. Col.       Alexander Vindman,\278\ and Jennifer Williams.\279\ 

       There is indeed overwhelmingly clear and convincing       evidence that President Trump used the powers of his office       to prevent the House from exercising its constitutionally       granted authority to conduct oversight related to the       Impeachment inquiry.      D. President Trump Obstructed the Impeachment Inquiry Without           Lawful Cause or Excuse 

       Whether President Trump obstructed Congress turns on       whether there is evidence that he had legal cause or excuse       for his total non-cooperation with the Impeachment inquiry. I       will address how each of the arguments that the President's       Counsel have made in attempting to justify the President's       stonewalling do not provide sufficient legal excuse for his       conduct.                  D.1. Validity of Congressional Subpoenas  

       The President's Counsel argue that subpoenas related to the       Impeachment proceeding are invalid, if they were issued       before the House voted to approve H.Res. 660 formalizing the       Impeachment inquiry on October 31, 2019. In the President's       trial brief, Counsel states that ``It was entirely proper for       Administration officials to decline to comply with subpoenas       issued pursuant to a purported `impeachment inquiry' before       the House of Representatives had authorized any such inquiry.       No House committee can issue subpoenas pursuant to the       House's Impeachment power without authorization from the       House itself.'' \280\ Relying on the argument that subpoenas       issued prior to the passage of H.Res. 660 were invalid, the       White House, Department of State, and the Department of       Defense instructed current and former employees not to       testify before the Investigating Committees in the       Impeachment proceedings.\281\ 

       The President's Counsel's argument broadly fails because it       goes against well-established case law recognizing Congress'       power to conduct investigations \282\ and issues       subpoenas,\283\ even when it is not engaged in an       Impeachment. Furthermore, the standing rules of the House       authorize a committee or subcommittee, with certain       limitations, to issue subpoenas ``[f]or the purpose of       carrying out any of its functions and duties.'' \284\ 

       Therefore, the relevant question on the validity of the       House subpoenas does not turn       on whether they were issued before or after H.Res. 660, as       the President's Counsel argue. Rather, it should center on       whether they were issued as part of a lawful congressional       investigation.\285\ In this case, the subpoenas at issue       involved the legitimate purpose of investigating whether       President Trump and his associates sought assistance from the       Ukrainian government to influence the 2020 election. As a       result, there is convincing evidence that the House Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Foreign Affairs       Committee, and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform       had valid investigative and subpoena authority, even before       the passage of H.Res. 660. 

       Even if the argument made by the President's Counsel was       legitimate, the Trump Administration failed to abide by its       rule. Following the President's Counsel's own logic, the       President would have to recognize the validity of and comply       with subpoenas issued after the Impeachment inquiry was       formalized on October 31, 2019. Yet, the President did not       permit officials from OMB and the National Security Council       to testify even though they were subpoenaed after H.Res. 660       passed the House.\286\                        D.2. Assertions of Privilege  

       To the extent that the President has legitimate executive       privilege claims, he failed to properly assert them or to go       through the proper accommodation process to keep information       confidential.               D.2.a. Presidential privilege is not absolute  

       The President's Counsel have stood by the October 8th       letter from Mr. Cipollone to Speaker Pelosi declaring that       the President and his Administration would not participate in       the Impeachment inquiry.\287\ President Trump himself has       articulated his expansive view of his powers saying,       ``Honestly, we have all the material . . . They don't have       the material.'' \288\ 

       However, in United States v. Nixon, the Supreme Court       flatly rejected this kind of unlimited assertion of executive       power. The Court held that ``neither the doctrine of       separation of powers, nor the need for confidentiality of       high-level communications, without more, can sustain an       absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from       judicial process under all circumstances.'' \289\ Instead,       the Court found that, in an inter-branch dispute, when a       claim of presidential privilege is based merely on the       grounds of a generalized interest in confidentiality, ``the       generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the       demonstrated, specific need for evidence.'' \290\ 

       A related D.C. Circuit Court case, Senate Select Committee       on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, affirmed that       presidential privilege is not absolute and could be overcome       by a ``strong showing of need by another institution of       government.'' \291\ The Court in this case articulated the       following test in making its decision: Congress in using its       investigative powers may override presidential privilege when       it makes the requisite showing of need that ``the subpoenaed       evidence is demonstrably critical to the responsible       fulfillment of the Committee's function,'' such as a       legitimate oversight or legislative purpose.\292\ 

       In this case, Mr. Cipollone's October 8th letter makes       clear the President intended to exercise privileges over the       whole of the Executive Branch, regardless of whether an       agency was involved in foreign policy or national security       policy.\293\ In contrast, the Investigating Committees       overwhelmingly demonstrated a particularized interest in       obtaining information to ascertain whether the President used       the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on       his behalf in the 2020 election. In addition, it would be       hard to think of a setting where congressional need for       information is greater than during an Impeachment, which is       the Constitution's most potent way to hold the President       accountable for his misconduct.\294\ 

       The President's Counsel further assert that senior advisors       to the President do not have to comply with congressional       subpoenas because they have ``absolute immunity.'' This       doctrine of absolute immunity has also been rejected by the       D.C. District Court in House Judiciary Committee v. Miers       \295\ and House Judiciary Committee v. McGahn.\296\                 D.2.b. Accommodation of legislative branch  

       Moreover, even if President Trump did have a legitimate       need to keep information confidential, each branch of       government is required to accommodate the legitimate needs of       the others to maintain the separation of powers. If President       Trump had a valid need to keep confidential some of the       information that the House requested, the agencies and       offices involved could have entered into good-faith       negotiations with the House to resolve their conflicting       needs. The Courts have suggested that the Framers intended       dynamic compromise as the most effective way to solve       disputes between the branches and that view has been affirmed       by the longstanding historical practice of the branches.\297\       In United States v. AT&T, the D.C. Circuit Court held that       ``Under this view, the coordinate branches do not exist in an       exclusively adversary relationship to one another when a       conflict in authority arises. Rather, each branch should take       cognizance of an implicit constitutional mandate to seek       optimal accommodation through a realistic evaluation of the       needs of the conflicting branches in the particular fact       situation.'' \298\ 

       It is this accommodation process that is the norm, not a       wholesale refusal by one branch to another. ``Cooperation       dominates most congressional requests for information, with       the executive turning over the requested information as a       matter of routine.'' \299\ A complete breakdown in these       procedures is a rarity as ``information access disputes are       typically worked out through one of several intermediate       options'' such as the Executive Branch agency providing       redacted documents or requiring Congress to keep the       requested information confidential.\300\ A memorandum written       by the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) during the       administration of President George H. W. Bush explains that       ``[I]f further negotiation is unavailing, it is necessary to       consider asking the President to assert executive       privilege.'' \301\ Traditionally, Executive Branch agency       branch officials then present their case for the assertion of       executive privilege to the President and the agency asks       Congress to hold its request in abeyance, pending the       President's decision.\302\ 

       The President's Counsel claim that the Executive Branch was       willing to enter into an accommodation process with the       House.\303\ However, whereas the presumption in an inter-      branch dispute is cooperation, the White House's default       position has been total refusal of the House's requests for       information. To this day, the Trump Administration has not       turned over a single responsive document or worked to make a       single witness available for questioning by Congress. The       Administration has not sought an intermediate option to make       information available to Congress. Nor has the Executive       Branch ever formally invoked executive privilege or asked       Congress to hold its requests in abeyance pending the       President's decision to assert executive privilege.                     D.2.c. Obstruction in Senate trial  

       President Trump's obstruction of Congress and his failure       to resolve disputes with the Legislative Branch in good faith       continued into the Senate trial, as his Administration       continued to withhold the information that was subpoenaed       during the House inquiry. The President's Counsel even went       so far as to instruct the Senate that it could not consider       the evidence the House did obtain saying that ``The Senate       may not rely on a corrupted factual record derived from       constitutionally deficient proceedings to support a       conviction of the President of the United States.'' \304\ 

       In addition, as the Senate Impeachment proceedings were       underway, new and material evidence of President Trump's       misconduct continued to come out. Lev Parnas, the associate       of Rudy Giuliani, asserted that President Trump was fully       aware of efforts to dig up ``dirt'' on his political rival,       as were Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General William       Barr, and former Energy Secretary Rick Perry.\305\ According       to news reports, it also has come to light that President       Trump directed John Bolton, his then-national security       adviser, to help with his pressure campaign against the       Ukrainian government.\306\ Both Bolton and Parnas made it       clear during the Impeachment trial that they were willing to       testify before the Senate.\307\ Yet, President Trump sought       to discredit both witnesses \308\ and even threatened to       assert executive privilege to prevent John Bolton from coming       to testify and cooperating in the Impeachment trial.\309\            D.3. Purported Defectiveness of Impeachment Inquiry  

       The President's Counsel argue that the subpoenas issued by       the House are invalid not only because of when they were       issued. They argue that the Impeachment inquiry itself is       defective and unauthorized and therefore any compliance is       unnecessary. 

       The President's Counsel argue that ``the House has never       undertaken the solemn responsibility of a presidential       impeachment inquiry without first authorizing a particular       committee to begin the inquiry'' and ``[t]hat has also been       the House's nearly unbroken practice for every judicial       impeachment for two hundred years.'' \310\ 

       As explained in Section V, Subsection D.1 of this       Memorandum, Congress' power to conduct investigations and       issue subpoenas, even when not as part of an Impeachment, has       been repeatedly and firmly settled by the Courts. Therefore,       even if one accepts that the Impeachment investigation was       invalid unless authorized by the House, it does nothing to       diminish the power of the committees at hand to engage in an       oversight investigation. Nor does it diminish the duty to       comply with subpoenas that were issued under this oversight       authority. 

       The President's Counsel is contradicted by the cases of       President Johnson and Nixon, where a committee of       jurisdiction started taking steps toward Impeachment before       the full House took any action. In the Johnson Impeachment,       the Judiciary Committee considered Articles of Impeachment       before reporting them out for a vote by the House.\311\ In       the case of President Nixon, the Judiciary Committee employed       a Special Counsel to assist in the inquiry, before the House       explicitly authorized the Committee's investigation to       determine whether the House should impeach.\312\ 

       What's more, the President's Counsel's position appears to       be that the House must authorize an Impeachment before it has       gathered enough evidence to warrant one, and also that a       congressional investigation which begins to produce evidence       of grounds for Impeachment loses its investigative authority       until the House votes to formalize the Impeachment inquiry.       These arguments defy both logic and past precedent.  

       Here, I am also persuaded by the House Impeachment       Managers' argument that the Constitution grants the ``sole       Power of Impeachment'' to the House of Representatives. In       addition, the Constitution says that, ``[t]he Senate shall       have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.'' \313\ Nowhere       does the Constitution empower the President to unilaterally       decide that an Impeachment is illegitimate. I conclude that       investigations leading up to H.Res. 660 and the formal       inquiry that continued afterward were duly authorized.                          D.4. Further Litigation  

       The President's Counsel argue that its categorical and       comprehensive defiance cannot be deemed to be obstruction of       Congress because the House has not sought judicial review of       the subpoenas issued as part of the Impeachment inquiry. 

       This argument is unconvincing given that the involvement of       the Courts in information access disputes between the       Legislative and Executive Branches has been rare, at least       with respect to conflicts over House subpoenas. As the       Congressional Research Service explains: 

       The traditional preference for political rather than       judicial solutions seems supported by the fact that neither       Congress nor the President appears to have turned to the       courts to resolve an investigative dispute until the 1970s .       . . The courts themselves have also generally sought to avoid       adjudicating investigative disputes between the executive and       legislative branches, instead encouraging settlement of their       differences through a political resolution. Consistent with       that approach, lower federal courts have suggested that       judicial intervention in investigative disputes ``should be       delayed until all possibilities for settlement have been       exhausted.'' . . . [In addition] some evidence suggests that       both the House and the courts have viewed judicial       involvement in an impeachment inquiry as inappropriate or in       excess of the judiciary's power.\314\ 

       Moreover, the argument of the President's Counsel is       ineffective in the context of the dilatory tactics the Trump       Administration has been using in other pending cases where       the House also has subpoenaed documents. In particular, the       Administration has used arguments which, if taken together,       seem to assert the President cannot be held accountable by       either the Judicial or Legislative Branch. These stall       tactics were highlighted in a case currently pending in the       D.C. Circuit Court, Committee on the Judiciary v. McGahn. In       this case, the House Judiciary Committee is trying to enforce       a subpoena against former White House Counsel, Don McGahn.       The D.C. District Court ruled against the DOJ, which claimed       that McGahn had absolute immunity from congressional       subpoenas for his testimony. In its decision, the Judge       compares the DOJ's inconsistent arguments in the McGahn case       with a series of cases regarding congressional subpoenas for       the President's tax returns. The Judge points out that the: 

       DOJ stood silent with respect to the jurisdictional       question, as President Trump (in his personal capacity) has       invoked the authority of the federal courts, on more than one       occasion, seeking resolution of a dispute over the       enforceability of a legislative subpoena concerning his tax       returns. A lawsuit that asserts that a legislative subpoena       should be quashed as unlawful is merely the flip side of a       lawsuit that argues that a legislative subpoena should be       enforced. And it is either DOJ's position that the federal       courts have jurisdiction to review such subpoena-enforcement       claims or that they do not. By arguing vigorously here that       the federal courts have no subject-matter jurisdiction to       entertain the Judiciary Committee's subpoena-enforcement       action, yet taking no position on the jurisdictional basis       for the President's maintenance of lawsuits to prevent       Congress from accessing his personal records by legislative       subpoena, DOJ implicitly suggests that (much like absolute       testimonial immunity) the subject-matter jurisdiction of       the federal courts is properly invoked only at the       pleasure of the President.\315\ 

       The Judge in the McGahn case also noted that the DOJ made       conflicting arguments in the House's lawsuit seeking grand       jury evidence that contributed to former Special Counsel       Robert Mueller's report. The Judge goes on to write: 

       During oral argument, when one of the panelists asked DOJ       about the district court's subject-matter jurisdiction to       entertain the House's legal action, DOJ Counsel remarked       that, while the Executive branch was ``not advancing that       argument[,]'' it believed that DOJ ``certainly has both       standing and jurisdiction'' to seek review of the district       court's injunction . . . But if DOJ's position is that the       federal courts have the authority to entertain a legal claim       concerning the House's contested request for allegedly       privileged grand jury materials, how can it be heard to       argue, nearly simultaneously, that the instant Court has no       jurisdiction to entertain a legal claim concerning the       enforceability of a House committee's subpoena compelling the       testimony of senior-level presidential aides?\316\ 

       Further litigation is also problematic because, unlike       Presidents Nixon and Clinton who were in their second terms,       President Trump's misconduct is immediately preceding and, in       anticipation of, the upcoming presidential election. The crux       of President Trump's scheme was to corruptly use the vast       powers of his presidency to invite foreign interference into       the 2020 election in order to benefit himself politically.       Allowing President Trump to delay this Impeachment through       litigation would enable him to keep relevant documents and       witnesses from coming out until after the 2020 election. It       could also embolden him to engage in additional unfettered       misconduct aimed at increasing his chances of getting       reelected. 

       This threat to the integrity of our elections is exactly       the kind of misconduct that the Framers were worried about.       In George Mason's view, a risk of election fraud ``furnished       a peculiar reason in favor of impeachments[.]'' \317\ Another       exchange between two delegates, William Richardson Davie and       James Wilson, highlights the importance of safeguarding       against a corrupt president that would cheat to get       reelected. Davie stated, `` `[i]f he be not impeachable       whilst in office, he will spare no efforts or means whatever       to get himself reelected.' [Davie] considered this as an       essential security for the good behaviour of the Executive.''       \318\ Wilson concurred with Davie ``in the necessity of       making the Executive impeachable while in office.'' \319\                              D.5. Due Process  

       The President's Counsel assert that the Impeachment inquiry       is defective because of a lack of due process protections for       President Trump. Specifically, in Mr. Cipollone's October 8th       letter, he asserts that the President was entitled to due       process rights during the House's Impeachment inquiry, which       he was not afforded, including ``the right to see all       evidence, to present evidence, to call witnesses, to have       Counsel present at all hearings, to cross-examine all       witnesses, to make objections . . . and to respond to       evidence and testimony.'' \320\ 

       Procedural due process--meaning the legal procedures to be       used in a proceeding--is rooted in basic constitutional       principles of fundamental fairness. Determining due process       of the law ``require[s] . . . that state action, whether       through one agency or another, shall be consistent with the       fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at       the base of all our civil and political institutions and not       infrequently are designated as `law of the land.' '' \321\ 

       In evaluating whether President Trump was afforded       protections that are consistent with the ``fundamental       principles of liberty and justice,'' the analysis should       center on whether he was given rights customarily given to       presidents in previous Impeachments. 

       During the Clinton Impeachment inquiry, the President's       Counsel was invited to attend all Judiciary Committee       executive sessions and open hearings, was allowed to cross-      examine witnesses, object to pieces of evidence, suggest that       the Committee review additional evidence, and respond to       evidence used by the Committee.\322\ During the Nixon       Impeachment inquiry, the President's Counsel was not invited       to participate in the Judiciary Committee's proceedings until       months after the inquiry's authorizing resolution was       passed.\323\ Once invited, Nixon's counsel was allowed to       attend the initial presentation of evidence and respond to it       in later proceedings, attend later hearings with witnesses,       submit requests to call witnesses, cross-examine witnesses       that were called, and object to pieces of evidence.\324\ 

       The House's Impeachment inquiry into President Trump       afforded the President rights that were consistent with these       precedents from prior presidential Impeachments. The       President's Counsel was given the opportunity to participate       in the House Judiciary Committee's proceedings during the       impeachment inquiry. This included the right to attend every       Judiciary Committee hearing; request additional witnesses       during these hearings; present evidence orally or in writing;       have the President's Counsel cross-examine witnesses; and       raise objections during Judiciary Committee hearings.\325\ In       a November 29th letter to the President, House Judiciary       Committee Chairman Nadler inquired which of these privileges       the President's Counsel wished to exercise.\326\ In his       December 6th response, Mr. Cipollone chose not to exercise       any of these rights and claimed the Impeachment inquiry       violated due process rights.\327\ 

       After reviewing this comparison, I conclude President Trump       has been afforded as least as much due process protection as       Presidents Nixon and Clinton, and therefore standards of       fundamental fairness requisite for due process have been met       in the current Impeachment proceeding. 

       Based on the above analysis, I find that there is       overwhelmingly clear and convincing evidence that President       Trump obstructed the House Impeachment inquiry without lawful       cause or excuse and that President Trump is guilty on the       second Article of Impeachment.                       VII. LACK OF EVIDENTIARY RECORD       A. Senate's Role in Lack of Witnesses and Documents 

       As I have explained, the House of Representatives, as part       of its Impeachment inquiry, subpoenaed documents and       witnesses from multiple Executive Branch agencies. To date,       the Administration has produced zero responsive documents. In       fact, the Administration has engaged in a coordinated and       systematic effort to deny relevant evidence and testimony to       the House of Representatives in defiance of lawful       Congressional subpoenas.\328\ 

       Fortunately, patriotic and law-abiding federal employees       and former officials complied       with lawful subpoenas and appeared at depositions or public       hearings. As described previously, testimony provided by       witnesses is probative of the President's guilt on both       Articles of Impeachment. 

       Once the Articles of Impeachment were received by the       Senate, the Senate had the opportunity to utilize its own       oversight and Impeachment authority pursuant to Article I of       the Constitution to gather relevant documents and testimony.       However, in this Impeachment trial, unlike previous ones       conducted by the Senate, whether of Presidents or other       officials, no witnesses were allowed.\329\ 

       My Republican colleagues voted against holding a fair       trial. For example, Leader McConnell initially sought to have       a set of rules governing this Impeachment trial that would       not have included a provision to automatically adopt the       House's evidence.\330\ He also sought to have twenty-four       hours of opening arguments over two days to speed up the       trial.\331\ My Republican colleagues relented on these       points, allowing the House Impeachment Managers and the       President's Counsel to each have twenty-four hours of       argument over three days.\332\ The Republican-authored       resolution ultimately did not guarantee witnesses, only       providing for a vote on whether witnesses could be heard at       the end of arguments and the question period.\333\ From the       get-go, my Republican colleagues were reluctant to have       evidence and arguments put in front of the American people       for judgment. 

       My Democratic colleagues offered eleven amendments in an       effort to ensure a fair trial.\334\ The amendments, if       adopted, would have permitted Senators and the American       people to see relevant evidence and hear from witnesses.       These amendments were defeated--almost entirely along party       lines.\335\ 

       After the question and answer portion of the Impeachment       trial, the Senate voted on amendments offered by my       Democratic colleagues that would have provided for witnesses       and documents.\336\ These amendments were again defeated,       largely along partisan lines.\337\ It is crucial to note,       that this second series of votes was taken after reports that       Ambassador Bolton's draft manuscript contained evidence       relevant and central to the allegations in the Articles of       Impeachment. Through the end of the trial, the vast majority       of my Republican colleagues did not want to hear from       Ambassador Bolton, other relevant witnesses, or see documents       that would likely reveal evidence damaging to the President. 

       Further, Leader McConnell compared his approach in this       trial to that of the Impeachment Trial of President Clinton,       when Senators voted on whether to hear witnesses at the end       of arguments.\338\ Leader McConnell's assertion is       disingenuous considering that the Clinton Impeachment trial       occurred after a lengthy and comprehensive investigation led       by the then independent Counsel, Kenneth Starr, which       included tens of thousands of pages of evidence and recorded       testimony. During the Clinton Impeachment trial, witnesses       had also previously testified in grand jury proceedings.\339\       There were no surprises as to what witnesses would say.       President Trump's Impeachment Trial represents a stark       departure from what occurred during the Clinton Impeachment       Trial and indeed, sets a damaging and devastating precedent.    VIII. CONCLUSION: REMOVAL OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE SOLE APPROPRIATE                                   REMEDY  

       Conviction and removal of a President from office is a high       standard, and one that should only be arrived at when there       are no other remedies available. As I laid out during the       1999 Impeachment trial of President Clinton, ``the       independence of the Impeachment process from the prosecution       of crimes underscores the function of Impeachment as a means       to remove a President from office, not because of criminal       behavior, but because the President poses a threat to the       Constitutional order.'' \340\ Furthermore, during the Clinton       Impeachment proceedings, I concluded that the President's       improper conduct must represent a continuing threat to the       American people.\341\ In the current case, I have concluded       that allowing President Trump to remain in office would pose       such a continuing threat to our electoral system and the       Constitution.      A. Subversion of the Constitutional Order and an           Unaccountable President 

       The President's Counsel have argued that even if President       Trump abused the power of his office to withhold U.S.       military assistance to an ally, in order to pressure that       country to conduct investigations for his personal and       political benefit, doing so would not be an impeachable       offense. According to the President's Counsel, ``If a       President does something which he believes will help him get       elected--in the public interest--that cannot be the kind of       quid pro quo that results in impeachment.'' \342\ It is on       this basis that the President's Counsel further argue that,       even if the President did in fact condition security       assistance for Ukraine on politically-motivated       investigations, it would not be an impeachable offense.\343\       That argument violates the fundamental principle of our       constitutional system that no one is above the law. 

       Furthermore, President Trump has shown that he will block       any congressional check on his misuse of office by ignoring       subpoenas as he pleases, without asserting a lawful cause. At       the same time, Trump Administration lawyers have been arguing       in various court cases that the Judiciary has no role in       enforcing the very subpoenas from Congress that the       Administration is resisting. 

       President Trump's defiance of both Congress and the Courts       on subpoenas threatens to nullify the constitutional       authority of both the House and Senate, not merely to check       the personal excesses of any given president, but also to       oversee the entire Executive Branch. It validates and       encourages the President's strategy of large-scale       obstruction of congressional inquiries. It emboldens the       President to defy investigations into his misconduct and       strengthens the President's determination to resist       additional congressional oversight. 

       The result of permitting the Executive Branch to wholly       disregard Congressional requests for information is not only       to neuter the Impeachment power, but more profoundly, impact       Congress as a fundamental check on executive mismanagement,       abuse, corruption, and overreach embodied in the power of       congressional oversight.      B. Ongoing Harm to the Constitutional Order 

       An additional basis for seeking the removal of a President       from office is that his conduct poses continuing harm to the       constitutional order. President Trump's solicitation of       foreign election interference, based on the perpetuation and       amplification of baseless and unfounded theories that harm       his political opponents, serves to damage the fundamental       institutions of our democracy. 

       President Trump's behavior was not a one-time indiscretion,       but rather part of a pattern of behavior to invite foreign       influence into our elections which thereby undermines the       constitutional order and harms the integrity of our       democracy. In 2016, then-candidate Trump called on Russia to       hack the emails of his political rival, Secretary       Clinton.\344\ He also promoted hacked emails from Secretary       Clinton's campaign that were stolen by Russian Military       Intelligence units, in order to benefit himself politically       in the 2016 election.\345\ In June 2019, President Trump       publicly announced that he would take information on his       political rival from a foreign government.\346\ Moreover, he       pressured Ukraine to announce investigations into his       political opponents to benefit his 2020 campaign. Indeed,       even after the House began its Impeachment inquiry and he was       confronted by allegations of soliciting foreign interference,       President Trump doubled down by asking China also to       investigate the Bidens.\347\ In addition, as stated earlier,       his personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani as recently as December       2019, was working to gather disinformation on political       opponents.\348\ 

       The President has in no way taken responsibility for these       actions or shown that he understands the consequences of his       behavior and its harm to the Constitution. After the       Impeachment trial in 1999, President Clinton apologized to       the nation and acted contrite. In contrast, President Trump       has not, in any way, admitted wrongdoing and clings to the       fiction that his call with President Zelensky was       ``perfect.'' \349\ This lack of remorse, combined with his       past and present actions, leaves open the possibility that       President Trump will repeat such offenses in the future.      C. Elections Cannot be the Sole Remedy 

       It has been argued that Impeachment and removal of the       President is not the appropriate remedy when the country is       roughly ten months away from an election. The President's       Counsel argue that any judgment regarding the President's       actions should be left to the American people when they go to       the polls in November 2020. However, by soliciting foreign       interference in the coming election, President Trump's       actions threaten the viability of our elections and the very       foundation of our constitutional order to serve as a check on       the President's conduct. 

       The Founders were acutely aware of the dangers of foreign       election interference. As Alexander Hamilton said in       Federalist Paper Number 68, ``[t]he desire [of] foreign       powers to gain an improper ascendant in our Counsels'' was       one of ``the most deadly adversaries of republican       government.'' \350\ The Founders knew this risk was       inevitable in an election setting. In a letter to John Adams,       Thomas Jefferson wrote ``You are apprehensive of foreign       Interference, Intrigue, Influence. So am I--But, as often as       Elections happen, the danger of foreign Influence recurs.''       \351\ 

       I reject the notion, put forward by the President's       Counsel, that a President who believes his reelection is in       the best interest of the country cannot be impeached for       abusing his power to tilt the next election in his favor. The       Impeachment clause cannot be read to provide a carte blanche       for the President to engage in illegal acts \352\ that       directly undermine the operation of our free and fair       electoral system. The remedy for a President attempting to       corrupt the next election cannot be allowing the President to       corrupt that election. Even a well-intentioned autocrat is       still an autocrat and not a President subject to the       Constitution. If accepted as true, these views would pave the       way for the type of autocratic government that the Founders       feared and fought to leave behind. 

       For elections to express the will of the electorate, they       must be free and fair. Elections must be legitimate, and the       public must have confidence in them. Even the perception that       our elections are tainted would lead voters to question       whether their vote matters. That is why one of our jobs as       lawmakers is to ensure the integrity of the electoral       process. We work to ensure that every vote cast is fairly and       accurately counted.       We work to ensure that external forces, foreign or otherwise,       cannot sway or pre-determine the outcome of the election. The       United States government should not be playing a role in       advancing the goals of foreign powers that seek to use our       institutions to further their own interests. 

       Acquitting President Trump would undermine the integrity of       our elections and clear the way for Russia or other countries       to repeat in 2020, and beyond, the kind of election       interference that the Intelligence Community unanimously       assessed occurred in the 2016 election. Through acquittal,       the Senate will give its blessing for President Trump to use       any means at his disposal to sway the next election in his       favor, with no consequences. President Trump has already       demonstrated unequivocally that he has no compunction about       violating the law, obstructing congressional oversight, and       putting our nation and allies at risk. The difference now       will be that President Trump will know that the Senate will       give him cover for his future abuses of office. The ongoing       threat to the constitutional order must be remedied, and       therefore removal of the President is the only logical       finding in this case.                                   endnotes

(In the spring of 2018,       Soviet born businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman had       multiple contacts with President Trump and his associates.       Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman donated $325,000 to the pro-      Trump Super Pac America First Action through an LLC.       Through those contacts, they forged a relationship with       Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. In August, 2018,       Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman hired Giuliani for $500,000 to       provide legal advice for their company ``Fraud       Guarantee.'' Press reports indicate that Fraud Guarantee       appears to have no customers. On October 10, 2019 a       federal indictment from the Southern District of New York       charged Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman with funneling illegal       campaign contributions from foreign donors to U.S.       government officials and political action committees.)

In the fall of 2015, the Obama       Administration grew concerned that Mr. Shokin, despite       promises to increase anti-corruption investigations, had not       followed through, including on promises to investigate       corruption allegations against the Ukrainian energy company       Burisma. In March 2016, Vice President Biden called for Mr.       Shokin to be fired and told Ukrainian authorities that the       United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees if       he was not relieved of his position. The U.S. position that       Mr. Shokin should be removed and replaced with a prosecutor       general that was dedicated to institutional reforms was       coordinated with European allies and partners and held       popular support inside Ukraine.

(Regarding       Mr. Shokin, Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent, a leading       authority on rule of law and anti-corruption efforts,       assessed in his deposition, ``There was a broad-based       consensus that he [Shokin] was a typical Ukraine prosecutor       who lived a lifestyle far in excess of his government salary,       who never prosecuted anybody known for having committed a       crime, and having covered up crimes that were known to have       been committed.'')

(The       Skype call between Mr. Shokin and Mr. Giuliani occurred after       Mr. Shokin was denied a visa to travel to the United States,       based on his record of corrupt dealings. Deputy Assistant       Secretary George Kent testified that the State Department       objected to the visa because Mr. Shokin was ``very well and       very unfavorably known to us. And we felt, under no       circumstances, should a visa be issued to someone who       knowingly subverted and wasted U.S. taxpayer money.''

(Ambassador Yovanovitch stated at her       closed-door interview, ``The embassy had received a visa       application for a tourist visa from Mr. Shokin, the previous       prosecutor general. And he said that he was coming to visit       his children, who live in the United States . . . The       consular folks . . . got the application, recognized the       name, and believed he was ineligible for a visa, based on his       . . . corrupt activities . . . so I alerted Washington to       this, that this had happened. And the next thing we knew,       Mayor Giuliani was calling the White House as well as the       Assistant Secretary of Consular Affairs, saying that I was       blocking the visa for Mr. Shokin, and that Mr. Shokin was       coming to meet him to provide information about corruption at       the embassy, including my corruption.'')

(In early September 2019, Shokin swore in an affidavit that       Vice President Biden pressured the Poroshenko administration       to fire him to protect Hunter Biden. He further testified       that he was forced out because he was leading ``a wide       ranging corruption probe'' of Burisma and that he was       ``forced to leave office, under direct and intense       pressure from Joe Biden and the U.S. Administration.'' At       the beginning of the affidavit, Shokin wrote that he was       making the statement at the request of lawyers acting for       pro-Putin Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash, who has a       history of acting as a Russian agent and in July 2019,       retained the pro-Trump legal team Victoria Toensing and       Joe DiGenova, who have been working in coordination with       Giuliani to further the corrupt scheme. As part of his       legal representation, Mr. Firtash retained Giuliani       associate Lev Parnas to be his translator. Furthermore,       court filings indicate that Mr. Firtash wired Mr. Parnas's       wife a million dollars through an intermediary. It must be       further noted that Mr. Giuliani referenced that Ms.       Toensing would accompany him to the meeting he requested       with then President- elect Zelensky in mid-May.

(For example, the       President's counsel falsely claimed that the House       Impeachment Managers didn't try to obtain first hand       witnesses while they were making their case in the House. The       President's Counsel argued, ``They didn't even subpoena John       Bolton. They didn't even try to get his testimony. To insist       now that this body will become the investigative body--that       this body will have to do all of the discovery--then, this       institution will be effectively paralyzed for months on end       because it will have to sit as a Court of Impeachment while       now discovery will be done. It would be Ambassador Bolton,       and if there are going to be witnesses, in order for there to       be, as they said, a fair trial, fair adjudication, then, the       President would have to have his opportunity to call his       witnesses, and there would be depositions. This would drag on       for months. Then that will be the new precedent.'' As the       House Impeachment Managers argued, these assertions do not       actually represent the facts, ``We asked John Bolton to       testify in the House, and he refused. We asked his deputy,       Dr. Kupperman, to testify, and he refused. Fortunately, we       asked their deputy, Dr. Fiona Hill, to testify, and she did.       We asked her deputy, Colonel Vindman, to testify, and he did.       We did seek the testimony of John Bolton as well as Dr.       Kupperman, and they refused. When we subpoenaed Dr.       Kupperman, he sued us. He took us to court. When we raised a       subpoena with John Bolton's counsel, the same counsel for Dr.       Kupperman, the answer was, `. . .  you serve us with a       subpoena, and we will sue you, too.'' We knew, based on the       McGahn litigation, it would take months, if not years, to       force John Bolton to come and testify.'')

And I shared that with       Andriy [Yermak]. And then Andriy came back to me and said: We       don't think it's a good idea. So that was obviously before       Andriy came back and said: We don't want to do that.''       Ambassador Volker further elaborated: ``So the Ukrainians       were saying that just coming out of the blue and making a       statement didn't make any sense to them. If they're invited       to come to the White House on a specific date for President       Zelensky's visit, then it would make sense for President       Zelensky to come out and say something, and it would be a       much broader statement about a reboot of U.S.-Ukraine       relations, not just on we're investigating these things       [2016/Burisma].'')

Ambassador Yovanovitch responded:       ``I think it's appropriate if it's part of our national       strategy. What I would say is that we have a process for       doing that. It's called the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.

Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S.       425, 426 (1977). (In Nixon v.

(``A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively       in the absence of information respecting the conditions which       the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where       the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite       information--which not infrequently is true--recourse must be       had to others who do possess it. Experience has taught that       mere requests for such information often are unavailing, and       also that information which is volunteered is not always       accurate or complete; so some means of compulsion are       essential to obtain what is needed. All this was true before       and when the Constitution was framed and adopted. In that       period the power of inquiry--with enforcing process--was       regarded and employed as a necessary and appropriate       attribute of the power to legislate--indeed, was treated as       inhering in it. Thus there is ample warrant for thinking, as       we do, that the constitutional provisions which commit the       legislative function to the two houses are intended to       include this attribute to the end that the function may be       effectively exercised.'')

Without the power to compel compliance       with subpoenas and the concomitant right to impeach a       president for refusal to comply, the impeachment power would       be nullified.'')

Indeed, the former is necessary to the proper exercise of the       latter: according to the Supreme Court, the ability to compel       testimony is ``necessary to the effective functioning of       courts and legislatures . . . Thus, Congress's use of (and       need for vindication of) its subpoena power in this case is       no less legitimate or important than was the grand jury's in       United States v. Nixon. Both involve core functions of a co-      equal branch of the federal government, and for the reasons       identified in Nixon, the President may only be entitled to a       presumptive, rather than an absolute, privilege here. And it       is certainly the case that if the President is entitled only       to a presumptive privilege, his close advisors cannot hold       the superior card of absolute immunity.'')

Traditionally, this presentation involves a memorandum from       the head of the agency that received the congressional       request explaining the information sought by Congress, why       the information is privileged, and the efforts that the       agency has made to date to accommodate the congressional       request; a memorandum from the attorney general evaluating       the legal basis for a privilege assertion over the requested       information, including whether the qualified privilege might       be overcome in the balancing of       interests and needs; and the White House counsel's       recommendation to the president. Pending the president's       decision, the agency is directed to ask Congress to hold the       request in abeyance, and to explain that this is simply to       protect the president's ability to assert the privilege and       does not itself constitute a claim of privilege.'')

(These amendments included: subpoenas for       relevant documents held by the White House related to       meetings and calls between President Trump and the President       of Ukraine; subpoenas compelling the Secretary of State,       Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and       Secretary of Defense to produce documents and records related       to the July 25 phone call between President Trump and the       Ukrainian President and records related to the freezing of       assistance to Ukraine; and subpoenas for the testimony of       Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and Ambassador John       Bolton, both of whom have significant firsthand knowledge of       the events that are the subject of this impeachment trial.

(In response to the       report in the New York Times on January 26, 2020, that the       manuscript of a book by former National Security Adviser John       Bolton contends that President Trump directly tied the freeze       on security assistance for Ukraine to Ukraine agreeing to       conduct investigations into the 2016 campaign and Biden/      Burisma theories, defense counsel Alan Dershowitz argued that       ``if a President-any President-were to have done what `The       Times' reported about the content of the Bolton manuscript,       that would not constitute an impeachable offense. Let me       repeat it. Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true,       would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an       impeachable offense . . . You cannot turn conduct that is not       impeachable into impeachable conduct simply by using words       like `quid pro quo' '' and `personal benefit.' '')

(In response to President       Trump's statement to George Stephanopoulos that he would       consider taking information from a foreign government on one       of his political opponents, Ellen Weintraub, Chair, Federal       Election Commissioner, wrote, ``Let me make something 100%       clear to the American public and anyone running for public       office: It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or       receive anything of value from a foreign national in       connection with a U.S. election. This is not a novel concept.       Electoral intervention from foreign governments has been       considered unacceptable since the beginning of our nation.       Our Founding Fathers sounded the alarm about `foreign       interference, intrigue and influence.' They knew that when       foreign governments seek to influence American politics, it       is always to advance their own interests, not America's.'')
