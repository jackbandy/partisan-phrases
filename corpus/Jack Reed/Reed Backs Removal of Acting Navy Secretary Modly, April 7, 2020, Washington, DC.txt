Reed Backs Removal of Acting Navy Secretary Modly


Today, after U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced the resignation of Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), the Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, backed the move and said Mr. Modly had mishandled the situation concerning the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71), and the removal of its commanding officer, Captain Brett E. Crozier.

"Mr. Modly mishandled the situation and I concur with Secretary Esper's decision to accept the resignation.  It is my understanding that Acting Secretary Modly removed Captain Crozier against the advice of senior Navy uniformed leadership and without completion of a proper investigation.  Also troubling was the manner in which addressed the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt and made disparaging comments about their former Commander, Captain Crozier.  These actions were inappropriate for the leader of the U.S. Navy at any time, particularly in a crisis, and did a disservice to Captain Crozier, the sailors of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, and all Navy personnel.  The new leadership of the Navy must do better in leading and protecting sailors, Marines and their families in this unprecedented crisis," said Reed.

"I have already asked the Secretary of Defense and the Inspector General's office of the Department of Defense for a thorough review that includes an assessment of the actions of Navy leadership, both civilian and military, and what role, if any, the White House played in this matter.  Congress must continue pressing for answers to ensure the health and safety of our sailors and troops comes before political considerations," concluded Reed.
