Mr. BIGGS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Cathi  Herrod, who recently retired from the Center for Arizona Policy after  serving 20 years as president.

Cathi dedicated her life's work to promoting and defending the  sanctity of life, traditional marriage and families, and religious  freedom.

She joined CAP in 1997, shortly after its founding, as legislative  counsel. Upon retirement of CAP's founder, Len Munsil, in 2005, Cathi  assumed the role of president and has since been a force for good at  the Arizona Capitol.

Since CAP's founding, more than 200 pieces of CAP-supported  legislation have been passed by the Arizona Legislature, including many  that protect the unborn and pregnant mothers.

Cathi has received numerous awards and distinctions for her work. She  was recognized by Arizona newspapers as one of the 10 most influential  leaders at the Arizona Capitol. She received the Family Champion award  from Focus on the Family and received the William Wilberforce Award  from Students for Life of America.

Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the work of dedicated individuals like  Cathi who relentlessly strive to promote policies that protect the  dignity of every Arizonan. I wish Cathi well in her much-deserved  retirement.
