Increasing Medicaid Funding

Mr. BIGGS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, the original Medicaid program was  designed to help the disabled, pregnant women, seniors, and children.

Then there was this expansion that came along, and it is filled with  able-bodied adults of working age who could be working. That is the  fastest growing program in the United States today. They pay out about  $100 billion a year in lost payments.

The Republicans want to deal with that. How we deal with it is an  increase in funding over the next 10 years of 25 percent. We just heard  somebody say we are going to gut it. Only in Washington, D.C., would  someone say an increase in spending is a cut. That is the weirdness of  this place, but this is the reality. These are the facts right here.
