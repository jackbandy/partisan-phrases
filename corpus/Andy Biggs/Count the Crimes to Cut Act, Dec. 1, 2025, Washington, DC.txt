Count the Crimes to Cut Act

Mr. BIGGS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas  for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government has turned the criminal code into  a labyrinth, a maze so bloated and disorganized that not even the DOJ  can tell you how many Federal crimes exist.

That is why I rise in strong support of H.R. 2159, the Count the  Crimes to Cut Act, led by my friend, Chip Roy from Texas,  Representative McBath, who is the ranking member on our Subcommittee of  Crime and Federal Government Surveillance, and supported by Members of  both parties who understand that freedom collapses when the law becomes  unknowable.

This bill is co-led by staunch conservatives like Representative Roy  and myself and our colleagues, who occasionally think differently than  us, Mrs. McBath and Mr. Cohen. We disagree on a lot in this Chamber,  but we should all agree that Americans should know what conduct is  criminal before they are punished for it.

The Count the Crimes to Cut Act forces the DOJ to produce a complete  list of every Federal criminal statute with the specific legal  elements, the authorized penalties, and the number of prosecutions for  each offense over the last 15 years.

Right now, we literally cannot tell the American people how many  Federal crimes exist. I called the Congressional Research Service  several years ago because I was interested in this. They said we have  no idea.

Estimates range from 4,000 statutes to hundreds of thousands of  criminalized regulations, but no one actually knows because Washington  has never bothered to count them. This is the very definition of  overcriminalization: vague laws, hidden laws, duplicative laws, and  regulatory crimes that nobody could reasonably expect an ordinary  citizen to find or understand.

The Federal code has grown so bloated that a person can unknowingly  violate a regulation they have never heard of and the government can  still throw the book at them.

Even former Harvard University Professor Harvey Silverglate estimates  that the average American commits three felonies a day without even  knowing it.

Dr. Silverglate clearly wasn't referring to violent felonies like  murder or felonies like money laundering or fraud, but instead to those  vague, hidden, duplicative and sometimes downright silly laws.

I have other pending legislation; the End Endless Criminal Statutes  Act to repeal 10 unnecessary criminal offenses such as selling or  possessing colored oleomargarine or colored margarine unless they are  packaged and labeled or served in a triangular shape. That is far from  the only silly law still on the books.

It is illegal to use a falconry bird in a movie that isn't about  falconry, to sell runny ketchup, or to leave the country with too many  nickels in your pockets.

Here is the deal: We just have too many laws and too many crimes.  When the Federal Criminal Code becomes a weapon instead of a guide, it  is always the most vulnerable, the poor, the small business owners, the  persons who don't have a legal team on retainer who gets crushed first.

Overcriminalization is one of the most destructive features of the  modern Federal leviathan. We cannot restore liberty, shrink government,  or protect due process unless we first expose the scope of the problem  and that is what this bill attempts to do.

I am so pleased to be a sponsor, but I am proud to associate with my  cosponsors, Mr. Roy, Mrs. McBath, Mr. Cohen, and others.

This is very simple, Mr. Speaker: If you believe in liberty, you vote  ``yes'' on H.R. 2159. If you believe the government should be  accountable to the people, you vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2159. If you  believe that Americans deserve to know the laws that can put them  behind bars, you vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2159. It is bipartisan, common  sense, and long overdue.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Count the  Crimes to Cut Act.
