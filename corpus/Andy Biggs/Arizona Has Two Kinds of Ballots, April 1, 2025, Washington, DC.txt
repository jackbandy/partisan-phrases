Arizona Has Two Kinds of Ballots


Mr. BIGGS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you something. In  Arizona, we have two kinds of ballots. We are the only State that does,  and we are really unique in this way. It is a result of a Federal case.

You have State ballots, which require you to prove citizenship to  vote on, but not so on Federal ballots. That means to vote for Members  of Congress, U.S. Senators, and the President of the United States, you  do not have to show citizenship. You don't have to show identification.

The SAVE Act is required if we are going to have election integrity.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for that. It will make  the Federal law in Arizona correspond to the State law. That will help  Arizona's election integrity.
