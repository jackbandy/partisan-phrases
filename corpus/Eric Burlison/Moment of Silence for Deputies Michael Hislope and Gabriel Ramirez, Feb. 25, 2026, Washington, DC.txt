Mr. BURLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the lives of Deputy  Michael Hislope and Deputy Gabriel Ramirez of the Christian County  Sheriff's Office who yesterday were killed in the line of duty while  serving the people of southwest Missouri.

Deputy Ramirez was murdered during a traffic stop while doing what  law enforcement officers across this country do every day: protecting  the public and enforcing the law.

He was a United States Army veteran who continued his service at  home, serving nearly 1 year as a deputy.

What followed was a dangerous manhunt that stretched through the  night and ended near Reeds Spring where Deputy Hislope was killed while  helping bring the violence to an end.

Deputy Hislope was also a United States Army veteran and had served  his country as a deputy for more than 6 years.

Two other deputies were also shot, and countless officers placed  themselves in harm's way to protect others. Their courage and sacrifice  stand in stark contrast to the evil they confronted.

Today, we grieve for two families who have lost sons, husbands, and  brothers, and we honor the public servants who answered the call to  stand between danger and their neighbors.

Please join me in praying for their families, the injured officers,  and the entire law enforcement community as they carry this profound  loss on their hearts.

I ask for a moment of silence, Mr. Speaker.
