Healthcare Crisis


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697961/healthcare-crisis


Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, there are so many issues in our country  right now that are affecting our people, but one of the biggest  concerns is an urgent matter that on December 31 of this year, premiums  for people's health insurance are going to be skyrocketing because of  the expiration of the premium tax credits.

We have heard so much talk. We have heard so many petty partisan  messages, people attacking each other, but right now, we have to  actually do something about this issue.

In my district, if you are a family of four and make $130,000 a year,  right now under the premium tax credits you have to pay 8.5 percent of  your income for your health insurance. That is about $10,000 or $11,000  a year.

Those premiums are going to go up to $30,000 on January 1. People are  going to go broke. They are not going to buy health insurance. When  less people are on health insurance, everybody's health insurance rates  go up.

Right now, there are three discharge petitions in this House giving  people options as to how to address this, two of which are bipartisan,  negotiated ideas. There is one for a 1-year extension and another for a  2-year extension.

Mr. Speaker, we need the Speaker of the House, the majority leader,  and the President of the United States of America to engage in this  issue. Pick a way forward and solve this problem that is affecting so  many Americans.
