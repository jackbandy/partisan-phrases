Breaking the Gridlock Act

Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, everyone here knows that affordability and  the affordability of healthcare is the top concern of Americans today.  Failure to extend these tax credits will cause health insurance  premiums to skyrocket all across our land.

In my district, Mr. Speaker, if you utilize the premium tax credits,  a family of four making $130,000 has to pay 8\1/2\ percent of their  income for health insurance premiums, or about $10,000 or $11,000 a  year. If we refuse to act, their bill will go to $30,000 a year, or  $1,500 more per month. That is crazy. They won't even buy their  insurance. As a result, it will reduce the risk pool, which will cause  everyone's premiums in our country to go up.

That is why for months the Problem Solvers Caucus has been working  across the aisle, both here in the House and the Senate, to find  bipartisan solutions to this very real affordability crisis.

Mr. Speaker, let's deliver a huge victory for the American people.  Let's overcome the partisan toxicity of Washington, D.C. Let's get  Democrats and Republicans, Members of the House and the Senate, to work  together to serve the needs of the American people. I urge all of my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''
