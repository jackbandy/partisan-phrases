Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, I rise on behalf of the Massachusetts  Seventh Congressional District.

As the House prepares to vote on a truly horrifying Republican budget  resolution, one void of empathy or common sense, I am thinking of the  people in my district who stand to be harmed the most: families in  Mattapan who receive their healthcare through MassHealth, the Medicaid  program for Massachusetts; mothers in Chelsea, who rely on SNAP to feed  their babies; disabled veterans in Randolph who receive lifesaving care  and benefits through the VA; families in Roxbury who rely on Head Start  for childcare.

This Republican majority said they would spend the next 2 years  cutting costs for the middle class, but the only thing they are cutting  is trillions of dollars from lifesaving programs our communities depend  on to make ends meet.

Mr. Chair, this has never been about efficiency. Tell me how it is  efficient to make people across this country sicker, hungrier, poorer,  and more vulnerable. Tell me how it is efficient to buy more toy  rockets for Donald Trump's billionaire friends while parents can't  afford groceries. The cruelty is the point. What a callous shame and a  sham.

I urge my colleagues to stand with the people. Protect families and  reject this shameful budget resolution. In the words of a righteous  faith leader whose place of worship Donald Trump recently attended:  Have mercy.
