Trump's Attacks on Black History

Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in vigorous opposition to  occupant Trump's hostile attacks, hostile and insecure attacks on Black  history. Black history is American history.

Dictators try to shutter museums, censor history, and whitewash the  truth, but we know the truth. We hold these truths to be self-evident,  that centuries of bondage and enslavement brutalized Black bodies and  tore apart Black families, that Black women have been the mothers of  movements, that Black folks have endured redlining and pay disparities,  and yet, still, we rise.

Black brilliance exists in every corner of this Nation, from the  stage to the court to the classroom to the Halls of Congress. I want  every single person, certainly every single child who calls this Nation  home, to walk into our Smithsonian museums including our beautiful  Blacksonian and see our collective history, accurate history on full  display.

I want them to see themselves in our struggles and our triumphs. I  want them to be inspired by the lyrics of Etta and the speeches of  Malcolm, and the leadership of Fannie Lou.

It is by studying our history we learn how to overcome the systems of  oppression, the reckless whims of petulant men thirsty for power, and  the will of dictators. My Blackness is beautiful, and Black history is  American history.
