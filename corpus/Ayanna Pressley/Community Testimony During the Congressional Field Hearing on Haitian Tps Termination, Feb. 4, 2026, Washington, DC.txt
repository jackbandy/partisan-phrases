Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, as part of the Congressional Field Hearing  on Haitian TPS Termination held in the Massachusetts 7th Congressional  District, members of the community were invited to discuss the  importance of extending TPS for Haitian nationals. Therefore, I include  in the Record their testimonies:

Dear Honorable Senator Markey and Honorable Congresswoman       Pressley: In response to the slated termination of Temporary       Protected Status (``TPS'') for Haitian nationals on February       3, 2026, Rian Immigrant Center respectfully submits the       following remarks.

Rian Immigrant Center (``Rian'') is a 501(c)(3) non-profit       organization located in Boston, Massachusetts and serving       immigrant and refugee communities across the Commonwealth,       primarily through our Immigration Legal Services program.       Rian, formerly the Irish Immigration Center and the Irish       International Immigrant Center, was founded in 1989 by an       Irish nun, Sister Lena Deevy, and a group of volunteer       attorneys, to serve Boston's undocumented Irish community.       Over the years, Rian has transformed into a vibrant center       serving immigrants and refugees from over 125 countries       worldwide, and reflecting the rich diversity of the foreign-      born communities of Boston and throughout Massachusetts. In       fact, early on in our organizational history, our founder       Sister Lena understood the importance of building bridges       between Boston's immigrant communities to find common ground       and to forge mutual support; she understood that the success       of Boston's Irish was inextricably linked to the success of       all Boston's immigrant communities.

Currently and for the last several years, Rian serves       immigrants and refugees from Haiti as its single largest       client group. Twenty-three percent (519/2276 individuals) of       all clients served by Rian in 2025 were of Haitian origin.       Our clients include:

Haitians who have held TPS since the 2010 earthquake in       Haiti that triggered the original Department of State       designation, and who have held that status continuously for       the past 15 years, forging deep roots in our community. These       Haitian neighbors work legally, pay income, sales and other       tax, and pay into our Social Security system;

More newly-arrived Haitian families escaping recent and       ongoing waves of intolerable unrest in Haiti, seeking       peaceful lives and an opportunity to provide safety to their       children;

Haitians who were lawfully paroled into the United States       to seek asylum from a tremendously backlogged system, who       followed proper entry procedures only to now face termination       of their protected status;

Haitians with TPS in large family units including U.S.       citizen children who have never lived in Haiti and are       culturally American; and

Haitians with medical complexities receiving life-saving or       life-extending treatment in the Boston area, who would be       unable to receive comparable care if returned to Haiti.

TPS is a life-line for Rim's Haitian client base. It       provides protection from removal to a country indisputably in       the throes of unrest. It provides access to work       authorization, so that protected individuals can lawfully       work, support their families, pay taxes to the federal and       state government, and contribute to the economy. Most       importantly, it is a status authorized by Congress for       nationals of countries who cannot safely repatriate. Last       year, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Noem       announced that she was terminating Haitian TPS because       conditions in Haiti no longer supported an ongoing       designation. That decision was not based in any honest       interpretation of the facts; it is indisputable that Haitian       nationals cannot safely repatriate at this time. Rian       represents many Haitian-American U.S. citizens petitioning to       lawfully bring their spouses and minor children to the U.S.       through the established family reunification process. Many of       these families have been stuck in limbo and separated for       five or more years, as the U.S. embassy remains closed to       normal visa operations due to instability and dangerous       conditions. The evacuation of consular officers from the U.S.       embassy; the suspension of normal consular operations for       several years; reports of active gunfire between U.S. Marines       guarding the embassy and violent gang members; and Department       of State-issued travel warnings for Haiti all point to the       inaccurate, if not flagrantly deceptive nature of Secretary       Noem's TPS termination announcement. To send Haitian citizens       back to these actively unsafe conditions, while lying that       the conditions support their safe return, would be a       humanitarian travesty, one not rooted in reality and without       any productive purpose. TPS, established by Congress, exists       exactly to protect individuals from returning to such       conditions our Haitian community members fear returning to       today.

Rian urges Congress to advocate for an extension of TPS       based on the indisputable facts on the ground. A country       presumably following the rule of law cannot allow decisions       on TPS terminations to be made wholly without factual       support. Beyond this, we urge Congress to find a permanent       solution for Haitian TPS holders who are so clearly at the       whim of an anti-immigrant administration. Our Haitian       neighbors in Greater Boston are tax-paying, law-abiding and       productive community members, caring for our children and our       elderly, staffing our reputable hospitals, and raising the       next generation of U.S. citizen children ready to positively       contribute to our society. We lose nothing, and stand only to       gain, by allowing TPS holders a pathway to permanent status,       or at least ongoing protection while the emergency conditions       in Haiti exist, as Congress intended in establishing TPS in       the first place.            Respectfully submitted,                                                 Jacqueline Kelley,                                On behalf of Rian Immigrant Center.                                __________

To Whom It May Concern: My name is Ruthzee Louijeune, and I       am an At-Large City Councilor representing all of Boston,       Massachusetts. I submit this testimony, not only for myself,       but on behalf of the Haitian residents of Boston whose lives,       families, and livelihoods are directly threatened by the       termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Boston is       home to approximately 16,000 Haitian residents, making it the       2nd largest Haitian community per capita in the United       States. The decision to end TPS would be a devastating       disruption to the social and economic fabric of our city.

In recent weeks and months, my office has been inundated       with calls, emails, and walk-ins from constituents who are       afraid, confused, and desperate for guidance regarding TPS.       They are asking about legal resources, immigration attorneys,       emergency funds, and whether it is safe to continue going to       work. Many are afraid to leave their homes. Others are facing       the immediate loss of income because their work permits have       expired and they are legally barred from working, despite       having jobs and employers who need them.

One constituent told us, ``My main concern is that I don't       want to be dragged on the street and locked up. I am thinking       of leaving, but I can't go back to Haiti. Can you please help       me find another country to go to? I don't know if I will be       able to sell my home before the due dates. I don't know what       to do for my son. Please help me.''

Another constituent asked our office, ``Do you think I       should remove my money from the bank?''

These are only a few samples that showcase the widespread       fear, panic, and instability being experienced by families       who have spent years building safe and productive lives in       Boston. Ending TPS will result in the breaking apart of       families, including households where children are U.S.       citizens and parents are long-time residents and workers in       our city. Policies that force parents to choose between       deportation and leaving their children behind is an       unamerican value that we must vigorously fight against.

The termination of TPS also threatens Boston's economy as       they are our essential workers in healthcare, food service,       construction, childcare, transportation, and home health       care. As a result, we have begun to hear that employers       across the city are already experiencing related workforce       shortages.

TPS exists precisely for circumstances like Haiti's       political instability, violence, and brutality among other       economic and ecological disasters.

Our office continues to receive urgent calls from       constituents seeking referrals and emergency financial       assistance. The silver lining is that neighbors are stepping       in to help one another with assistance for rent, food, and       basic necessities, even while community organizations and       faith groups are stretched beyond capacity trying to respond       to this growing crisis.

Boston has long been a city that values immigrants and       recognizes their role in our shared future. Please find       compassion and empathy to ensure families are not forced into       the shadows, separated from their loved ones, or pushed into       harm's way by the termination of TPS. Everyone deserves       stability and the opportunity to build a safe life.

I sincerely urge the United States Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) to consider extending Temporary Protected       Status for Haitians to remain safe, employed, and united with       their families.            Sincerely,                                                 Ruthzee Louijeune,                                    Boston City Councilor At-Large.                                __________

My father was a proud Jewish American and serviceman who       fought in Okinawa. During the last years of his life, he was       bound to a wheelchair and unable to perform daily tasks       independently. The man who bathed him, dressed him, prepared       his food, pushed his wheelchair and drove him to appointments       was a skilled and compassionate person. Most of all, this man       respected and showed love for my dad. He lived an honest       life, worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week--and performed a       job that was desperately needed. This man who kept my father       alive was an immigrant with temporary status.

Removing temporary status from people who fled hardship,       seek a better life, and contribute to our families and       communities is both mean-spirited and illogical. What kind of       a nation are we? My father would be ashamed of this country       where some of his relatives found refuge before and after the       Holocaust. What kind of a nation are we if we do not to allow       those seeking safety or a better life to live among us and do       the work they choose, often jobs that our citizens aren't       choosing? Taking away TPS status makes no sense on either a       moral or practical level. It is hateful and contrary to the       country my father fought for and was so proud of.                                __________

To Sen. Ed Markey, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, and Whom It May       Concern: Haitian Temporary Protected Status is critical to       the safety and stability of families across Boston. At a time       when Haiti continues to face widespread violence, political       instability, and humanitarian crises, ending or weakening TPS       would place families in harm's way and destabilize our       neighborhoods.

In Boston, Haitian TPS holders are essential workers in our       healthcare system, schools, childcare centers, construction       sites, restaurants, and small businesses. They are parents of       Boston Public Schools students, renters and homeowners, and       longtime residents who contribute every day to       the strength of our city. Treating their status as temporary       ignores the reality of their lives and their deep roots here.

I stand with Boston's Haitian community, local advocates,       and faith leaders calling for an extension of Haitian TPS and       permanent protections.

Our city is stronger when families can live without fear       and we will continue to stand with immigrant communities who       call Boston home.            Respectfully,                                                       Julia Mejia,                                    Boston City Councilor At-Large.                                __________

My name is Maria Teresa Nagel, I am the Director of       Immigrant Affairs in the City of Somerville, MA, and I am       here in strong opposition to the termination of TPS for       Haitians.

Haitians have a long and proud history of commitment to the       United States, dating back to the Chasseurs--Haitian soldiers       who fought alongside U.S. forces during the Revolutionary       War. Since then, more than one million Haitians have made       this country their home. Today, over 80,000 Haitians live in       Massachusetts alone, where they play an outsized and       indispensable role in our healthcare and education systems.

They are our nurses, home health aides, and doctors. They       are our teachers, teachers' assistants, and family liaisons.       They care for our children, our elders, and our most       vulnerable neighbors. They are essential to our economy, our       communities, and the cultural fabric of this nation.

After the catastrophic earthquake in 2010--an event that       affected more than three million people and claimed over       200,000 lives--the United States granted Temporary Protected       Status to Haitians already living here. At the time, the       Secretary of Homeland Security described the disaster as one       of ``historic proportions'' and acknowledged that the       ``personal safety'' of Haitians would be endangered if they       were forced to return. Sixteen years later, Haiti continues       to endure extraordinary hardship. Corruption, devastating       hurricanes, political instability, and widespread civil       unrest have only deepened the crisis. The dangers that once       justified TPS have not disappeared, they have intensified.       Meanwhile, the lives of Haitian TPS holders have become       inseparable from our own. They have built families, careers,       and communities here. This is their home. Ending TPS for       Haiti would tear 330,000 people--our neighbors, coworkers,       parents, and caregivers--from the communities they sustain.       It would destabilize families, devastate local economies, and       severely weaken critical sectors like healthcare, retail, and       education that all of us rely on. And it would do so in       direct contradiction of the law, with full knowledge that the       extraordinary and unsafe conditions in Haiti persist.

No one, no one, will benefit from ending TPS for Haitians       this February. The consequences will be profound and far-      reaching, and the cost will be borne by all of us. Most of       all, it will mark a failure of our moral responsibility and       our legal obligations.

I urge the federal government to reconsider this       termination--for the safety of our neighbors, the stability       of our economy, and the values we claim as the greatest       nation on Earth.            Thank you.
