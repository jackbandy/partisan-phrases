Disapproving the Rule Submitted By the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Relating to ``Overdraft Lending: Very Large Financial Institutions''

Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Waters for her  leadership, under which we have advocated to create an economy that  works for all people, not just Elon Musk and wealthy billionaires.

That is why I oppose this measure to overturn the Consumer Financial  Protection--emphasis on ``Protection''--Bureau rule that caps overdraft  fees by banks at $5.

The work of CFPB has been cost-saving and life-changing, but this  resolution would undo that progress. Whether it is an elder whose  Social Security  check was delayed into her direct deposit, likely because of Trump's  mass firings, or the young college student who makes the innocent  mistake of confusing a savings and checking account, anyone can be  affected by unnecessary junk fees.

Let's be honest, it is our most vulnerable who will bear the brunt of  the harm. For the single parent who has to pay bills today with money  that is coming tomorrow, overdrafting may be their only option. The  exorbitant fees, sometimes $35 for every overdraft, would further push  them into debt.

It is a shame the Republicans are attacking poor people just to help  greedy bank CEOs get richer, the shame and the sham of it all.

I oppose this resolution and encourage everyone to stand with working  people who are struggling to make every single dollar stretch.

Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, they are struggling to make every dollar  stretch because of the harmful policies advanced by your dictator in  chief. Vote ``no.''
