Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025

Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in vigorous opposition to the  CLARITY Act. This bill gives a green light to self-enriching crypto  schemes where officials at the highest levels of power, including in  the White House, have generated hundreds of billions of dollars in  personal profit.

We need legislation that stops financial abuse, not encourages it,  especially during a time when the SEC has dropped enforcement actions  against major crypto firms and undermined investor safety.

Across our country, millions of working families are battling rising  costs, our elders are targeted by financial scams, and investors are  trying to recover from volatile markets. Republicans are ignoring all  of that to prioritize the crypto industry's wish list.

To be clear, the people deserve crypto legislation that is fair,  transparent, and accountable, not a bill that opens the floodgates to  conflicts of interest and weakens investor protections.

The CLARITY Act fails that test. Republicans need some clarity all  right: moral and legislative. I agree with Ranking Member Waters that  this is really the calamity act.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
