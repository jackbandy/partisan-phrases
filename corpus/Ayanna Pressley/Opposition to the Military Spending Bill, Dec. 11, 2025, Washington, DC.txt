Opposition to the Military Spending Bill

Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this year's  massive $900 billion military spending bill.

This legislation gives more money to the so-called Department of War  than to our Department of Education, Transportation, and Health and  Human Services combined.

Mr. Speaker, can you ask my Republican colleagues to get serious  about helping the American public? I know you seem to be judged by the  content of your character.

It is certainly poor character to be not supporting our military  servicemembers and their families. This mammoth bill does not support  them either.

It certainly is poor character to block healthcare coverage for IVF,  despite the fact that IVF is critical for helping Active-Duty personnel  grow their families.

It certainly is poor character to ban initiatives associated with  diversity, equity, and inclusion, even though these cuts will undermine  military readiness.

This mammoth bill expands the administration's power to attack  immigrants, including for our Haitian neighbors.

The few good things in this legislation do not outweigh the cruelty  and the harm that will undoubtedly come if it is signed into law. The  public does not support this bill and neither do I. That is why I am a  ``no'' vote.
