Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, this Republican administration claims to  care about babies and families, but I cannot hear the words they speak  because I see the things that they do.

The birth of every baby should be a joyful transition defined by  compassion and whatever healthcare is required for the baby and the  mother.

America's broken for-profit healthcare system denies far too many  this basic dignity, but Medicaid has been a lifeline.

Today, 42 percent of births in America are funded by Medicaid.  Republicans who claim to be pro-family are coming for Medicaid with a  sledgehammer.

What would this mean for families across America? It would mean even  worse maternal health outcomes, States rescinding policies that improve  access to reproductive care, and decimating access to prenatal care,  contraception, and cancer screenings.

This big, shameful, unconscionable bill is unacceptable, but it is  not inevitable.

I need just four Republicans, four people of conscience, to listen to  their constituents, to look into the eyes of pregnant mothers praying  for a safe delivery, and to show a shred of humanity and oppose this  horrific bill.

If my colleagues aren't here to fight for the people who sent them,  they should give up their damn seats.
