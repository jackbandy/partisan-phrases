Expert Testimony During the Congressional Field Hearing on Haitian Tps Termination


Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, as part of the Congressional Field Hearing  on Haitian TPS Termination held in the Massachusetts 7th Congressional  District, experts from the community were invited to discuss the  importance of extending TPS for Haitian nationals. Therefore, I include  in the Record their testimonies:  Testimony of Attorney Mirian Albert of Lawyers for Civil Rights to the

Congressional Field Hearing on the Termination of Haitian Temporary                              Protected Status

Lawyers for Civil Rights (``LCR'') advocates for       communities of color and immigrants through legal action,       education, and economic empowerment. On March 3, 2025, LCR       fIled a federal lawsuit to block the termination of Temporary       Protected Status (``TPS'') for Haitian and Venezuelan       immigrants. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of three       immigrant advocacy organizations--Haitians Americans United,       Inc. (``HAU''), Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts      (`` VAM''), UndocuBlack Network (``UBN'')--and four       individual TPS holders. Today, LCR urges Congress to act to       preserve humane immigration protections like TPS. Without       those protections, the consequences will be severe, forcing       families into crisis, undermining local economies, and       pushing communities into unnecessary instability.

TPS for Haiti was first designated in 2010, after a       catastrophic earthquake. Extensions continued over many years       in recognition of Haiti's ongoing instability and       humanitarian needs. The designation was most recently       extended through February 3, 2026, under a Biden-era       decision, reflecting the reality that the conditions       prompting the original designation have not meaningfully       improved. In February 2025, the Trump Administration       attempted to shorten that designation through a ``partial       vacatur,'' purporting to cut the TPS period by six months. A       federal court ruled the action unlawful and restored the       February 3, 2026 expiration date. Despite this ruling, in       late 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced       it would not renew Haiti's TPS designation beyond that date.

LCR strongly condemned this decision. Terminating TPS amid       Haiti's ongoing crisis--including widespread gang violence,       political instability, and economic collapse--ignores       conditions that even the U.S. State Department continues to       warn make travel unsafe. The consequences of this decision       are       not abstract or speculative; they are immediate and deeply       human. If allowed to proceed, the termination of Haitian TPS       on February 3, 2026 would impose immediate and serious harms.

First, TPS holders would lose protection from deportation       absent another lawful status resulting in the sudden       destruction of countless lives and the separation of       families. Many Haitian TPS recipients have lived in the       United States for over a decade, have U.S. citizen children,       contribute to the economy, own homes, and have built stable       lives rooted in their communities. Termination would suddenly       expose over 300,000 Haitian TPS holders to removal       proceedings, upending families and lives.

Second, work authorization tied to TPS would expire       creating a severe gap in the economy. Haitian TPS holders       comprise a large portion of essential work in healthcare,       education, and other critical sectors. The loss of their       labor would harm not only individual families, but also       employers, local economies, and public services that rely on       their contributions.

In light of these realities, LCR urges Congress to take the       following actions:

Pursue a Pathway to Permanent Residency for TPS Holders.       While politically challenging, abandoning long-term TPS       holders to indefInite legal limbo, or forcing them into       undocumented status, is neither humane nor rational       immigration policy.

Invest in U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services'       capacity, access, and fairness. Congress should fund and       mandate meaningful improvements at USCIS to reduce       adjudication backlogs, expand language access, and ensure TPS       holders can realistically pursue alternative forms of relief.

Increase Funding for Legal Services and Community-Based       Organizations. Congress should increase funding for legal       services providers and trusted community-based organizations       that assist TPS holders with transition planning,       applications for relief, and know-your-rights education.       Access to legal counsel is often the difference between       stability and removal.

Terminating Haitian TPS without a humane and legally sound       alternative compounds existing injustices and jeopardizes the       well-being of families and communities across the United       States. We must choose policies rooted in justice, grounded       in law, and reflective of this Nation's fundamental values.                                __________

To Whom it May Concern: This testimony is submitted       anonymously on behalf of a Massachusetts-based, community-      rooted mental health organization that primarily serves       Haitian individuals and families, many of whom hold TPS. To       protect the safety, dignity, and privacy of our clients,       staff and community partners, no identifying information is       included. Our mission has been to destigmatize and normatize       conversations around mental health within the Haitian       community, a community that has long been taught to endure       suffering in silence, to ``be strong,'' and to survive       without support. For many of our clients, seeking mental       health care represents a cultural and emotional rupture: the       first time they have allowed themselves to name fear, grief,       trauma, and exhaustion out loud. We have worked       intentionally to build trust with Haitian families, often       in their own language, often through community       relationships, and always with deep respect for history,       culture, and faith. Over time, we have watched individuals       begin to heal. Parents who survived political violence,       natural disasters, and forced migration finally started to       feel grounded. Families began to imagine stability.       Children began to feel safer because their caregivers felt       safer. The current administration's actions surrounding       TPS are now reopening wounds that never fully healed.

The possibility of TPS being taken away has had a       devastating emotional impact on our Haitian clients. Many are       survivors of profound trauma, political persecution, gang       violence, the 2010 earthquake, repeated displacement, and       systemic racism both abroad and in the United States. TPS has       been one of the few stabilizing forces in their lives. The       threat of its removal has triggered intense fear, panic,       despair, and retraumatization. We are seeing clients unravel       emotionally. Individuals who had made progress in therapy are       now regressing under the weight of uncertainty. Parents       express terror at the thought of losing work authorization       and the ability to provide for their children. Many fear       being forced to return to a country that remains unsafe and       unstable. Others carry the unbearable guilt of potentially       uprooting U.S.-born children or leaving them behind. For the       Haitian community, this fear is not hypothetical. Haiti's       ongoing political collapse, gang violence, kidnappings, and       humanitarian crisis are part of our clients' lived reality.       The idea of return is not a policy debate, it is a threat to       life, safety, and psychological survival.

If TPS is terminated, the emotional consequences will be       severe and long-lasting. It will undo years of trust-      building, reinforce stigma around seeking help, and send a       devastating message to Haitian communities that safety and       healing are conditional and disposable. The mental health       impact will reverberate through families, schools, churches,       and workplaces.

From our clinical and community perspective, ending TPS for       Haitians is not only destabilizing, it is inhumane. It       punishes resilience, undermines recovery, and disregards the       deep trauma history carried by this population.

We urge decision-makers to consider the profound emotional       harm TPS termination will cause to Haitian individuals,       families, and communities. Preserving TPS is essential to       protecting not only legal status, but mental health, dignity,       and human life.            Respectfully submitted,

My name is Rebecca Henry. I have been living in the United       States since February 2010, following the devastating       earthquake that killed so many people in Haiti. Before       leaving, I lived under constant fear and stress. Gangs       attempted to kidnap me multiple times, and I nearly lost my       life due to political violence and instability.

Coming to the United States was the best thing that could       have happened to me. I am a mother of two children--one born       in Haiti and one born here in the U.S. As soon as I was able,       I enrolled in school to learn English and began working to       support my family.

I am a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), and I care for my       patients with great joy, pride, and dedication. My patients       love me deeply, and every day they look forward to seeing me       and receiving my care. This work is not just a job--it is my       calling.

I have lived here peacefully, attending church,       participating in community activities, and raising my       children responsibly. Through hard work and sacrifice, I was       able to purchase a home and a car so I could care for my       family and fulfill my responsibilities.

Since this past summer, however, I have begun experiencing       severe anxiety and panic attacks. I am increasingly fearful       and reluctant to leave my home. I constantly worry about       losing my house and being unable to drive or work because my       driver's license and work permit are at risk of expiring.

I am overwhelmed by the thought of not being able to work.       I have many bills to pay and two children who depend on me. I       respectfully pray that those in authority will take our       situation into consideration.

I cannot return to Haiti, and I have no other place to go.       Please help!                                __________

My name is Xian Mao and I am a resident of Methuen,       Massachusetts, Ward 0 Precinct 3. I am a family medicine       physician who cares for many Haitian patients in Lawrence,       Massachusetts. I believe rescinding the TPS would lead to       significant barriers for my patients to accessing healthcare.       Many of my patients have withstood remarkable obstacles to       start their lives in this state, some without any support       from their family or community. My mission as a doctor is to       ensure all my patients receive the best care possible, and       added stress from their immigration status being rescinded       would lead to worse outcomes in an already vulnerable       population.
