End Qualified Immunity for Ice Agents

Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in defense of communities across  America terrorized by the dangerous, rogue, and violent actions  perpetrated by ICE agents.

Millions have seen the videos of ICE shooting and killing Renee Good,  a poet and mother who was unarmed and trying to drive away.

Following her tragic death at the hands of law enforcement,  Republicans rushed to deny the truth and smear the victim, a playbook  that has been employed frequently, especially against the Black  community.

Now, the White House is claiming ICE agents have immunity from  lawsuits. Enough.

That is why I will reintroduce my bill to end qualified immunity to  hold Federal agents accountable for breaking the law and killing our  neighbors.

This bill is for Renee Good and so many others, like Keith Porter, a  proud girl dad who was killed by an ICE agent in Los Angeles. This bill  is also for Nenko Gantchev from Chicago, who died in ICE custody after  living in the United States for 30 years.

Mr. Speaker, this bill is for every person in America, citizen or  not, to know that when ICE agents break the law, they should be held  accountable. For the families of these victims, Congress must end  qualified immunity.
