Senator Murray Secures Relief for Small Businesses, Accountability Measures for Corporations in Senate Coronavirus Relief Package


U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), the top Democrat on the Senate labor committee and a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, helped secure provisions in the Senate coronavirus relief package to help small business owners and companies in Washington state and across the country. The package includes more than $375 billion in small business grants, loans, and assistance.

"I've heard from so many business owners across Washington state who are struggling right now, so while it's not the bill I would have written by myself, I'm glad we were able to take some necessary steps in this stimulus to provide critical federal grants, loans and other support to help keep businesses afloat during these painful times--as well as to secure protections to prevent the largest corporations from using taxpayer dollars to buy back stocks or allow executives to line their own pockets with pay raises. This is far from the last step we'll need to take, so Congress should be prepared to do even more to support our nation's workers, including those who support people with disabilities, and other small businesses as we continue navigating this storm together. I'm going to keep fighting to ensure that federal funds are distributed in our communities in a fair and transparent manner."

On March 23, Senator Murray called Republicans back to the negotiating table after opposing an earlier version of the relief package, released without Democratic support, and fought to include important limits and protections on federal bailout funding, including limits on executive compensation, stock buybacks, and key accountability measures on how federal relief funds are distributed. Additionally, Senator Murray fought to secure the following federal investments to help bridge the gap for small businesses in Washington state and nationwide who are struggling due to the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic:
