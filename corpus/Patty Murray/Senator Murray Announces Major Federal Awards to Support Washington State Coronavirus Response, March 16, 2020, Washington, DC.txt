Senator Murray Announces Major Federal Awards to Support Washington State Coronavirus Response


Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the ranking member of the Senate health committee, announced the distribution of federal grants to Washington state to help ensure communities have the resources to prepare for, prevent and respond to the coronavirus pandemic.

"I am so grateful to our dedicated local and state public health officials who have been on the front lines of this pandemic, working tirelessly to save lives and keep as many people as possible safe and healthy--and I'm glad to see these critical federal resources finally arrive to support their vital work," said Senator Murray. "While these funds are urgently necessary, they are only the first of many steps we're going to need to combat this pandemic and support families, small businesses, and communities who are suffering. Know I am going to keep fighting with everything I have to make sure the federal government stays at the table and does its part to help Washington state through this crisis."

BACKGROUND

On March 6, the Senate passed an initial $7.8 billion emergency funding package, as well as a $500 million authorization to enhance telehealth services, in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Senator Murray, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, was instrumental in helping pass the legislation, which included funding for vaccine and therapeutic development, support for state and local governments' preparedness and response efforts, and the purchase of critical medical supplies to protect the health and safety of health care workers and families. Senator Murray fought to expedite the disbursement of immediate funding from the emergency supplemental package for Washington state totaling at least $11.48 million in federal awards from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which were received by state and local health departments on March 16. Additionally, Senator Murray previously secured $2.75 million for Washington state from CDC awards to support immediate assistance for response activities such as the purchase of lab equipment and supplies, infection control, and surge staffing, as well as to begin implementation of coronavirus surveillance systems to enhance testing and surveillance in the state; those funds were disbursed to the Washington state Department of Health on March 6.
