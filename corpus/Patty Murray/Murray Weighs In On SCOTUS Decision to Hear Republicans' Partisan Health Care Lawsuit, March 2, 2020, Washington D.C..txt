Murray Weighs In On SCOTUS Decision to Hear Republicans' Partisan Health Care Lawsuit


Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, released the following statement today following breaking news that the Supreme Court would hear Republicans' partisan health care lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care act.

"As people across the country are asking how to protect themselves and stay healthy, the Trump Administration is preparing to explain why it thinks the Supreme Court should take families' health care away. Let's be clear, taking away people's health care and making it higher cost and lower quality is not what people need their President to be working toward right now--not by a long shot," said Senator Murray. "As this partisan lawsuit moves forward, Democrats are going to continue holding Republicans accountable for working to upend the lives of families across the country and urging them to stop causing problems for families' health care and work with us to solve them instead."

If Republicans succeed in their lawsuit they would:

-          End protections for pre-existing conditions that 135 million patients rely on;

-          Kick young adults off their parents' insurance;

-          Remove protections against exorbitant health care costs like limits on patients' out-of-pocket costs, or the prohibition against companies placing annual and lifetime caps on benefits, even for people who get coverage through their jobs;

-          Take away essential health benefits that require insurance to cover emergency care, hospitalization, prescription drugs, maternity care, and more;

-          Strip health care away from tens of millions of people who got coverage through Medicaid expansion and the exchanges.
