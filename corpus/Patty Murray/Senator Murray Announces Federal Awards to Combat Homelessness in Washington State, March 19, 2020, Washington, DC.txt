Senator Murray Announces Federal Awards to Combat Homelessness in Washington State


U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awards totaling more than $3.6 million for cities and counties across Washington state. The federal investments come from the Continuum of Care (CoC) Program, which provides funding to nonprofit providers, as well as state and local governments, to quickly provide housing options for families and people facing homelessness. Of these awards, nearly $1 million will go to King County to combat youth homelessness through the CoC Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP). As the coronavirus continues to spread across Washington state forcing schools across the state to close, children and families facing housing insecurity are at increased risk of exposure and transmission, and often lack a safe place to self-isolate should the need arise.

"As we work to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus, it is increasingly important that Washingtonians navigating homelessness and housing insecurity--who may not have a place to self-isolate or practice social distancing--have access to safe housing options to help keep themselves and others healthy," Senator Murray said. "These federal awards come at a critical time for our state, particularly for homeless and housing insecure youth who need a safe place to sleep and learn, and I'll continue pushing for additional investments to strengthen housing options for our most vulnerable children and families.

In total, $3,645,985 was awarded to communities across Washington state through the CoC Program, including $988,622 in YHDP funding. The funding from these grant programs is distributed on a formula basis.
