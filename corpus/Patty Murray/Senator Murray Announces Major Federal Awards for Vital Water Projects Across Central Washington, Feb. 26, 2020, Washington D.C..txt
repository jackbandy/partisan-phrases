Senator Murray Announces Major Federal Awards for Vital Water Projects Across Central Washington


U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced three federal funding awards to help ensure continued access to safe, clean water for growers, children, and families in Central Washington. Senator Murray applauded significant federal investments for the Kittitas Reclamation District in Ellensburg, the City of Leavenworth, and the Quincy-Columbia Basin Irrigation District through the Bureau of Reclamation's WaterSMART Program, which aims to reduce water waste and assist local agricultural and conservation efforts.

"Vital conservation efforts like the WaterSMART program help ensure families and farms across our state have safe, clean water, and I'm so thrilled to see these strong federal investments flow to Central Washington," Senator Murray said. "While President Trump continues working to cut funding for this critical program and others like it, I'm going to keep fighting to make sure our state's growers and rural communities have the water they need to live and thrive."

Specifically, $975,000 was awarded to the Kittitas Reclamation District to install reinforced pipes in the Southern Branch Canal, $300,000 was awarded to the City of Leavenworth to upgrade 1,400 water meters, and $300,000 was awarded to the Quincy-Columbia Basin Irrigation District to line an earthen canal and decrease seepage loss. Collectively, the programs are projected to result in 1,387 acre-feet of annual water savings. Across the Western U.S., the WaterSMART program helps fund water conservation, reclamation, and efficiency projects, including infrastructure upgrades and construction.
