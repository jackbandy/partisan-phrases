Senator Murray Statement on Senate Passage of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act


Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, released the following statement on the Senate passage of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA).

 

Earlier today, Senator Murray offered a modified version of her PAID Leave Act as an amendment to FFCRA. Her amendment would ensure that all workers have paid leave and all small businesses are quickly reimbursed for that paid leave this year and next, given the bipartisan recognition that a federal paid leave requirement is a critical part of this response. While Senator Murray's amendment was blocked by Republicans, she will continue to push her PAID Leave Act in the next aid package to protect workers and small businesses. More information on the PAID Leave Act is available here.

 

"While I'm glad we finally passed this second round of relief, there continues to be an enormous amount we've got to do to ensure that workers, families, those on the front lines of our health care system, and small businesses have the resources and support to deal with the enormous challenge the coronavirus presents in Washington state and nationwide."

 

"In the next phase of our work I'm going to continue fighting to make sure we respond directly to the public health crisis we face, and to put the people and communities hurt most directly first in all our efforts. That includes ensuring every worker can get paid leave and every business gets immediately reimbursed for it."
