ROUNDUP: Senator Murray Expresses Frustration, Holds Officials Accountable Over Trump Administration's Coronavirus Response


This week, U.S. Senator Patty Murray has been working to hold the Trump Administration accountable for its chaotic and delayed response to the novel coronavirus and pushing to get state and local health departments in Washington state and across the country the resources they need as quickly as possible.

In a hearing with public health officials, she expressed the frustration she is hearing from people in her state unable to get tests, and she also sent letters to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia pressing them on how they are preparing for the spread of coronavirus and to Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar about how President Trump's health care sabotage undermines our preparedness for outbreaks like this. Senator Murray is also pushing for a robust emergency supplemental funding package that goes far beyond President Trump's totally inadequate request.
