Senator Murray Announces Major Federal Funding for Washington State Community Health Centers to Support Coronavirus Response


Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), the top Democrat on the Senate health committee, announced $36,581,775 in federal funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to support all of Washington state's 27 community health centers (CHCs). The funding will help CHCs meet staffing needs, test and treat patients with COVID-19, and supply health care workers with much needed personal protective equipment.

"As we all work to slow the spread of this virus, I'm going to keep fighting to ensure our community health centers and other front line providers across the state--including in our rural communities--have the resources they need to provide care for those who have fallen ill as well as help Washingtonians stay healthy," Senator Murray said

CHCs are integral to Washington state's efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic, providing testing, treatment, and telehealth services where they otherwise may not be available to some of Washington state's most vulnerable and underserved communities. Senator Murray fought to include funding for CHCs in the CARES Act, and was able to secure $1.32 billion in supplemental awards for CHCs across the country in the law. The Senator has long supported CHCs in Washington state and across the country, introducing a bipartisan bill last year to extend CHC funding for the next five years.
