As Washington State Tribes Work to Address Coronavirus, Senator Murray Successfully Secures Major Federal Investments in Tribal Health Care and Other Priorities


Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, helped secure more than $10 billion for tribal COVID-19 response expenses as part of the Senate's major coronavirus package. This money will go to a variety of programs, including the Urban Indian Health Program, and to individual tribes to address the spread of coronavirus in tribal communities.

"We know crises often adversely impact tribal and other historically-overlooked communities disproportionately, and this pandemic is no exception. That's why from the beginning I've fought to strengthen federal funding for our tribes to make sure they have the tools and resources necessary to address this pandemic, and am glad we were able to take significant steps in this legislation to increase funding for programs like the Urban Indian Health Program that have been so indispensable in the work to slow the spread of the virus in Indian Country. Know I will continue fighting for more resources to help our tribes weather this storm today and in the weeks and months to come."

Washington state tribes have been proactive in addressing coronavirus, but as the virus continues to spread, tribal communities, including health care services and other critical programs, could easily be overwhelmed. Senator Murray, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, helped secured the following provisions for Indian Country in the Senate package to help tribes deal with the outbreak of COVID-19:
