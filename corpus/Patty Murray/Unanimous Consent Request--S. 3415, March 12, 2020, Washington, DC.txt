Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3415


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is simple. We need people who are  sick to stay home if we have any hope of slowing the spread of this  virus, but, today, one in four private sector workers in our country  cannot stay home from work without losing a day's pay or potentially a  job. 

  We have got to fight this virus with everything we have--every single  one of us--and that means we have to have policies in place that help  people make the right choices for themselves, their families, and their  communities. 

  Our bill will give all employees 14 paid sick days immediately-- today, not next week, not the week after, today--in public health  emergencies like this one, in addition to allowing them to accrue 7,  meaning it would help workers and communities right now. 

  I urge Senate Republicans: Treat this like the public health crisis  it is. Allow parents, families, businesses, communities to have the  peace of mind to know that we are acting today and take this urgent  needed step. This is nothing short of a chance to save lives and buy  desperately needed time to fight this virus. Please don't waste it.  

   3415--this is a bill that will allow Americans to earn paid sick  time so they can address their own health needs and the health needs of  their families--that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration,  the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.
