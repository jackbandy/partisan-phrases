Murray Statement on Death of Qasem Soleimani in U.S. Airstrikes


Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) issued the following statement on U.S. confirmation that Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Qasem Soleimani was killed in U.S. airstrikes.

"I voted against going to war in Iraq because I felt the Administration was asking us to send our brave men and women into harm's way without clear plans or goals. Today, while I agree wholeheartedly that Qasem Soleimani was an enemy of the United States, I am gravely concerned this President's escalatory actions jeopardize American servicemembers, allies, and interests and could put us on a path to deeper, sustained engagement--once again without a strategy or clearly defined objectives, and this time without any attempt to seek Congressional approval.

"In decisions of war and safety our country must come first. Regardless of party, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle should now be demanding the President provide his legal justification for this action, commit to coming before Congress in advance of any further escalating steps, and explain how he will manage the consequences of his decision with the goal of protecting Americans, our allies, and our interests."
