Senator Murray Announces Federal Housing Funding From Coronavirus Relief Bill for Washington State Tribes


Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced millions in federal housing funding for Washington state tribes from the recently passed Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The awards, which total $12,322,245 for tribes across Washington state, will be distributed through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program. The IHBG program provides funding to tribes and tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs) to develop, maintain, and operate affordable housing, with a focus on providing housing and other resources for tribal families with low incomes.

"Crises like the coronavirus pandemic often disproportionately impact tribes and other overlooked communities, which is why I fought hard to make sure the CARES Act had strong investments to help tribes keep their members off the street while we work to slow the spread of the virus," Senator Murray said. "I'm going to stay focused on this, because there's much more work we need to do to make sure Indian Country has the necessary resources to address the coronavirus--including ensuring tribal members have access to a safe, secure home to help keep our communities safe and healthy during this public health emergency."

According to a 2017 report by HUD, more than 50% of tribal households in the Pacific Northwest qualify as low-income (less than 80% of median income). The report also details the extent to which households in tribal areas deal with physical housing deficiencies, such as heating or plumbing deficiencies, at a much higher rate than other U.S. households. These housing issues are only exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, as key tribal businesses are forced to close and unemployment continues to rise.

Senator Murray fought to include more than $10 billion in funding for tribes in the CARES Act, and has made clear that she will continue fighting for more funding to address the specific needs of tribal communities in Washington state, and to ensure that federal funds for tribes are promptly and properly distributed. In her role as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Murray has successfully fought for increased funding for the IHBG Program, which helps to combat housing issues specifically plaguing tribal communities--in particular, tribal families who are low-income. However, in his 2021 budget plan, President Trump again proposed cutting funding for this crucial program.
