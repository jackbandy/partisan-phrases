Murray Urges Republicans to Join Democrats in Matching COVID-19 Crisis With Bold Solutions in HEROES Act


U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), assistant Democratic leader and ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP) Committee, issued the following statement in support of the House HEROES Act and urged Republicans to join Democrats in enacting solutions that address the public health crisis and provide urgently needed relief to front line workers, families, and small businesses.

"This is a crisis unlike any we've seen in our lifetimes, and the only way our country can come back from this stronger is with solutions that help workers, families, and small businesses come back stronger. That's why ideas at least as big and bold as those in the HEROES Act are not only appropriate, but essential--and on many priorities, like the deepening child care crisis, it is already clear we'll need to do even more going forward.

"Republicans have a choice in the coming days: they can join Democrats and respond to the suffering in America today with policies that bring our people back stronger--or they can plug their ears, close their eyes, and act like nothing's wrong. I've got a message for them: families can't do that, and they'll remember who fought for them and who didn't."
