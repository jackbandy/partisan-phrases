Murray Opposes Partisan GOP Coronavirus Bill; Calls Republicans Back to Negotiating Table


Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, released the following statement on the inadequate, partisan Republican coronavirus response legislation.

"In the midst of an unprecedented national crisis, Republicans can't seriously expect us to tell people in our communities who are suffering that we shortchanged hospitals, students, workers, and small businesses but gave big corporations hundreds of billions of dollars in a secretive slush fund."

"I oppose this bill as it currently stands and am urging Republicans to return to the negotiating table so we can reach an agreement that does much more to support the workers, families, and communities on the front lines of this pandemic."
