DelBene, Murray Lead Washington Lawmakers in Push to Help Alcoa Workers


Led by Representative Suzan DelBene (WA-01) and Senator Patty Murray (WA), a group of Washington state lawmakers wrote to U.S. Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia in support of a Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) petition filed by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers for the more than 700 workers at Alcoa's Intalco plant in Ferndale. The TAA petition would provide the workers with the training and resources to regain employment. They were joined on the letter by Senator Maria Cantwell (WA) and Representative Rick Larsen (WA-02).

"The Intalco plant is one of the largest employers in Whatcom County and supports many indirect jobs in addition to the 700 workers at the facility itself. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that these workers receive the retraining and reemployment resources available through TAA certification. Such a certification will allow them to get back on their feet more quickly, support their families, and continue making critical contributions to their communities and our economy," the lawmakers wrote.

Following Alcoa's announced curtailment of the Intalco plant on April 22, the four lawmakers wrote to President Trump, urging him and his administration to prioritize resolving the issue of excess Chinese aluminum capacity, which has depressed prices in the global market and harmed American businesses and workers, specifically in Washington state. The lawmakers also sent a letter to the President and CEO of the Alcoa Corporation on May 6 urging the company to cooperate with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to find a solution to the forthcoming layoffs at Alcoa's Intalco facility in Ferndale, WA.
