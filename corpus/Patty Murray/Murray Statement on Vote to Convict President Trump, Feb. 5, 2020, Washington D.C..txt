Murray Statement on Vote to Convict President Trump


U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) issued the following statement today after voting "guilty" on both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

"I've said many times throughout this trial that each senator's decision to choose fairness or a cover-up, and country or party, is theirs alone to make and live with--and that this isn't just about this president, it's about every future president. I am now on the record, representing millions of people in my home state of Washington, in saying it is unacceptable for a president, now or ever, to ask a foreign country to interfere in our election for their own benefit. I want every American to know my strong feeling is that we, the people, elect our presidents, they owe their office to the American people, and Americans must be their priority. I am grateful to every senator who stood up for this fundamental American principle today."
