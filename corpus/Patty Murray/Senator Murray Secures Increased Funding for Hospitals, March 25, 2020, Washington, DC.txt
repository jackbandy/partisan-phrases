Senator Murray Secures Increased Funding for Hospitals, Protections for Workers, Accountability Measures, and Other Washington State Priorities in Senate Coronavirus Package, Stresses "More To Do"


Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a top Democratic appropriator and the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, issued the following statement on her vote in support of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, legislation to provide much-needed relief in response to COVID-19 in Washington state and across the U.S.

This weekend, Senator Murray called Republicans back to the negotiating table after opposing a version of the relief package, drafted without Democratic support, and secured stronger resources and support for hospitals, health care workers, and hard-hit communities in Washington state and nationwide.

"From the beginning of this crisis I've insisted that our response be focused on getting people on the front lines the support they need, like surge capacity in hospitals, more medical supplies and personal protective equipment for responders, and relief for workers and small businesses who've had the rug pulled out from under them. I'm glad Democrats pushed for and got much-needed changes that will do more to help Washington state hospitals, workers, small businesses, and hard-hit families and communities."

"I also want to be clear that this was not the bill I would have written on my own, and there's no question there is much more to do to fight this virus--especially when it comes to ensuring all workers have paid leave, cost isn't a barrier to treatment, and hard-hit states like ours get the resources we are demanding."

"I know how difficult this time is for people across our state and I want every worker, student, and family in Washington to know I am holding each of you in my heart, and that I will continue holding the Trump Administration accountable for implementing this law, and others related to the coronavirus response, with the urgency, consistency, and equity our state deserves."

"I am doing absolutely everything I can to make sure Washington state gets what we need from the other Washington, and I won't stop until we've recovered. There is a long road ahead, but we will get through this together."
