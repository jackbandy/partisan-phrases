Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator's amendment would  indiscriminately cut $16 billion from State and USAID, including  lifesaving assistance Secretary Rubio said he wants to maintain for the  purchase of food from American farmers, programs to counter the PRC  influence, and efforts to ensure American businesses are more  competitive overseas.

This amendment would cut funding for the USAID inspector general by  83 percent, making any waste, fraud, or abuse hard to uncover.

And it would gut global health programs like Trump, Rubio, and Musk  say they allegedly want to conserve. Not even House Republicans went  this far.

This amendment would undermine American workers, American businesses,  and our national security. I urge a ``no'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1266
