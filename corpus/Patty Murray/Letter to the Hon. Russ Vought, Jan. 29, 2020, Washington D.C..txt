Letter to the Hon. Russ Vought, Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget - Senator Murray Decries Proposed Closure of Seattle Federal Archive Building


Following news that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had accepted a recommendation from the Public Buildings Reform Board (PBRB) to close the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Federal Archives and Records Center in Seattle, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), released the following statement.

"For generations, local tribes, historians, archivists, researchers, and more have used the vital records at Seattle's Federal Archives and Records Center to help tell the story of the Pacific Northwest's heritage and history, and I am deeply disappointed by OMB's decision to approve the recommendation to close this important resource after a rushed and questionable process," Senator Murray said. "I will continue working with my colleagues in the Senate, as well as local partners, on next steps to ensure all perspectives across the spectrum are heard as this process moves forward, and I am committed to ensuring that the records stored in Seattle's federal archive remain accessible to local stakeholders to continue the critical work of making our history and culture accessible to families and communities statewide."

The Federal Archives and Records Center in Seattle houses records, both archival and in storage, from Washington state, Alaska, Oregon, and Idaho, as well as tribes throughout the Pacific Northwest, that are vital to agencies, universities, researchers, scientists, tribal members, and students. The facility is also open to the public during the week for archival research.

On Friday, Senator Murray sent a letter, along with most of the Washington state Congressional delegation and the Senators from Alaska, Oregon, and Idaho, expressing her concern over the fact that PBRB's recommendation to close the building was made without informing the necessary stakeholders and with little to no public input.
