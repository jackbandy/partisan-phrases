Directing the Removal of United States Armed Forces From Hostilities Within or Against Venezuela That Have Not Been Authorized By Congress--


Instead, the bill that the Senator from Louisiana is asking unanimous  consent for actually lets Donald Trump and Russ Vought decide whom they  want to pay during a shutdown, and that will allow them to stiff  everyone else. President Trump has said he will only pay the people he  wants to.

He literally said:

[W]e're going to take care of our people. There are some       people who really don't deserve to be taken care of, and       we'll take care of them in a different way.

This bill would actually let Trump do exactly that.

We should make sure all of our workers get paid, not just the workers  Trump likes. So the best way to do that is, of course, for Republicans  to sit down with us, as Democrats, and work out a solution to reopen  the government. If, instead, you do as the Senator from Louisiana  suggests here, then, at a minimum, it should cover all employees, and  that proposal is out on the table with Senator Van Hollen and Senator  Peters.
