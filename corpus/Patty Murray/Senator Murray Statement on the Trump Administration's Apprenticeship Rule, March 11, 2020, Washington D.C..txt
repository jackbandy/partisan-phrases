Senator Murray Statement on the Trump Administration's Apprenticeship Rule


Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), released the following statement on the Department of Labor's (DOL) newly released apprenticeship rule that will undermine the highly effective, bipartisan registered apprenticeship programs by creating a duplicative, unnecessary, and lower-quality "industry-recognized apprenticeship programs" (IRAPs), that do not provide crucial benefits and protections.

 

"Quality apprenticeship programs provide pathways to good paying jobs for workers across the country. This rule undermines Registered Apprenticeship Programs in favor of an untested system that that lacks sufficient accountability and crucial worker protections," Senator Murray. "I've opposed this rule from the beginning, and I'll keep fighting to ensure that all workers get the benefits and protections they deserve."

 

In August 2019, Senator Murray opposed the rule when it was first proposed and urged the DOL to reconsider. Additionally, in February and November 2019, Senator Murray pressed the Department of Labor about whether it was using funds appropriated by Congress for registered apprenticeships for IRAPs.
