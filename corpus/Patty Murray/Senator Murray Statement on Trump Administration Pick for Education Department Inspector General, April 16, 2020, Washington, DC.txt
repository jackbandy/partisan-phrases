Senator Murray Statement on Trump Administration Pick for Education Department Inspector General


U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), issued the following statement on the Trump Administration's announced intent to nominate Andrew de Mello to serve as Inspector General of the Department of Education.

 

"I'm extremely concerned about the Trump Administration's pick for the crucial role of Inspector General of the Department of Education. Andrew de Mello has hardly any experience conducting oversight and no background in education policy. As the coronavirus crisis continues, it's clear that educators, students and families across the country need qualified and capable individuals serving at the Department of Education."

 

"It's also crucial that oversight of the Department of Education be non-partisan and independent, so I will be looking closely at Mr. De Mello's background to determine if he can fit the bill."

 

This unqualified pick for the Inspector General at the Department of Education comes amid attacks from the Trump Administration on independent agency watchdogs. On April 7, Senator Murray slammed President Trump's tweet calling the report from the Inspectors General of the Department of Health and Human Services about hospital shortages "fake." Senator Murray also expressed deep concern about the Trump Administration's removal of Inspector General Glenn Fine from the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.
