CORONAVIRUS: Murray Secures New $100 Billion Program to Provide Surge Funding for Hospitals


Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), the top Democrat on the Senate Labor, Health, and Human Services (LHHS) Appropriations Subcommittee, released the following statement regarding the new $100 billion funding program for hospitals and billions for other investments in medical equipment and preparedness in the new bipartisan coronavirus response package which passed the Senate.

"We have to fight the virus that is at the root of all the harm we are seeing--not just the economic symptoms. That's why I fought to make sure this bill included surge funding for hospitals and medical equipment, and why I'm going to keep fighting for more funding. Health care workers on the frontlines have been clear--they need resources, infrastructure, and serious reinforcements and they need them yesterday. I'm working to get this bipartisan bill signed into law, to hold this Administration accountable to quickly getting this funding to the places that need it most, and to make sure Congress continues to build off this bill with additional resources for our states and communities."
