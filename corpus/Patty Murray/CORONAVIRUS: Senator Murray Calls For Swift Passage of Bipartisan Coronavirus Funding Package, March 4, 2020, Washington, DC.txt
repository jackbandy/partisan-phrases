CORONAVIRUS: Senator Murray Calls For Swift Passage of Bipartisan Coronavirus Funding Package


Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), the top Democrat on the Senate Labor, Health, and Human Services (LHHS) Appropriations Subcommittee, released the following statement in response to the announcement of a bipartisan emergency supplemental funding agreement to respond to the novel coronavirus.

"State and local health officials working to keep families in Washington state and across the country safe have already been waiting too long for support--we can't let them wait one second longer. We need to get these emergency resources out to communities yesterday.

"This robust, bipartisan agreement goes far above the President's totally inadequate request to actually meet the needs we are hearing from our states and will help ensure tests and vaccines are available to everyone who needs them.

"I'm going to continue working to get this to the President's desk as quickly as possible and pressing to make sure we are listening to experts, providing needed resources, and doing everything in our power to keep families safe in the months ahead."
