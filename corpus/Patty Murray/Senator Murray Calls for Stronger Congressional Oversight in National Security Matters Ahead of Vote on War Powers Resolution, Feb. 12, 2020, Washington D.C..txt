Senator Murray Calls for Stronger Congressional Oversight in National Security Matters Ahead of Vote on War Powers Resolution


Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) urged her colleagues to join her in supporting Senator Tim Kaine's (D-VA) war powers resolution that would require the president to consult Congress before taking additional action that could embroil the U.S. in another foreign conflict. The resolution, as well as Senator Murray's floor speech, come following President Trump's recent escalation of tensions with Iran, including taking unilateral military action to kill Iran's Qasem Soleimani, which prompted an Iranian missile attack on U.S. troops deployed in Iraq. The attack led to more than 100 U.S. servicemembers being diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). Senator Murray called on her colleagues to support the bipartisan legislation, which is expected to be brought up for a vote on Thursday.

The daughter of a World War II veteran and Purple Heart recipient, Senator Murray is a cosponsor of the war powers resolution, and voted against the 2002 authorization of military force that President Trump has used to justify his actions in the Middle-East and that the House of Representatives finally repealed two weeks ago.
