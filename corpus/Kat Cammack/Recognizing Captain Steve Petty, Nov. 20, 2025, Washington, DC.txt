Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor  Captain Steve Petty, a United States Army veteran, who was inducted  into the Florida Veterans Hall of Fame on November 5, 2025, for his  outstanding service, leadership, and unwavering commitment to the  health and dignity of his fellow veterans.

Captain Petty has dedicated his post-service life to ensuring that  those who served our Nation receive the care, respect, and honors they  have earned. As Director of the Veterans Resource Center in Ocala,  Florida, he has led groundbreaking efforts to provide free Galleri  blood testing for veterans exposed to carcinogens such as Agent Orange  and burn pits--conditions that have claimed far too many lives long  after the battles ended. Through his leadership, veterans who served  ``boots on the ground'' in the Vietnam War, Gulf War, and the Global  War on Terrorism can now access this $950 cancer screening at no cost,  right in their own community. This lifesaving initiative--made possible  through partnerships with the Marion County Hospital District and the  Marion County Community Development Block Grant--stands as a model of  community collaboration, compassion, and unwavering commitment to those  who have borne the battle.

Beyond his work in advancing preventive care, Captain Petty has also  been instrumental in ensuring that every Marion County veteran interred  at the Bushnell National Cemetery receives full military honors--a  solemn and sacred recognition of their service to our Nation. Captain  Petty's dedication exemplifies the very best of the veteran community:  leadership through service, compassion through action, and a steadfast  refusal to leave any brother or sister behind. His induction into the  Florida Veterans Hall of Fame is not only well-deserved--it stands as a  testament to what one individual can accomplish when driven by love of  country and devotion to those who have borne the battle.

On behalf of Florida's 3rd Congressional District, I offer my deepest  congratulations to Captain Steve Petty, his wife Joan, and all those at  the Veterans Resource Center who continue to serve those who served us.
