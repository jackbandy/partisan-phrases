Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, today we recognize and cerebrate the  legacy of a group of individuals whose passion for the game of baseball  helped lay the foundation for college athletics at Santa Fe College in  Gainesville, Florida.

In the 1970-71 academic year, at what was then known as Santa Fe  Junior College (SFJC), a group of players formed a baseball club--one  of the earliest steps, along with other club sports, that would  eventually lead to the college becoming a recognized National Junior  College Athletics Association (NJCAA) member in 1973. They were known  as the ``Gainesville Nine.''

The baseball club, which predates the Northwest Campus, the largest  of Santa Fe's seven locations across Alachua and Bradford counties,  played other club and college teams from across the North Florida  region. The bonds formed among the players showed that athletic  participation and physical activity not only enrich the campus  experience, but also foster a sense of perseverance and belonging that  support a college-going culture.

Santa Fe College's Athletic programs have since grown in stature both  regionally and nationally. The Northwest Campus gymnasium was built in  the late 1970s and the baseball and softball fields were added in the  early 1980s. Over the college's illustrious history, multiple NJCAA  sports were offered including track, cross country, tennis, and slow  pitch softball. Currently, the college offers five sanctioned  intercollegiate teams in volleyball, men's and women's basketball,  softball, and baseball.

Today, we honor the legacy of the 1970-71 SFJC club baseball team,  the ``Gainesville Nine'' and celebrate their place in the rich history  of Santa Fe College and its athletic programs.
