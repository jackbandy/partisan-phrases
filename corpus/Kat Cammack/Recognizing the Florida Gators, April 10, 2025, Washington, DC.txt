Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2025 men's  basketball NCAA national champions, the Florida Gators.

On Monday night, the Gators defeated the University of Houston in the  national championship game to become the three-time national champions,  winning the first title since the 2006-2007 season.

Led by Coach Todd Golden, the Gators were one of four tournament one- seeds, advancing through the rounds of 64 and 32 before dancing their  way through the Sweet 16, Elite Eight, and Final Four.

After winning the title this week, the Gators ended the season with a  36-4 record making Gainesville, a/k/a Titletown, incredibly proud.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Coach Golden, the entire team, and, of  course, the Gator nation. These guys are absolutely incredible.

As always, it is so great and sweet to be a Florida Gator.

Go Gators.
