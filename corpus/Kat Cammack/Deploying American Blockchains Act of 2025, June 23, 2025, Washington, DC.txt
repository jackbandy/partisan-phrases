Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2025


Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his steadfast  support, and I also thank the ranking member for his support.

I rise today in support of H.R. 1664, the Deploying American  Blockchains Act of 2025, bipartisan legislation that I am proud to lead  alongside my colleague Representative Darren Soto.

This bill is about far more than emerging technology. It is about  securing America's future, economically, strategically, and  technologically, in an increasingly digital world.

Blockchain technology is not a passing trend. It is a foundational  innovation that is reshaping how we think about security, identity,  data integrity, and commerce. From supply chains and finance to  healthcare and identity management, blockchain is transforming the way  our systems function.

Mr. Speaker, we are at a crossroads. While American entrepreneurs and  technologists are ready to lead, they are operating in an environment  filled with uncertainty. Too many innovators in this space face unclear  rules, inconsistent Federal policies, and outdated frameworks that push  investment and opportunities overseas. Meanwhile, nations like China  are investing heavily in blockchain infrastructure and making it clear  that their intent is to control the digital rails of the future.

We cannot afford to fall behind. American values of freedom,  transparency, and accountability must guide the development of the next  generation of digital infrastructure. That is what this bill ensures.

The Deploying American Blockchains Act takes a strategic, thoughtful  approach by directing the Commerce Department to lead the Federal  Government's blockchain effort. The Department will advise the  President, establish a Blockchain Deployment Program, and ensure that  the United States remains competitive in the development and  application of this critical technology.

Importantly, this bill affirms that blockchain is not just a  buzzword. It is the backbone of next-generation innovations in areas  like supply chain security, smart contracts, digital identity, and  fraud prevention. These applications aren't just theoretical. They are  being deployed right now across sectors of the entire American economy.  If we fail to lead, others will step in to define the rules of the  road.

This bill sends a powerful message to our allies and adversaries  alike: America intends to lead. We will lead. We will build, not just  consume. We intend to shape the global standards for digital trust and  transparency, and we will not allow authoritarian regimes to do so in  our absence.

This bill is about leadership. It is about economic opportunity, and  it is about protecting our American interests and ensuring that our  technological edge continues to serve the people, our values, and our  future.

I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in  supporting this commonsense legislation. Together, we can keep America  at the forefront of innovation and ensure that our digital future is  one defined by liberty, accountability, and American leadership.
