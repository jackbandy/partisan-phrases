Recognizing Alfred Thomas Lewerenz


Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the  life and legacy of Alfred Thomas Lewerenz of Rainbow Springs, Florida,  who passed away on September 16, 2025, at the age of 89.

Mr. Lewerenz lived a life marked by service, leadership, and deep  devotion to his family and community. In 1952, he enlisted in the  Florida Army National Guard, beginning a distinguished 33-year military  career that saw him rise from Private to Lieutenant Colonel. As  Battalion Commander of the 53rd Infantry Brigade in Coral Gables, he  was instrumental in maintaining communication lines and coordinating  operations during natural disasters and civil security efforts. His  integrity and dedication left a lasting impression on all who served  alongside him.

Mr. Lewerenz's commitment to excellence extended well beyond his  military service. A graduate of Lindsey Hopkins Vocational School, the  U.S. Army Signal School, and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff  College, he combined technical skill with a lifelong love of learning.  His passion for electronics led to a successful career in broadcasting,  where he worked with WTVJ in Miami, co-founded Omni Video, and later  served as Engineering Manager at Telemundo. He also shared his  expertise as a Technical Advisor for the Broward County School Board,  mentoring the next generation of media professionals.

Outside of his professional achievements, Mr. Lewerenz was known for  his generosity, energy, and love of life. A devoted husband, father,  and grandfather, he found joy in hosting family gatherings, camping  trips, and community events. After retiring to Rainbow Springs, he  cherished time spent golfing, playing pool, and attending Meadowbrook  Church with his beloved wife Marilyn.

Mr. Lewerenz is survived by his wife of 56 years, Marilyn; his  children Lorraine Berg, Stephanie Hanks, Jennifer Brant, and Stephen  Lewerenz; nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. He will be  remembered as a patriot, mentor, and friend whose legacy of service,  faith, and love continues to inspire those who knew him.

Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Alfred Thomas Lewerenz for  his lifetime of service to Florida and to our Nation.
