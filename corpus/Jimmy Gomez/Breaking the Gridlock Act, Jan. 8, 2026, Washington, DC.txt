Breaking the Gridlock Act

Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, it is about damned time that this bill is  actually going to get a vote. Here is why. The Republicans in the  summer passed their One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which I am glad they  are not trying to rebrand anymore. It cut Medicaid by almost $1  trillion. It took away food stamps. Then they refused to extend the ACA  subsidies that would help ACA tax credits, that would help people in  their own States.

That is what the Democrat majority next year is going to do. We will  continue fighting for our own people throughout the country. It doesn't  matter if a constituent is in a red State or a blue State, if someone  is hurting because of the Republican majority this year. Donald Trump  has taken away healthcare. He has taken away food stamps. He has taken  away opportunities. We are going to make sure that we reverse all that.

The first step is these ACA tax credits because it is going to help  working families. The party in the majority now said they were going to  lower the cost of living, but they failed. Now we are going to step up.
