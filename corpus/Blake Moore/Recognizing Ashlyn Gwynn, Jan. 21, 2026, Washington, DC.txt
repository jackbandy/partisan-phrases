Recognizing Ashlyn Gwynn


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699245/recognizing-ashlyn-gwynn


Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  constituent Ashlyn Gwynn, who was recently involved in a near-death car  accident.

Ashlyn was recruited to play soccer at Cal State Fullerton. This past  September, on her way to another sporting event, she and her teammate  Lauren were struck by a truck. Both were transported to the hospital,  but Lauren tragically passed away after 6 weeks of intensive care. Her  family's words were: ``Lauren fell asleep in the Lord.'' Lauren's  legacy of goodness and positivity will always be remembered.

After Ashlyn stabilized, doctors let her family know that there was a  strong possibility that she may never regain consciousness. If she ever  were to, it was possible that she would never walk or talk again.

Thankfully, Ashlyn has made significant signs of improvement. She was  transferred to a step-down rehabilitation unit, and through the  generosity of a close friend of her father, she has been transported  back to Utah, where she continues to receive physical and speech  therapy and close care from her parents.

I don't know Ashlyn, but I know her parents, and Matt and Shelly  Gwynn are the best people I have ever known. I am so fortunate to have  gotten to know them in this role. He is a police chief back home as  well as a State legislator, and they are giving her the best possible  chance of success.

I wish Ashlyn the best.
