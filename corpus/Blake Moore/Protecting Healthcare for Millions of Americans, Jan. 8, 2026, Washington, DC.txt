Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, sincere appreciation to the  Congresswoman. I thank her very much. That is a great way to honor  Doug.

Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, to close, I again thank the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Rivas) for yielding a few more minutes  to finish out these thoughts in Doug's memory.

Mr. Speaker, I will wanted to give a quick closing message to his  wife, Jill, and his four children: Kyle, Allison, Sophia, and Natalie.

I get an hour every week to do these floor messages. I am lucky to  get five Members to come. I try to fill up 20 minutes, 15 of which your  dad would actually take. He would go on and on. I would try to get him  to wrap up so I could go to dinner. He was always there for me.

Tonight, we ran over time with the amount of people who wanted to  come and take time out of their very busy schedules to come and share a  brief message. They sat for an hour to spend 60 seconds to reflect on  your dad and your husband.

I hope you can take from that some sense of appreciation and  connection that we all have with your dad and what an amazing man he  is.
