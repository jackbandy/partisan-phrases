Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026


Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chair, Representative Moolenaar's amendment No. 26,  entitled the SAFE Research Act, would enact excessive prohibitions for  research awards that would stymie American innovation. In particular,  the amendment would introduce a government-wide prohibition to give  awards to individuals if they, or a research collaborator, have been  affiliated with a hostile foreign entity at any time within five years  of applying for the award. The definitions of who is included a  ``hostile foreign entity'' is very far reaching and includes twelve  separate entity lists as well as any entity performing academic,  scientific, or technical collaboration perceived to contribute to  nefarious activity.

For an agency to implement this prohibition, they would have to  analyze a personal history of every awardee, along with every research  collaborator (defined by joint research, coauthored publications,  collaboration on awards, and formal mentor relationships) that awardee  has had in the past five years. Furthermore, the amendment restricts  post-award activity, prohibiting covered individuals from sharing  ``expertise'' with ``hostile foreign entities,'' or those affiliated  with them, for five years. This is vague, onerous, and impracticable.  Simply from an implementation standpoint, it is highly difficult for  any research agency, nonetheless one that has had its staff gutted, to  properly carry out these proposed policies.
