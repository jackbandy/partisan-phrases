Recognizing Life and Contributions of Alcario ``al'' Castellano


Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Liccardo for yielding.

I first met Al and Carmen in the late 1970s. When I was elected to  the community college board, Carmen was the secretary for the president  of City College, and Al was a hardworking guy. What really stood out  was the two of them constantly volunteering their time for the  community through the GI Forum and the scholarship programs.

I am not a fan of the California Lottery, but it was great to see  them win because what they did with their newfound wealth was in  keeping with their  commitment to the community. They made sure that their windfall was  distributed to nonprofits and to the community. They lifted everyone  up.

Al and Carmen won the lottery in many ways. They created a wonderful  family. Their children, now adults, have the same commitment to public  service that they had.

We will miss Al, just as we miss Carmen. I am so grateful to my  colleague, Mr. Liccardo, for organizing this tribute here on the floor  today.

Al and Carmen left a tremendous mark for good in our community. I  will miss Al tremendously.
