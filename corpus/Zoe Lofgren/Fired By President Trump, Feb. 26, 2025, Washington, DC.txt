Fired By President Trump


Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the story of a Federal  scientist, in their own words, who was fired by President Trump and  Elon Musk.

I was a Laboratory Leadership Service, LLS, fellow. We are       a group of 24 Ph.D. scientists in the LLS program at the CDC.       Almost all of the fellows in our program were terminated. LLS       fellows have been instrumental in the past by responding to       combat public health outbreaks like Ebola. Likewise, my       current fellows and I have helped protect the United States       from new and emerging infections within the past year. This       has directly affected our outbreak response work.

Really? We are firing the people who keep Ebola from the country?

These senseless firings have to stop. If you were fired from a  Federal science agency, if your cutting-edge science research was  destroyed and cut, we want to hear your story. You can share it at the  website for the House Science Committee Democrats.
