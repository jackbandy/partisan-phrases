Senator Markey Leads Call to Preserve First Responders' Access to Emergency Spectrum in Next Coronavirus Economic Relief Package


Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and seven of his colleagues today urged Senate leadership to include language that would preserve first responders' access to T-band spectrum (470--512 MHz) in upcoming coronavirus economic relief legislation. Senator Markey previously introduced the Don't Break Up the T-Band Act, which allows police officers, firefighters, and other emergency personnel in eleven metropolitan areas across the county to continue to communicate with each other using T-Band spectrum.

 

The Don't Break Up the T-Band Act repeals a provision of the 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act, which directed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to auction off this band of spectrum by 2021. Police and fire fighters in highly-populated metropolitan areas in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere use critical T-Band spectrum for emergency public safety communication. Agencies across the country have invested millions of local, state, and federal dollars in the T-Band networks, which offer the reliable coverage and regional interoperability that first responders require for mission critical voice communications.

 

"At a time when first responders already face enormous pressure and economic strain to address the pandemic, the last thing we should do is saddle them with millions of dollars in costs to needlessly alter their critical communications systems," write the Senators in their letter to Senate and Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee leadership.
