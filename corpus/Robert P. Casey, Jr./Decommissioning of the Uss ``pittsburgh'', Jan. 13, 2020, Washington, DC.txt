BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize the  service of the brave veterans and servicemembers who have served on the  USS Pittsburgh (SSN-720), one of 62 nuclear-powered, fast-attack, Los  Angeles-class submarines that have formed the backbone of the U.S.  Navy's submarine force. This month the USS Pittsburgh (SSN-720) will  complete the decommissioning process in Bremerton, WA. 

  The USS Pittsburgh first launched in 1984 and was commissioned the  following year. In its 35 years of exemplary service, the USS  Pittsburgh (SSN-720) patrolled American waters, offered logistical  support to servicemembers around the world, and took part in vital  missions launching strikes into Iraq during Operation Desert Storm in  1991 and in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2002. 

  The USS Pittsburgh (SSN-720) completed its final Active-Duty patrol  on February 25, 2019, when it arrived at its home port at New London,  CT, Naval Base. From there, the USS Pittsburgh (SSN-720) made its final  sea journey in a rare Arctic transit, to Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton.  It was the first and thus far only submarine of its class to make such  a journey. 

  The USS Pittsburgh (SSN-720) is the fourth U.S. Navy vessel named for  the great city of Pittsburgh whose steel mills helped forge America's  industrial success and now serves as a center of medical innovation and  scientific advancement. The USS Pittsburgh (SSN-720), like its namesake  city, represents the best of American ingenuity, duty and excellence. I  am proud to represent Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  in the U.S. Senate, and I thank the veterans and Active-Duty  servicemembers who have served aboard the USS Pittsburgh (SSN-720) over  the last four decades.
