Casey Releases COVID-19 Funding Breakdown for PA Airports


Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement to announce that 63 Pennsylvania airports will receive a combined total of more than $239 million in new funding from the Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a result of the CARES Act, the latest coronavirus relief legislation:

"Pennsylvania's airports provide an essential service to travelers and stimulate our local economies. With a steep decline in travel and revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our airports need help to continue operations and save employees' jobs. I was proud to advocate for our Commonwealth's airports to receive funding from the CARES Act and I am pleased that the FAA plans to implement a streamlined grant process to expedite this funding for critical airport needs. I will continue to work to ensure that our workers and our airports receive the resources they need to manage through this pandemic."
