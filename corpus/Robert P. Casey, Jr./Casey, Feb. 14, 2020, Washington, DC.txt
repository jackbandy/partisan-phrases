Casey, Colleagues Continue Push to Provide Resources for Victims of Gun Violence


To commemorate the second National Gun Violence Survivors Week, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) and his Senate colleagues renewed their push to help create a support network for victims of gun violence, including survivors and their families, friends, classmates and coworkers, through federal legislation. While existing programs and benefits at the federal, state and local levels may help victims address medical, legal, financial and other needs, these opportunities can be difficult to find and navigate. The Resources for Victims of Gun Violence Act seeks to address these challenges by establishing an interagency Advisory Council to gather and disseminate resources and information for victims of gun violence.

"Victims of gun violence and their loved ones should not be left to cope with their trauma alone," said Senator Casey. "In addition to pushing for common-sense gun safety laws, we must provide support and resources to survivors and their families, friends and caregivers. With about 100 individuals being killed by guns daily in the United States, we must do more to alleviate some of the burden that millions of affected Americans carry each day by offering life-long support in their recovery. I am thankful to my colleagues for joining with me in this critically important effort."
