Impeachment


   Introduction  

       Throughout this impeachment trial, I have often thought of       an inscription above the front door of the Finance Building       in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania from the 1930s: ``All public       service is a trust, given in faith and accepted in honor.''  

       This inscription helped me frame my own understanding of       the evidence offered during this trial because I believe that       President Trump and every public official in America must       earn that trust every day. That sacred trust is given to us       ``in faith'' by virtue of our election. The question for the       President--and every official--is: Will we accept that       ``trust'' by our honorable conduct? The trust set forth in       the inscription is an echo of Alexander Hamilton's words in       Federalist No. 65, where he articulated the standard for       impeachment as ``offenses which proceed from the misconduct       of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or       violation of some public trust.'' \1\ 

       Much time has been devoted to why and how we got here. Let       us make no mistake about this--we are here because of the       President's conduct. He solicited the interference of a       foreign government in our next election and demanded that       same government announce an investigation of his political       opponent, as well as an investigation into a debunked       conspiracy theory about the last presidential election. 

       President Trump has exhibited an unmistakable pattern of       behavior that indicates a predisposition toward autocratic       leadership and a willingness to embrace an agenda based on       foreign propaganda, directly undermining the national       interests of the United States.\2\ The world watched       President Trump stand next to Russian President Vladimir       Putin in Helsinki, Finland in July 2018.\3\ When President       Trump was asked whether he believed President Putin or his       intelligence agencies--all of which definitively concluded       that Russia interfered in the 2016 election \4\--President       Trump responded: ``My people came to me . . . [and] said they       think it's Russia. I have President Putin. He just said it's       not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it       would be.'' \5\ 

       After this press conference and despite his attempts to       retract his comments, President Trump faced widespread and       bipartisan condemnation. Republican members of Congress       called his performance ``troubling,'' ``a step backwards,''       ``shameful, ``untenable,'' ``bizarre and flat-out wrong.''       \6\ However, only Senator John McCain offered a forceful       rebuke of President Trump: 

       Today's press conference in Helsinki was one of the most       disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.       The damage inflicted by President Trump's naivete, egotism,       false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to       calculate. 

       No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly       before a tyrant. Not only did President Trump fail to speak       the truth about an adversary; but speaking for America to the       world, our president failed to defend all that makes us who       we are--a republic of free people dedicated to the cause of       liberty at home and abroad. American presidents must be the       champions of that cause if it is to succeed. Americans are       waiting and hoping for President Trump to embrace that sacred       responsibility. One can only hope they are not waiting       totally in vain.\7\ 

       Over a year and a half later, the President's pattern of       conduct has made it clear. Just as Senator McCain feared,       Americans have waited in vain for President Trump to       embrace--or even understand--his duties as a public servant.       This President has not and never will be faithful to the       ``sacred responsibility'' that he holds as President of the       United States, nor will he ever truly honor the trust that       the people placed in him. 

       Besides Senator McCain, Republican Senators failed to fully       confront the President when he chose the word of a former KGB       agent over the United States Intelligence Community. For this       reason, it is unsurprising that our Nation has found itself       imperiled yet again by another example of President Trump's       shameful and dishonorable conduct. In response to Republican       Senators who have expressed concern about the President's       ``inappropriate'' conduct but have repeatedly refused to hold       him accountable, I must ask: What will it take? What action       will finally be so objectionable, so inappropriate to break       from this President? He will not learn. He will not change.       When confronted with a choice between the national interests       and his personal political interests, President Trump will       always choose the latter. The Senate's failure to hold him       accountable in this impeachment trial would be a stain on       American history. 

       After a thorough, careful review of all of the available       evidence in this impeachment trial, I have determined that       House Managers have not only met, but exceeded, their burden       of proof in this case. President Trump violated his duty as a       public servant by corruptly abusing his power to solicit       foreign interference in the 2020 election and by repeatedly       obstructing Congress's constitutionally-based investigation       into his conduct. President Trump's clearly established       pattern of conduct indicates he will continue to be a       ``threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed       to remain in office.'' \8\ For these reasons, I will vote       ``guilty'' on both Article I and Article II.                            II. Procedural History  

       Before discussing the facts of this case, it is important       to address the Senate trial itself. To ensure a full and fair       trial for all parties, Senate Democrats repeatedly called for       relevant witnesses and relevant documents to be subpoenaed       during this trial in the Senate.\9\ The testimonial and       documentary evidence would supplement an already substantial       record presented by the House Managers and ensure that this       was a fair trial for all parties involved. Senate Republicans       refused to allow any witnesses and documents.\10\ 

       Seventy-five percent of Americans supported calling       witnesses during his trial.\11\ Unfortunately, President       Trump has been calling the shots and dictating the Republican       approach to this trial.\12\ This is the third Presidential       impeachment trial in our country's history, and it is the       only one to be completed without calling a single       witness.\13\ In fact, every completed impeachment trial in       history has included new witnesses that were not even       originally interviewed in the House of Representatives.\14\ 

       By blocking relevant witnesses and relevant documents,       Senate Republicans have denied the American people the full       and fair trial they deserve. It is clear that this proceeding       was rigged from the start to protect President Trump rather       than to hear all of the facts.                             III. Material Facts       Special Counsel Mueller & Russian Interference in the 2016           Presidential Election 

       To fully understand the facts established by the House       Managers in this case, it is necessary to first understand       the context in which President Trump engaged in this       behavior. In May 2017, Special Counsel Robert Mueller was       appointed to investigate `` `the Russian government's efforts       to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,' including       any links or coordination between the Russian government and       individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.'' \15\       Special Counsel Mueller released his comprehensive report in       April 2019, which established in meticulous detail that       Russian President Vladimir Putin personally directed an       ongoing and systemic Russian attack in the 2016 presidential       election in the United States.\16\ 

       Special Counsel Mueller's conclusions were also confirmed       by the United States Intelligence Community \17\ and the       bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\18\ The       Mueller investigation did not find evidence that President       Trump's 2016 campaign conspired or coordinated with the       Russian government, but Special Counsel Mueller did confirm       that ``the Russian government perceived it would benefit from       a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and       that the [Trump] Campaign expected it would benefit       electorally from information stolen and released through       Russian efforts.'' \19\ For example, then-candidate Trump       declared during a public rally in July 2016: ``Russia, if       you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000       emails that are missing'' from then-candidate Hillary       Clinton's email server.\20\ Russian hackers targeted       Clinton's personal server within hours of Trump's       request.\21\ After the Mueller Report, in June 2019,       President Trump was asked whether he would accept opposition       research from a foreign government against his political       opponent. President Trump responded ``I think I'd take it.''       \22\ 

       Rather than embrace the Special Counsel's investigation and       condemn Russian interference in the election, President Trump       reportedly tried to undermine the investigation by calling it       a ``witch hunt'' \23\ and a ``hoax.'' \24\ In fact, in Volume       II of his report, Special Counsel Mueller detailed the       President's numerous efforts to obstruct the Special       Counsel's investigation into Russian interference and his       attempts to remove the Special Counsel in order to end the       investigation. The Special Counsel identified ten separate       episodes of potential obstruction of justice including, but       not limited to: (1) President Trump firing former FBI       Director James Comey; \25\ (2) President Trump attempting to       fire Special Counsel Mueller; \26\ and (3) President Trump       requesting his White House Counsel lie and publically deny       that President Trump tried to fire Special Counsel       Mueller.\27\ 

       Neither Special Counsel Mueller nor Attorney General       William Barr charged President Trump with a crime for the       actions detailed in Special Counsel Mueller's report,\28\ in       part because of a controversial Office of Legal Counsel       opinion indicating that a sitting President cannot be       indicted for a crime.\29\ However, over a thousand former       federal prosecutors, who served under Republican and       Democratic administrations, issued a statement shortly after       the release of the Special Counsel's report that stated, in       part, as follows: 

       Each of us believes that the conduct of President Trump       described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report would,       in the case of any other person not covered by the Office of       Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting President,       result in multiple felony charges for obstruction of       justice.\30\ 

       After releasing his report in April, Special Counsel       Mueller testified in front of the House Judiciary Committee       and the House Intelligence Committee on July 24, 2019.\31\       During his testimony, Special Counsel Mueller confirmed that       Russia was still engaging in ongoing efforts to attack future       elections and warned that the United States must ``use the       full resources that we have to address this''       interference.\32\ On July 25, one day after Special Counsel       Mueller testified, President Trump spoke on the phone with       the newly-elected President of Ukraine, President Volodymyr       Zelensky.\33\ Unknown at the time, this phone call would soon       set off the comprehensive investigation leading to President       Trump's impeachment and the current trial in the Senate.      Ukraine 

       On April 21, 2019, several months before Special Counsel       Mueller's public testimony,       Volodymyr Zelensky was elected President of Ukraine and later       that day, President Trump called him to congratulate him on       his victory.\34\ On that call, President Trump extended a       future invitation to the White House and he also promised       that he would send a ``very, very high level'' representative       from the United States to attend President Zelensky's       inauguration.\35\ 

       Two days after President Trump's call with President       Zelensky, on April 23, media reports confirmed that former       Vice President Joe Biden would enter the 2020 presidential       race.\36\ Around this time, the President's personal       attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was leading a smear campaign to       tarnish and remove then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie       Yovanovitch, a respected diplomat known for advancing the       United States' anti-corruption efforts abroad.\37\ The smear       campaign was also advanced by two ``corrupt former       prosecutors''--Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Shokin--in Ukraine.\38\       It was widely confirmed that the corrupt Ukraine prosecutors       were seeking ``revenge against'' Ambassador Yovanovitch for       exposing their misconduct.\39\ On the day after the media       reported that former Vice President Biden was entering the       presidential race, President Trump recalled Ambassador       Yovanovitch from her position in Ukraine.\40\ 

       Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Giuliani both promoted two conspiracy       theories that have been pursued by President Trump.\41\ One       of the conspiracy theories alleged that Ukraine hacked a       Democratic National Committee (DNC) server in 2016 in order       to frame Russia for election interference and help the       Clinton Campaign.\42\ The other theory alleged that former       Vice President Biden coerced the Ukrainian government into       firing Mr. Shokin to ``prevent an investigation into Burisma       Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company for which Vice President       Biden's son, Hunter, served as a board member.'' \43\ Both       theories have been criticized and debunked by officials in       the Trump Administration.\44\ 

       On May 3, 2019, shortly after President Zelensky's       election, President Trump and President Putin spoke by       telephone and discussed, in part, the so-called ``Russian       Hoax,'' referring to Special Counsel Mueller's       investigation.\45\ During that conversation, President Putin       reportedly spoke negatively about Ukraine, suggesting that it       was corrupt and that President Zelensky was ``in the thrall       of oligarchs.'' \46\ A Washington Post article, published on       December 19, 2019, reported that a senior White House       official even indicated that President Trump suggested that       ``he knew Ukraine was the real culprit [of 2016 election       interference] because `Putin told me.' '' \47\ 

       On May 9, the New York Times reported that the President's       personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani, would be traveling to       Ukraine to pressure the government to open investigations       into the conspiracy theories about Burisma and the 2016       election.\48\ Mr. Giuliani specifically acknowledged ``[t]his       isn't foreign policy'' but that the investigations ``will be       very, very helpful to my client.'' \49\ 

       Around May 13, President Trump ordered Vice President Pence       not to attend President Zelensky's inauguration and sent a       lower-ranking delegation, despite his promise to President       Zelensky to send a ``very, very high level''       representative.\50\ This delegation included Secretary of       Energy Rick Perry, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon       Sondland, Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations       Ambassador Kurt Volker and NSC Director for Ukraine       Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman.\51\ 

       On May 23, despite positive reports from the delegation       regarding President Zelensky's effort to combat corruption,       President Trump said he ``didn't believe'' the delegation       because that was not what Mr. Giuliani had told him.\52\ The       President also reiterated that Ukraine ``tried to take me       down'' during the 2016 election, confirming that he still       believed the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was       actually responsible for 2016 election interference.\53\       President Trump directed Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry       and Ambassador Volker to ``talk to Rudy'' and coordinate       engagement with the Ukraine government.\54\ 

       Despite President Trump's misplaced concerns about       Ukrainian conspiracy theories, in May 2019, the Department of       Defense (DOD) and the State Department certified that Ukraine       had ``taken substantial actions'' to decrease corruption.\55\       This was important because it was a necessary requirement in       order for DOD to release $250 million in Ukrainian military       assistance that had been appropriated and authorized by       Congress.\56\ Congress had also appropriated and authorized       another $141 million to be administered by the State       Department for security assistance to Ukraine.\57\ 

       However, by July 12, the President had ordered a block on       all military and security assistance for Ukraine against       overwhelming recommendations from across the Executive Branch       and strong bipartisan support for the aid.\58\ The hold       continued throughout August in violation of the Impoundment       Control Act of 1974.\59\ The President did not initially       give a reason for the hold, although by September, the       President claimed that the hold was because he was       concerned about corruption in Ukraine and burden-sharing       for Ukrainian assistance among European allies.\60\ 

       Throughout this time period, it also became clear that       President Trump was withholding the White House meeting that       he promised President Zelensky during their April 21 phone       call.\61\ Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Yovanovitch's       replacement in Ukraine, pushed for the White House meeting,       but he learned that the meeting was conditioned explicitly on       Ukraine publically announcing investigations into the 2016       election and Burisma.\62\ Ambassador Sondland was unequivocal       in his description during his testimony: ``Was there a quid       pro quo? As I testified previously with regard to the       requested White House call and the White House meeting, the       answer is yes.'' \63\ 

       After a July 10 meeting, Dr. Fiona Hill, former Senior       Director of European and Russian Affairs at the National       Security Council, informed then-National Security Advisor       John Bolton that Ambassador Sondland reiterated the quid pro       quo to Ukrainian officials during a meeting at the White       House.\64\ Dr. Hill testified that Mr. Bolton advised her to       ``go and tell [the NSC Legal Advisor] that I am not part of       whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on       this.'' \65\ Over the next two weeks, Mr. Giuliani       coordinated with Ambassadors Sondland and Volker to arrange a       phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky for       President Zelensky to inform President Trump that he would       announce the investigations.\66\ 

       On July 25, President Trump spoke on the phone with       President Zelensky.\67\ At one point, President Zelensky       thanked President Trump for the ``great support'' in military       assistance and indicated that Ukraine would be interested in       purchasing more Javelin anti-tank missiles soon.\68\ In       response, immediately after the Javelin reference, President       Trump stated as follows: ``I would like you to do us a favor       though.'' \69\ President Trump brought up the investigations       that he sought into the Ukrainian election interference and       Biden conspiracy theories.\70\ After the call, Ambassador       Sondland informed a State Department aide that President       Trump ``did not give a [expletive] about Ukraine'' and he       only cared only about ``big stuff,'' meaning `` `the Biden       investigation' that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.'' \71\ 

       Around that time, the Ukrainian government also became       aware that President Trump was withholding military aid.\72\       On August 12, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, with       consultation from Mr. Giuliani, edited a draft statement for       President Zelensky to publically release that included       explicit references to ``Burisma and the 2016 U.S.       elections.'' \73\ On that same day, a whistleblower filed a       complaint with the Intelligence Community Inspector General       expressing concerns about President Trump's phone call with       President Zelensky on July 25.\74\ 

       Ukraine ultimately did not release the statement regarding       investigations and no further action was taken regarding a       White House meeting.\75\ Furthermore, there were increasing       concerns among national security officials regarding       President Trump's hold on military aid, which many began to       understand was meant to pressure Ukraine too.\76\ Ambassador       Sondland testified that President Trump's effort to condition       release of the security assistance on Ukraine announcing       investigations was as clear as ``two plus two equals four.''       \77\ 

       On September 7, President Trump and Ambassador Sondland       spoke on the telephone and Ambassador Sondland explained that       President told him ``there was no quid pro quo, but President       Zelensky must announce the opening of the investigations and       he should want to do it.'' \78\ Shortly after, on September       9, Ambassador Taylor texted Ambassadors Sondland and Volker       and explicitly said, ``I think it's crazy to withhold       security assistance for help with a political campaign.''       \79\ On that same day, the Intelligence Community Inspector       General notified Congress of the August 12 whistleblower       complaint regarding President Trump's July 25 phone call with       President Zelensky.\80\ 

       Two days later, President Trump unexpectedly released his       hold on Ukraine's security assistance.\81\ Since President       Trump lifted the hold, however, he has continued to press       Ukraine, and even other foreign countries, to open       investigations into his political rival.\82\ For example, on       October 3, President Trump stated as follows on the White       House lawn: 

       Well I would think that if they [Ukraine] were honest about       it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's       a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens. . .       . Likewise, China should start an investigation into the       Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as       what happened with Ukraine. So, I would say that President       Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an       investigation into the Bidens.\83\ 

       To date, President Zelensky still has not met with       President Trump at the White House.      Congressional Investigations 

       As noted above, Congress was notified on September 9 of the       August 12 whistleblower complaint regarding President Trump's       phone call with Ukraine.\84\ Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced       on September 24 that the House would move forward with an       official impeachment inquiry.\85\ 

       On September 9 and September 24, three House Committee sent       letters to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone asking for six       specific categories of documents related to the Ukraine       investigation.\86\ The White House did not respond, and as a       result, the Committees issued a subpoena to Acting White       House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney.\87\ 

       On October 8, Mr. Cipollone responded and indicated that       ``President Trump cannot permit his Administration to       participate in this       partisan inquiry under these circumstances.'' \88\ The letter       called the inquiry ``constitutionally invalid'' even though       the Constitution grants the House the sole power of       impeachment.\89\ The letter made reference to ``long-      established Executive Branch confidentiality interests and       privileges,'' \90\ although President Trump has never       specifically asserted an executive privilege over a single       piece of information related to the inquiry. 

       As a result of President Trump's blanket directive, every       Executive Branch agency that received an impeachment inquiry       request or subpoena has not complied with the request.\91\       Specifically, the Executive Branch has not produced a single       document or permitted a single witness to testify in response       to a subpoena.\92\ The only witnesses who did testify or       submit documents did so in direct violation of the White       House's directive.\93\                         IV. ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT  

       As we know, Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the       Constitution states that ``[t]he Senate shall have the sole       Power to try all Impeachments.'' \94\ As a Senator reviewing       this case, I have based my assessment of the evidence on the       following two questions: 

       (1) Did the president do what he is charged with in the       Articles?; and 

       (2) If so, is that action an impeachable offense that       warrants removal from office?      Abuse of Power 

       In the first Article of Impeachment, the House of       Representatives charged President Trump with abusing his       power as President by corruptly ``soliciting the Government       of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would       benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a       political opponent, and influence the 2020 United States       Presidential election to his advantage.'' \95\ In this case,       I have found that the House has presented substantial,       persuasive evidence to prove the allegations in Article I. 

       First, there is no dispute that the White House directly       withheld $391 million dollars in military aid from       Ukraine.\96\ The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) held       the aid, at the direction of the President, despite the       Department of Defense and the State Department certifying       that Ukraine was taking necessary measures to reduce       corruption.\97\ Furthermore, all agencies--except OMB--      strongly supported the release of the aid because it was in       the national interest of the United States.\98\ 

       Nor is there dispute that President Trump withheld a White       House meeting with President Zelensky. On his April 21 phone       call, President Trump explicitly invited President Zelensky       to the White House in the future.\99\ However, after former       Vice President Joe Biden announced his candidacy for       President just a few days later, President Zelensky--despite       numerous efforts--still has not met with President Trump at       the White House. 

       Second, the evidence establishes that President Trump       conditioned the aid and the White House meeting on Ukraine       announcing investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election.       In the July 25 phone call, President Trump asked President       Zelensky to ``do us a favor though'' and referenced the 2016       election and Burisma investigations immediately after       President Zelensky brought up military assistance.\100\ 

       Related to the White House meeting, Ambassador Sondland       could not have been more clear when he testified that       ``yes,'' there was a quid pro quid conditioning a White House       meeting with Ukraine announcing investigations into the       Bidens and Burisma.\101\ He further testified that the       conditioning of the White House meeting and military       assistance on Ukraine publically announcing investigations       was as clear as ``2+2=4.'' \102\ 

       So, the question is: Why? Was President Trump acting       corruptly to advance his own political interests, or was he,       as his defense attorneys would have us believe, deeply       concerned about ongoing ``corruption'' in Ukraine and       ``burden-sharing?'' \103\ The facts clearly established that       President Trump was acting corruptly to further his own       political interests. 

       First, while the President's defense lawyers have rightly       argued that the President ``defines foreign policy,'' \104\       the facts do not support that the President's actions related       to Ukraine were based on ``legitimate concerns'' regarding       corruption and burden-sharing.\105\ Also, if the President       was so concerned about corruption in Ukraine, why did he       dismiss one of the Nation's best corruption-fighting       diplomats, Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch? \106\ 

       Second, the President was utilizing his personal attorney,       Mr. Giuliani, to coordinate the announcement of       investigations in Ukraine. Mr. Giuliani explicitly said that       he was not engaged in foreign policy, but was acting on       behalf of President Trump in his ``personal capacity.'' \107\       The State Department also released a statement in August       emphasizing that Mr. Giuliani is a private citizen acting in       his personal capacity and ``does not speak on behalf of the       U.S. government.'' \108\ Accordingly, one cannot reasonably       argue that the investigations pursued by Mr. Giuliani were       related to ``legitimate'' foreign policy when they were       coordinated by the President's personal attorney for the       President's personal benefit. 

       Third, it was the prior practice of the Administration to       release aid to Ukraine without delay or regard to alleged       corruption and burden-sharing concerns. Both of these       asserted concerns were an after-the-fact distraction from the       truth. The Trump Administration disbursed--without question--      approximately $511 million and $359 million to Ukraine in       2017 and 2018, respectively.\109\ The only thing that changed       in 2019 was that former Vice President Joe Biden announced       that he was running for President. 

       Finally, the proposed investigations into Burisma and 2016       election interference were debunked conspiracy theories that       would have only benefited one person--Donald Trump. Regarding       Burisma, President Trump claimed that former Vice President       Biden corruptly forced Ukraine to fire then-Prosecutor       General Shokin to avoid further investigation into       Burisma.\110\ The truth is that Vice President Biden was       actually pursuing Mr. Shokin's termination--with bipartisan       and international support--because Mr. Shokin was a corrupt       and ineffective prosecutor.\111\ In fact, Mr. Shokin was not       actively investigating Burisma and his removal would have       made it more likely--not less--that Burisma would be       investigated in the future.\112\ 

       Furthermore, even if we were to accept that President Trump       had legitimate interests regarding alleged corruption in       Ukraine, he certainly should not have asked a foreign       government to announce the investigation. Rather, he should       have gone through official channels and asked the Department       of Justice to look into the allegations.\113\ Ambassador       Sondland indicated that President Trump was only concerned       about the announcement of investigations--he was not       concerned with the actual completion of investigations.\114\       President Trump was not actually interested in corruption in       Ukraine, but was only concerned with harming a political       opponent with the announcement of an investigation. 

       Regarding Ukrainian election interference, President Trump       has suggested that Ukraine attempted to help the Hillary       Clinton campaign in 2016 by framing Russia and hacking a       Democratic National Committee server.\115\ This theory is not       supported by any evidence. The U.S. Intelligence Community,       the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Special       Counsel Robert Mueller all came to the conclusion that       Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 election.\116\       Dr. Fiona Hill called this Ukraine theory a ``fictional       narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the       Russian security services'' to raise doubts about Russia's       own culpability and to harm the relationship between the       United States and Ukraine.\117\ President Trump's former       Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, also indicated       that the Ukraine theory was ``not only a conspiracy       theory, it is completely debunked.'' \118\ Pursuing such a       clearly debunked conspiracy theory only served to benefit       President Trump, and Putin, by raising doubts regarding       Russia's own election interference and its preference for       President Trump's election in 2016. 

       Based on this evidence, it is clear that President Trump       acted corruptly by conditioning the release of military aid       and a White House meeting on Ukraine announcing       investigations into his political opponent.      Obstruction of Congress 

       Under the second Article of Impeachment, the House charged       that President Trump has obstructed Congress by directing the       ``the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance       of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives pursuant       to its `sole Power of Impeachment.' '' \119\ I have concluded       that the House has presented substantial evidence to prove       the allegations in this Article. 

       On October 8, 2019, during the House impeachment inquiry,       the White House Counsel wrote that ``President Trump cannot       permit his Administration to participate in this partisan       inquiry under these circumstances.'' \120\ As a result of       President Trump's directives, the House did not receive a       ``single document'' from the White House, the Vice President,       OMB, the Department of State, DOD or the Department of       Energy--despite 71 requests and demands.\121\ Furthermore,       the only witnesses who testified or produced documents did so       in opposition to the President's directive.\122\ 

       President Trump did not assert a single claim of       ``executive privilege'' over any specific document or piece       of testimony during this inquiry.\123\ Rather, he issued a       blanket directive that completely denied the constitutional       oversight responsibilities of the House.\124\ Based on this       evidence, it is clear that President Trump has obstructed       Congress.                            V. Impeachable Conduct  

       Having established that the President did, in fact, engage       in the conduct alleged in these Articles--I now turn to       whether this conduct warrants removal from office. 

       During the Constitutional Convention of 1787, our Founders       grappled significantly with how to elect the Executive, but       they also debated how to hold the Executive accountable.       While some delegates believed that the President should only       be held accountable at the ballot box through elections,       others voiced the logical concern that ``if [the President]       be not impeachable whilst in office, he will spare no efforts       or means whatever to get himself re-elected.'' \125\ After       much debate, the Convention voted that the Executive shall be       ``removable on impeachments'' \126\ and later confirmed the       grounds for impeachment included ``Treason, bribery and other       high crimes and misdemeanors.'' \127\ 

       ``High Crimes and Misdemeanors'' is left ambiguous in the       Constitution. At the time of the drafting, the Founders'       understanding       of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' was informed by centuries       of English legal precedent.\128\ This understanding was       reflected in Federalist No. 65, written by Alexander       Hamilton, which explained that impeachment should stem from       an ``abuse or violation of some public trust.'' \129\ Noted       historian Ron Chernow explained that Hamilton's understanding       of impeachment should ``count heavily because he was the       foremost proponent of a robust presidency, yet he also       harbored an abiding fear that a brazen demagogue could seize       the office.'' \130\ Informed by this history, Congress has       consistently interpreted ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors''       broadly to mean ``serious violations of the public trust.''       \131\ 

       The President's defense lawyers argued that impeachment       requires a violation of a criminal statute to be       constitutionally valid.\132\ This argument is not supported       by historical precedent, credible scholarship or our common       sense about the sacred notion of the public trust.\133\       When applying the accurate Hamiltonian standard for       impeachment--an ``abuse or violation of some public       trust''--it is clear that President Trump's conduct       exceeds that standard. Any effort to corrupt an election       must be met with a swift measure of accountability as       provided for under the impeachment clause in the       Constitution. There is no other remedy to constrain a       President who has acted, time and again, to advance his       personal interests over those of the Nation. 

       Furthermore, since his candidacy, President Trump has       engaged in substantial and ongoing efforts to solicit foreign       interference in our elections. As detailed in Special Counsel       Mueller's report, the Trump campaign routinely welcomed       Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election       because they ``expected [the Campaign] would benefit       electorally from information stolen and released through       Russian efforts.'' \134\ As an illustration of just how       brazen President Trump has become in his conduct, his July 25       phone call with President Zelensky occurred just one day       after Special Counsel Mueller testified in Congress, where he       warned of the ongoing threat of foreign interference in       elections.\135\ As the Washington Post reported on September       21 in a story written by three reporters who have covered the       President for several years, the President's conduct on the       Ukraine call revealed ``a president convinced of his own       invincibility--apparently willing and even eager to wield the       vast powers of the United States to taint a political foe and       confident that no one could hold him back.'' \136\ 

       The President's blanket obstruction of Congress also       substantially imperils our constitutional system of checks       and balances. Not only has this President taken the       unprecedented step of issuing an outright refusal to       cooperate with Congressional oversight in this case, but       President Trump has exhibited an ongoing hostility to       oversight of his administration. As detailed in Special       Counsel Mueller's report, President Trump engaged in ten       distinct efforts to obstruct and curtail investigations into       his conduct and Russia's interference in the 2016       election.\137\ It is clear that this President has engaged in       an ongoing pattern of behavior that threatens to diminish any       meaningful future oversight of the Executive Branch. 

       Given the President's ongoing pattern of corrupt behavior,       especially as it relates to the next election, I find him       ``guilty'' under both Articles of Impeachment.                                VI. Conclusion  

       Our Founders had the foresight to ensure that the power of       the President was not unlimited and that Congress could--if       necessary--hold the Executive accountable for abuses of power       through the impeachment process. This Senate trial is not       simply about grave presidential abuse of power, it is about       our Democracy, the sanctity of our elections and the very       values that the Founders agreed should guide our Nation. 

       The inscription--``[a]ll public service is a trust, given       in faith and accepted in honor''--serves as a reminder to us       all of the bedrock principles of our republic. We must hold       those accountable who violate this sacred trust. President       Trump dishonored that public trust given to him by abusing       his power for personal, political gain. In order to prevent       continuing interference in our upcoming election and blatant       obstruction of Congress, the Senate should find him guilty       under both Articles.                                   endnotes
