Casey Statement on U.S. Airstrike in Iraq


Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) is releasing the following statement following the United States' airstrike in Iraq which killed General Qassim Suleimani of Iran:

"Qassim Suleimani was a military figure who inflicted terror and killed thousands in Israel, Iraq, Syria and other places. He was directly responsible for the killing of hundreds of American soldiers and civilians. The world is safer with him gone.

The Trump Administration must provide a full briefing to Congress next week regarding the following:

-The intelligence used to authorize the strike;-The legal basis for the strike;-The nature of the threat articulated by the Pentagon in its statement last night; and-The preparations and planning the Administration has undertaken regarding potential retaliation by the Iranian regime against Americans abroad and here at home.

I have grave concerns that President Trump and his Administration have not provided the American people with a comprehensive strategy on Iran. Finally, this and other recent actions by the Administration have been taken without a Congressionally-approved Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). As we prepare for fallout in the coming days, Congress has a critical role to play in assessing the legality of the strike, understanding its impact on U.S. national security and conducting oversight over this Administration's actions abroad."
