Casey Secures $250 Million in Funding to Help Feed Seniors During Pandemic


Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) announced that he has secured $250 million in funding to help feed seniors during the coronavirus pandemic. Many seniors already suffer from food insecurity, which could be made worse by the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, pandemic. Under the funding released yesterday, Pennsylvania is slated to receive $10.2M. Senator Casey pushed for funding for senior nutrition programs during the debate over the second coronavirus relief package, now public law, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (H.R. 6201). Today, Casey also called on the Administration to push funds out the door more quickly.

"Today, we can announce, that after my efforts, substantial funding to feed seniors during the coronavirus pandemic will be released to older Americans across the country and in Pennsylvania," Senator Casey said. "While this funding is needed, getting it out the door should not have taken this long. The Administration should have moved more quickly and I will continue to press them to act with the speed that this crisis deserves."

The funding will ensure that Area Agencies on Aging have the funds to continue providing meals to seniors as they are forced to stay home during this pandemic. Of the $10.2M, $6.8M will support meals to seniors in their homes through Meals on Wheels and $3.4M will support congregate meals.

Senator Casey also introduced a bill to mitigate the risks that the coronavirus (COVID-19) poses to seniors. The Coronavirus Relief for Seniors and People with Disabilities Act would address critical health and financial needs of older adults by providing $1.6 billion for nutrition services for seniors during this pandemic. Additional funding for senior nutrition is expected to be included in Senate legislation soon to be announced.
