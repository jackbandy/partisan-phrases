Casey Releases Report Detailing Triple Threat to Containing and Combatting COVID-19


U.S. Senator Bob Casey released a report detailing how President Trump and Congressional Republicans' efforts to destroy, dismantle and defund the ACA and Medicaid expansion will lead to more illness and higher costs associated with the coronavirus.

"While the novel coronavirus risks American lives, the President is in court trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act," said Senator Casey. "His efforts to sabotage affordable health care are only making it harder for Americans to receive the preventative services and treatment they need."
