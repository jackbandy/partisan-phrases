Casey Introduces Bill to Expand SNAP Delivery During COVID-19 Pandemic


Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) introduced the Increasing Access to SNAP Delivery During COVID-19 Act, which would ensure SNAP participants, especially seniors and immunocompromised individuals, have access to home food delivery and curbside pickup during the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this week, Casey led a bipartisan letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) urging the Department to immediately improve the ability of at-risk individuals to access the food they need while remaining at home. U.S. Representatives Jahana Hayes (D-CT-5), Marcia Fudge (D-OH-11) and Joe Neguse (D-CO-2) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.

"Everyone, including SNAP participants, should be able to safely access the food they need. More must be done to ensure high-risk individuals are able to maintain reliable access to food while also maintaining social distancing guidelines," said Senator Casey. "The Increasing Access to SNAP Delivery During COVID-19 Act would support retailers in expanding their SNAP delivery offerings during the pandemic, allowing immunocompromised individuals and seniors to continue to stay at home as much as possible as advised by public health authorities."

In March, Casey introduced a legislative package in order to protect and support children and families during this public health emergency, including policies to support retailers' capacity to provide SNAP delivery.

The Increasing Access to SNAP Delivery During COVID-19 Act builds on these proposals by requiring USDA to implement the following:

Require USDA to promote alternative delivery options for SNAP participants;Provide $500 million in funding to support retailers in delivery expansion;Coordinate states' plans to expand delivery options; andRequire a report to Congress regarding funding utilization.

Senator Casey was joined by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Tina Smith (D-MN).
