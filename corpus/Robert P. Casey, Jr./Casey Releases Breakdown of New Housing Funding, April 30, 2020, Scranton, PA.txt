Casey Releases Breakdown of New Housing Funding


Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement to announce that public housing authorities in Pennsylvania will receive more than $8.1 million in new funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Housing Choice Voucher program as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act:

"I am pleased that Pennsylvania will receive more than $8.1 million to help our public housing authorities provide safe, clean, reliable housing to the communities they serve. 83 different housing authorities across the Commonwealth will be able to use funding from the Housing Choice Voucher program to ensure they can meet emerging needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and maintain existing programs. Housing insecurity is among the challenges worsened by this crisis and these grants come at a time when families and individuals need assistance most."

The CARES Act provided $1.25 billion for Tenant-Based Rental Assistance, which funds the Housing Choice Voucher program, including $400 million for increased subsidy costs and $850 million for administrative and other expenses incurred by public housing authorities (PHAs), including, according to HUD, "activities to support or maintain the health and safety of assisted individuals and families, and costs related to retention and support of participating owners."
