Disinterment of Remains of Fernando V. Cota From Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, Texas


Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026. I thank  Chairman Rogers for his leadership in bringing this critical piece of  legislation, which is vital to the national security of our Nation, to  the floor for the 65th consecutive year.

This year's NDAA puts our warfighters first by streamlining  procurement and ensuring they receive the capabilities needed to  counter the increasingly sophisticated actions of our adversaries,  particularly the People's Republic of China.

Through the Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee, we were  able to ensure our Special Operations Forces, the Defense Intelligence  Enterprise, and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency have the tools  required to execute the Department's efforts in strategic competition  and in countering malign influences.

Additionally, I am extremely proud to have championed the SOCUM  Urgent Technologies and Capabilities Pilot Program which ensures our  special operators receive the technology and equipment they need to  meet and defeat emerging threats.

This is an essential bill for America's national defense, and I urge  my colleagues to support it.
