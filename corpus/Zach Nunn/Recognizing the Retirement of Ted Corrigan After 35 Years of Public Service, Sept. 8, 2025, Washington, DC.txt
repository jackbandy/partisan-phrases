Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Ted  Corrigan on the occasion of his retirement. Through more than three  decades of steady leadership at Des Moines Water Works, Ted has played  a central role in ensuring clean, reliable water for families across  Central Iowa.

Since joining Des Moines Water Works in 1990, Ted has been a trusted  steward of one of Iowa's most critical resources. He helped oversee  major infrastructure improvements, expanded watershed protection  programs, and worked with partners across the region to strengthen  collaboration among local water providers. His leadership helped bring  about the creation of Central Iowa Water Works, a new regional utility  model built on cooperation and long-term planning.

Ted guided the DMWW through both steady progress and unforeseen  challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic. At a time when basic  services could not be taken for granted, he made certain that more than  500,000 Iowans continued to receive safe drinking water without  interruption. His leadership during that period and beyond earned the  Water Works national recognition, including the 2024 Gold Award for  Exceptional Utility Management from the Association of Metropolitan  Water Agencies.

Ted also understood that public service extends beyond pipes and  pumps. He championed the transformation of Water Works Park into a  welcoming community space, helping to lead the development of the  Lauridsen Amphitheater and creating new opportunities for Iowans to  gather, enjoy outdoor recreation, and build stronger community ties.

I have had the opportunity to work with Ted on matters of regional  infrastructure and public health. His professionalism, clarity, and  focus on long-term solutions made him a valuable partner to many, and  his example has helped strengthen public trust in the institutions that  serve our state.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Ted Corrigan  for his decades of committed service to the Des Moines community and to  the people of Iowa. We extend our best wishes to him and his family as  he enters this next chapter.
