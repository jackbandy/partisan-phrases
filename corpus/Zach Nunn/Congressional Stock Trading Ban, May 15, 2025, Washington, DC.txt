Congressional Stock Trading Ban


Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, in 2023, dozens of Members of Congress  beat the S&P 500, while only 40 percent of Wall Street pros were able  to pull that off. I think that has got Americans asking: What does  Congress have, a secret strategy?

The sad part is, they did. It is called insider trading.

Members of this body are so good at investing that apps like the  Pelosi Tracker exist as a stock tip machine. It has given investors a  45 percent return in the last year alone simply by copying the former  Speaker's stock trades.

Now, this isn't a partisan issue. Republicans and Democrats together  have made over $200 million in the market last year, while Americans  got hammered by inflation and rising interest rates.

Mr. Speaker, I am a farm kid from Iowa. When I came to Washington, I  didn't have many stocks to sell, but I sold them all because it is the  right thing to do. It is ridiculous that anyone would commit insider  trading while being here.

President Trump agrees and Speaker Johnson agrees that now is the  time to pass my bill, the No Corruption in Government Act to finally  ban Members of Congress from stock trading, stop government pay raises,  and extend the lobbying ban.

Mr. Speaker, let's pass this bill and get it to the President's desk.  Let's give the American people back their faith in democracy.
