Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  outstanding young Iowan, SirMichael Carrington Williams-Thomas of  Waukee, for his selection as Iowa's 2025 recipient of the Billy Michal  Student Leadership Award.

This national honor is awarded annually to one student from each  state who exemplifies the values of leadership, service, and  citizenship. In being chosen to represent Iowa, SirMichael joins a  distinguished group of young Americans committed to putting service  over self and leading with integrity to build stronger communities,  inspire others through action, and uphold the enduring values that  strengthen both Iowa and our Nation.

SirMichael is a sophomore at Waukee High School and already a well- regarded leader across civic and academic organizations. From his role  as a member of the State of Iowa's Youth Advisory Council and Lead  DSM's Youth Leadership Initiative, to his active engagement as an Eagle  Scout, mock trial participant, and church leader, Carrington's record  is defined by energy, humility, and resolve.

I have had the pleasure of getting to know SirMichael and have been  continually impressed by his focus, ambition, and unwavering belief in  the power of servant leadership.

Mr. Speaker, SirMichael Carrington Williams-Thomas represents the  very best of Iowa and our Nation, and I ask that my colleagues join me  in congratulating him and celebrating the extraordinary promise of a  young Iowan already making a powerful difference in the world.
