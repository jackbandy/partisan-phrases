Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Dan  Houston on the occasion of his retirement and to honor his more than 40  years of service at Principal Financial Group. From his first role in  the retirement division to serving as Chairman, President, and Chief  Executive Officer, Dan has exemplified steady leadership, a deep sense  of responsibility, and a commitment to doing right by others. His  career reflects the integrity and work ethic that define our state.

Throughout his four decades at Principal, Dan helped guide the  company through times of change and growth while staying true to its  mission of serving everyday Americans. Under his leadership, Principal  remained a reliable partner for working families and small businesses,  helping them prepare for the future, plan for retirement, and weather  economic uncertainty. He championed a people-first approach to  financial services that created long-term security for those Principal  served.

Beyond the workplace, Dan remains a strong supporter of education,  civic engagement, and local leadership. He serves on the boards of the  Iowa Business Council, the Greater Des Moines Partnership, the Iowa  State University College of Business, the Partnership for a Healthier  America, and the Community Foundation of Greater Des Moines. Through  these roles, he continues to lift others up and strengthen the  communities we call home.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Dan Houston  for his commitment to Iowa, his more than 40 years of service at  Principal Financial Group, and in wishing him well as he steps into  this new chapter.
