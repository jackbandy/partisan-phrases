Recognizing President Wendy Wintersteen for Her Service to Iowa State University


Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize President  Wendy Wintersteen, a longtime champion for Iowa's students and a  nationally respected leader in higher education, as she moves on from  her role as the 16th President of Iowa State University.

Wendy's leadership has shaped the future of Iowa State and made a  meaningful difference across our state. She has led with vision,  investing in entrepreneurial learning, strengthening research programs,  and opening up new resources for hands-on learning in agricultural  sciences and beyond.

As the first woman to serve as president in the university's history,  she has inspired not only students and faculty, but future leaders  across Iowa. Her commitment to innovation has helped position Iowa  State as a national leader in preparing students to solve real-world  challenges, grow our economy, and serve our communities.

It was always a pleasure to run into Wendy on the early morning  flight from Des Moines to D.C., where she has been a tireless advocate  for the Cyclones and for our state's land-grant mission. It's been an  honor to work alongside her and an even greater honor to call her a  friend.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking President  Wendy Wintersteen for her years of distinguished service to Iowa and  Iowa State University. We are excited for all that lies ahead and  confident that her next chapter will be just as impactful as the last.
