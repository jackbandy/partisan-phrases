Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I honor Greg Edwards, President and  CEO of Catch Des Moines, for his outstanding contributions to our  community. Since joining in 2000, Greg has been a driving force in  tourism and economic development, bringing his experience from Peoria,  Illinois, and Overland Park, Kansas. Under his leadership, Catch Des  Moines has grown into a premier destination marketing organization,  strengthening the region's reputation and economy.

Greg has successfully championed major projects transforming Des  Moines, including the Wells Fargo Arena and the downtown Hilton  convention hotel. His efforts also helped secure Des Moines as a  recurring host for NCAA Division I events, including the first and  second rounds of the Men's Basketball Tournament in 2016 and 2019, with  another round secured for 2028. Additionally, he played a key role in  reorganizing the Des Moines Area Sports & Tourism Commission and served  as chair of Destinations International.

Beyond tourism, Greg was vital in revitalizing the city post-COVID  and recently helped break ground on 515 Walnut, a 33-story skyscraper  set to reshape the downtown skyline. His leadership has left a lasting  impact on Des Moines, and we thank him for his service. We wish him  success in his next endeavors and are confident he will continue making  a difference.
