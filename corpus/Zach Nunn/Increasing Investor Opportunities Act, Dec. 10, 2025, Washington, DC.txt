Increasing Investor Opportunities Act

Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Chair, Chairwoman Ann Wagner has been a great  leader on capital markets and driving real innovation, but also real  investment across this country through our INVEST Act. That is why I  rise in support today of the INVEST Act, legislation that will  transform the way we bring capital to the heart of the heartland, in  places like Missouri and Iowa.

Consider, if you will, Mr. Chair, a precision agriculture company in  Atlantic, Iowa, that develops a new soil monitoring technology. They  want to raise capital to manufacture sensors and hire engineers. Under  current rules, they face excessive auditing requirements that cost up  to $200,000 just  in compliance alone. That is an amount that a coastal tech giant might  spend in a day, but for a heartland company, that is a year's worth of  an entire payroll for multiple employees.

My ELEVATE Act, included in this package, fixes this challenge. It  reduces auditing requirements for emerging growth companies from 3  years to 2 years, cutting costs while protecting investors.

Iowa's innovators and America's innovators are creators of solutions  that help feed the world and drive America forward. We should remove  barriers, not continue to create or make them harder, because a startup  in Perry, Iowa, deserves the same shot at success as one in Palo Alto,  California.

The INVEST Act delivers fairness, and my work on the ELEVATE Act  delivers it right to the heart of this country.

Mr. Chair, I urge passage.
