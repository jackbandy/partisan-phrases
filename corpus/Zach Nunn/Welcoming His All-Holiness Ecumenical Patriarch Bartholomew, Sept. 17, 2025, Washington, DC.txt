Welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome his All- Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to the United States this  week. My colleagues and I are honored to host him here in the House of  Representatives and I know my Greek-Orthodox constituents are excited  to have him visit our Nation's Capital. His All-Holiness is a champion  of religious liberty, engaging in dialogues with leaders of Judaism,  Christianity, and Islam. Moreover, he leads a congregation of 300  million church members worldwide and is the longest-serving Patriarch  in the two-millennia history of the Church. We are blessed to have him  here in Washington, D.C. this week.
