Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel  Trenton N. Twedt of the Iowa National Guard, whose nearly four decades  of distinguished service in uniform exemplifies unwavering commitment  to our state and our country.

Colonel Twedt began his military career in 1986, enlisting in the  United States Air Force as an avionics specialist. From those early  days working on aircraft systems to later roles in command, he carried  a steadfast dedication to mission and to the Airmen and women with whom  he served.

After earning his degree from the University of Iowa, Colonel Twedt  received his commission in 1999. This marked the beginning of a new  chapter in a remarkable career that advanced from the enlisted ranks to  the highest levels of leadership within the Iowa Air National Guard.

His service carried him to many parts of the world, including Iraq,  Afghanistan, Qatar, and Germany. Yet through all his overseas  assignments, his heart remained in Iowa, where he guided and mentored  Guardsmen to ensure they were trained, supported, and prepared to  serve. His mentorship, including to myself as a Squadron Commander,  where he imbued his leadership traits upon the next generation of Air  Force officers as our Group Commander, reflects his enduring commitment  to building leaders of character and service.

Over the years, Colonel Twedt has been a steady hand in moments of  challenge, a trusted advisor to his peers, and a mentor to the next  generation of Air Force leaders. His leadership has been recognized  with the Legion of Merit and many other commendations. However, his  most enduring legacy will be found in the lives he has influenced, the  careers he has shaped, and the high standard of integrity he has upheld  throughout his service.

Mr. Speaker, Colonel Trenton N. Twedt has lived a life of service  that exemplifies the very best of the Iowa Air National Guard and the  United States Air Force. I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing  our gratitude for his dedication to duty, his leadership through  decades of change, and his contributions to our state and our Nation.
