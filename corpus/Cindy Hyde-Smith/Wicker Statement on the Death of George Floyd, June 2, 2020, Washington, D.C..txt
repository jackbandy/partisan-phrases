Wicker Statement on the Death of George Floyd


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today released the following statement on the death of George Floyd and ongoing protests throughout the nation:

"The killing of George Floyd was senseless and wrong. No human being should ever have to die the way he did, especially at the hands of an officer who had sworn to uphold the law.

"Our commitment to the rule of law is what makes America great. I am glad to see the officer involved in Floyd's death facing consequences so that the family and our society can receive justice.

"Our commitment to the rule of law also means there is no place for rioting, looting, and burning property in our cities.

"Unfortunately, peaceful protests on behalf of Floyd have been hijacked repeatedly by extreme elements that have nothing to do with Floyd's cause. These individuals are exploiting the hurt and pain felt by so many Americans to carry out senseless acts of vandalism and violence.

"They, too, need to be identified and face the full force of the law."
