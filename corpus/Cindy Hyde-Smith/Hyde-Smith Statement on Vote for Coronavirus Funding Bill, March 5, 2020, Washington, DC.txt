Hyde-Smith Statement on Vote for Coronavirus Funding Bill


U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today issued the following statement after her vote to send President Trump the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act:

"The overwhelming vote for this package indicates strong support for a government-wide response to the coronavirus situation, meaning we must have federal, state, and local coordination and cooperation."

The package, passed on a 96-1 vote, includes funding and provisions to support a comprehensive U.S. effort to prevent, prepare for, and respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).  The House of Representatives approved the bill on Wednesday. Find a summary of the legislation here.

Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate Telehealth Working Group, worked to include an important telehealth provision in the bill to benefit Social Security beneficiaries.
