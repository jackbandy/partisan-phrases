Impeachment


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I will vote to acquit President  Donald J. Trump on both Articles of Impeachment presented by House  Democrats. I have listened carefully to the arguments presented by the  House Democratic managers and the White House defense team. Those  prosecuting the President failed on a legal and constitutional basis to  produce the evidence required to undertake the very serious act of  removing a duly elected President from this office. 

  This trial exposed that pure political partisanship fueled a reckless  investigation and the subsequent impeachment of the President on weak,  vague, and noncriminal accusations. The Democrats' case, which lacked  the basic standards of fairness and due process, was fabricated to  fulfill their one long-held hope to impeach President Trump. 

  We should all be concerned about the dangerous precedent and  consequences of convicting any President on charges originating from  strictly partisan reasons. The Founding Fathers warned against allowing  impeachment to become a political weapon. In this case, House Democrats  crossed that line. 

  Rejecting the abuse of power and obstruction of Congress articles  before us will affirm our belief and the impeachment standards intended  by the Founders. With my votes to acquit President Trump, justice will  be served. The Senate has faithfully executed its constitutional duties  to hear and judge the charges leveled against the President. 

  I remain hopeful that we can finally set aside this flawed partisan  investigation, prosecution, and persecution of President Trump. The  people of Mississippi and this great Nation are more interested in us  getting back to doing the work they sent us here to do.
