Hyde-Smith Votes with Appropriations Committee to Advance USMCA Trade Pact


U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today supported Senate Appropriations Committee approval of legislation to implement the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a trade pact that holds the promise of expanding markets for agricultural and manufactured goods produced in Mississippi.

The Appropriations Committee must approve the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (HR.5430) before the full Senate can give final approval to the trade agreement.  The committee voted 29-2 for the bill.

"This trade agreement will expand the market for agricultural, manufacturing, and other goods and services produced in Mississippi.  It will also help us meet 21st century realities like fighting the theft of trade secrets and improving e-commerce across our borders," Hyde-Smith said.  "We've waited long enough to finalize this agreement, and I look forward to the full Senate voting on the USMCA as soon as possible."

Hyde-Smith, who also serves on the Senate Agriculture Committee, pointed out that Canada and Mexico import the most products from Mississippi.  The Magnolia State exported $11.8 billion in goods in 2018, a level of commerce expected to grow with implementation of the USMCA.  

The Senate Majority Leader has indicated the full Senate could vote on HR.5430 this week--as early as Thursday--if other Senate committees with jurisdiction also approve it over the implementing legislation.

The trade pact legislation passed the House on Dec. 19, 2019, following an unnecessary yearlong delay by House Democrats.  Hyde-Smith criticized the delay in an October speech to the Senate.
