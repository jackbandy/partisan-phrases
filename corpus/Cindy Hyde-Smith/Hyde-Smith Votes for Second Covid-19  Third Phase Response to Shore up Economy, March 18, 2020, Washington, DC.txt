U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today voted to send President Trump the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the second bill passed by Congress to meet the nation's needs during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

President Trump has signaled he will sign the bill (HR.6201), which focuses on additional aid to strengthen the U.S. health care system while also assisting workers, families, and businesses.  At the same time, work is underway in the Senate on a third response package aimed at shoring up the U.S. economy.

"As a nation, we have never experienced anything like the health, social, and economic disruptions caused by this coronavirus," Hyde-Smith said.  "The bill going to the President is not perfect, but it will provide help as we work on a more comprehensive plan to secure the nation's economic foundation and ensure health care providers have what they need to get us past this pandemic."

HR.6201, among other things, will:
