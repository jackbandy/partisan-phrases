Wicker Denounces China's Plans to Crack Down on Hong Kong


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., joined a resolution led by U.S. Senator Josh Hawley, R-Mo., condemning the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) proposed "sweeping national security law" for Hong Kong that would ban "secession, subversion, and foreign interference." The legislation is an apparent attempt to silence protests that have rocked the independent Chinese city in recent months.

"The protesters in Hong Kong deserve to be heard, not beaten and oppressed. This newly-proposed law is further proof the Chinese Communist Party is intent on consolidating power and control by any means necessary. I am proud to join this effort to call out Beijing for its abuse of basic human rights and to reiterate America's support for the "one-country, two-systems' policy that has governed Hong Kong," Wicker said.

The resolution states that passage of this proposed law would put Beijing in direct violation of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law. These governing documents have allowed Hong Kong to preserve a free, capitalist society since 1997 when Great Britain returned control over the city to China. Recent moves by Beijing to erode the principles outlined in these documents have sparked protests in Hong Kong.

The resolution calls upon all free nations to support the principles that have sustained Hong Kong's independence, and to stand firm against the CCP's campaign to destroy Hong Kong residents' basic liberties and human rights.

Wicker recently joined legislation calling upon China to release Hong Kong protesters who have been detained.
