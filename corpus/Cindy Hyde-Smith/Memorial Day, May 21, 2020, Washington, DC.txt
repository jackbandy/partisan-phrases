Memorial Day


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, due to the coronavirus pandemic,  Memorial Day commemorations will be different this year. The  coronavirus may force us to continue Memorial Day traditions virtually  or privately with our families. Nevertheless, it is important for us to  take time this weekend to honor those who bravely gave their lives for  all of us. 

  Throughout our Nation's history, courageous and patriotic men and  women have gone into battle and lost their lives to protect the  freedoms that make being a U.S. citizen such a blessing. I am proud  that Mississippians throughout our history have readily committed to  serving our Nation. Likewise, we are equally committed to honoring the  fallen and their families. 

  It was Mississippians who helped initiate the solemn act of  commemorating those lost in battle. Columbus, Mississippi, proudly  claims rights to originating Decoration Day, when women began  decorating the graves of the all casualties not long after the Civil  War. 

  This year, despite all precautions we must take, there are ways we  can remember and honor the fallen. For my part, I honor the brave  Mississippians who have dedicated their lives to protecting our  citizens, and I pray for the  families who share in their sacred sacrifice.
