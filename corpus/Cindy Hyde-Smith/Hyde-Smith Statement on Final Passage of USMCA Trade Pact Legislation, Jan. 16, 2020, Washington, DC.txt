Hyde-Smith Statement on Final Passage of USMCA Trade Pact Legislation


U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), who serves on the Senate Agriculture Committee, today issued the following statement regarding final passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA):

"My vote for the USMCA is one of the best I've taken because I am certain it will benefit and grow the billions of dollars in trade Mississippi does with our North American neighbors.  Agriculture and manufacturing will grow, but improvements in the trade agreement also creates opportunities for e-commerce and small business.

"This is a big win for our country and President Trump deserves credit for putting American trade policies on a stronger foundation."

Hyde-Smith voted with the Senate to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (HR.5430), clearing it for President Trump's signature.  The House passed this legislation in December, but only after House Democrats sat on it for more than a year.

Mississippi trade with Canada and Mexico totaled $3.4 billion in 2018, which represents a significant portion of the state's overall commerce with foreign nations
