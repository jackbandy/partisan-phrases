National Police Week 2025

Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, as our Nation comes together to  observe National Police Week, we honor the courageous men and women in  law enforcement who have given their lives in service to others.

This is a time of remembrance, reflection, and gratitude--a moment to  recognize not only those fallen heroes, but also the families, friends,  and loved ones who share in their sacrifice and carry the weight of  their loss.

In my home State of Mississippi and across the country, law  enforcement officers serve on the frontlines with unwavering  dedication. Despite increasing challenges and adversity, they show up  every day--facing risk and uncertainty--not for the recognition, but  out of a deep commitment to protect and serve their fellow citizens.  Their courage is matched by the strength of their families, who live  with the daily reality of what that service demands.

These public servants are more than officers. They are mentors,  protectors, neighbors, community leaders, and patriots. In Mississippi,  we are blessed with extraordinary individuals who wear the badge with  honor and integrity. Every life lost in the line of duty is a tragedy  that affects us all.

Today, I want to specifically honor the four Mississippi officers  whose names have been added to the National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial this year--four heroes who protected our communities, four  heroes whose legacy will never be forgotten.

We remember: Jeremy Todd Malone, a George County Sheriff's deputy who  was shot and killed during a traffic stop in January 2024. He served in  law enforcement for 21 years and is survived by his wife, three  daughters, mother, and two brothers.

We remember: Troy Lamar Floyd, a Summit Police Department patrolman  who was shot and killed in August 2024 while conducting a checkpoint.  Patrolman Floyd had served in law enforcement for more than 20 years  and is survived by his wife and children.

We remember: Michael Elaine Griffin, a government affairs liaison and  U.S. Marine Corps veteran, who died in the line of duty in September  2023 after encountering a car accident involving a partially overturned  vehicle, which unfortunately shifted and fell on top of him. After  retiring from the Mississippi Highway Patrol with 34 years of service,  he served as a sworn officer with the Mississippi Department of Public  Safety for 2 years until he passed away. He is survived by his wife and  daughter.

And we remember: Robert Daye Daffin, Jr., a narcotics agent who  served with the George County Sheriff's Office for more than 14 years.  He died in 2021 from complications as a result of contracting COVID-19  in the line of duty and is survived by his daughter, parents, and three  siblings.

We honor their memory and stand beside their families with enduring  respect.

Remembrance must also inspire action. Supporting law enforcement  means ensuring our officers have the tools, resources, support, and  safety that they deserve on and off duty. It also means fostering a  climate of respect and appreciation for the burdens they and their  loved ones carry.

I remain steadfast in my commitment to those who wear the uniform and  to the families who sacrifice alongside them. Their service deserves  not only our gratitude but also our unwavering support.

Let us come together this week and throughout the year to honor their  service, remember their sacrifices, and renew our promise to stand with  those who protect our communities. May God bless our fallen heroes,  their families, all who serve in law enforcement, and the United States  of America.
