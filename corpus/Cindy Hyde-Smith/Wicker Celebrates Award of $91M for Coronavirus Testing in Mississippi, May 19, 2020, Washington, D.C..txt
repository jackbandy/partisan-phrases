Wicker Celebrates Award of $91M for Coronavirus Testing in Mississippi


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today celebrated the award of $91,086,258 to the Mississippi Department of Health from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support the expansion of coronavirus testing in Mississippi. Expanded testing will help Mississippi with its efforts to re-open the economy.

"Reopening our economy does not mean ignoring the virus. We can, and must, continue to be smart about the pandemic while getting back to work," Wicker said. "This new funding will enable a massive expansion of testing in Mississippi, which will enable more people to go back to work and resume their social lives safely."

The award to Mississippi is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration and Congress to expand access to coronavirus testing.

The state will be able to use the funding to meet the testing goals laid out in the governor's COVID-19 testing plan, including purchasing test kits and other supplies as necessary.
