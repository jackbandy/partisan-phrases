Hyde-Smith Votes to Protect & Defend the Unborn


U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), a member of the Senate Pro-Life Caucus, today voted to proceed with two bills that would protect and defend the lives of unborn children, including those who survive abortion procedures.

Hyde-Smith voted with a majority of her fellow Senators to allow debate and passage of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act (S.311) and the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (S.3275).  Unfortunately, neither measure received the required 60 votes needed to proceed to full consideration.  The Senate voted 56-41 on S.311 and 53-44 on S.3275.

"The disappointing votes on these two important bills will not deter us from continuing to fight to protect and defend the unborn," said Hyde-Smith, who is an original cosponsor on both measures.  "We will continue to press for pro-life policies, including laws that mandate medical care for babies who survive an abortion and that prohibit elective abortions after 20 weeks."

The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, introduced by Senator Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), would require medical practitioners to provide professional skill, care, and diligence to protect a baby born alive following an abortion procedure.  It would also authorize criminal consequences on health care providers who violate the law.

The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, authored by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), would prohibit elective abortions after 20 weeks, the point at which scientific evidence indicates an unborn child can feel pain.  The United States is among only seven nations, including China and North Korea, which permit elective abortions after 20 weeks.
