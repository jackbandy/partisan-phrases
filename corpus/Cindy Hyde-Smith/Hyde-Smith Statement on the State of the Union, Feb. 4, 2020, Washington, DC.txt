Hyde-Smith Statement on the State of the Union


U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today issued the following statement regarding President Trump's third State of the Union Address to the nation:

"I applaud President Trump for remaining optimistic despite these contentious times.  He reminds us that there is more work to do to continue the great American comeback.

"The President's strong America-first, pro-growth agenda is succeeding.  We have millions of new jobs, record-low unemployment rates, manufacturing growth, new trade agreements, and a soaring stock market.

"Families in Mississippi and across the nation are reaping the benefit of a nation that is secure and enjoying a strong economy.

"We need to work together to build on those successes to benefit more working families and lift more Americans out of poverty.  We need to come together on major challenges like investing in our infrastructure and lowering the cost of health care and prescription drugs.

"I will continue to work with the President and my colleagues to protect our nation and to promote greater opportunities for families to prosper in this great nation."
