Hyde-Smith Cosponsors Resolution Commending U.S. Military Intelligence for Ending Soleimani Reign of Terror


U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today became an original cosponsor of a resolution applauding the U.S. military and intelligence community for their role in ending the reign of terror orchestrated by Iranian military chief Qasem Soleimani.

The resolution also commends President Trump for ordering the operation to eliminate Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) terrorist organization.  Soleimani died in a U.S. unmanned airstrike in Iraq last week.  

"Eliminating Qasem Soleimani rid the world of a terrorist mastermind whose actions resulted in the loss of hundreds of American lives, while destabilizing global security for many years.  Any fair assessment of the operation targeting him can only be seen as justified and worthwhile," Hyde-Smith said.  "It is a pleasure to cosponsor this resolution to commend those who carried out this mission to remove this force for evil."

The resolution also reaffirms the U.S. Senate "commitment to disrupting, dismantling, and defeating the IRGC-QF and affiliated organizations around the world that threaten United States national security, and bringing terrorists to justice."
