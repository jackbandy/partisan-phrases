Wicker Statement on Mississippi National Guard Activation


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today released the following statement upon learning the Mississippi National Guard has been activated in support of civil authorities in Washington, D.C., to provide a safe and secure environment for protesters:

"I am proud of our Mississippi National Guardsmen for their work to support safety in our nation's capital and to protect the many individuals who have been exercising their constitutional right to protest peacefully. Our state's guardsmen will be partners to local law enforcement as they work to prevent further injury, damage, or destruction in the days ahead.

 "Unfortunately, this activation became necessary after peaceful protests on behalf of George Floyd were hijacked by extreme elements that have nothing to do with Floyd's cause. These individuals are exploiting the hurt and pain felt by so many Americans to carry out senseless acts of vandalism and violence."
