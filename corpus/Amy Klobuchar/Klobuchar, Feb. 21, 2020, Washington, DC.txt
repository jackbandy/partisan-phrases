Klobuchar, Smith Announce More Than $3 Million in Grants for Critical Investments in Affordable Housing and Community Development Across Minnesota


U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith announced seven separate NeighborWorks grants totaling $3,087,500 for community organizations throughout Minnesota. The grants will help more Minnesota families realize their dream of owning a home, increase access to affordable rental units, provide needed financial and counseling services to households in the state, and support the repair or rehabilitation of existing homes.

"Availability of affordable housing that families can fit in their budget is one of the most important issues for our state," Klobuchar said. "These additional resources will help communities across Minnesota build and maintain reliable, affordable housing. It will also help Minnesotans gain access to mortgage loans and vital community services, including healthcare, education, and job opportunities."

"Without a safe, stable, affordable place to live, it's hard to make anything else in your life work--keep your job, go to school, stay healthy or engage with your community,"  Smith, a member of the Senate Banking and Urban Affairs Committee, said. "In supporting grant funding for NeighborWorks and affordable housing, we're helping families grow and be a part of successful communities." 

Minnesota organizations receiving these grants include: Aeon of Minneapolis ($581,500), CommonBond Communities of St. Paul ($577,500), Dayton's Bluff Neighborhood Housing Services of St. Paul ($275,500), Midwest Minnesota Community Development Corporation of Detroit Lakes ($545,000), NeighborWorks Home Partners of St. Paul ($465,000), One Roof Community Housing of Duluth ($278,000), and Southwest Minnesota Housing Partnership of Slayton ($365,000). Many of these organizations work on housing and community development projects across Minnesota.
