Letter to the Hon. Mitch McConnell, Majority Leader, the Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, the Hon. Charles Schumer, Minority Leader, the Hon. Kevin McCarthy, Minority Leader - Klobuchar, Eshoo Lead Bicameral Letter Urging Congressional Leaders to Ensure College Students in Need Have Access to High-Speed Internet


We write to urge you to include dedicated funding in future legislation to help ensure that collegeand university students with the greatest financial need can access high-speed internet during thecoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.As colleges and universities across the country have transitioned to distance learning to limit thespread of coronavirus, many students who relied on campus resources are struggling to continuetheir education from home.1 One of the biggest barriers for students of color, students in ruralareas, and other disadvantaged students is lack of access to reliable and affordable internetconnectivity, equipment required for connectivity, and devices. These are all required toparticipate in distance learning. Even before the pandemic, only 66 percent of black households,261 percent of Hispanic households,3 and 63 percent of rural households had access tobroadband,4 and one survey found that about 20 percent of college students did not haveconsistent access to technology, such as laptops and tablets.5 Another survey found that 30percent of students experienced difficulty connecting to the internet when accessing course material online during the pandemic.6 Without action from Congress to address these disparities,students are at serious risk of falling behind and missing out on job and academic opportunitiesprovided by the internet.While the spring semester is ending, colleges and universities are moving summer classes andprograms online and will likely continue distance learning into the next school year. As itremains unclear when effective treatment or a vaccine will be available, connecting college anduniversity students to the internet is even more essential.7Although the CARES Act included funding for institutions of higher education, it did not includededicated funding sufficient to ensure that college and university students have essential internetconnectivity. It is for this reason we introduced the bicameral Supporting Connectivity forHigher Education Students in Need Act,8 which is supported by over 60 higher education, civilrights, and public interest organizations.9 We urge you to include $1 billion in dedicated fundingin a future coronavirus relief package to establish an Emergency Higher Education Connectivityfund at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to help ensure thatcollege and university students with the greatest financial need at historically Black colleges anduniversities, Tribal colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and other minorityserving institutions, as well as rural-serving institutions, can pay for at-home internetconnectivity, equipment, and devices such as laptops and tablets.Thank you for your attention to this highly important issue. We stand ready to work with you tohelp keep college and university students connected at this critical time.
