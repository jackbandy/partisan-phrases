Klobuchar, Smith Announce Over $33 Million in Funding to Support Efforts to End Homelessness


U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Tina Smith (D-MN) announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded Minnesota $33,500,442 in Continuum of Care Grants (CoC) in FY2019 to support efforts to end homelessness.

"Over half a million Americans experience homelessness every night, and this funding will help address the unique challenges faced by homeless populations throughout our state," Klobuchar said. "I am pleased that we were able to secure these critical investments to help communities across Minnesota provide supportive housing and relief for Minnesotans struggling with homelessness."

"Without the solid foundation of a safe, stable place to live, nothing else in your life works," Smith said. "I am glad to see HUD providing over 200 grants to Minnesota communities because we know that individuals and families experience housing instability in virtually every area--whether it's rural, urban or suburban. I am working to get Tribes access to these grants as well so they have the resources to combat homelessness on Tribal lands. We must do everything we can to help all of our communities grow and thrive."

The CoC Program is designed to promote a community-wide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness; to provide funding for efforts by nonprofit providers, States, and local governments to quickly re-house homeless individuals, families, persons fleeing domestic violence, and youth while minimizing the trauma and dislocation caused by homelessness; to promote access to and effective utilization of mainstream programs by homeless individuals and families; and to optimize self-sufficiency among those experiencing homelessness.
