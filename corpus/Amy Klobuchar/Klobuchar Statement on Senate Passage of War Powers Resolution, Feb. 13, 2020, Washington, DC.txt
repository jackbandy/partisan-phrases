Klobuchar Statement on Senate Passage of War Powers Resolution


U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) released this statement following passage of a war powers resolution in the Senate that directs President Donald Trump to remove U.S. military forces from hostilities against Iran unless the Administration receives Congressional authorization.

"Today's vote sends a clear message that the U.S. president does not have the authority to attack Iran without Congressional approval and is an important step in restoring Congress's proper Constitutional role in authorizing military force."
