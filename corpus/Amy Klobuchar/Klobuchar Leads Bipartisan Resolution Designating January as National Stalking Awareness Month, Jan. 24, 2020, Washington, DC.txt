Klobuchar Leads Bipartisan Resolution Designating January as National Stalking Awareness Month


U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) introduced a resolution designating January 2020 as National Stalking Awareness Month to raise awareness on the dangers of stalking and educate Americans about how to prevent this serious offense. The resolution is cosponsored by every woman senator on the Judiciary Committee--Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)--as well as Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Mike Crapo (R-ID).

Approximately 1 in 6 women in the U.S. have experienced stalking victimization at some point in their lifetimes. Klobuchar is the author of the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act, legislation that would, among other things, prevent convicted stalkers from buying or owning a gun--a commonsense update to federal law that many states have already adopted. A provision based on that bill was included in the 2019 Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, which passed the House in April 2019 with bipartisan support.    

"As a former prosecutor, I have seen firsthand the serious emotional and physical toll stalking can take on victims, and I know that many fear not only for their own lives but also the safety of their loved ones," Klobuchar said. "Our bipartisan resolution will raise awareness about the dangers of stalking, the need to ensure that victims are protected, and the resources available to help survivors to get their lives back on track."

Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) will introduce a companion resolution in the House of Representatives. The resolution compliments efforts by the Stalking Prevention, Awareness, and Resource Center (SPARC) to bring attention to Stalking Awareness Month.

Klobuchar is a national leader in the fight to prevent domestic violence. She is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and prior to her time in the Senate, Klobuchar served as Hennepin County Attorney. Last year, Klobuchar and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) reintroduced the Abby Honold Act--the legislation was inspired by Abby Honold, a former student of the University of Minnesota and rape survivor, who brought this issue to the forefront. Minnesota Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN) also reintroduced bipartisan companion legislation in the House of Representatives. 

In 2018, Klobuchar and Cornyn's SAFER Act--legislation that reauthorizes, strengthens, and extends the Sexual Assault Forensic Registry program in an effort to help reduce the national rape kit backlog--was signed into law. In 2016, the Klobuchar-backed bipartisan Justice for All Reauthorization Act was signed into law. The law strengthens the rights of crime victims by providing the protection they need to restore their lives and enhances law enforcement's ability to proactively stop violent criminals. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act also aims to reduce the rape kit backlog by supporting grant programs that fund forensic testing.
