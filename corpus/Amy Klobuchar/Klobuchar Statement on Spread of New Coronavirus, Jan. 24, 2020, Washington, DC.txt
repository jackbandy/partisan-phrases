Klobuchar Statement on Spread of New Coronavirus


U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) issued this statement in response to the outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV ) that began in Wuhan, China. At least 26 people have died and more than 830 have been sickened by this virus. There are two confirmed U.S. infections in the U.S. and 63 suspected cases -- including two in Minnesota.

"Ensuring that families, health care providers, and local and state health departments across the country are prepared to detect, prevent, and treat the coronavirus must be our top priority. It is also crucial that we work together with our international partners to develop a comprehensive public health strategy to fight this outbreak. I will continue working to provide the CDC and other agencies with the resources they need to track and combat this virus."
