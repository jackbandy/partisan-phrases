Klobuchar Announces Coast Guard has the Same Priority Access to Child Care Programs


U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar announced that the Department of Defense (DoD) has amended a policy that hindered U.S. Coast Guard members from accessing DoD child care programs. The announcement follows a letter Klobuchar joined with 20 Members of Congress to Defense Secretary Mark Esper urging equal prioritization for children of members of the U.S. Coast Guard in DoD child development centers.

On February 21, the Department of Defense issued a memorandum establishing a tiered priority system for military members' access to DoD child care services, with active duty Coast Guard members ranking below other DoD active duty personnel. Last week, the Department amended this policy to give children of active duty Coast Guard members the same level of prioritization and access to military child care centers as their DoD counterparts.

"I am glad that the Department of Defense took action to ensure our Coast Guardsmen and women have equal access to the child care they need," Klobuchar said. "Many of our servicemembers rely on these child care programs, and I will continue working to ensure our U.S. Coast Guard and their families have the support and resources they need and deserve."
