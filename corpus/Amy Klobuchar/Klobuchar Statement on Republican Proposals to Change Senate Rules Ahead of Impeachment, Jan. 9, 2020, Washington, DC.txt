Klobuchar Statement on Republican Proposals to Change Senate Rules Ahead of Impeachment


U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ranking Member of the Senate Rules Committee with jurisdiction over changes to Senate rules, issued this statement after Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced a resolution demanding the House of Representatives to immediately appoint impeachment managers and transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Earlier this week, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced legislation to change the Senate rules to allow Republicans to dismiss the articles of impeachment against the President.

"You don't get to change the rules in the middle of an impeachment because you want to protect the president from the evidence--attempting to do that on the eve of trial to avoid a full and fair hearing of the facts and evidence would be a violation of senators' oaths of office. We have a constitutional duty to take this case, and justice demands that we hear from witnesses who have information regarding the allegations against the president. It is that simple. As Ranking Member of the Rules Committee, I will continue to fight against attempts to put the president above the law."
