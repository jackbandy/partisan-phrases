Klobuchar Statement on Reports of Uber's Potential Acquisition of Grubhub


U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, issued the following statement after reports emerged about Uber's interest in acquiring Grubhub.

"Uber's potential acquisition of Grubhub raises serious concerns, as it would combine two of the three largest food delivery app providers and could adversely impact consumers, innovation and restaurants at a time when many are struggling due to the coronavirus. Consumers and restaurants are using these services more than ever, and the last thing they need is an increase in the extremely high fees already paid to these companies. Protecting competition remains especially important as we continue to confront the financial impacts of the coronavirus pandemic."
