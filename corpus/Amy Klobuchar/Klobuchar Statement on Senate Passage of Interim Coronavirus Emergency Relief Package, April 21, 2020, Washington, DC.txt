Klobuchar Statement on Senate Passage of Interim Coronavirus Emergency Relief Package


U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) released the following statement after the Senate unanimously approved the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.

"As our country confronts this public health and economic crisis, this emergency relief legislation is a step forward in ensuring those most in need get access to critical resources. This relief will fund a crucial scale up of testing and a national strategy that allows us to begin to take steps to re-open our economy, provide critical funding for our health care workers and hospitals, and get more resources to our small businesses - including additional funding to address the needs of rural and minority owned businesses. But more needs to be done.

"Future legislation must also protect our democracy by providing additional funding for states to expand vote by mail and early voting. As we prepare for November, we need to take action now to make sure no voter has to choose between their health and exercising their right to vote. And we will continue to fight to ensure our state and local governments on the front lines of combating this pandemic have the resources and support they need."
