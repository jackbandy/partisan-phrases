Klobuchar Statement on Failed Vote on Whether to Allow Witnesses or Documents in Trump Impeachment Trial


U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) issued this statement following the failed vote on whether to consider subpoenas for witnesses or documents in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.

"The purpose of a trial is to get to the truth. Without witnesses or documents, this is not a fair trial. The American people deserve to hear from people with firsthand knowledge of the president's actions."
