Klobuchar Statement on Senate Passage of Families First Coronavirus Response Act


U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) released the following statement after the passage of a coronavirus (COVID-19) response bill in the U.S Senate.

"As we respond to the coronavirus pandemic, our first priority is public health. This crisis is also having an enormous impact on our economic well-being. This legislation will expand much needed testing, provide emergency paid sick and family leave, strengthen unemployment insurance, and strengthen food security initiatives to protect Americans and their families as they grapple with the effects of this public health crisis in all aspects of their lives. As we focus our effort on a new set of relief measures for the people of this country, we must make sure that frontline health care workers have access to critical supplies, that more American workers have paid leave benefits, that unemployment benefits are expanded, and that every American's right to vote in the upcoming elections is protected. The American people are resilient and we will work through this together."
