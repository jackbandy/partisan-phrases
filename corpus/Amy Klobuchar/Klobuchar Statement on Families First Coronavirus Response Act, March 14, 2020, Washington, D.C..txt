Klobuchar Statement on Families First Coronavirus Response Act


Today, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) released the following statement after the passage of a coronavirus (COVID-19) response bill in the House of Representatives.

"As we take on coronavirus, we cannot lose sight of the most vulnerable among us. The coronavirus response bill passed in the House of Representatives would expand much needed testing, provide emergency sick leave, strengthen unemployment insurance, and establish food security initiatives to protect Americans and their families as they grapple with the effects of this public health crisis in all aspects of their lives. I call on my colleagues in the Senate to pass this bill immediately. Now is the time to come together as a country and take action."
