Letter to the Hon. Michael Pence, Vice President of the United States - Members of Minnesota Congressional Delegation Urge Administration to Provide Critical Assistance to the State in Response to Coronavirus Pandemic


We write to call on the Administration to provide critical assistance to the State of Minnesota in its efforts to respond to and mitigate the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

We have heard serious concerns from medical personnel in our State regarding the ability to process coronavirus testing due to the limited availability of needed components such as reagents and lab supplies. It is for that reason that we ask the Administration to assist our State in ensuring access to all supplies needed to process at least 15,000 tests per month. In addition, we urge you to take measures to address supply chain issues resulting in shortages of reagents, as deficiencies in testing components have forced the State to ration the number of tests performed at its public health laboratory.

We must do more to help prevent and respond swiftly to the spread of COVID-19. Ensuring adequate access to testing must be a vital part of that response.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent request.

Sincerely,
