Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025


Mr. SHEEHY. Mr. President, where was the Democrat outrage when 8,000  Active-Duty Reserve troops were unceremoniously and with no due process  fired out of the military without benefits? Where was the outrage when  thousands of first responders and police officers, firefighters,  nurses, and doctors lost their employment because they had COVID  vaccine hesitancy? There was no outrage, there was no call of betrayal  under President Biden when all that happened.

The truth is, this bill is pro-veteran. It adds $6 billion to our  veteran spending. It adds the largest pay increase for our warfighters  in a generation. This is a pro-veteran bill.

Let's stop using veterans as political pawns and keep the government  funded.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1274
