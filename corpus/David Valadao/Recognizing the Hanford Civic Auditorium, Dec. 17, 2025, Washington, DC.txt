Recognizing the Hanford Civic Auditorium


Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Hanford Civic  Auditorium on their 100th anniversary. For the past century, this  iconic building has stood as a symbol of Hanford, California's rich  history, architectural heritage, and cultural identity.

Since opening its doors in 1925, the Hanford Civic Auditorium has  served as the cornerstone of community life--a vibrant hub for artistic  performances, civic engagement, and social events. From city council  meetings and public forums to receptions, family reunions, and  community celebrations, it has hosted countless gatherings that reflect  the heart and spirit of Hanford. More than just a venue, the auditorium  plays a vital role in fostering civic pride, cultural expression, and a  shared appreciation for the city's rich local history--ensuring its  legacy will endure. The original vision for the Hanford Civic  Auditorium was not only to meet the needs of a growing community, but  also to honor the brave members of our military who answered the call  to arms during WWI--and to memorialize those who never returned. Today,  the City of Hanford proudly designates the auditorium as a local  historical and cultural landmark. This recognition is made possible by  the dedicated staff and team members who work tirelessly behind the  scenes to ensure the auditorium's continued success.

I extend my heartfelt thanks to those who have contributed to  preserving and promoting the Hanford Civic Auditorium. Their commitment  ensures it will continue to serve the people of Kings County and stand  as a living testament to the community's values and history.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to  join me in celebrating the Hanford Civic Auditorium on their 100th  anniversary. Its contributions to the cultural and civic life of  Hanford will continue to resonate for generations to come.
