Recognizing the Maddy Institute


Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Maddy  Institute on its 25th anniversary and to thank them for their  significant contributions to the Central Valley.

Established in 1999 by the California Legislature, the Maddy  Institute honors the life and service of Senator Kenneth L. ``Ken''  Maddy. Senator Maddy's integrity, legislative expertise, and commitment  to bipartisanship left a lasting legacy--one that the Maddy Institute  continues to uphold.

Since its founding, the Maddy Institute has inspired citizens of all  ages to learn about the democratic process and engage in civil  dialogue. Through partnerships with four universities, it has offered  young adults hands-on opportunities to participate in civic engagement,  serve their communities, and develop strong leadership skills. Nearly  600 alumni now serve in business, government, and the nonprofit sector,  which is a testament to the Maddy Institute's impact.

My District and Washington, D.C. offices have welcomed interns from  the Maddy Institute throughout my time in Congress. Their local  expertise and interest in government make the interns invaluable  members of my team. I'm proud to support a program that promotes the  next generation of public servants.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to  join me in congratulating the Maddy Institute on 25 years of service.  By educating, engaging, and empowering young people, the Maddy  Institute is helping shape the next generation of leaders in the  Central Valley and across our Nation.
