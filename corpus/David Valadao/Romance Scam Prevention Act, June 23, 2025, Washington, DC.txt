Romance Scam Prevention Act


Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge support for my bill, the  Romance Scam Prevention Act. Every year, millions of Americans from all  ages and backgrounds use dating apps and websites to make connections.

For many, online dating has made it easier to build relationships.  Unfortunately, there are countless stories of criminals using these  sites for fraudulent activity.

While it is sadly common to see users lie about things like their age  and occupation, romance scammers use fake profiles to develop  connections and emotionally or financially exploit unsuspecting users.  According to the Federal Trade Commission, Americans lost over $1.1  billion in 2023 alone, with senior citizens being the age group most at  risk.

There have been countless stories of people being conned out of their  entire life savings, all because they believed they had found love  online. People who meet online often take their conversations to other  communication platforms and might not know that they are talking to  someone who has been removed from the original dating app.

This bill requires dating platforms to issue fraud ban notifications  to users who have interacted with an account who has been removed for  fraudulent activity.

As criminals are becoming more sophisticated when it comes to  exploiting victims online, it is time to put safeguards in place to  protect users from financial fraud.

I thank Chairman Guthrie and his staff at the Committee on Energy and  Commerce for their work on this important bill, as well as my co-leads,  Representatives Brittany Pettersen,  Tom Suozzi, and Craig Goldman.
