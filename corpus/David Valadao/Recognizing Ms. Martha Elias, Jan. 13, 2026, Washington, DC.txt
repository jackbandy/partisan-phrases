https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698972/recognizing-ms-martha-elias


Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Martha Elias  for her well-earned retirement from Nueva High School and for her  decades of dedicated service to the Lamont community. Shortly after  completing her education in Mexico, Ms. Elias immigrated to the United  States and began her professional career as a bilingual secretary at a  printing company. Determined to further her education, she attended  Brigham Young University in Utah, where she earned a bachelor's degree  in Spanish Teaching and Latin American Studies. In 1991, Ms. Elias  continued her commitment to education by earning a teaching credential  in Bakersfield, going on to serve students at both Arvin High School  and Highland High School. Since 2010, Ms. Elias has been a trusted  counselor and dedicated English Language Development Coordinator at  Nueva High School.

Through her compassion, professionalism, and deep cultural roots, she  built meaningful relationships with students and families alike. She  made it her mission to ensure every student felt supported, confident,  and prepared with the skills needed to succeed beyond graduation. Ms.  Elias' impact extends far beyond the classroom. She has been a mentor  to colleagues, a trusted partner to parents, and a pillar of the  greater Kern County community. As the Master of Ceremonies for academic  award assemblies, she brought families together to celebrate student  achievement, often receiving heartfelt thanks from parents whose  children's lives she helped shape. Under her leadership and guidance,  Nueva High School achieved significant milestones, including the  highest graduation rate in alternative education, increased scholarship  attainment, and record participation in ROTC programs.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to  join me in recognizing Ms. Martha Elias for her extraordinaly career,  her lasting impact on generations of students, and her unwavering  dedication to the Lamont community. Her service exemplifies the  difference one committed educator can make, and she leaves behind a  legacy that will be felt for years to come.
