Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my dear friend,  fellow farmer, and colleague, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.

I have known Doug for about 16 years, going back to our time together  in the State legislature. From day one, his commitment to the people of  northern California, especially those in agricultural communities, was  clear.

In Congress, Doug was one of the fiercest advocates for wildfire  mitigation, disaster recovery, California water issues, and farmers and  ranchers who keep this country fed.

As chairman of the Western Caucus, he fought tirelessly for domestic  energy production, public land access, and rural communities that way  too often get overlooked.

Beyond his lasting legacy as a public official, Doug was my friend.  We served together in the State legislature, and one year, on my  birthday, he stopped by my office, not with a card but with a bag of  rice and just a little Post-it Note that said: Happy birthday.

I brought that bag home, gave it to my mom, and she made Portuguese  rice pudding for him, and I brought it back. The next week, he brought  me another bag of rice, and still to this day brought up that he wanted  more. Doug just had one of those senses of humor that you loved.

Doug was a friend to all and someone you could always count on for  leadership, loyalty, and just a good laugh. He will be deeply missed in  the Halls of Congress.

My prayers are with his wife, Jill, his children, and all of his  family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.
