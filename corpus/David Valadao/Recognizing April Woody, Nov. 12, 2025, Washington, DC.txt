Recognizing April Woody


Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today alongside my colleague  Congressman Vince Fong to recognize Ms. April Woody on being awarded  the 2025 Cattlewoman of the Year by the Kern County Cattlewomen's  Association.

Nearly sixty years ago, April Woody joined her husband, Ron Woody, in  continuing his family's cattle ranching operation. Though new to  ranching, she quickly learned the ropes and became an essential part of  the operation, helping to carry forward a legacy rooted in hard work  and dedication to the family business. Ms. Woody joined the Kern County  Cattlewomen in 1969 and became deeply involved in the organization's  community work. She organized the fair booth, served on the Cattle  Princess Selection Committee, and brought humor to the High Fever  Follies fundraiser by wearing the group's famous ``beef cut suit.''  Following her early involvement with the Kern County Cattlewomen, Ms.  Woody began a distinguished career in education. She taught both junior  high and high school English before earning two master's degrees in  Pupil Personnel Services and Marriage, Family, and Child Counseling.  For the final sixteen years of her career, she served as a counselor at  Centennial High School in Bakersfield, where she dedicated herself to  the academic and personal development of all students. Since her  retirement, Ms. Woody has reconnected with the cattle community and  remains involved with the Kern County Cattlewomen. Over the past nine  years, she has served in numerous leadership roles, including Vice  President and President. Currently she serves as Secretary and on the  Board of Directors, chairs the organization's annual Clay Shoot, and  has chaired the Scholarship Committee for seven years. Beyond her  service to Kern County Cattlewomen, Ms. Woody also remains active in  her church and throughout the community.

Mr. Speaker, we ask our colleagues in the House of Representatives to  join us in congratulating Ms. April Woody on being named Kern County's  2025 Cattlewoman of the Year. Her dedication to agriculture, education,  and service to the community embodies the values that define the  Central Valley.
