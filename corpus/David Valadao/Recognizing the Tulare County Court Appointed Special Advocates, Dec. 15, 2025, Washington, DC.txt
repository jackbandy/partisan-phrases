Recognizing the Tulare County Court Appointed Special Advocates, Casa


Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Tulare County  Court Appointed Special Advocates on their 40-year anniversary.

The Tulare Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) provides support  to the juvenile court and its dependent children, who are innocent  victims of abuse and neglect. CASA was established in 1977 to combat  misrepresentation of these victims and Tulare County CASA was created  in 1984 by concerned members of the community. These strong advocates  step into the court room on behalf of victimized children to help  ensure their cases go smoothly and they can get on track for a better  life.

To date, 15,000 children have been served by the Tulare County CASA  volunteers who have worked over 300,000 volunteer hours. CASA  volunteers come from every walk of life and share a commitment to  improving children's lives and protecting the welfare of our  community's youth.

Organizations like the Tulare County CASA help create a safe  community for our children and I want to thank every volunteer for  their commitment to our youth. Thanks to their work, the children in  our region have an advocate to help protect them from further violence,  abuse, and neglect.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to  join me in celebrating the Tulare County Court Appointed Special  Advocates on their 40th anniversary for their hard work, which will be  felt for generations to come.
