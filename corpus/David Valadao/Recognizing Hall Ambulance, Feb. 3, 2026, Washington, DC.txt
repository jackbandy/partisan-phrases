Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise along with Representative Vince  Fong, to recognize Hall Ambulance on its 55th anniversary and to  commend them for their significant contributions to the Central Valley.  Hall Ambulance was founded on February 10, 1971, when Mr. Harvey L.  Hall began responding to medical aid calls from his home in Bakersfield  using a single Cadillac ambulance. From these humble beginnings, Mr.  Hall built a trusted emergency medical service by forging strong  relationships with patients, emergency room nurses, physicians, and  public safety personnel throughout Kern County. Guided by compassion  and an unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional care, he  established a new standard of care--one defined by innovation,  professionalism, and attention to detail. His leadership helped  transform emergency medical services in the region, from requiring  attendants to accompany patients during transport to introducing  paramedic services to Bakersfield in 1975, placing the community among  the first in California to benefit from pre-hospital advanced life  support care.

Since its founding, Hall Ambulance expanded its reach across Kern  County, serving communities from Wasco to Frazier Park, Taft to Boron,  and many regions in between. Under the continued leadership of Mr.  Hall's wife, Lavonne C. Hall, the company expanded into Delano and grew  to provide paramedic services to ninety-four percent of Kern County's  population.

Hall Ambulance has played a defining role in the evolution of modern  emergency medical services and has earned national recognition for  elevating standards of care within the ambulance industry. In 2020, on  the 50th anniversary of the Wedworth-Townsend Paramedic Act, the  California Ambulance Association and the National EMS Museum honored  Hall Ambulance for its foundational leadership, recognizing the  organization among seventeen native Californians who helped shape  emergency medical services nationwide. Today, more than 500 dedicated  employees continue Mr. Hall's legacy, upholding a mission rooted in  care, compassion, and service.

Mr. Speaker, Representative Vince Fong and I invite our colleagues in  the House of Representatives to join us in congratulating Hall  Ambulance on 55 years of service to the Central Valley. Their steadfast  commitment ensures that families across the region receive lifesaving  emergency medical care when they need it most.
