Recognizing September As National Service Dog Month

Mr. LaLOTA. Mr. Speaker, one in ten American adults lives with a  disability, yet there are only about 16,000 accredited service dogs  nationwide. These dogs provide more than assistance--they offer  independence, dignity, and healing for children, adults, and especially  our veterans carrying both visible and invisible wounds. This is why I  rise today to recognize September as National Service Dog Month.

Organizations like Canine Companions, Paws of War, and America's  VetDogs, headquartered in my home state of New York, are leading the  way. They prepare and place service dogs that make life-changing  impacts, while continuing to stand behind each partnership well beyond  the first match. This month is an opportunity to educate the public  about the vital role service dogs play and the protections in place to  guarantee their access. It is also a time to honor the trainers,  volunteers, and families who make this work possible.

As a Navy veteran, I've seen firsthand the impact these dogs have on  our service members. So I want to thank all of those organizations who  are doing this important work.

We see them. We thank them. We stand with them, and we support them.  I encourage all Americans to join me in celebrating service dogs and  the life-changing bond they share with those they serve.
