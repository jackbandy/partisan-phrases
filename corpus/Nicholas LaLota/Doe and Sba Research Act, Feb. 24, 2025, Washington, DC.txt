Mr. LaLOTA. Mr. Speaker, America's small businesses are the backbone  of Main Street America, yet too many of them face roadblocks when  trying to do business with the Federal Government's largest buyer, the  Department of Energy. That is why I proudly introduced the DOE and SBA  Research Act, which strengthens the relationship between America's  small businesses and the Department of Energy.

This legislation creates a partnership between the Department of  Energy and the Small Business Administration for joint research. It  expands opportunities for entrepreneurs to fuel innovation and drive  economic growth, and it provides small businesses with a clear, more  direct path to collaborate with our national labs on groundbreaking  research and technology development.

Brookhaven National Laboratory in my district is a perfect example of  how small business and Department of Energy partnerships can transform  a region into a premier center for scientific innovation. The  partnerships made possible by the DOE and SBA Research Act will empower  Main Street America to contribute to cutting-edge  research, drive the Department of Energy's mission, fuel American  ingenuity, and keep America at the forefront of scientific innovation  and technological advancements.

I thank my colleagues, Representatives Morrison and Thanedar, for  joining me in introducing this important bipartisan legislation.

This legislation passed the House with unanimous support last  Congress. Unfortunately, we couldn't get it over the finish line in the  Senate in time, so I thank Chairman Williams for his important  leadership in getting it back to the floor and across the finish line a  second time in the House. We will get it done this time.

I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.
