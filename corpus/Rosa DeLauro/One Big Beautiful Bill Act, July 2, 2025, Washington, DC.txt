One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Ms. DeLAURO. I would ask my House Republican colleagues: Have you no  shame?

This bill hands $4.5 trillion in tax cuts to billionaires and the  biggest corporations. It takes healthcare aware from 17 million  Americans. People will die, and 42 million Americans will go hungry.  This bill triggers $500 billion in Medicare cuts. It increases the  budget deficit by $3.3 trillion.

President Trump and House Republicans have abandoned their promise to  lower the cost of living. They are making it worse.

I would say to my Republican colleagues: Have the moral courage to  oppose this bill. The consequences of this vote will come due. They  will not wait until next November. It will come tomorrow, and every day  after, and every phone call and letter that your office answers. When  your constituents tell you they cannot find health coverage or afford  groceries, and they ask what you have done to help, I hope you have the  moral courage to tell them the truth; that you did nothing. Vote  ``no.''
