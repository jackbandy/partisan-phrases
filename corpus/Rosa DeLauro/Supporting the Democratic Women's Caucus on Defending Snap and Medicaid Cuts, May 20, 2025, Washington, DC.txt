Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend Medicaid and the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, from an  ongoing Republican assault.

In a few hours Republicans will meet to advance a bill that abandons  Americans who are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. It guts  Medicaid, which covers health care for children, people with  disabilities, seniors, and low-income workers, and it cuts nearly $300  billion from agriculture and programs that combat hunger, including  food stamps.

This Republican bill cuts Medicaid, forcing states to pay more or  cover fewer people--it cuts benefits.

I think of the 64,000 people in Connecticut, including 27,000  children, who can eat thanks to food stamps.

If this program is pushed back to the states, who have fewer  resources, the children will go hungry, and their families will not be  able to afford healthy foods. In this cost of living crisis, the last  thing we should be doing is making it harder for families to put food  on the table. But that is exactly what Republicans are preparing to do.  The results will be devastating--the largest cut to the most successful  anti-hunger program in American history. All to pay for massive  giveaways to billionaires.
