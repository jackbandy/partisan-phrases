Supporting Ukraine

Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, Democrats will always be a friend to those  fighting for their freedom--and the American people will always stand  with Ukraine.

While ceasefire negotiations may be underway, Ukraine is not giving  up, nor should they. Russia's offensives have stalled. European  partners and allies are still committed to the struggle against  aggression from Putin. And the Ukrainian people are speaking clearly,  through their elected President Zelensky, that they are a sovereign  Nation, and they speak for themselves. Only Ukraine can decide when it  is done fighting--no one else.

It is our job in America to continue to support our ally. History  teaches that aggressors never stop of their own accord. And they are  never satisfied with appeasement. If Vladimir Putin's war is rewarded  with Ukrainian land, he will try again for more.

I will continue to advocate for our ally Ukraine--for their defense,  for the civilian and military resources they need, and for allowing  them to control their own destiny. That is our obligation as an ally  and as the world's strongest democracy.

It is my promise to them. As the lead Democrat on the House  Appropriations Committee, I promise that I will never give up that  fight. I will continue to support resources and funding for the  Ukrainian people, and I urge them not to give up. We must all continue  speaking out, for as long as it takes, until Ukraine is safe and free  once more.
