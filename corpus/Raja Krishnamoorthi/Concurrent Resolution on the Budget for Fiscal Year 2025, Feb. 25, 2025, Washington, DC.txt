Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Chair, I rise today as the ranking member  of the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United  States and the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP, to express serious  concerns about the proposed cuts in the Republicans' budget resolution.

First, the resolution includes $880 billion in cuts to programs that  risk stalling the advancement of technologies crucial to our  competition with the CCP.

Second, these cuts will likely jeopardize our ability to enforce  critical export controls with the Chinese as well as gutting programs  that help us reshore manufacturing from China.

While we have got to restore our fiscal house, these cuts to critical  programs amount to the GOP's perverted version of DEI, devastating,  extreme, and irresponsible.

The CCP is cheering for the GOP budget resolution tonight, and I  object.
