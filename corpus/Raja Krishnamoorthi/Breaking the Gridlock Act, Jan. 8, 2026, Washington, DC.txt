Breaking the Gridlock Act

Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of extension of  the ACA tax credits.

I met Shadene Butchart in Chicago. She has ALS. Since the ACA tax  credits have expired, her health insurance premium consumes the  entirety of her husband's Social Security check. She will not be able  to afford any health insurance to cover this incredibly distressing  disease.

I rise strongly in support, and I urge my colleagues to support it,  as well.
