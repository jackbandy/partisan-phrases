Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Taiwanese American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Chicago (TACCGC) for  its longstanding contributions to economic development,  entrepreneurship, and civic engagement in the Greater Chicago region.

Founded in 1988, TACCGC has served as a vital forum for professionals  and business leaders from a wide range of industries, fostering  collaboration, supporting business growth, and strengthening the local  economy.

Beyond its work in business development, TACCGC actively promotes  Taiwanese American interests, strengthens economic ties between the  United States and Taiwan, and encourages participation in American  civic life. Its commitment to community involvement and international  cooperation reflects the values that drive lasting prosperity.

I want to thank President Lisa Su and the other leaders for their  leadership and service, and I am proud to recognize the organization's  continued positive impact.
