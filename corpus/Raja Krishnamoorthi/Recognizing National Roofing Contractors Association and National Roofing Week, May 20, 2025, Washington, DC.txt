Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  National Roofing Contractors Association headquartered in Itasca,  Illinois, on the occasion of National Roofing Week between June 1-7,  2025.

National Roofing Week honors the efforts of thousands of roofing- related workers and businesses across the country, as well as the  industry's commitment to public service in general. National Roofing  Week is a valuable reminder of the significance quality roofing has on  every home and business in the U.S.

Established in 1886, NRCA is one of the Nation's oldest trade  associations and the voice of professional roofing contractors  worldwide. NRCA has nearly 4,000 roofing company members representing  the entire roofing supply chain. Using its network of roofing  contractors and industry-related members, NRCA is responsible for the  installation of new construction and replacement roof systems on  commercial and residential structures in America. Most of NRCA's  members are small, privately held businesses that provide family- sustaining jobs for thousands of hardworking individuals who are the  backbone of our economy.

Professional roofing contractors provide vital services to their  communities, on and off the clock. NRCA members will recognize National  Roofing Week June 1-7, by supporting numerous charitable projects,  employee training programs and other activities across the Nation. I  commend NRCA and the vital role the organization and its members play  in every community, and I ask my colleagues to join me in acknowledging  their contributions during National Roofing Week.
