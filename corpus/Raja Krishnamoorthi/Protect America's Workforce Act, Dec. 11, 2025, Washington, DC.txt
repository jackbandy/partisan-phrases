Protect America's Workforce Act

Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 2550.

This bipartisan bill reverses an illegal executive order that  stripped collective bargaining rights from roughly 67 percent of the  Federal workforce, so more than two-thirds of the Federal workforce.

Removing their limited bargaining rights does not improve efficiency.  It threatens the integrity of our civil service. These rights exist for  one essential reason: to shield Federal employees from political  pressure so that they serve the American people, not the agenda of any  one President or political party.

No worker should have to take a political loyalty test to receive or  keep his or her job. The Protect America's Workforce Act restores a  balanced, targeted framework that respects national security, while  reaffirming the rights of those who serve us.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation and  restore these protections for over 1 million Federal workers. Again,  this particular legislation is about no political loyalty test having  to be administered to workers in the Federal Government. They are  accountable to the American people.
