Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Chicago Indo-US Lions Club for its outstanding service to communities  across Illinois and for continuing the proud legacy of Lions Clubs  International. Founded in Chicago in 1917 by Melvin Jones, Lions Clubs  International has grown into the world's largest service club  organization, guided by a mission of community service, humanitarian  assistance, and the promotion of peace.

The Chicago Indo-US Lions Club exemplifies this legacy through its  dedicated volunteerism and commitment to addressing critical community  needs. The Club has played a vital role in supporting vulnerable  populations, particularly through its focus on public health  initiatives, including vision, hearing, and diabetes care.

Through its fundraising and outreach efforts, the Chicago Indo-US  Lions Club helps bridge these gaps by providing essential medical  equipment, including vision and hearing screening tools and A1C testing  kits, to underserved communities.

On February 28, 2026, members of the Chicago Indo-US Lions Club and  their partners will gather to reaffirm their commitment to service and  to support future health and environmental initiatives across Illinois.  I am proud to recognize the Chicago Indo-US Lions Club and thank them  for their dedication to service and for fostering connections that help  Illinois communities thrive.
