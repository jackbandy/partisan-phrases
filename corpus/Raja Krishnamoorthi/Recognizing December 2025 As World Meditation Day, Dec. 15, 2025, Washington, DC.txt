Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sunday,  December 21, 2025, as World Meditation Day, which has been designated  by the United Nations to celebrate the growing recognition of  meditation as a practical tool for mental well-being and peace.

This observance will culminate in a global moment of stillness at  10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, when events across Illinois, throughout the  United States, and around the world will unite communities in a shared  moment of peace and connection during the holiday season, supporting  mental well-being, resilience, and unity.

This meditation will be led by Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. For more  than 45 years, Gurudev has dedicated his life to promoting peace,  advancing human values, and serving communities around the world.

Mr. Speaker, I wish to extend my deepest gratitude to Gurudev Sri Sri  Ravi Shankar for his work in promoting meditation, and I encourage my  colleagues to join in a moment of silence in recognition of World  Meditation Day.
