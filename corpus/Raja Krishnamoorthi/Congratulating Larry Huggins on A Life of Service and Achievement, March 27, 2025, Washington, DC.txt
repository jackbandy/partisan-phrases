Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to  celebrate Larry Huggins' incredible contributions to Illinois and  Chicago.

Larry is a trailblazer. At a time when Black people were discouraged  from construction jobs, Larry founded a construction company that is  still thriving and has helped build some of Chicago's most famous  landmarks.

Huggins is an eminent civic leader, as well. He served as acting  chairman of Metra and founded the famous Christmas in the Wards to  distribute toys and other gifts to Chicago's needy.

He also cofounded the Chicago Football Classic, which is a yearly  football game between two HBCUs at Soldier Field. The game is  accompanied by scholarships, workshops, and outreach for students.

From business success to civic leadership, I am pleased to  congratulate Larry Huggins on a life of exemplary service and  achievement.
