Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Love Thy City  event held in Tyler, Texas, a community-wide initiative that reminds us  that service to our neighbors does not start in Washington, D.C. It  starts in the heart and in the home, and it extends to every corner of  this Earth.

Organized by local citizen leaders, churches, nonprofits, and  volunteers of all ages, Love Thy City is a day of service to others,  rooted in the great command to love our neighbors. That is a principle  that transcends politics and parties, race and gender, and every other  perceived difference between us.

It is our shared responsibility to care for everyone around us just  as the Good Samaritan did, not because government would tell us to, but  because the love of Christ propels us to.

Whether it is cleaning up a park, helping a neighbor in need, or  simply showing kindness to a stranger, Love Thy City challenges us to  use our active faith to lead by example and invest in our communities,  not just with words, but with action.

This is what makes east Texas strong: faith, service, and a deep love  for God and for others. I am proud to honor this effort today and to  recognize all those who give their time to love their neighbor.
