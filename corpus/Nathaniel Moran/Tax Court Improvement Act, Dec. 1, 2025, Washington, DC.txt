Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Tax  Court Improvement Act. This taxpayer-friendly bill significantly  improves the critical Tax Court process available to Americans who find  themselves in a dispute with the IRS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank specifically Representative Terri Sewell, who  joined me in coauthoring this bill, for recognizing that taxpayers  deserve a court process that is clear, timely, efficient, and just. Her  work on this bill reflects our joint commitment to the people we serve.

For too long, the Tax Court has operated under preexisting rules that  do not mirror many of the well-established procedures for other courts  and rules that are antiquated in their application.

In short, changes need to be made so that the Tax Court process works  better for the people that it serves. When a system is slow or  confusing, the burden falls on taxpayers, often at moments when they  are already under stress. This bill provides practical updates that  help the court do its job more effectively, and it helps taxpayers find  resolution more easily and quickly.

First, this bill modernizes the court's subpoena rules. Today, if  someone is subpoenaed to produce documents before the Tax Court, they  must show up in person. This wastes time, adds expense, and clogs an  already full docket. Other Article I and Article III courts already  allow documents to be submitted, at times, without requiring physical  appearance. This bill, likewise, gives the Tax Court the same  commonsense flexibility, allowing judges to decide when someone truly  needs to appear in person.

Second, the bill helps the court address its growing case backlog. It  does this by allowing special trial judges, who are experienced legal  professionals who already handle much of the court's work, to take on  additional responsibilities with the consent of the taxpayer. If the  taxpayer agrees, these special trial judges can hear certain additional  matters, issue final decisions in specific cases, and use limited  contempt authority to maintain order. This is similar to how magistrate  judges currently assist Federal district court judges to streamline  their dockets when consent of the parties exists. The result is simple:  faster resolution for taxpayers without sacrificing expertise on the  bench, fairness in the process, or integrity in the result.

Third, the bill strengthens public trust by creating clear ethical  standards for Tax Court judges. Article III judges already have  statutory recusal rules. Currently, Tax Court judges do not. Codifying  disqualification requirements ensures that taxpayers know that their  case will be heard by a judge who is impartial and above reproach. This  change helps to take away any indicia of impropriety in the process,  again giving weight to the soundness of the final judgment.

Finally, this legislation clarifies the court's authority to use  equitable tolling in deficiency cases. Today, if a taxpayer misses a  filing deadline, even due to illness, natural disaster, or being given  incorrect information, the court often has no ability to offer relief  to that taxpayer. Cases can be dismissed before the merits are even  heard, putting taxpayers at risk for losing their claim when they are  not at fault for missing the deadline. That is not a just result. This  bill ensures the court can make determinations based on the substance  of claims, not just procedural technicalities, especially when a  taxpayer is acting in good faith.

Taken together, these reforms make the Tax Court more efficient,  responsive, and just for the American taxpayer. They reflect these  values that guide our work in this Chamber: strong institutions, fair  treatment for taxpayers, and renewed trust in our government processes.

This is a measured, practical bill that passed unanimously in  committee, and it deserves the support of this House on both sides of  the aisle.

I urge my colleagues to vote for the Tax Court Improvement Act to  help strengthen a court process that plays a vital role in protecting  our taxpayers' rights and ensuring accountability of the IRS within our  tax system.
