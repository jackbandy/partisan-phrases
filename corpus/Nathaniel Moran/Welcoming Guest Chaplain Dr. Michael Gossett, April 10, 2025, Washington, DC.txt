Welcoming Guest Chaplain Dr. Michael Gossett


Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to introduce Dr. Michael  Gossett, pastor of Green Acres Baptist Church in Tyler, Texas, to the  United States House of Representatives to serve as the guest chaplain  this week and offer a prayer this morning.

Dr. Gossett and his wife, Katie, lead the largest congregation of  believers in east Texas. They also proudly shepherd a flock of four  wonderful children at home.

Pastor Michael, as he is known, and Katie are passionate about their  call to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ. They are personable and  approachable in their style, showing the same love and grace as our  risen Lord and Savior.

Having been a firefighter for 5 years before entering full-time  ministry, this Liberty University alum is tough-minded, disciplined,  and steady in his leadership. He is authentic and genuine and always  faithful to preach the truth of the inherent Word of God. Because of  that, he has been a strong and effective leader for Green Acres since  he arrived in 2019.

I am proud to call him my friend and proud that he dedicated his life  to being salt and light in this lost and dark world.

To God be the glory for the great things He is doing through the  Gossetts and Green Acres Baptist Church in Tyler, Texas. We welcome  Pastor Gossett.
