Risch Meets with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of the Hellenic Republic on Wednesday to discuss the status of U.S.-Greek relations.

"The US-Greek partnership is as strong as ever, and I was glad to welcome Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to the committee today," said Risch. "Our two nations have expanded our bilateral and regional military cooperation, and have signed a revised defense cooperation pact. This could not come at a better time as tensions continue to rise in Greece's neighborhood. As we look to the future, I appreciate today's timely discussion on the current state of the Eastern Mediterranean region, the security of Europe, allied efforts to push back on Russian malign influence, and the strengthening of the U.S.-Greek relationship economically, militarily, and politically. I am confident that we will be able to work together to tackle both old and new security challenges that affect the transatlantic alliance."
