Risch Statement on Senate Confirmation of Brett Giroir to Be U.S. Representative on WHO Executive Board


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement after the U.S. Senate confirmed Admiral Brett Giroir to be representative of the United States on the executive board of the World Health Organization (WHO).

"I'm pleased the Senate confirmed Admiral Brett Giroir to be the U.S. representative on the executive board of the WHO today," said Risch. "This action ensures that the United States will be aptly represented on the WHO Executive Board and before the World Health Assembly. Given the scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the role that the United States will continue to play in the global response, it is perhaps more critical than ever to have experienced global health professionals at the table. I am confident that Dr. Giroir will provide thoughtful leadership on the board while advancing the global health security of the United States and our partners."
