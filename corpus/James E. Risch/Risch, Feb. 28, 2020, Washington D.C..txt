Risch, Menendez Statement on Newly Formed Tunisian Government


U.S. Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement of congratulations to the Tunisian people on the formation of their new government:

"We welcome the newly formed Tunisian government under Prime Minister Elyes Fakhfakh, following months of arduous negotiations. Tunisian lawmakers from across the political spectrum came together in pursuit of common cause, voting in favor of an impressively diverse cabinet in which 17 out of the country's 24 regions are represented. We extend our support to the Tunisian people and their elected government, and look forward to working with the new government, business leaders, and civil society to strengthen Tunisia's economy, security, and the U.S.-Tunisian relationship. We congratulate the Tunisian people on their successful transition from autocracy to democracy as evidenced by the country's recent elections and the formation of the new governing coalition."
