Risch Approves Second Coronavirus Emergency Funding Package


Today, U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) issued the following statement after voting to approve H.R. 6201, the second supplemental funding package to combat COVID-19:

"We are in the midst of a truly unprecedented time in modern U.S. history. These extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures. Today, I voted in support of a second bipartisan coronavirus emergency funding bill. This legislation is far from perfect -- and I strongly believe we must redouble our efforts to balance the federal budget -- but the urgent needs of Idahoans and the integrity of the U.S. economy must be addressed as swiftly and comprehensively as possible. This bill, along with the first coronavirus supplemental bill enacted earlier this month, has the strong support of the president and will ensure that Idaho's families, small businesses, and communities receive the critical assistance and federal support they deserve.

"These are challenging times, but as your senator, I will continue working at the federal level to deliver resources and relief to Idahoans. My office will remain available for legislative work and constituent services for anyone who has been impacted -- either directly or indirectly -- by COVID-19. We each have a role to play in keeping Idaho's communities safe and healthy, and I will continue working hard on your behalf to deliver results back home."
