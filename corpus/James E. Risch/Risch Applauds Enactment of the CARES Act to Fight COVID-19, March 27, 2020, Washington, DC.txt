Risch Applauds Enactment of the CARES Act to Fight COVID-19


Today, U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) issued the following statement upon President Trump signing the CARES Act to battle COVID-19 into law:

"I thank President Trump for signing the CARES Act into law. This has been a thoroughly bipartisan effort, with the Senate passing this legislation by a vote of 96-0, the House agreeing to it by unanimous consent two days later, and President Trump signing this bill within hours," said Risch. "The CARES Act is critical to stabilizing our economy, providing American families, workers, and businesses with the assistance they need, and ensuring the men and women on the front lines of the COVID-19 outbreak have the necessary funding and supplies to keep millions of Americans safe."
