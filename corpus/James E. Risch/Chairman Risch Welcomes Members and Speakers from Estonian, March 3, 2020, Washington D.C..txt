Chairman Risch Welcomes Members and Speakers from Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish Parliaments


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today met with a group of members and speakers of parliament from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland to discuss the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and continued transatlantic collaboration to counter malign activities from Russia and China.

"I was glad to welcome a group of members and speakers from the Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Polish parliaments to the historic Foreign Relations Committee room in the U.S. Capitol today," said Risch. "Our countries share a long history of strategic partnership based on shared values, and today I reaffirmed the United States' commitment to working together to counter Russian malign influence in the Eastern European region. These four countries face daily threats from their eastern neighbor, and with U.S. and NATO help, they are rising to the challenge, not least by meeting their NATO spending commitments."
