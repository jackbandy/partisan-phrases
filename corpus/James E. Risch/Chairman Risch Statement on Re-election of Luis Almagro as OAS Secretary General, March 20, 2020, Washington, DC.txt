U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement in response to Luis Almagro's re-election as secretary general of the Organization of American States (OAS):

"I would like to congratulate Luis Almagro for his re-election today as secretary general of the OAS. Mr. Almagro has made significant progress in the last five years to build consensus among member countries of the OAS, and to keep the organization dedicated to its core objectives of defending representative democracy and basic human rights, combatting corruption and transnational crime, and fostering economic growth. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I will continue to work with President Trump to advance the full range of U.S. national interests in the Americas, including at the OAS."
