Letter to Betsy DeVos, Secretary of the Department of Education - Idaho Senators Urge Disbursement of Aid for Higher Education


Dear Secretary DeVos:

Thank you for your swift action to provide assistance to education institutions throughout the country during this unprecedented time.  As you know, students, teachers, parents and faculty of America's higher education institutions are making the necessary but difficult decisions to close their facilities and provide remote learning.  Among Idaho's four largest universities, these decisions have impacted more than 55,000 students and 11,000 faculty and staff who are responsible for a system-wide Gross State Product impact of more than $3.3 billion per year to the Idaho economy.

Last month, we proudly voted in favor of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which directed the Department of Education to distribute $14 billion to institutions of higher education.  We were pleased that on April 9, 2020, the Department of Education announced the first disbursement of funds for higher education authorized by the CARES Act and we urge a swift and efficient distribution of the remaining amount to help keep our Idaho postsecondary institutions solvent.  In addition, we ask that you conduct a full review of your agency's regulations to, wherever possible, reduce regulation that may be hindering higher education institutions' ability to effectively serve students during this difficult time.

Thank you for your continued support and we look forward to working together with you to Open Up America Again.
