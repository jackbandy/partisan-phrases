Risch and Crapo Praise Signing of USMCA


Idaho Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo today released the following statements upon President Trump's signing of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law:

"Idaho's ag producers and manufacturers have waited a long time for a trade deal that delivers truly free and fair trade. The USMCA is a victory for Idaho and all of America and its signature into law will herald in a new chapter of even greater economic opportunity and success," said Risch. "I thank and congratulate the Trump administration on making this historic trade deal a reality."  

"I thank President Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for their forceful negotiations of the USMCA," said Crapo. "Signing this agreement into law is a step forward in ensuring improved access to valuable export opportunities for Idaho's farmers and ranchers."

Background: Free and fair trade is vital for Idaho's $4 billion export industry. The USMCA will provide much-needed updates to the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by:

Opening markets and reducing trade barriers.Raising the projected U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by more than $68 billion.Creating an anticipated 176,000 American jobs.Establishing new provisions related to intellectual property and digital trade.Providing Idaho farmers, ranchers, and small businesses with new trading pathways for commodities like dairy.Preserving existing channels for top Idaho exports like potatoes, canola, and beef cattle.
