Risch Statement on First Idaho Coronavirus Case


Today, U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) issued the following statement following the announcement of the first case of COVID-19, the Chinese coronavirus, in the State of Idaho:

"The announcement of Idaho's first positive COVID-19 case is not unexpected. Given the spread of the Chinese coronavirus (COVID-19), it was inevitable this disease would cross Idaho's borders. Governor Little and state officials have been preparing for this eventuality since January and announced a preemptory emergency declaration earlier today. In addition to that, President Trump today announced a national emergency and a plan of action to make tests more readily available across the country. These actions will expedite distribution of supplies and resources to local officials and medical professionals who are on the front lines of this outbreak.

"As this outbreak continues, I will work with my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to pass emergency funding where needed. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, and avoid large social gatherings and nonessential travel. If you develop a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness and have reason to believe you may have been exposed to the virus, contact your primary care physician. For more information about COVID-19, visit Governor Little's COVID-19 website or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

"I thank our state and local leaders and health care professionals for their proactive efforts on this issue and applaud their dedication to keeping Idahoans safe."
