Chairman Risch Statement on Administration's Israeli-Palestinian Peace Plan


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made the following statement after being briefed at the White House on the details of the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan along with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

"The search for peace between Israelis and Palestinians has been elusive," said Risch. "I applaud the president and his team for injecting new thinking and momentum into a process that has stalled over many years. This plan seeks to secure the sovereignty of Israel's borders, provides a pathway to a long-awaited state for Palestinians, and has the potential to open the door to economic prosperity in exchange for a departure from violence. I encourage Israel to embrace its Palestinian neighbor. I encourage the Palestinian people to look toward a brighter future and abandon the failed policies of the past. Only together can we achieve an enduring peace."
