Risch on Environmental Review of Columbia River System


Today, U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), issued the following statement on the release of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) of the Columbia River System Operation:

"The Draft EIS offered by this administration is expansive, science-based, and appropriately recognizes the critical importance of the four dams on the Lower Snake River to the region's energy production, flood risk management, irrigation, and economic well-being. The challenges related to salmon and steelhead recovery are complex, and robust analysis makes it clear that dam breaching is not a viable option for the species recovery while maintaining the vital Congressionally authorized purposes of the system. I applaud the administration on this excellent first step and thank them for their dedication to reaching a comprehensive solution by Fall of 2020."
