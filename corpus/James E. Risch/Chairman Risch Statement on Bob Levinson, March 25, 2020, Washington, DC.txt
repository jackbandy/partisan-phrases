Chairman Risch Statement on Bob Levinson


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement on the apparent passing of Bob Levinson, an American citizen who was held hostage by the Iranian regime for 13 years. Mr. Levinson went missing in 2007 and was the United States' longest held hostage. 

"I am incredibly saddened by recent reports from the Levinson family that Bob Levinson passed on while in Iranian custody," said Risch. "This is further evidence that the Iranian regime will stop at nothing to subvert and abuse human rights. The Levinson family deserves justice, and we will continue to push for Bob's return to his loved ones."
