Risch, Menendez Call for Peaceful Dialogue in El Salvador


U.S. Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement in response to a dispute between the president and the national assembly in El Salvador:

"The United States and El Salvador enjoy a historic partnership, and we strongly support continued economic and security cooperation between our two countries. However, we remain deeply concerned about President Bukele's deployment of armed forces to address a political dispute with legislators. We note President Bukele's subsequent pledge to uphold the Supreme Court's order to refrain from using the armed forces in activities contrary to established constitutional norms, and we will continue to monitor the situation. We join U.S. Ambassador Johnson in calling for a peaceful dialogue between political actors and respect for the independence of democratic institutions as Salvadorans seek to build a more secure and prosperous country."
