Risch Meets with Members of the Idaho National Guard in Washington, D.C.


Today, U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) met with members of the Idaho National Guard who were deployed to Washington, D.C. on Friday to aid in the protection of local residents and peaceful protestors demonstrating against the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The roughly 400 Idaho National Guardsmen who volunteered for this deployment remain unarmed and in "soft cap," meaning they are not outfitted in body armor nor riot gear while on duty.

Senator Risch spoke with the Guardsmen on Monday evening and thanked them for their service.

"I am deeply proud of the Idaho National Guard. These men and women represent the very best of what our state has to offer, and their commitment to protecting lives and preserving peace during this difficult time is humbling," said Risch. "I thank them for their service to our nation and pray for their continued safety."
