Chairman Risch Statement on DOJ Indictment of Nicolás Maduro


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement after the Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against Nicolás Maduro and members of his inner circle on narco-terrorism charges:

"I commend the administration for maintaining steady pressure on Nicolás Maduro and his corrupt regime in Venezuela. Maduro's well-documented involvement in transnational criminal activities is a security threat for the United States and the region at large. Today's action by the Department of Justice marks another opportunity for the countries of the Americas and Europe to take stronger action to support the return of democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela, and to help stop the slide to authoritarianism in the region."
