Risch Votes in Support of Coronavirus Supplemental


Today, U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) issued the following statement after voting to approve supplemental funding to combat the novel coronavirus:

"During this novel coronavirus outbreak, a speedy and coordinated response is vital to our national strategy of containment. Today, I voted in support of supplemental funding to combat COVID-19. I am closely monitoring this evolving situation and am in constant contact with the administration and our state and local partners. I have also requested the White House make more coronavirus test kits available to the State of Idaho. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I hosted a dialogue this morning with experts from across the U.S. government, and got greater clarity on efforts to detect, deter, and mitigate coronavirus. Defending against the novel coronavirus will take an all-hands-on-deck effort, and I thank our public health officials and medical providers for their tireless work to contain this situation and navigate the challenges before us."
