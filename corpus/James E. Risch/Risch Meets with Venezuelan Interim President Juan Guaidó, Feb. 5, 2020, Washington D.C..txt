Risch Meets with Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guaid贸


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today joined Vice President Mike Pence and Senate colleagues in a meeting with Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guaid贸.

 "I had a productive meeting with Venezuelan Interim President Guaid贸, Vice President Pence, and Senators Rubio and Scott earlier today," said Risch. "We had a candid discussion and reaffirmed our support for him as the rightful president of Venezuela. I appreciate President Trump's recognition of Juan Guaid贸 at the State of the Union last night, which is a clear indication of unwavering U.S. support for the democratic forces in Venezuela and the country's prompt return to democratic rule."
