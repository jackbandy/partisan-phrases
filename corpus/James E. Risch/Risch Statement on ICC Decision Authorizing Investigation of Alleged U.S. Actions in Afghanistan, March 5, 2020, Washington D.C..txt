Risch Statement on ICC Decision Authorizing Investigation of Alleged U.S. Actions in Afghanistan


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement in response to the International Criminal Court's (ICC) ruling that its chief prosecutor can pursue an investigation into alleged U.S. actions in Afghanistan:

"I am disappointed that the ICC has decided to pursue an investigation against U.S. personnel for alleged actions in Afghanistan. The prosecutor's original request was rightly rejected in April, but she has decided to go forward on appeal. This decision makes clear the increasingly political agenda of the ICC and its prosecutor.

"The United States is not a party to the ICC's Rome statute, and I support the administration's efforts to defend our sovereignty and protect U.S. personnel from unjust actions by the ICC. We remain committed to protecting our personnel from these political efforts spearheaded by the ICC's prosecutor."
