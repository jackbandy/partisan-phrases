Risch: Designating Media Organizations Under CCP Control is a Good Decision


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement regarding the Department of State's decision to designate five Chinese media entities as foreign missions under the Foreign Missions Act:

"I applaud the decision to designate five Chinese media organizations as foreign missions. In the United States, we believe in a free press and we know these types of organizations are not free. They are under the direct control of the Chinese Communist Party and we shouldn't pretend otherwise. These designations are a smart and reasonable step that acknowledges this reality."
