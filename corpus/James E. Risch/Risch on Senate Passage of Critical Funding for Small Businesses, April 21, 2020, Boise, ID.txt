Risch on Senate Passage of Critical Funding for Small Businesses, Health Providers


Today, U.S. Senator Jim Risch released the following statement commending the Senate's passage of "Phase 3.5" of emergency coronavirus legislation to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program and provide additional relief to health care providers:

"Small businesses need every possible tool in the toolbox to weather the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Paycheck Protection Program is one of those essential tools," said Risch. "This program is central to ensuring small businesses keep their employees paid and continue serving the people in our communities for years to come. Renewed funding for this program, in addition to critical assistance for our hospitals and health care centers, cannot come soon enough for the thousands of small businesses that make Idaho great."
