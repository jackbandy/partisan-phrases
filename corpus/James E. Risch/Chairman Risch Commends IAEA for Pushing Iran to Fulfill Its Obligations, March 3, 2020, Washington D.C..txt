Chairman Risch Commends IAEA for Pushing Iran to Fulfill Its Obligations


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement in response to a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that details Iran's lack of cooperation in accounting for undeclared nuclear sites and activities:  "I commend Director General Grossi and his team at the IAEA for pushing Iran to explain its undeclared nuclear sites and activities. Submitting a second, separate report alongside its quarterly report on Iran is an unprecedented recognition of the significance of Iran's lack of cooperation. It shows that the IAEA is serious about holding Iran to account, which I discussed with Director General Grossi when we met last month.  "Iran must live up to its commitments under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Additional Protocol, and the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. It must allow full and unfettered access to IAEA inspectors, and provide complete and accurate information in response to IAEA requests. This report affirms what many of us have long suspected -- the Iranian regime is violating legally binding obligations and commitments. I applaud the IAEA's ongoing efforts to push Iran to fulfill its nonproliferation obligations and I urge Iran to fully cooperate with the IAEA, reverse its recent nuclear activities, and accept the invitation from the Trump Administration to begin talks."
