Risch Statement on International Women's Day


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement ahead of International Women's Day on March 8th:

"Today, tomorrow, and every day are good days to celebrate women and their contributions at home and abroad. I am very privileged to work with energetic, knowledgeable, and influential women every day in both my personal and committee offices. Each of these women contribute uniquely to our team and I am deeply appreciative of how dedicated each of them is to the issues they oversee and to the American people.

"Today is a stark reminder that there is still work to be done for women around the world. We enjoy great freedoms here at home, but too many women around the world continue to lack access to the political and economic freedoms many take for granted, including the right to own and inherit land, secure access to capital or credit, go to school, or participate freely in governance. I am proud of the work our committee does each day to work towards a better and brighter future for all women.

"Women's success is critical to every stable and prosperous society. Happy International Women's Day to all."
