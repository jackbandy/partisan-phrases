Risch, Rubio Welcome Recent Nicaragua Sanctions Against Senior Officials of the Ortega Regime


U.S. Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), today released the following statement after the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, pursuant to Executive Order 13851, designated two senior members of the Nicaraguan regime:

"We welcome the designation of Julio César Avilés Castillo, the commander-in-chief of the Nicaraguan Army, and Iván Adolfo Acosta Montalván, the Ortega regime's minister of finance. Both men are being sanctioned for their links to the Ortega regime and for propping up a dictator who has repeatedly undermined democracy, human rights, and Nicaragua's rule of law. The United States of America is holding accountable those individuals who pose a threat to the democratic order of our hemisphere. The Nicaraguan people's fight for freedom from oppression will continue to be a priority in the U.S. Senate."
