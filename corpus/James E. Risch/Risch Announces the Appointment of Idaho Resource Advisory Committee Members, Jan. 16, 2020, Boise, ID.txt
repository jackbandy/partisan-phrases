Risch Announces the Appointment of Idaho Resource Advisory Committee Members


Today, U.S. Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) announced the appointment of members to the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) North Central Idaho Resource Advisory Committee (RAC). 

"For far too long, RACs across Idaho and the country have gone without the ability to disburse funds for Title II projects in our rural communities," said Risch. "I am happy to see this process progress so these funds can be invested in projects in North Idaho, and will continue to work with the Forest Service to fill the remaining RACs throughout Idaho."

Background: A key component of the Secure Rural Schools law, RACs provide recommendations to federal land managers about where and how to spend SRS Title II funds, however, 60 percent of RACs nationwide lack a quorum, severely limiting the distribution of funds for SRS projects. This equates to approximately $55 million for Title II projects that is allocated for, but not being invested in, rural communities.

In September 2019, Risch led 13 of his Senate colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, urging him to expedite nominations to RACs.
