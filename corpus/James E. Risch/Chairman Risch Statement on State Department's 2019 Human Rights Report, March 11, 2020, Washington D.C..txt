Chairman Risch Statement on State Department's 2019 Human Rights Report


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement in response to the annual human rights report released by the Department of State today:

"The State Department's release of the 2019 human rights report reminds us that as Americans, we are incredibly blessed to be born with undeniable rights that allow us to live freely. Unfortunately, this report shows us that there is no shortage of countries that continue to deny their citizens -- the very people they have the responsibility to protect -- the most basic human rights. Kleptocrats, autocrats, and dictators alike will stop at nothing to detain, abuse, torture, and even murder those who wish to see change. We can use this report to continue to name and shame countries that have made a habit of human rights abuses, like Iran, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Russia, and China.

"Freedoms of speech, religion, assembly, and more are under attack around the world. Today is a reminder that the United States will always advocate for those who cannot advocate for themselves. We will continue to push for accountability of those who abuse their power, and work towards justice for all. I want to thank Secretary Pompeo and his team for their work on this key diplomatic tool."
