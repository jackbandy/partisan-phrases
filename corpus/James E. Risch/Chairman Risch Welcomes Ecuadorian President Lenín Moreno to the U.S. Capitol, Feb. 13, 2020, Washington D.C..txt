Chairman Risch Welcomes Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno to the U.S. Capitol


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today welcomed Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno to the historic Foreign Relations Committee room in the U.S. Capitol.

"I was glad to welcome President Moreno to the U.S. Capitol today," said Risch. "President Moreno's government has taken measures to improve the economic and security conditions in Ecuador, and we welcome the opportunity to cooperate with those efforts. Ecuadorians are experiencing first-hand the negative effects of the regional instability provoked by Maduro's tyranny in Venezuela and China's debt diplomacy. Ecuador will find bipartisan support in the United States as it works to address those challenges and create a more secure and prosperous future."
