Chairman Risch Statement on Anniversary of Removal of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir


U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement on the first anniversary of the removal of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir from power and the country's ongoing transition:

"One year ago today, the removal of President Omar al-Bashir from power signified a crucial milestone for the Sudanese people as they sought to reclaim their country from a ruthless military regime. Sudan has undergone tremendous change in the year since, but not without also encountering painful obstacles like military-sponsored violence and crippling economic conditions. The historic signing of a political agreement and the Constitutional Declaration in Khartoum last August placed Sudan on a clearer path toward greater democracy. On this anniversary, the United States recognizes hard won achievements so far, reaffirms its support for the civilian-led transition, and stands in solidarity with the Sudanese people determined to have a brighter future."
