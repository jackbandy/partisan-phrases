True Cost of Big Tech

Mr. PATRONIS. Mr. Speaker, Section 230 of the Communications Decency  Act insulates ``Big Tech'' from most liability for the digital fentanyl  promoted on their sites. Time and time again, drugs are sold, sexually  suggestive and/or explicit content is posted without consent,  algorithms promote and normalize suicide and self-harm, and chatbots  tell children how to cope with their emotions. All of these things are  harming our vulnerable and impressionable youth. Chatbot usage is now  so widespread that nearly three quarters of teens have used AI  companions, and of these users approximately one in three have used  them for social interactions and relationships to include the more than  one in ten who sought emotional or mental health support.

That is why I proudly introduced H.R. 7045, the Promoting Responsible  Online Technology and Ensuring Consumer Trust (PROTECT) Act, to  immediately repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and to  restore accountability for online platforms.

The question we must ask ourselves is: can there be any  accountability when there is no liability. The answer is no. Without  liability there is no accountability. When was the last time you saw  revenge porn or fentanyl marketed on a billboard? The answer is you  have not seen it because of a well-crafted system that punishes  wrongdoing. Why do we see this content online constantly? The answer is  Section 230.

Let us stop pretending like the internet is new, novel, and worthy of  special treatment when 96 percent Americans access it. When the law  passed in 1996, the internet was in its early days long before the  average American spent nearly half the month online and nearly one in  six sales occurred online. Congress can no longer ignore the fact that  the average American spends nearly 60,000 percent more time online than  during the year of the law's passage.

To be clear, this law lets the large companies that dominate the  areas where Americans spend almost half their time generally face no  consequences for the content these platforms share, actively promote,  and generate billions from. Worse yet, the law also deprives states of  the power to protect their own citizens through state law. I am deeply  troubled by alarming national trends and the proliferation of AI  chatbots, providing advice to our children. Increasingly, children have  been suffering, and parents have been unable to pursue an effective  means of encouraging the industry to police itself.

Sadly, one in five children receive an unwanted sexual solicitation  annually online. Despite Section 230 continuing to insulate online  predation, I am proud of the work multiple sheriff offices, as well as  state and federal agencies did to arrest 13 suspects during an online  child sexual predator operation in my district and in surrounding  communities last fall.

Imagine how much more ``Big Tech'' would be willing to do to shut  down the predator superhighway if they faced actual consequences. While  I could fill hundreds of pages with stories about how social media is  harming our youth and supplement it daily, I want to focus on stories  from my district and my home state of Florida.

As a successful Section 230 defense often results in the court  granting dismissal early in the litigation, the facts are often  accepted as plead. In these instances, the excerpts below reflect the  claims as plead by the victims and their families.  Only Fans Parent Company Faces No Liability for Allegedly Profiting Off                          Rape of a Miami Teenager

In April 2022, Michelson Romelus and Bendjy Charles       allegedly filmed each other on video while they forcible       raped and sodomized the teenage victim in Miami. Several       weeks later, the footage was allegedly edited and uploaded to       OnlyFans.com where the footage was allegedly sold as part of       a monthly subscription. Despite these facts, the case was       recommended for dismissal based on Section 230, meaning the       alleged victim could not recover from the platform.    Omegle Immune From Liability for Allegedly Connecting a Minor With a            Predator Who Coerced an 11-Year-Old Into Undressing

On March 31, 2020, an 11-year-old girl and user of the       Omegle platform, which allowed users to connect with people       randomly and anonymously allegedly connected the child with a       predator. This predator allegedly informed the victim that he       knew where she lived and provided specific details about       where she lived to prove it. He allegedly threatened to hack       the victim and her family's devices if she did not disrobe       and comply with his demands. The predator allegedly filmed       the incident. The case was dismissed by the Court as the       victim's family ``failed to plead claims that withstand       Omegle's Section 230 immunity.'' The platform has since       ceased operations.   OfferUp Found Not Liable for Allegedly Connecting Buyer With Seller Who                           Robbed and Shot Buyer

On June 13, 2018, the victim allegedly arranged to meet       with the seller in Palmetto, Florida to consummate the       contemplated sale of goods. The meeting was allegedly setup       in response to a post on the OfferUp platform. When the       victim arrived, he was allegedly robbed and shot multiple       times. The Court concluded that Section 230 barred the claim       against OfferUp.      Craigslist Faces No Accountability for Allegedly Facilitating Sex                        Trafficking of a 15-Year-Old

Back in 2008, a then fifteen-year-old girl began to       allegedly be forcibly trafficked for commercial sex, which       allegedly continued for a decade across Miami-Dade County.       She was allegedly frequently expected to perform commercial       sexual acts for between eleven and fourteen different men       daily. The traffickers allegedly used craigslist's ``erotic       services'', ``adult services'', ``massage services'',       ``casual encounters'', and``personals'' categories to display       their posts and to send emails on the platform to negotiate       commercial sex sales. Her traffickers allegedly posted       sexually explicit, nude and partially nude photos as well as       coded words to advertise commercial sex. At times, messages       allegedly sent on the platform indicated that the victim was       underage. To use their platform, the traffickers allegedly       paid a fee to craigslist who never rejected or removed any       posts.

Although the Court explained that ``some of her allegations       demonstrate craigslist's appalling lack of diligence in       preventing trafficking, not a single one establishes that       craigslist created or developed the trafficking content.''       After an extensive legal battle, the Court ultimately found       craigslist not liable based on a Section 230 defense.    Mother Whose 11-year-old Son Was an Alleged Victim of Sexual Battery                   Denied Relief After a Four-Year Fight

Following an alleged sexual assault of legal guardian's 11-      year-old son and two other minor males in 1994, Richard Lee       Russell was criminally convicted for events relating to those       alleged in the complaint. This sexual predator under Florida       Law allegedly solicited the sale of the photographs and video       of this assault in America Online, Inc., chat rooms.       Ultimately, this case was appealed all the way to the Florida       Supreme Court. The mother was denied civil relief from       America Online, Inc., after the Court found Section 230       preempted Florida law.                        Emerging Threat of AI Chatbots

Beyond platforms serving as a predator superhighway,       today's parents must contend with AI chatbots that are       grooming children and pretending to be licensed therapists.       For example, a 14-year-old boy, after allegedly prolonged       conversations with an AI chatbot, tragically ended his life       near Orlando, Florida. His brave mother recently testified in       the Senate Judiciary Committee that the company Character       Technologies, Inc., would not disclose to her many of her       child's last words. Imagine a parent not being allowed to       know what was going on through her child's mind in his final       minutes.

For all these reasons, Congress must swiftly pass the PROTECT Act to  keep our children safe and to restore accountability to the internet.
