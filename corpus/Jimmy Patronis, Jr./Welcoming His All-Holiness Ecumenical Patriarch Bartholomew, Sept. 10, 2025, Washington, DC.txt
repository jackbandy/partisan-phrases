Mr. PATRONIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the Greek  Orthodox community in Florida and also across the United States to  extend a heartfelt welcome to his All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew who will visit Washington, D.C., from September 15 through  September 17.

For many Greek Orthodox faithful in my district, His All-Holiness is  more than a religious leader. He is their spiritual father. He is a  voice of compassion, a symbol of faith that has been carried across  generations of families who came to America in search of freedom of  opportunity. His visit to our Nation's Capital is an occasion for pride  for my constituents and all Orthodox Christians who call America home.

Patriarch Bartholomew is known worldwide as a bridge-builder, working  tirelessly to promote peace, dialogue, and respect among all different  faiths. He is also a champion for protecting our natural environment,  earning him the title of the ``Green Patriarch.''

His leadership is a source of inspiration not only for the Greek  Orthodox community but all those who care about human rights, religious  liberty, and the stewardship of God's creation.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming His All- Holiness to the United States and celebrating this historic visit with  many Greek Orthodox Americans who are honored by his presence. This  moment is a reminder of enduring contributions that faith, family, and  the community make the strength of our Nation a great nation.
