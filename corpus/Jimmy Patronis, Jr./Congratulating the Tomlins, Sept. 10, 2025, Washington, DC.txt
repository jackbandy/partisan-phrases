Mr. PATRONIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Tomlin family of  Crestview, Florida, who have been named the 2025 Okaloosa County  Outstanding Farm Family of the Year. This recognition is part of the  Okaloosa County Farm Bureau's 75th Annual Membership Meeting, a  gathering that celebrates the strength of our agricultural community.

Cory and Jennifer Tomlin, together with their children Harper,  Hadley, and Haylyn, represent the very best of Florida agriculture.  Their family has carried forward a proud legacy of fanning that began  in 1982 when Jennifer's grandfather, Mr. Joe Bundrick, established  their beekeeping operation. Today, with the guidance of Mr. Bundrick  and the leadership of Jennifer's father, Ken, the Tomlins manage about  400 hives annually. Their farm produces honey, provides pollinator  services, and serves the community through both wholesale and retail  operations, including a storefront offering honey and beekeeping  supplies.

The Tomlin family's dedication goes well beyond their farm. Jennifer  serves as the Children's Ministry Leader at Dorcas Baptist Church,  Harper is an active 4-H member, and every member of the family  contributes to the success of their agricultural operation. Together,  they exemplify the values of faith, family, and stewardship that  sustain rural communities across America.

Four generations have worked this farm, and the Tomlins are committed  to ensuring it continues for generations to come. Their story reflects  not only the resilience of farm families in Northwest Florida but also  the essential role of agriculture in our Nation's future.

On behalf of the United States Congress, I commend the Tomlin family  for their outstanding contributions to agriculture and community life.  They are most deserving of this year's recognition as the Okaloosa  County Farm Family of the Year.
