Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act

Mr. PATRONIS. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, Aaron Bean, for  introducing this amendment.

Mr. Chairman, after working hard to obtain Federal approval in the  first Trump administration, a weaponized court system pulled Florida's  404 permitting out from under us, even though our program was  thoroughly vetted and approved in 2020.

Florida's DEP has become a national model for environmental  protection, and Washington should be learning from us, not tying our  hands.

The amendment makes it clear that once a State assumption program is  approved, the EPA cannot withdraw it unless Congress explicitly says  so--no more regulatory whiplash, no more political games.

For Florida, this is critical. It protects our section 404 program,  and it ends the uncertainty caused by conflicting court rulings and  shifting interpretations in Washington.

Meanwhile, the Army Corps of Engineers got a gut punch with an  overwhelming caseload while working hard to try to solve dozens of  projects that an activist judge has placed on hold in our communities  that they desperately need, like stormwater, schools, and even sewer  treatment plants not under construction, protecting our most precious  environments. But we can't unless the permits can be issued.

This is about predictability, federalism, and letting the States  manage their own waterways. It is proinfrastructure, prodevelopment,  but, most importantly, it is proenvironmental protection.
