Repeal Section 230


Mr. PATRONIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 7045, the PROTECT Act, because it is time to repeal  section 230 and hold Big Tech accountable for the harm being done to  our children.

As a father of two young boys, I refuse to stand by and allow harm to  happen to our children when there are no consequences, and these  companies walk away without responsibility.

Big Tech has become a digital fentanyl that is slowly killing our  children. It is pushing parents to the sidelines. It is acting as  therapists. It is replacing relationships with robots. This must stop.

Parents are fighting a system designed to replace them. Algorithms  and chatbots fuel addiction, depression, self-harm, and even suicide,  all while these companies hide behind section 230.

When social media leads our kids to suicidal thoughts, our children  believe they are better off gone, and no one is held responsible. This  is a deeply broken system.

I demand accountability. I am standing up for our children, and I am  saying that the double standard ends now.
