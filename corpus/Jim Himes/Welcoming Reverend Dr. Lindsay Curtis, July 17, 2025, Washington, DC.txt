Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, on this consequential day, when this body is  likely to make law and debate critical things, it has already been a  good and blessed day because our day was opened with a prayer by  Reverend Dr. Lindsay Curtis.

Dr. Curtis is well into his second decade leading as senior pastor at  Grace Baptist Church, a 129-year-old faith community in the center of  my district, Norwalk, Connecticut.

The church has thrived under Pastor Curtis' leadership, and I admire  him as a friend, as a mentor, and as a spiritual guide not just for his  understanding of the Scripture, but for his deep commitment to  ministry.

Dr. Curtis, over the course of his career, has served as president of  the Connecticut State Missionary Baptist Convention. He has served as  chairman of the Advisory Board of Directors of Norwalk ACTS, which is a  partnership of civic leaders. He has acted as the president of the  Norwalk NAACP, commissioner of the Judicial Selection Commission, and  when he sees a problem, he uses ministry to solve it.

Just this summer, out of nowhere, he conjured up a summer camp for  150 children in Norwalk, Connecticut, who might not otherwise have a  way to constructively spend their days.

I have always loved the quote attributed to St. Francis of Assisi.  That quote is familiar to so many of you: Always preach the Gospel.  Sometimes use words.

Lindsay Curtis embodies that idea in his ministry, and his superb  record is blemished perhaps only by my suspicion--and it is a  suspicion--that he thinks that somehow the Chicago Bulls fit into the  Trinity, but above all else, our God is a forgiving God, so I am sure  that that will not be a problem.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Curtis so much for opening us up today.
