Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome His All-Holiness  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to the United States.

His first visit since 2021, he joins us on his eighth Apostolic trip  to our country during which he will receive the prestigious Templeton  Prize for his environmental advocacy.

The ``Green Patriarch's'' landmark 1997 speech in Santa Barbara--in  which he first posited the notion of ecological sin--is striking for  how revolutionary it was then, and how prescient it remains today. In  particular, one line from His All-Holliness' remarks 28 years ago  struck me as worthy of meditating upon in the tumultuous times in which  we find ourselves.

In his speech, His All-Holliness offers the following: ``we lovingly  suggest to all the people of the earth, that they seek to help one  another to understand the myriad ways in which we are related to the  earth, and to one another.

Now, perhaps more than any time in my recollection, that call to  engage with one another, identify our commonalities, eschew clinging to  our differences, and help--how we can, where we can--feels vital to the  moral health of the American people and the long-term viability of our  global environment.

On behalf of the Eastern Orthodox Christian community of Southwestern  Connecticut, I would like to extend my congratulations to His All- Holiness for his Templeton Prize; it is a well-deserved acknowledgement  of his years of advocacy. I hope his trip is a success and that he  enjoys his time in the United States.
