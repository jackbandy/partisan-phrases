Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment, which would have our Nation turn its back on the brave  people of Ukraine in their greatest hour of need by cutting off all  military assistance.

As we stand here today, Russia's illegal invasion, which is now in  its fourth year, is intensifying to the highest levels of the war,  despite all of the oily, phony, happy talk coming from Vladimir Putin  about seeking peace.

On Saturday, Russia launched the largest drone assault of the war,  with 805 drones and 13 cruise missiles, killing 5 people and hitting  the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The Tuesday before, a glide bomb  killed 23 Ukrainians. Just last night, Russian and Belarusian drones  made 19 hits in sovereign Polish airspace, scrambling NATO F-35s and F- 16s to fend off civilian casualties.

It was Ukraine's air force that alerted their neighbors in Poland to  these blatantly illegal incursions, demonstrating Ukraine's commitment  to protecting not only their own population but the rest of Europe.

If this amendment were to pass, it would cripple not only Ukraine's  legal right to defend itself but also our NATO Treaty allies.
