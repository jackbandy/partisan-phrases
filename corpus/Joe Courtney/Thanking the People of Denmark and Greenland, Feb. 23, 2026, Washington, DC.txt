Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the people of  Denmark and Greenland for their quick professional evacuation last  Saturday of a U.S. submariner on board the USS Delaware 7 miles off  Greenland's coast. The submariner was experiencing an acute medical  problem that required immediate hospital care.

Mr. Speaker, I had the honor of representing the Connecticut  submarine base where the USS Delaware and its crew are homeported. In  the north Atlantic, our subs have conducted joint NATO patrols in the  waters off Greenland, Iceland, and the U.K. for many decades which  benefits U.S. Homeland Security. It is a team effort and Denmark's  response to a U.S. sailor in distress is a powerful example of how the  NATO alliance is not just based on words but rather meaningful deeds.

Mr. Speaker, for some reason, there has been deafening silence from  our Commander in Chief and Navy leadership to publicly thank Denmark  for its act of friendship on Saturday.

As the Representative of the USS Delaware's home port and ranking  member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, I will  publicly tell the people of that nation that  your caring response to one of our sea servicemembers in distress is  deeply appreciated and will be long remembered.
