Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  my constituent, Isabeau Levito, who officially qualified for the U.S.  Olympic figure skating team where she will represent Team USA at the  2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, Italy, next month.

Isabeau Levito grew up in south Jersey, training for years at the  Igloo Ice Center in Mount Laurel.

Long before the spotlight, she was on the ice before sunrise,  balancing schoolwork, family time, and relentless practice with  remarkable discipline and grace.

This month, Isabeau achieved a lifelong dream. After earning a bronze  medal at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in St. Louis, she  officially qualified for Team USA and will represent our country at the  2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, Italy.

Isabeau joins what experts are already calling the strongest U.S.  women's Olympic skating team in decades, and she stands proudly among  the best.

We are incredibly proud of her. On behalf of south Jersey, we wish  Isabeau Levito the very best as she skates for the gold and for Team  USA.
