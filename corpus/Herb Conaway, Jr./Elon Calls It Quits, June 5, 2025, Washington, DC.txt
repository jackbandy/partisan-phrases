Elon Calls It Quits

Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because we are witnessing a  tragic breakup between a Nazi-saluting billionaire and the President of  the United States.

Elon Musk has decided to call it quits after President Trump and  congressional Republicans moved to eliminate a tax credit that would  have benefited Musk under the so-called big, beautiful bill.

To be completely honest, I agree with both sides on this. I agree  that Trump should start to question Elon's Federal contracts, and I  agree with Musk that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is an abomination.

I am curious to see who my Republican colleagues will choose in this  breakup because, unfortunately for them, they have pledged undying  allegiance, either directly or indirectly, to both of these men.

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle turned a blind eye as  Musk was handed the keys to the government, enabling him to disable or,  rather, dismantle--probably both--programs everyday Americans depend  on. The majority stood by Trump through everything he has done, and now  we will see if that support falters.

The American people deserve much better than the drama playing out  between these two men, and it is time my Republican colleagues  recognize this.

At long last, let's work together to focus on the real issues facing  our beloved Nation.
