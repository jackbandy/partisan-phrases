Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Mr. GOODEN. Mr. Speaker, throughout this sham and shame of a  shutdown, we have heard so many lies from the Democrats. Over the last  45 days, and especially the last 45 minutes, I have heard them say this  is an evil bill, that Republicans don't care about the disabled, and  that Trump is the worst President in history for children. They have  said that Republicans are to blame for the fentanyl crisis, that  Republicans shouldn't take photos with veterans. January 6, of course,  they mention that. They have said Republicans are corrupt. They have  said that Republicans are starving kids.

What they haven't said is the one thing that this bill does, which is  to open up the government. Not one Democrat is getting up here saying  this bill opens the government.

Let me remind them and my colleagues and the American people that  this bill opens the government tonight, and the American people have  Republicans to thank for ending this shutdown and opening the  government.

I urge a ``yes'' vote. I am proud to vote ``yes.'' I am so  disappointed in my Democratic colleagues because, for the life of me,  throughout my time in the House, I have heard them talk about how  wonderful it is to keep the government open and that a shutdown is so  bad and can never happen. Tonight, they won't even admit that this bill  opens the government, and this is what we need for this country  tonight.

I urge a ``yes'' vote.
