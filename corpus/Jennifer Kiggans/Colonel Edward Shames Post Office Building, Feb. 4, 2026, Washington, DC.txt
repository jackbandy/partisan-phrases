Colonel Edward Shames Post Office Building


Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on my  bill designating the United States Postal Service facility located at  1225 Kempsville Road in Virginia Beach as the Colonel Edward Shames  Post Office Building.

Colonel Shames was a proud Virginian and a member of Easy Company,  101st Airborne Division, notably featured in the hit HBO documentary  ``Band of Brothers.'' He parachuted into Normandy on D-Day, fought  through Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge, and led  under fire in some of the most consequential battles of World War II.  For his courage and sacrifice, he was awarded a Bronze Star and a  Purple Heart.

After the war, Colonel Shames continued serving our Nation,  eventually retiring as a colonel, and later made Virginia Beach his  home, where he became a dedicated community member and a tireless  advocate for veterans.

As the last surviving officer of Easy Company, Colonel Shames  represented the very best of the Greatest Generation. Naming this post  office in his honor ensures his legacy of service, leadership, and  patriotism will endure for generations to come.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
