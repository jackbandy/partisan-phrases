Recognizing National Family Caregivers Month


Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Family Caregivers Month and to honor the more than 63 million  Americans who selflessly care for their loved ones. That includes more  than 1.5 million Virginians who step up every single day for their  parents, spouses, and family members.

As a Navy veteran, a nurse practitioner, and someone who has seen  firsthand the challenges families face, I know just how essential these  caregivers are to our long-term care system.

Far too often caregivers shoulder enormous emotional, physical, and  financial burdens without adequate help.

That is why Congress must work together to advance commonsense,  bipartisan solutions, like the Credit for Caring Act, increased respite  care funding, and expand workplace flexibility. These are practical  steps that will give caregivers the support they desperately need.

When caregivers thrive, families thrive. This month, and every month,  let's honor their sacrifice.

Mr. Speaker, I thank all the caregivers out there. They are  appreciated.
