Disinterment of Remains of Fernando V. Cota From Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, Texas


Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, this NDAA delivers the  investments and reforms our servicemembers deserve, improving  readiness, modernizing our forces, and strengthening the foundation of  America's national defense.

The bill revitalizes our defense industrial base, strengthens  American shipbuilding, and supports the workforce that keeps our Navy  and joint force mission-ready. These investments deliver for our  Nation, and they deliver for Hampton Roads, home to the sailors,  shipbuilders, and military families who sustain our national security  every single day.

It invests directly in the men and women who wear the uniform by  improving pay, strengthening housing, expanding childcare, and ensuring  access to timely, high-quality healthcare. It also makes targeted  improvements to training capabilities and modernization so our force  remains the world's premier fighting force.

The fiscal year `26 NDAA builds a stronger military, a more resilient  industrial base, and a more secure nation. I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation.
