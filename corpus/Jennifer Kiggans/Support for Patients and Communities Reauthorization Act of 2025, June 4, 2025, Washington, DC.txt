Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.

Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment. More than 50  million American adults consider themselves to be in recovery from a  substance use disorder or mental health condition.

In order to ensure that more patients can reach recovery, we must  bolster treatment integration and wraparound services for patients  suffering from substance use disorder and addiction.

This amendment directs the National Coordinator for Health  Information Technology to convene a public roundtable to examine the  use of electronic health records among certain providers and issue a  report of the findings. This would better inform policymakers about the  existing landscape and uptake of certain providers utilizing electronic  health records.

In closing, I urge support of this important amendment as well as the  underlying bill.

Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Chair, in closing, I urge my colleagues  to vote ``yes'' on my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
