Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record  remarks submitted at the request of a Virginia Beach constituent, Rabbi  Dr. Israel Zoberman of Temple Lev Tikvah, and are a reflection of his  views:

October 7 Revisited. Prophet Habakkak's haunting Biblical.       Words come true on a sacred turned scarred Day robbed of its       joys, ``For a stone shall cry out From the wall.'' Once       loving homes where the Divine forged an abode turned Into       blackened stones soaked from Hatred--filled wells of blood       and fire, With walls of witness wailing in silence Of strewn       bodies, young and old bonded. In death as in life, for the       land of ubiquitous. Memorials again and again and again, Till       when? Of snuffed dreams in a hunting field. Where dancing--      davening flowers held. Sway till halted singing from deep       within. Surging souls yearning to bond across. Man--made       borders--barriers to be. Breached for war or peace, To yet       prevail with heightened cadence. Of Shalom's invisible,       ever--surviving promise!
