Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  having us tonight to talk about this important issue.

Over the August district work period, I traveled throughout coastal  Virginia and heard directly from the people I represent:  servicemembers, shipyard workers, working families, and aerospace  leaders. I saw firsthand how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is already  beginning to shape our future here at home.

At a TRICARE roundtable, I met with hospitals, small clinics, and  providers who serve our military community. Families told me how  critical it  is to have consistent, reliable access to healthcare. The One Big  Beautiful Bill Act makes a strong downpayment by providing over $2  billion in new funding for the Defense Health Program, strengthening  medical readiness for our servicemembers and ensuring our  servicemembers and their families and loved ones can get the care they  deserve.

I also visited the Curtiss-Wright service center in Chesapeake, where  skilled workers support our Navy's nuclear fleet. Their work is a  reminder that America's shipbuilding strength begins with the men and  women of our industrial base. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act invests  more than $29 billion in shipbuilding and another $25 billion in  advanced weapons and munitions. These funds will help sustain high- skilled jobs across Hampton Roads and guarantee our Navy remains the  strongest in the world.

At Naval Station Norfolk, I heard from commanders and sailors about  the importance of readiness and from military families about the daily  challenges of housing, childcare, and the costs of moving.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act makes historic investments in quality  of life for our servicemembers, providing over $7.5 billion this year  for modernization of military housing, including $1 billion for  unaccompanied housing across the services, $230 million for the Marine  Corps Barracks 2030 initiative, tuition assistance, childcare, and  housing allowance supplements, and an extension of temporary lodging  expenses from 14 to 21 days to ease the burden of PCS moves. These are  not abstract numbers. They are real solutions for the families who  sacrifice so much to serve our great Nation.

Finally, I traveled to Wallops Island in my district to visit the  Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, where Virginia is playing a vital role  in America's return to the Moon and preparation for Mars. The One Big  Beautiful Bill Act provides nearly $10 billion for NASA, supporting  Artemis missions, the International Space Station, and new launch  infrastructure. These investments will directly benefit Wallops,  strengthen our space economy, and inspire the next generation of  aerospace leaders here in Virginia.

Mr. Speaker, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act restores American  strength at sea, revitalizes our industrial base, improves quality of  life for military families, and secures our future in space. I am proud  to have supported this historic legislation, and I will keep working to  make sure coastal Virginia sees the full benefit of what we  accomplished.
