Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, tonight, the Virginia  congressional delegation is gathered on the House floor to pay our  respects to Virginia Beach Police Department Officers Cameron Girvin  and Christopher Reese, who were killed in the line of duty in the early  hours of Saturday, February 22.

Tragically, our community lost two of our local heroes when a  cowardly criminal gunned down two of Virginia Beach's finest during a  routine traffic stop.

Officer Chris Reese was just 30 years old, having served with both  the Virginia Beach Police Department and the Virginia Beach Sheriff's  Office for the last 6 years. He leaves behind a loving wife. He will be  remembered for his loyalty to his loved ones and his passion for  serving the residents of our city.

Officer Cameron Girvin was just 25 years old and has served with the  Virginia Beach Police Department since 2020. He leaves behind his wife  and their unborn daughter, Paisley, who is due in the summer. He will  be remembered for his contagious smile and love for his family.

These brave young men were taken too soon and leave behind a grief- stricken and forever grateful community.

The city of Virginia Beach, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the  United States of America will forever be grateful to these officers who  made the ultimate sacrifice protecting our community. Their families  will always remain in our prayers.

On behalf of myself, the Virginia congressional delegation, and the  United States House of Representatives, I ask that the United States  House of Representatives observe a moment of silence in their honor.
