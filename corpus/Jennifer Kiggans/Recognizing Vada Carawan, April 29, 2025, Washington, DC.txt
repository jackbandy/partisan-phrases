Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  very brave young woman from Virginia's Second District. Vada Carawan is  an 11-year-old Virginia Beach native who recently showed courage beyond  her years when she saved her father's life. On November 23, 2024, Vada  was spending time with her father, Clinton, when he started to  experience what doctors later called ``sudden cardiac death,'' which  comes with no warning. Just 11 days earlier, Clinton had driven Vada to  girl scouts where she learned how to perform CPR. The moment Clinton  started to experience the cardiac event, Vada told herself that she  could cry once the EMT came, but before that she had to focus on saving  her dad's life. Vada thinks she performed CPR for around 5 to 7  minutes, which doctors said was critical to saving her dad's life. For  her heroism, Vada received the National Medal of Honor--Lifesaving  Award from the Girl Scouts of the United States of America. Her bravery  and quick action in a time of distress is truly remarkable. Virginia's  Second District is truly lucky to have such a fearless and impressive  member of the community and we are so thankful that her father is ok.  Please join me in recognizing Vada for her heroism.
