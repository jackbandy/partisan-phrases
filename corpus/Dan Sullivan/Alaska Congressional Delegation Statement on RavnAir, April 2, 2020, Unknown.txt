Alaska Congressional Delegation Statement on RavnAir


Today, the Alaska Congressional Delegation released the following statement after Alaska based regional airline RavnAir Group announced a 90 percent reduction in flying operations.

"The recent announcement made by RavnAir Group is very concerning news for Alaskans--especially for our remote communities. We have worked hard to support federal programs like bypass mail and Essential Air Service, and we will continue to work to make sure that mail, as well as vital goods and services can continue to be delivered to rural Alaskan communities. There will undoubtedly be gaps, but Alaskans across the state are coming together to develop solutions," said the Alaska Congressional Delegation. "Alaskans are resilient and by working together, we will find a path forward."
