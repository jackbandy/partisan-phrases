Sullivan Statement on the First Reported Coronavirus Case in Alaska


Today, U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) issued the following statement on the first reported COVID-19 case in Alaska: 

"The health and well-being of Alaskans is my top priority. We are some of the most resilient people anywhere and, working together, we can limit the spread and lessen the impact of this virus. The individual in this case followed the appropriate protocol -- by self-reporting -- and our dedicated medical professionals were prepared.

"Last week, we passed an emergency supplemental funding package totaling $8.3 billion to allocate money to state, local and tribal health providers, as well as community health centers. These funds are already coming to Alaska.  

"My staff and I are in regular contact with our state health officials and elected officials, standing by to give them the assistance needed in containing and treating this virus and dealing with its negative economic impacts." 

NOTE: Senator Sullivan has set up a page on his website where Alaskans can find resources and up-to-date information on the coronavirus from reputable sources.
