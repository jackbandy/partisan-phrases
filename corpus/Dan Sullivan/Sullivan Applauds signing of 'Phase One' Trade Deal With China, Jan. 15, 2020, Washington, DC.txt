Sullivan Applauds signing of 'Phase One' Trade Deal With China


U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) released the following statement after attending the signing of the U.S.-China Phase One Trade Agreement at the White House: 

"I want to commend the President and his team--particularly U.S. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer--for negotiating this trade agreement. Today's agreement is an important, serious, and much-needed first step in resetting the U.S.-China economic relationship. Importantly, it is positive news for Alaska's fishermen. China's commitment to purchase Alaska seafood at levels significantly exceeding the country's historic purchases will be a welcome boon to a vital Alaska industry that has been caught in the middle of ongoing trade negotiations. Because of our seafood industry, China is Alaska's largest trading partner. I have repeatedly urged President Trump, Ambassador Lighthizer, and Secretary of Commerce Ross to include seafood in Phase One of these trade negotiations, and I'm glad that they did so.

"While I am pleased to see a focus on addressing some of China's most egregiously unfair trade practices, such as intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and barriers to financial services, China must still commit to the long-term structural changes to its trade and economic policies that are necessary for a freer, fairer and more reciprocal trade relationship with the United States. It will be imperative that China address the "promise fatigue' that the U.S. has experienced in previous agreements, over many years, whereby China makes commitments to the United States and then does not follow through on them."
