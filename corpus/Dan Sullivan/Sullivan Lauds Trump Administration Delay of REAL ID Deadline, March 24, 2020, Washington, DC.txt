Sullivan Lauds Trump Administration Delay of REAL ID Deadline


U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) today applauded the Trump administration for announcing yesterday the delay of the October 1 deadline for Americans to obtain federally-compliant driver's licenses or identification cards, known as REAL ID. On March 9, after consulting with Alaskans, particularly rural Alaska leaders and residents, Senator Sullivan sent a letter to President Trump and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf urging them to postpone the REAL ID implementation deadline. As the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic heightened concerns about the deadline, Sullivan co-sponsored the Delay REAL ID Act to require the Department of Homeland Security to immediately push back the implementation date by at least one year.

"In the midst of this national health and economic crisis, it is unreasonable to expect Americans and Alaskans, especially those in remote communities, to rush to the DMV to comply with an impending federal ID mandate," said Senator Sullivan. "We have more serious and immediate priorities, such as ensuring our citizens are practicing social distancing and keeping themselves healthy, and protecting our economy from the long-term ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic. Alaska and the entire country need more time on REAL ID. I appreciate the President for recognizing this and taking decisive action to alleviate the concerns of Alaskans."

Congress passed the "REAL ID Act" in 2005 following a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission that the federal government "set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses."

President Trump made the delay announcement during a briefing by the White House Coronavirus Task Force on Monday.  The Trump administration has not yet announced a new REAL ID compliance deadline.
