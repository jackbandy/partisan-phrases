Sullivan Applauds Trump Admin. Modernizing NEPA Environmental Reviews


U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) released the following statement regarding the Trump administration's release of a proposed rule to modernize and accelerate environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

"Because of our broken public works and environmental approval process, our country's infrastructure is in serious disrepair," said Senator Sullivan. "Our bridges, our water mains, our transportation corridors, our energy grid--the very foundations of our country--are crumbling. Reform is desperately needed and I applaud the Trump administration's proposed rule to modernize our NEPA regulations to provide more certainty and consistency during the permitting process. The administration's proposal in many significant ways parallels a title of the Rebuild America Now (RAN) Act, a bill that I introduced which would set realistic deadlines for NEPA reviews, simplify NEPA documents, and streamline the NEPA process--all of which would help us build vital infrastructure projects faster as well as create jobs for the hardworking men and women who build our country. As the Trump administration proposal is being considered, I'll continue to work on the RAN Act and support other reasonable reforms both through regulations and legislation."
