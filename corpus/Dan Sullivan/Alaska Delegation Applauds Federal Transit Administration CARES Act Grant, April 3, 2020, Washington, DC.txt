Alaska Delegation Applauds Federal Transit Administration CARES Act Grant


Today, the Alaska Congressional Delegation applauded funding appropriated by the CARES Act and awarded by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to help Alaska prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19 through various existing urban, rural, and tribal grant programs. The state of Alaska will receive a total of $144,852,468.

"Alaskans have watched as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases have increased in our state, and it is clear that an all-hands-on-deck approach that includes federal support will be needed to turn the tide in this pandemic," said the Congressional Delegation. "From our urban areas to our rural communities, the health and safety of Alaskans continue to be our top concern. The CARES Act was a critical piece of legislation, and the funding made available by it through the FTA is yet another tool Alaska will use to fight COVID-19 and keep families healthy and connected to one another. The smooth movement of doctors, medicines, and medical equipment is needed to ensure all communities have access to lifesaving treatment. We will continue working at all levels of government to ensure that our infrastructure can meet this crucial moment for Alaskans and our broader public health needs."
