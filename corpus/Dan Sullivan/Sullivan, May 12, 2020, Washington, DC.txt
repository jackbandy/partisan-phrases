Sullivan, Trump Discuss Cares Act Flexibility for States, Municipalities & Tribes


U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) attended a meeting at the White House today with President Donald Trump, Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin, and a group of Republican senators to discuss several legislative proposals to grant states and local governments flexibility to use relief funds under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Last Thursday, Sullivan introduced the Coronavirus Relief Fund Flexibility Act, which would allow the Coronavirus Relief Funds provided under the CARES Act to be used to replace revenue shortfalls resulting from the pandemic.

"I had a constructive meeting with President Trump and Secretary Mnuchin at the White House today where we discussed something that's really important for our state, municipalities and boroughs--the ability to flexibly use CARES Act resources to effectively respond to the pandemic," said Senator Sullivan. "My bipartisan legislation was a focus of the conversation, and I must say, having the support of the Governor and state legislators and local officials of both parties certainly helps me make the case that this bill should get across the goal line. I'll keep fighting until Alaska leaders have the flexibility they need to make our local governments whole from the crisis and keep our first responders on the payroll."

Under the CARES Act, states, tribes, and municipalities have access to $150 billion in relief funding. The U.S. Treasury Department restricted these resources from being directed toward revenue shortfalls. The Coronavirus Relief Fund Flexibility Act aims to clarify the matter and ensure these recipients can have the certainty to proceed with their pandemic recovery efforts, including keeping vital first responders on the payroll.
