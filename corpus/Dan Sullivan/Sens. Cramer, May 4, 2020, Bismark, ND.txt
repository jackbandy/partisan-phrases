Sens. Cramer, Inhofe, Sullivan: Sec. Ross Commits to Evaluating all Federal Authorities to Secure America's Energy Independence


U.S. Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) spoke with Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross this past week about their position that we need to apply tariffs, including 232 national security tariffs, to oil imports from Saudi Arabia and Russia as a result of their anticompetitive behavior. This is Sen. Inhofe's second call with Secretary Ross since his March 18 letter.

"Saudi Arabia and Russia's continued dumping of crude is having lasting and damaging effects on American energy producers. This is intentional -- Russia and Saudi Arabia are tired of competing with us and want to put American oil and gas producers out of business so they can once again dictate energy prices to the world. The consequences are significant -- thousands of jobs and millions in capital investment have been lost to these foreign market manipulations. Secretary Ross acknowledged the importance of America's energy independence as a key part of our national security and is evaluating all of the federal government's authorities, including tariffs, to secure America's energy independence."
