Alaska Delegation Welcomes $124 Million in CARES Act Grants for Alaska's Airports


Today, the Alaska Congressional Delegation welcomed over $124 million appropriated by the CARES Act and awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to provide immediate relief to 257 of Alaska's airports amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The funding will support continuing operations and replace the vital revenue lost from the sharp decline in airport traffic caused by COVID-19. This financial support may be used for airport capital expenditures, airport payroll and utilities, and debt payments. 

"Alaska's geography is unlike that of any other state, and our aviation sector is vital to accessing our rural communities. The COVID-19 pandemic has made the transportation of medical supplies particularly important by putting our airports front and center in getting Alaskans the support they need to weather this crisis," said the Congressional Delegation. "The funding announced by the DOT is welcome news for our dedicated pilots, mechanics, and other airport workers on the frontlines of this pandemic. COVID-19 has caused much uncertainty across industries in our state. As a Delegation, we will continue working at the federal level to ensure that both the people of Alaska and our economy come out healthier, safer, and stronger than ever before."
