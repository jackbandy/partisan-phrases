"The impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and the oil price war have hit Alaska hard--prompting some difficult decisions. We have been in constant communication with Alyeska and our North Slope operators, and recognize this is a prudent step to take at this time. We will continue to do everything we can to support Alaska's economy, stabilize the oil markets, and address the current crisis so that we can overcome these impacts as quickly as possible."
