Sullivan Cosponsors Modernization of the Older Americans Act


U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) has signed on as a cosponsor of the Modernization of the Older Americans Act Amendments, legislation that reauthorizes the Older Americans Act (OAA) for another four years. The safety-net program was first enacted in 1965 and ensures seniors have access to needed services as they age. Alaska is slated to receive approximately $4.8 million in federal funding for Fiscal Year 2020. This reauthorization includes a seven percent increase in program funding for Native American and Alaska Native elders, and an additional $500,000 annually for technical assistance for tribal organizations to implement OAA programs.

"Senior citizens, particularly those on a budget, have relied on the Older Americans Act to provide life-improving services going back more than 50 years--services that provide them with the certainty and peace of mind they deserve," said Senator Sullivan. "This reauthorization also includes important provisions that provide grants for our Alaska Native elders and the tribal organizations that meet their needs. I'm glad to join Senator Murkowski and more than two dozen of my Senate colleagues in cosponsoring this bill to support Alaska's low-income and vulnerable older residents."

BACKGROUND:
