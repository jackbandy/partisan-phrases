Alaska Delegation Applauds HHS Grants to Prevent and Combat COVID-19


Today, the Alaska Congressional Delegation applauded funding awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to health care providers across Alaska. This funding became available through legislation passed earlier this month, providing $8.3 billion in emergency funding to combat the spread of COVID-19.

"The COVID-19 epidemic represents uncharted territory for our country. Our doctors, nurses, and other caregivers are on the front lines, and they should be provided the support they need to continue keeping Alaskans safe," said the Congressional Delegation. "The health and safety of Alaskans is paramount, and these HHS grants will go a long way toward ensuring that everyone in our state -- from our urban areas to rural villages -- has access to the health care necessary to turn the tide in the fight against this urgent public health crisis. Our state's health care providers continue to display remarkable bravery and heroism amid much uncertainty, and our state is deeply grateful. There is much work ahead, and the situation surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak changes from day to day. Alaskans are resilient, and if we continue working together, we will get through this crisis stronger than ever before."
