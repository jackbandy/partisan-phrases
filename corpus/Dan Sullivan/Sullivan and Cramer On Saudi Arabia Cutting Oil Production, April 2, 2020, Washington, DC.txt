Sullivan and Cramer On Saudi Arabia Cutting Oil Production


U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) released the following statements on President Trump's news that Saudi Arabia has agreed to work with OPEC to stabilize the energy market by decreasing oil production. Both Senators have led the effort to get Saudi Arabia to cut production and both received calls from the Saudi Arabia Ambassador to the United States Reema bint Bandar Al Saud announcing the news.

"While I appreciated the Saudi Ambassador's call today indicating that the Kingdom will cut oil production and will call for an emergency meeting of OPEC next week to help stabilize global energy prices, this is a classic case of actions speaking louder than words. And we need action.," said Senator Sullivan. "Significant damage has already been done by Saudi Arabia's actions to date, which have negatively impacted tens of thousands of workers in Alaska and North Dakota, as well as other energy producing states. We will monitor this issue very closely as we continue to evaluate the long-term strategic relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia." 

"President Trump's announcement is a positive step, and I urge him to keep pressing both Russia and Saudi Arabia. As I told the Saudi Ambassador today, this de-facto war on American energy needs to end now," said Senator Cramer. "The Saudis have been an ally in the region, and I hope recent events underscore the importance of our partnership. The world needs to know we won't be bullied and will always put America first."
