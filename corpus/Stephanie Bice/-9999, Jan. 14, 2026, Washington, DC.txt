Mrs. BICE. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you, along with my colleague,  Representative Keith Self of the Texas Third Congressional District, to  honor Colonel Chuck DeBellevue, United States Air Force retired, an  American patriot whose extraordinary courage, leadership, and lifetime  of service reflect the highest ideals of our Nation and the United  States Air Force.

On September 9, 1972, then-Captain DeBellevue and his F-4 Phantom II  crewmate, Captain John Madden, shot down two north Vietnamese MiG-19s.  These victories marked DeBellevue's fifth and sixth aerial kills,  making him the highest scoring American ace of the Vietnam war.

Over the course of his career, Colonel DeBellevue flew 220 combat  missions, including 96 over North Vietnam. He is credited with the  destruction of six North Vietnamese jet fighters in aerial combat,  making him America's leading ace of that conflict and the last American  ace to serve on Active Duty. His actions in combat remain among the  most distinguished examples of aerial valor in the United States  military history.

His decorations include the Air Force Cross, the Service's second  highest award for valor, along with three Silver Stars, three Legions  of Merit, six Distinguished Flying Crosses, and eighteen Air Medals.

Colonel DeBellevue earned a bachelor of science degree in physics  from the University of Southwestern Louisiana and was commissioned as a  second lieutenant in the United States Air Force.

Following undergraduate navigator training and an initial assignment  flying the F-4 Phantom II at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North  Carolina, he was deployed to Southeast Asia, joining the 555th Tactical  Fighter Squadron at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand.

Following his combat tour, Colonel DeBellevue attended undergraduate  pilot training and became a full-fledged F-4 pilot. He subsequently  served with distinction in multiple fighter squadrons, including the  335th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, the  8th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico,  and the 43rd Tactical Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf Air Force Base,  Alaska. His staff assignments included service at the Pentagon, Alaskan  Air Command, and the Fifth Air Force.

After his promotion to colonel in 1985, he attended the Army War  College and held senior leadership positions across the Air Force.

In his final Active-Duty assignment, he was commander of Air Force  ROTC Detachment 440 at the University of Missouri, Columbia, where he  continued to shape and mentor future officers.

Colonel DeBellevue is a command pilot with more than 3,000 flying  hours, including over 550 hours in combat. In 1972, he and the other  Vietnam war aces were awarded the MacKay Trophy and the Veterans of  Foreign Wars Armed Forces Award. He retired from Active Duty February 1  of 1998, after 30 years of honorable service.

Following his retirement from the Air Force, Colonel DeBellevue  continued his commitment to service through work in the aerospace  industry, higher education, and veteran advocacy. I am proud to say he  currently resides in Oklahoma's Fifth Congressional District, which I  represent. He serves on the boards of the Dale K. Graham Veterans  Foundation and the Air Warrior Courage Foundation and is president of  the American Fighter Aces Association. In 2023, he was honored as River  Rat of the Year and named the Air Warrior Courage Foundation  Humanitarian of the Year.

Colonel DeBellevue's lifetime of service has been recognized with  numerous honors, including selection as Outstanding Alumnus of the  University of Louisiana in 2008, introduction to the Louisiana Aviation  Hall of Fame in 2011, and the Oklahoma Military Hall of Fame in 2012.  In 2014, he was the recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal as a  member of the American Fighter Aces.

Colonel DeBellevue and his wife, Sally, have raised a family grounded  in service, integrity, and love of country.

Mr. Speaker, Colonel Charles ``Chuck'' DeBellevue represents the very  best of the United States Air Force and of those Americans who have  answered our Nation's call with uncommon valor and lifelong dedication.  It is fitting that his service and legacy be entered into the  Congressional Record so that future generations may know and be  inspired by his example.
