Recognizing Simona Elvin


Mrs. BICE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate my incredible  Marine Corps fellow, Captain Simona Elvin, for her tremendous work this  past year in my office.

Simona has been instrumental in helping prepare for legislation,  meetings, and defense events. Her expertise has been crucial in  crafting legislation that directly benefits our servicemembers in  Oklahoma's Fifth Congressional District. Her hard work in my office and  service to our Nation are applaudable.

Mr. Speaker, I will miss Simona, not only for what she has brought to  us legislatively but also for who she is as a person. From day one, it  was obvious that she would fit well with Team Bice. Her attitude,  spirit, and wit will be truly missed, especially at Monday morning  coffee.

This past weekend was the 126th Army-Navy game. As a member of the  Board of Visitors at West Point, this is not easy to say, but for  Simona, I will: Congrats. Go Navy.

Mr. Speaker, she will be truly missed.
