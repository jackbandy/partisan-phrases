Horrific Ice Abuses

Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, in the span of 12 weeks, our country was  shaken by the tragic killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, who lost  their lives because of the violent and reckless choices that the Trump  administration has made.

When I went to Minneapolis shortly after Renee Good's killing, I  heard firsthand how the Trump administration's dangerous escalation of  immigration enforcement is a threat not just to Minnesota but to every  community and every American.

Since Trump took office, at least six people have died during  enforcement activities by Federal agents. People are not just dying in  our streets. They are also dying in immigration detention centers run  by ICE and private companies that have been empowered to profit off of  detaining mothers, fathers, and children who pose no threat to our  communities.

Just last year alone, 32 people died in ICE detention, including Jean  Wilson Brutus, who had been detained at Delaney Hall in Newark, New  Jersey.

While this administration claims they have our communities' best  interests in mind, they have already proved through their actions from  New Jersey to Minnesota and across the country that safety is not their  priority. No one is safe in Trump's America, not mothers, not fathers,  not our elders, and not even our children.

That is why we must continue to stand up to fight for our communities  and why we must drive Trump's paramilitary out of our communities, why  we must end ICE, why we must end private detentions, why we must remove  Secretary Noem, why we must remove Stephen Miller, and why we must  continue to fight for the soul of our Nation.
