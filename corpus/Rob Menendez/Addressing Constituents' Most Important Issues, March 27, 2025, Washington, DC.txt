Addressing Constituents' Most Important Issues


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689192/addressing-constituents-most-important-issues


Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, more than 700,000 New Jerseyans sent me  here to be their voice in Congress and to address the challenges they  face each and every day.

Many of those constituents have sent me messages advocating for what  is most important to them. Thousands have written asking me to protect  Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. Hundreds more wrote about the  rising costs of childcare and housing. Many have asked me to stop the  scourge of gun violence in our communities.

Not a single person, not one, wrote about loosening regulations on  their commercial walk-in coolers and refrigerators.

Why, then, are those the bills that Republicans brought to the floor  this  week? Maybe it is because Republicans don't have solutions to the  challenges that most Americans are facing. Maybe it is because the  Republican budget slashes billions of dollars from Medicaid and food  assistance to the most vulnerable amongst us. Maybe that is why they  prefer to talk about refrigerators.

House Democrats, on the other hand, continue to present an  alternative to the American people and fight for the progress that they  deserve. Democrats are ready to lower the costs of childcare by  expanding the number of childcare facilities across the country. We are  pushing for record new investments in affordable housing and incentives  for first-time home buyers.

That is what the American people are asking for, and that is what  House Democrats are fighting for.
