Saving Homeowners From Overregulation with Exceptional Rinsing Act


Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Ranking  Member Pallone, for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, House Republicans ended 2025 by failing to extend  Affordable Care Act tax credits causing healthcare costs to skyrocket  for millions of Americans.

Since President Trump took office, electricity prices have gone up by  13 percent nationwide and 20 percent in New Jersey, leaving over 80  million Americans struggling to pay their utility bills. Instead of  addressing the affordability crisis that they have ignored, that  President Trump has called a hoax, the Republicans' priority on day one  is showerheads.

It is obscene that with all the work we need to do to uplift American  families, to give them a fair shot at the American Dream, the  Republican majority would choose instead to focus on showerheads. Why?  Because it is important to one person and one person only, Donald  Trump.

Not once, at any of the townhalls I have had, has anyone said that  their showerhead pressure is their top concern. Housing, yes.  Healthcare, yes. Childcare, yes. Not once did they say showerheads was  their primary concern.

If my colleagues were serious about governing, we would be voting on  protecting healthcare, lowering costs, and addressing the real issues  that working families are facing. We would not be here today talking  about showerheads.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to get serious and focus  on the priorities our constituents sent us here to address. For all  these reasons and so many more, I strongly oppose this bill.
