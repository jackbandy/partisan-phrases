Supporting Federal Judiciary and Judges


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689013/supporting-federal-judiciary-and-judges


Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our Federal  judiciary and the judges who work tirelessly to uphold and defend our  democracy.

The hypocrisy that we are seeing unfold among our colleagues across  the aisle and in this administration is deeply concerning. The  separation of powers is a cornerstone of our democracy. Each and every  day Federal judges work as a check on the powers of both the  legislative and executive branches, regardless of who is in charge.  This is a good thing and something each and every one of us should be  working to protect.

Instead, our colleagues across the aisle are seeking to impeach  Federal judges, calling for unprecedented changes to our judicial  system, and trampling on the most basic and fundamental tenets of our  Constitution. How much more hypocritical can they be?

The Biden administration faced 133 multistate lawsuits from  Republican attorneys general. Texas Attorney General Paxton alone filed  over 100 lawsuits against the Biden administration. Republicans are now  seeking to undermine and attack the same judiciary they used to take  the Biden administration to court, and they are personally attacking  judges whose decisions they disagree with.

Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to stand against this reckless attack on  our judiciary.
