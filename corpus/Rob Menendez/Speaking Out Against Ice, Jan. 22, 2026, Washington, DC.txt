Speaking Out Against Ice

Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, last week, a mother of three, a U.S.  citizen, was killed in broad daylight. You would think in that moment  Republicans would find their voice to speak out against the cruelty of  this administration. Her children were robbed of memories that make a  life, and they won't have their mother there for them.

This week, ICE, DHS took this 5-year-old boy, Liam Ramos, from his  family and from his community. This is what Liam's teacher says about  him:

``He is very friendly. He comes into class every day, and he just  brightens the room. His friends haven't asked about him yet, but I know  that they'll catch on.''

Mr. Speaker, what they will catch onto, those 5-year-olds, the age of  my daughter, is that this government, this administration, House  Republicans have failed the American people. They failed our  communities. They failed to keep us safe in the name of something that  the Trump administration has lied to the American people about.

This is the face of the people you are taking from our communities,  from their families. It is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that you  have not found your voice to speak out against it.
