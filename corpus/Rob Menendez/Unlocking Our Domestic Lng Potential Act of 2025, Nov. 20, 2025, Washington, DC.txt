Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R.  1949.

Mr. Speaker, this bill would force the Department of Energy to  rubberstamp every LNG export and strip the Department of its ability to  review whether those exports are actually in the public interest.

At a time when families across the country are already seeing rising  costs, Republicans are doing the opposite of what is needed. Instead of  working to lower energy bills, they are prioritizing legislation that  props up the fossil fuel industry and blocks affordable, clean energy  that is ready to be connected to the grid.

We already know that increased LNG exports means higher energy prices  for our communities at a time when families are already facing an  affordability crisis. Due to skyrocketing demand, including from data  centers, families in New Jersey saw a 20 percent spike in electricity  bills this summer.

Further, Republicans claim that we need more fossil fuels to compete  with China. If that is their concern, why advance a bill that makes it  easier for China to purchase even more of our domestic energy? Why are  we driving up our own energy bills to help an adversary? It makes  absolutely no sense.

If we are serious about competing with China, we should take an all- of-the-above strategy to energy production and fast-track clean energy  onto the grid.

Further, my colleagues across the aisle should tell the Trump  administration to get Revolution Wind, which is off the coast of Rhode  Island, back on track. That is how we produce more energy in this  country. Doing so would bring down prices for American families in the  process.

Mr. Speaker, I am strongly opposed to this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to join me. Let's put the interests of our communities and  of our country first.
