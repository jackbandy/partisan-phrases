Safety in America


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1700054/safety-in-america


Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I have said for months that no one is safe  in Trump's America. From New Jersey to Minnesota, mothers, fathers,  children--no one is safe. We have seen people like Greg Bovino and his  masked paramilitaries come into our communities and cause an immense  amount of harm. We have seen 5-year-olds come home from school only to  be detained and then sent to Dilley, Texas, then be returned and see  the administration try to end their asylum claim. This is what people  are experiencing across the country. We need everyone to speak out  against it, not just in Minnesota, not just in New Jersey, and not just  Democrats but Republicans as well. This is not who we are as a country,  and we cannot be silent in this moment.
