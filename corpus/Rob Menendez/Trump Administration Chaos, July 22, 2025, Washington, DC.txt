Trump Administration Chaos

Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today frustrated by the chaos and  harm that is being caused by House Republicans under the direction of  the Trump administration. This week, the  House is coming to a standstill because Republicans refuse to address  the Epstein files despite Trump's repeated commitments to the American  people to do so.

However, their inability to deliver on their promises runs much  deeper. Trump promised to end inflation and make America affordable  again, yet inflation rose 2.7 percent in June, and the majority of  Americans rightfully blame the White House for driving up the prices of  food and groceries.

Trump said his mass deportation agenda would only target violent  criminals, but over 90 percent of detainees being held in New Jersey  have no criminal conviction.

Trump said he would improve the Affordable Care Act, yet he just  signed a bill into law that cuts over $1 trillion from healthcare and  will cause an average ACA premium increase of over $1,200 for people in  our district.

Amidst the chaos, the inaction, and the harm that is being caused in  communities nationwide, Democrats will continue to do everything we can  to protect and uplift those whom we represent. We will continue to  present an alternative pathway forward, one that fulfills the promises  of this country and delivers the results that all Americans deserve.
