Fighting for Lgbtq Rights

Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago today, our Nation made a  remarkable step toward equality with the legalization of gay marriage.  This was a day that came after decades of advocacy by individuals and  organizations across the country, including Garden State Equality in my  home State of New Jersey.

The rights of our friends and neighbors are under continuous attack  from the Trump administration including by cutting HIV treatment and  prevention and rolling back antidiscrimination protections.

More than 1.3 million Americans have sought lifesaving help by making  the call to 988. Yet this administration has eliminated funding for  those specialized services. These are blatant attempts to harm the  LGBTQ community that has already overcome so much and made incredible  strides towards equality.

It is here in this Chamber that we should be standing beside them and  fighting for them. When we are elected here to serve here in the  people's House, it is our obligation to fight for everyone that we have  the privilege of representing.

Mr. Speaker, that is what I will always do and what I urge my  colleagues across the aisle to do, as well.
