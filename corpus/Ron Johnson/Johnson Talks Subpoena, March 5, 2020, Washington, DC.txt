Johnson Talks Subpoena, Ukraine Oversight


In an interview on "The Story with Martha MacCallum" Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, spoke about his committee's continuing Ukraine oversight and a letter he sent to his colleagues to consider a subpoena as part of those oversight efforts.

Video of the interview can be found here, and excerpts are below.

"It is not our fault that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden got wrapped up in the whole Ukrainian story. But we're not closing our eyes to this. I have no idea why anybody would object to us obtaining records from a U.S. consulting firm -- run by former Clinton administration officials -- that is basically using Hunter Biden's name to strong arm the State Department to curry benefits for a corrupt Ukrainian oil company."

"Joe Biden has never adequately answered these questions. I've said repeatedly, if there's wrongdoing the American people need to understand that. If there is no wrongdoing, or if it's not significant, the American people need to understand that."

"One of the things we are preparing right now is a timeline, and it is incredibly interesting and it raises all kinds of questions. It connects all kinds of dots. Â… What I'm hoping to be able to do within the next couple of months is gather enough information, verify it through things like this subpoena and then issue at least an interim report so the American people can see what this possible corruption is. And again, it is bullying from a well-connected, swampy consulting firm."
