Johnson: Prosecutions Warranted in Floyd Case, but Riots Must End Immediately


U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the following Monday morning in response to the violence that played out over the weekend in cities across the country:

 

"The police action that resulted in the death of George Floyd was reprehensible and the officers involved should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. The resulting anger and frustration are understandable and peaceful protests are justified, but destructive riots are not. Riots and senseless destruction must end immediately. The federal government and the Department of Homeland Security should use all their resources and authorities to assist frontline local and state officials in countering this dystopian display of anarchy."
