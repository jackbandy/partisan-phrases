Johnson, Grassley Release Information About Unmasking of Americans


U.S. Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, released the recently declassified names of Obama-era officials who were behind the unmasking of Michael Flynn, following their Tuesday request. The senators released the following statement:

"Today we received a list of individuals who requested the unmasking of Lt. General Michael Flynn and others who received access to that information. The officials listed should confirm whether they reviewed this information, why they asked for it and what they did with it, and answer many other questions that have been raised by recent revelations. We are making this public because the American people have a right to know what happened. We commend Acting DNI Grenell and Attorney General Barr for their transparency and responsiveness. Our investigation of these matters has been ongoing for years, and as information finally comes to light, our focus on these issues is even more important now. The records are one step forward in an important effort to get to the bottom of what the Obama administration did during the Russia investigation and to Lt. General Flynn. We will continue to review this information and push for additional relevant disclosures until we are satisfied that the American people know the full truth."

The information identifies Dennis McDonough, Samantha Power, James Comey, John Brennan, and Joseph R. Biden, among others, as individuals who were potentially involved in the unmasking of Michael Flynn.
