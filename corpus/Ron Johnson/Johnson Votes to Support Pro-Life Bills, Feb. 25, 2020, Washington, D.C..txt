Johnson Votes to Support Pro-Life Bills


U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said this Tuesday after voting to advance two bills that protect the right to life -- specifically, in the case of babies who survive failed attempts at abortion and in that of babies far along enough toward birth that they are capable of feeling pain:

 "As a compassionate society we have an obligation to protect life, especially the life of the most vulnerable among us -- the unborn, and those babies born alive despite an abortionist's attempt to kill them," said Johnson. "America is an incredible experiment in human freedom, founded by leaders who understood that the most basic right, the right to life, is unalienable. I am proud to support these bills that promote that primary mission of our country."

 Votes on both bills, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Act and the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act received bipartisan majorities but failed to exceed the 60-vote threshold needed for passage.
