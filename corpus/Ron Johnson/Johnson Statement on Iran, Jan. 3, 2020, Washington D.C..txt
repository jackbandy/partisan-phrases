Johnson Statement on Iran


U.S. Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the following Friday in response to the death of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani:

"Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, has been escalating its malign actions for years.  It is time for Iran to de-escalate and end its terrorist acts and use of proxies. Americans will continue to support the brave men and women who have volunteered to keep us safe."
