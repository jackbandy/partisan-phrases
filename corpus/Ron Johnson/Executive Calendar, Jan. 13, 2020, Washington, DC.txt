  The online Record has been corrected to read: Mr. JOHNSON.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). Without  objection, it is so ordered. NOMINATION OF PETER GAYNOR Mr.  JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today asking the Senate to confirm  the . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================    

  The Administrator's principal duties include the operation of the  National Response Coordination Center and the effective support of all  emergency support functions. More broadly, the Administrator  coordinates the implementation of a risk-based, all-hazards strategy to  prepare for, mitigate against, respond to, and recover from natural  disasters, acts of terrorism, and other manmade disasters. 

  The Agency has over 20,000 employees and a surge capacity force of  over 9,000 volunteers to respond during local and national emergencies,  working around the clock when necessary. 

  The President's nominee to head FEMA, Mr. Peter Gaynor, has extensive  experience at the local, State, and Federal emergency management  levels. In 2018, the Senate confirmed Mr. Gaynor as the Deputy  Administrator of FEMA, and for most of last year he served as the  Acting Administrator.  Prior to Federal service, he was the director of Rhode Island's  Emergency Management Agency. For 26 years prior to his service in  emergency management positions, Mr. Gaynor served as an enlisted marine  and infantry officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. 

  Mr. Gaynor's experience will be valuable as FEMA works to implement  the Disaster Recovery Reform Act. A primary goal of that legislation is  to help ensure that the model for response to and recovery from natural  and manmade disasters is one that is locally executed, State managed,  and federally supported. 

  I am pleased to say that Mr. Gaynor's nomination has broad bipartisan  support. Our committee approved his nomination by voice vote in  November. Among others, he has received endorsements from Rhode Island  Governor Gina Raimondo, Senator Jack Reed, Big City Emergency Managers,  and the International Association of Fire Chiefs. 

  I am grateful to Mr. Gaynor for his willingness to continue serving  his country in this role and to his family for their continued  sacrifice. I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote yes on his  nomination. 

                                  Cloture Motion
