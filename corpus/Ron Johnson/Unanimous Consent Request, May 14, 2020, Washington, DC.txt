Unanimous Consent Request


  This COVID crisis has created all kinds of issues that need to be  thoroughly discussed and thoroughly debated. I think there are a number  of us on this side of the aisle--I am just one standing up--who object  to this unanimous consent request. The good news for the Senator from  Minnesota is, in talking with those colleagues, they also agree there  is a fair number of elements in this bill with which they could  probably find agreement. 

  I rise to certainly extend my hand in cooperation with the Senator  from Minnesota. Let's work on these things together, although this is  not a bill that comes through my committee's jurisdiction. I can say,  in my committee, we work across the aisle. Staff does an awful lot of  work, and we come to a conclusion. If it is not ready for a particular  markup, we go back and get the work done. We frequently pass a piece of  legislation by voice vote and then bring it to the floor when it has  all been ironed out. There is no disagreement, and there is no  objection, and we pass those bills by unanimous consent. 

  I think the problem here is that this bill has never had any kind of  committee markup or any committee work whatsoever. So I would just  suggest that the Senator from Minnesota work with her committee and her  committee chair. I see the committee chair is here in the Chamber. Work  on this. Try to find those areas of agreement. Then maybe we could pass  this and maybe potentially pass this by unanimous consent. This piece  of legislation is not ready. It hasn't gone through that process.
