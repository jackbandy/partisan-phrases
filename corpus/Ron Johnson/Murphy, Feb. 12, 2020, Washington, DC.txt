Murphy, Johnson, Barrasso to Meet with President Zelensky


U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), all members of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation, will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Friday. The senators released the following statement ahead of their meeting: 

"The U.S.-Ukraine relationship is as important now as ever. The future of Ukraine matters to the United States and we must make sure Ukraine knows that we view them as a strategic ally. This is why we're going to Kyiv as a bipartisan delegation to reinforce our support with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky."

Murphy has been a staunch supporter of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship for years. Murphy and Johnson traveled to Ukraine last year, where they met directly with President Zelensky while U.S. military aid was being withheld. In October, Murphy authored an op-ed in Buzzfeed detailing the Trump administration's systematic abandonment of Ukraine.
