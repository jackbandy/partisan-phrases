Johnson Statement on USMCA


U.S. Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said the following Thursday after voting for the USMCA trade agreement:

"Wisconsinites rely on trade agreements that will benefit businesses, ensure collaboration between our trading partners, and promote stable economic growth. The final version of the USMCA will help Wisconsin farmers and manufacturers continue to sell their goods throughout North America. I was pleased to vote for it, and I hope that this is the first of many trade agreements that will benefit Wisconsinites."
