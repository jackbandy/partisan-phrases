Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 616, the Foundation of the  Federal Bar Association Charter Amendments Act of 2025.

I was proud to lead this bill, along with our former colleague,  Congressman  Steve Chabot, in the 117th Congress when the bill passed  the House by unanimous consent. Sadly, the bill stalled in the Senate  at that time.

However, I am delighted to see that our colleagues across the Capitol  were finally able to come to an agreement this Congress and move this  important legislation.

S. 616 makes technical changes to the Foundation of the Federal Bar  Association's charter that will give the foundation the flexibility it  needs to advance its significant mission in this century.

The changes made would enable the foundation to swiftly meet the  needs and priorities of the organization and improve the administration  of Federal justice for all of our citizens.

It is critical for attorneys who practice in the Federal judiciary to  have the professional support that they need to illuminate the legal  issues that they are litigating on and to advance the interests of  their clients.

The Foundation of the Federal Bar Association provides just that  support, and it is crucial that the foundation be allowed to grow and  to serve our people with flexibility.

I thank our colleagues Senator Kennedy and Senator Whitehouse for  working together to get this bill finally across the finish line. I  urge all of our colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
