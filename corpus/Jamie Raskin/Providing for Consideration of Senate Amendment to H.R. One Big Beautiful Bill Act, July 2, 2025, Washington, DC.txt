Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I found the preamble to this big ugly bill:  We, the billionaires and our king, in order to deform and sicken our  Union, establish injustice, ensure domestic servility, weaken our  people's defenses, undermine the general welfare, and reserve to  ourselves and our posterity staggering debt servitude for eternity, do  hereby instruct the Republicans in Congress to strip 17 million people  of their healthcare, increase copays, deductibles, and premiums for  everyone else, cut 42 million people off of nutritional assistance,  increase the national debt by $4 trillion, trash renewable energy  systems, increase our electric bills for the carbon kings, all to  weaken and destroy the Constitution of the people of these United  States of America.

Please include this preamble in the legislative Record.
