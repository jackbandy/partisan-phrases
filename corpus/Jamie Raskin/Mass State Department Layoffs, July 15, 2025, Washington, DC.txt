Mass State Department Layoffs


Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, our National Archivist, our  National Security Advisor, and our  USAID Administrator took some time off from his work in these full-time  positions to exercise his additional powers as Secretary of State of  the United States.

The guy with four Federal jobs fired, en masse, more than 1,300  professional civil servants at the State Department, each of them doing  just one job and, in general, doing it in an exemplary and excellent  way. They have devoted their careers to America and America's role in  the world.

Yet, Secretary, Archivist, National Security Advisor, USAID  Administrator Rubio has robbed America of centuries of their expertise  for no apparent reason at all. This destruction of the American role in  the world comes as China is bolstering its soft power everywhere.

This is a giant blow to our national security and effectiveness in  the world.

I express gratitude to the patriotic men and women at the State  Department, many of them my constituents, for their decades of service,  and I affirm our enduring commitment to the values they have worked so  hard to advance.
