Recognizing Peyton Bolling, Miss America's Teen


Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate one of  Arkansas's own, Peyton Bolling. She was crowned recently as Miss  America's Teen, and she made history in doing so, the first Miss  Arkansas' Teen to win the coveted title of Miss America's Teen.

Madam Speaker, this comes just a year after another Arkansan, in this  case, Madison Marsh of Fort Smith, Arkansas, was crowned Miss America  2024.

When Peyton Bolling came to my office last year, she shared with me  her passion for civic engagement, an issue that demands the attention  of our next generation of leaders. Her passion to serve began at a  young age as a daughter of a U.S. Marine Corps colonel.

Peyton's dedication only grew in time as she witnessed government in  action as a U.S. Senate page. Now, she is taking her passion  nationwide, encouraging our young people to get involved and shape  their communities for the better.

This Rogers, Arkansas, native and proud Bentonville High School Tiger  has made Arkansas proud.

I congratulate Peyton. I look forward to seeing all that she  accomplishes as Miss America's Teen and beyond.
