Mr. STEIL. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to the  Fiscal Year 2026 Defense Appropriations Act, which provides $7.5  million to support continued research of conductive pigments and  coatings in batteries.

Advancing battery technology is essential to providing our military  with longer-lasting, more reliable energy sources. Better battery  technology will also benefit the American people through broader energy  innovation.

My amendment No. 274, included in Bipartisan En Bloc No. 7, continues  the Navy's work to research and test conductive pigments and coatings  for batteries. This research will help in building towards eventual  wide-scale production.

Continued research on innovative battery coatings will heighten  military readiness, improve energy efficiency, and benefit the American  people.

I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
