"What's the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, you ask? Put simply, it's a federal program that's used to fund presidential campaigns.

Given that not a single one of the candidates running for president this year has even asked for these funds, and no candidate that has taken the money has won in 16 years, I say we eliminate it.

Watch my latest episode of #SquealTV and see why we need to redirect this $$ towards tackling our debt."
