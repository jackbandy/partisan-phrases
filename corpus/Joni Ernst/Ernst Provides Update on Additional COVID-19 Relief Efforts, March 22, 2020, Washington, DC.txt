U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) is continuing to work through the weekend to help deliver additional relief to Iowans across the state. As the Senate continues to forge ahead on the Phase 3 relief package, Ernst has been hosting calls with Iowans from all corners of the state that represent workers and businesses in industries across the spectrum. Today, the Senate is expected to vote on moving forward with the bipartisan Phase 3 package--making the additional relief Iowans and all Americans are calling for one step closer to reality.

Ernst is focused on a number of areas important to Iowans in this Phase 3 package, but three areas she highlights in this short video:

Iowa's health care industry and workers on the front lines;Iowa's child care providers, centers, and workers; and,Iowa's small businesses and workers across the state's economy.
