During Women's History Month, Ernst Continues Fighting to Expand Opportunities for Women Across the Country


Kicking off Women's History Month, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), the first female elected to federal office from the state of Iowa and the first female combat veteran elected to the Senate, today highlighted two trailblazing women--Susan B. Anthony, a pioneer in the women's suffrage movement, and Hattie Caraway, the first woman elected to serve a full term as a U.S. Senator.

Ernst also spoke on the issues she is working on for women in the Senate--like her bipartisan measure to increase access to child care, her bill to expand health care choices for women by creating access to contraceptives over-the-counter (OTC) and without a prescription, as well as her proposal to provide working parents the opportunity to take paid time off to spend time with their newborn or newly adopted child in those first precious few weeks.
