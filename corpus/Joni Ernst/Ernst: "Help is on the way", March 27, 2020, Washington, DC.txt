Ernst: "Help is on the way"


U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), who has been fighting relentlessly to get Iowans the immediate relief they need in the face of COVID-19, today applauded the president for swiftly signing the Phase 3 relief package into law.

"To my fellow Iowans: help is on the way," said Senator Ernst, member of the Senate Small Business Committee. "The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the lives of Iowans across our great state, and these unprecedented times require an extraordinary response. In the face of this crisis, Congress and the Trump Administration have come together -- in a bipartisan way -- stepped up, and provided critical relief to families and workers across the country.

"Iowans are resilient and I'm confident we will get through this, but it will take an-all-hands-on-deck effort, working together at all levels -- from the federal government down to each and every Iowan. This too shall pass: stay safe, and stay strong."
