As a survivor myself, I'm pleased we are providing for the women, men, and children who are at a heightened risk during this crisis. We are sending support to #Iowa's domestic violence shelters & coalitions & nearly $2M to bolster the @ndvh.

Thank you to all of the DV shelter workers and advocates who are supporting victims during this pandemic--it's a great reminder to victims: you are never alone."
