Ernst: It's Imperative We Get This Bill Done and Support Our Families

On getting relief to Iowa families:

"If there is a way that we can provide our hardworking Americans, my Iowans, and opportunity to pay their rent, to make a car payment, to put food on their table during this pandemic, I think it is the right thing to do."

On supporting workers and small businesses:

"We have struck a very good balance in making sure that we are supporting the American worker, as well as making sure that we keep these businesses viable. It is important for our economy that not only are we supporting workers, but that those workers--once the pandemic is over--have somewhere that they can go back to work."

On the Senate staying in session until a deal is reached:

"I have been a long supporter of working through weekends, working through recesses, whenever we have pressing matters in Congress. Yes, we will work through the weekend. It is imperative that we get this bill done and support our families. That is first and foremost on our minds--and we're going to make it happen.
