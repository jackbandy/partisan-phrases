Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025

Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, since January, DOGE has saved $115 billion.  That amounts to--order, please.

Ms. ERNST. That amounts to $714 per taxpayer.

Ms. ERNST. Some of DOGE's findings include that the Small Business  Administration gave out more than $300 million in loans to thousands of  children 11 years and younger; Agencies were paying for tens of  thousands of unused software licenses; and the Department of Veterans  Affairs was paying $56,000 to water eight plants for 5 years.

Thanks to DOGE, that contract was canceled. Now the plants will  actually be watered for free.

While DOGE keeps delivering more savings every day, Democrats are  more upset by the effort to stop wasteful spending than by the misuse  of tax dollars.

Ms. ERNST. As I always say, if you can't find waste in Washington,  you are not looking.

Ms. ERNST. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. We  can't afford the Washington business as usual that gave us $36 trillion  of debt.

Ms. ERNST. I yield.

Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Would the Senator yield for a question?

Ms. ERNST. No.
