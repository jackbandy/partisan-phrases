Ernst: It's going to take a partnership to tackle the Coronavirus


U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today encouraged her colleagues in Congress, as well as officials at the state and local levels, to continue working together to protect Iowans and all Americans from the coronavirus (COVID-19). Last week, Ernst supported overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation to support federal, state, and local authorities in their efforts and has been in consistent communication with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds about the steps being taken to keep Iowans safe. Ernst said in part, "it's going to take a partnership to get through this episode."
