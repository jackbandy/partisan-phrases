Combat Veteran Joni Ernst Commends Trump for Decisive Action, Calls for US to Remain Vigilant Against Iran


U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a former company commander in Iraq and the first female combat veteran elected to the Senate, released the following statement today after President Trump's remarks to the nation:

"President Trump's decisive action took out a thug and known terrorist, Qassem Soleimani, and sent a clear, strong message to Iran: there are consequences for crossing a red line," said Senator Ernst, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. "As someone who's worn our nation's uniform, and served as a company commander in Iraq, I'm confident in the capabilities of our military and intelligence personnel, and I commend them for their ongoing efforts in the region. While I'm hopeful Iran is choosing the smart path--for their own sake--by de-escalating, in the meantime we must continue our maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime and remain vigilant against the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism."
