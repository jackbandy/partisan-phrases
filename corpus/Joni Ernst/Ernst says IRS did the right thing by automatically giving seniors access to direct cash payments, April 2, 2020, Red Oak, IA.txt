Ernst says IRS did the right thing by automatically giving seniors access to direct cash payments


Included in the Phase 3 relief package, Congress gave the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) the authority to waive a tax filing requirement for seniors and others who normally do not file taxes in order for them to receive the direct cash assistance. Early this week, it was reported that the IRS would require these folks to file taxes creating confusion among seniors in Iowa and across the country on whether or not they would get access to the direct cash assistance.

Senator Joni Ernst, and 21 of her colleagues, yesterday penned a letter to the IRS and U.S. Department of Treasury calling on the agencies to automatically qualify seniors for the cash payments. Last night, Treasury clarified that Social Security retirement and disability recipients will not need to file an abbreviated tax return, but the cash payments will be automatically deposited into their bank accounts. 

"In this time of crisis, there's already so much uncertainty, that's why it's vital we communicate clearly to Iowans, and all Americans, about the assistance they will be receiving as a result of the bipartisan relief packages we've delivered. I'm glad the IRS and Treasury Department did the right thing, followed through on what we asked, and most importantly automatically qualify our seniors for the direct cash payments," said Senator Ernst, member of the Senate Small Business Committee.
