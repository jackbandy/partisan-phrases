"1/3 When it comes to addressing fraud in the student loan system, there needs to be a fair and transparent process in place.

2/3 While I support making improvements to the previous @usedgov rule -- one that was very costly to hard-working folks across the country -- I'm concerned this new proposed rule will adversely impact Iowans, especially our veterans, from getting the relief they're seeking.

3/3 We should go back to the drawing board to ensure we have a process that not only protects our students, but the American taxpayer."
