Ernst Statement on Trump Administration's Announcement of Direct Assistance to Farmers


U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy, issued the following statement after President Trump's announcement to provide direct relief to farmers as a result of the CARES Act:

"Iowa farmers are resilient, working sun-up to sun-down, but we know this pandemic has challenged them. That's why I worked hard in the bipartisan CARES Act to provide them with support by bolstering the Commodity Credit Corporation and giving USDA the ability to provide direct assistance to farmers. Today, the president announced his administration's plans to use the $16 billion in funding we provided for direct payments, getting this aid straight into the hands of our hardworking farmers and producers."

Today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced details of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) which will provide up to $16 billion in direct payments to deliver relief to America's farmers and ranchers impacted by COVID-19
