Ernst: "All Hands on Deck' to Address COVID-19


U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today continued to urge her fellow Americans to work together to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and to find ways to support folks in Iowa and across the country who have been adversely impacted. Ernst stated that she is working with Democrats and Republicans at the federal level to provide resources to Iowa's families, workers, and small businesses.

In addition, Ernst praised the ongoing efforts of Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds to keep Iowans safe and highlighted her meeting this past weekend with Governor Reynolds and other state officials where she heard from Iowa grocers about their needs and concerns and to ensure they are able to continue to get supplies available to families across the state.

Finally, Ernst called on all Iowans to look out for folks in their communities--to make sure their neighbors, the elderly, and others who are vulnerable are taken care of as we work through this pandemic.
