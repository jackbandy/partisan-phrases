Ernst Statement on Senate Democrats Blocking Funding for Small Businesses


U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Small Business Committee who has been calling on the Senate to bolster funding for the newly-created and vital small business emergency relief program--called the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)--issued the following statement after Senate Democrats blocked additional and critically-needed funding for it:

"After hearing from Iowans and seeing the overwhelming response of small businesses across the country, it's clear we need to bolster the Paycheck Protection Program. We don't have time for political games; we're in a crisis. Workers and employers in Iowa and across the country need this relief now more than ever, so let's put aside the politics and swiftly get this specific additional support for small businesses approved so money can keep flowing, Iowa workers can continue to collect a paycheck, and our state's small businesses can stay afloat," said Senator Ernst.

Senator Ernst continues to be in constant communication with Iowans from every corner and county of the state to ensure folks are receiving the support they need, including the state's families, small business owners, health care workers, and more. She hosted a telephone town hall yesterday with Iowa small businesses and has participated in several Q&A sessions over the last few days, connecting with hundreds of Iowans.

As a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, Ernst fought hard to ensure small businesses were a priority in the Phase 3 relief package. Highlighted below are a number of the emergency relief measures Ernst successfully included in the bipartisan Phase 3 package that help support Iowa's small businesses:

Protecting workers and small businesses by allowing local banks and credit unions to provide federally-backed loans for small businesses to keep their employees on payroll and to pay bills; loans can be forgiven if they maintain payroll.Expanding loan access to child care providers, non-profits, and businesses with less than 500 employees.Background on Ernst's efforts to combat COVID-19:
