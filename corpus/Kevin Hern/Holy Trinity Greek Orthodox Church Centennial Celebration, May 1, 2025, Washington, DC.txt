Mr. HERN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Holy  Trinity Greek Orthodox Church on its centennial anniversary.

Established in 1925, this parish has served Tulsa and the Greek  Orthodox Archdiocese of America for a century. The Church continues to  be a strong and dedicated partner in the Tulsa community.

This impressive anniversary highlights the congregation's devotion to  the greater Tulsa community, as well as their unwavering faith in God  and commitment to His will. One hundred years of service is an  extraordinary accomplishment.

The rich traditions of the Orthodox Church extend back to the  earliest days of Christianity, established in the lands surrounding the  Mediterranean, where the first Christian communities lived and  worshipped. These traditions have survived millennia, connecting the  modern Orthodox Church to the earliest practitioners of our faith and  welcoming congregants of all races and cultures.

Congratulations to Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church of Tulsa for  reaching this significant milestone. I join the congregation and Tulsa  community-at-large in celebrating this centennial anniversary, and I  sincerely wish the Church sustained success and prosperity for years to  come.
