Epstein Files Transparency Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696811/epstein-files-transparency-act


Ms. ANSARI. Mr. Speaker, the walls are closing in on Donald Trump and  his rich and powerful friends who either abused or raped children or  who were enabling and complicit in these heinous crimes for decades.

This vote today matters, but here is the truth: Donald Trump could  direct the Department of Justice to release the files today. He is  choosing not to. Led by Oversight and Government Reform Democrats, they  are already under subpoena and have refused. This is an ongoing cover- up by the Trump White House.   Mike Johnson and the White House have  been complicit.

Mr. Speaker, what is Trump hiding? Why not release the files today?  Release the files today.
