Moment of Silence in Remembrance of El Camaron Gigante Victims


Ms. ANSARI. Mr. Speaker, a tragic incident occurred last night in my  district outside the El Camaron Gigante restaurant in Glendale. A  senseless act of violence took the lives of three people, injured five  others, and shattered our community.

I am heartbroken to say that my district has once again been touched  by gun violence as far, far too many have.

No one should be unsafe in this country eating in a restaurant or  celebrating a holiday like Cinco de Mayo with friends and family.

Mr. Speaker, in memory of the innocent victims of this tragedy, their  families, and the entire community, I would ask for everyone present in  the Chamber to please rise for a moment of silence.
