Opposing Legislative Voter Suppression

Ms. ANSARI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in firm opposition to the Republican  passage of the so-called SAVE Act, an act of legislative voter  suppression that will make it much harder for most people to vote, the  cornerstone of our democracy.

This bill, which just passed the Republican House, is designed to  combat a nonexistent problem. Noncitizens are already not allowed to  vote under Federal law. Instances of fraudulent, noncitizen voting are  exceedingly rare. You are literally more likely to get struck by  lightning than encounter noncitizen voting.

To address this made-up problem, Republicans have passed a draconian  bill that would make it extremely difficult and costly for  servicemembers, married women, and disadvantaged Americans to register  to vote.

In most cases it requires a person to present their birth certificate  matching a current ID. There are no exceptions for the 70 million  American women who changed their married name.

This bill also mandates in-person visits to register to vote,  disenfranchising potentially tens of thousands of deployed  servicemembers, as well as Native Americans in rural areas like  northern Arizona. This is a shocking act of voter suppression.
