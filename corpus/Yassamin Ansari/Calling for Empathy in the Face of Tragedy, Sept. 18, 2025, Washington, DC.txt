Calling for Empathy in the Face of Tragedy

Ms. ANSARI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for empathy in the wake  of fear-driven hate. Fear has become the air we breathe in America.

Parents breathe it as they drop their kids at school, wondering if  today will be the day they get a call that no parent should ever get.  Teachers breathe it, walking into classrooms, rehearsing how they might  shield their students.

Immigrant families breathe it in their own neighborhoods where ICE  raids at schools and festivals turn everyday life into a source of  terror. Transgender Americans breathe it just stepping outside, never  knowing if they will be targeted for simply existing as themselves.

Journalists and everyday Americans breathe it for simply exercising  their free speech rights. Elected leaders, including myself, breathe it  after watching colleagues and public figures gunned down in front of  their families.

This is the America we are living in right now, and this is not okay.  We don't need to agree with someone's politics to say that their murder  is a tragedy. The assassination of Charles Kirk, the murders of  Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the  countless children lost to school shootings, are not partisan issues.  These are human tragedies.

Violence against any American is violence against us all. Yet what  did we hear in the immediate aftermath? We didn't have space for grace  or respect for families left behind. We heard Fox News hosts declare  this is a war.

Mr. Speaker, that is not what America needs right now. That instinct  to weaponize tragedy betrays our humanity because political  disagreements, even vast ideological differences, never justify  violence.

The assassination of Charlie Kirk is a reminder of the imminent  threat that having so many guns in our society poses to all of us, not  just to our immediate safety, but to our freedom and our democracy.  Violence cannot heal division. History teaches us that it only deepens  it.

Somewhere along the way we have lost our empathy. We started debating  which families deserve protection, which communities deserve safety,  and which children deserve dignity. That is not who we are supposed to  be.

Empathy is not weakness. Empathy is strength, and empathy is action.  It is action against the epidemic of loneliness that leaves millions  disconnected and vulnerable, a crisis that fuels despair and  radicalization.

We need to invest in connection in this country: in schools, in civic  spaces, in mental health services, and in communities where people can  see one another as human beings again.

Empathy is action against the viciousness of unchecked social media.  Cruelty isn't an accident of these platforms. It is their business  model.

When algorithms reward division and hate, that hate doesn't stay  online. It shows up in our streets, in our schools, and in our  politics.

Congress cannot keep looking away while Big Tech profits from tearing  our communities apart. Empathy is action against gun violence, the fear  that stalks every one of us. It stalks every school, every community,  and every public gathering.

Enough with the excuses. Enough is enough.

Children's lives are worth more than the profits of gun  manufacturers. We need commonsense gun safety laws, and we need funding  for mental health care.

We cannot weaponize tragedy to silence dissent. When hate and fear  are unleashed, then nobody is safe. Today it may be immigrants;  tomorrow, transgender Americans; last week, a conservative political  leader. Hate corrodes the bonds of belonging for all of us.

I am asking my colleagues: Resist the temptation to harden your  hearts. Choose empathy instead. Choose courage over cruelty. Choose  action over indifference.

That is because our strength as a nation will never be measured by  how viciously we fight one another, but how deeply we care for one  another. Let this moment of grief be a call to empathy, to decency, and  to action.
