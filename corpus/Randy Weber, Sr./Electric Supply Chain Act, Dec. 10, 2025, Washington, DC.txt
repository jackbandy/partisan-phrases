Electric Supply Chain Act


Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chair, the things that make America great are  the things that America makes.

How do we do that?

We have an electric grid, Mr. Chair, and that electric grid is under  real pressure. Demand is climbing fast and driven by manufacturing, by  technology, and the needs for a modern economy while large amounts of  dependable thermal generation are scheduled to retire.

Mr. Chair, when you put those two trends together, you get a grid  that must work harder than ever and cannot afford any weak links. That  is exactly why the Electric Supply Chain Act is on this floor this day.

The bill directs the Department of Energy to regularly assess the  supply chains for the components that keep our bulk power system  running--not after a crisis, not after a breakdown, but proactively.

We know the risks are real, Mr. Chair. Our Nation's electric grid is  the largest machine ever built, and it depends on thousands of  specialized parts: transformers, inverters, control systems, many of  which have long lead times or limited manufacturers.

Any bottleneck, any shortage, any compromised component puts  reliability at risk and drives costs higher for families and  businesses.

This legislation strengthens our posture. It gives us the visibility  we need  to stay ahead of threats, support domestic production, and ensure  Americans have access to secure, dispatchable, and reliable power.

The things that America makes are the things that make America great.  We do this with dispatchable power.

Mr. Chair, this is exactly the kind of forward-looking policy  Congress should be doing. I thank Chairman Latta and Chairman Guthrie  for their leadership.

Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Electric Supply  Chain Act now.
