Anniversary of Santa Fe Shooting


Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, May 18, marks 7 years  since the heartbreaking and evil tragedy struck the town of Santa Fe,  Texas.

Mr. Speaker, it has been 7 years since 10 innocent lives were stolen  in a senseless act of violence that shook our community to its very  core. Lives were cut short. Families changed forever.

I will never forget getting that phone call. I remember walking the  school halls a week after the shooting and seeing the pain etched on  the faces of the parents, the students, and the first responders.

I attended the funerals. I wept with the families. Those were our  kids. These were our teachers. These were our neighbors.

Yet, Mr. Speaker, in the face of that darkness, something else stood  out: the unshakeable spirit of Santa Fe, Texas. That Texas town showed  the world what it means to be strong, what it means to come together,  and what it means to rise above any occasion.

Santa Fe is resilient, Mr. Speaker. Santa Fe is faithful, and Santa  Fe is still standing. May we never forget the lives we lost, and may we  always honor them by standing for life, for truth, and for the  communities that we are blessed to represent.

God bless Santa Fe. God bless Texas, and may God continue to bless  these United States of America.
