Recognizing the Retirement of Dr. Tom Johnson


Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the well- deserved retirement of Dr. Tom Johnson, a dedicated leader and public  servant who has made a lasting impact on Lamar State College Orange and  the community of Southeast Texas.

For seven years, Dr. Johnson has led Lamar State College Orange with  passion, determination, and a hands-on approach. He rolled up his  sleeves every day to deliver real results, record-breaking enrollment  and graduation rates, new vocational programs, the opening of a  satellite campus, and the construction of important new academic  buildings.

He even helped launch a nationally successful bass fishing team and  established the Gatemouth Brown outdoor plaza to honor the legacy of  the late Orange blues musician. These achievements are more than just  accomplishments, they are the foundation of opportunity for countless  Texans.

His impact on the community spans beyond Lamar State College. Johnson  began his career as an officer in the Houston Police Department, where  he served in a variety of patrol and administrative positions before  retiring from a 20-year law enforcement career.

Dr. Johnson's leadership has not only transformed Lamar State College  Orange but has paved the way for future generations to pursue the  American Dream right here in Texas.

On behalf of Texas' 14th Congressional District and this great  Nation, I want to thank Dr. Johnson for his service and dedication. His  hard work and vision set an example for all leaders.

I congratulate Dr. Johnson on his well-earned retirement. May it  bring him the rest and reward he so richly deserves.
