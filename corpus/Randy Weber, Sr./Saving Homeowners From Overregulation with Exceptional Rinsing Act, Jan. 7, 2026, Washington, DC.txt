Saving Homeowners From Overregulation with Exceptional Rinsing Act

Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  SHOWER Act, led by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Fry).

Over the last several years, Americans have seen firsthand what  happens when a radical regulatory agenda takes over Washington. The  previous administration, it is sad to say, inserted itself into nearly  every aspect of American life, raising costs and imposing rules that  made no sense for American families.

One of the clearest examples is what they did, believe it or not, to  our showers. They twisted the law to claim--you can't make this stuff  up--that the 2.5-gallon-per-minute standard applied to the entire  shower system instead of just each individual showerhead. You can't  make this stuff up. Quite frankly, I think they were all wet. The  result was weaker water pressure and daily frustration for homeowners,  all in the name of government control.

For a year now, this Congress has worked to reverse the damage left  behind by previous administrations, Mr. Speaker. The SHOWER Act is  simply another step in that effort. It locks in the law's original  intent and ensures that future leftist administrations cannot weaponize  regulations against everyday Americans again.

This bill is one of many we must pass, Mr. Speaker, to reverse the  harm already done and restore America to the one we once knew. Mr.  Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the SHOWER Act.
