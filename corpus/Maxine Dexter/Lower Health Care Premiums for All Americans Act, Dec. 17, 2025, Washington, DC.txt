Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the GOP  higher healthcare costs for worse coverage act.

I did not spend 20 years as an ICU doctor saving lives to come to  Congress and sit back while Republicans strip healthcare coverage from  millions. No. I came to Congress to fight for affordable, accessible  healthcare for all.

This bill does nothing to accomplish that goal. Worse than that, it  pushes people toward less coverage at a higher cost and opens a  backdoor abortion ban that marches us a step closer to a national one.
