Hands Off Crater Lake National Park


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, Oregon's Crater Lake National Park is a  national treasure. As a lifelong hiker and camper, I have a deep  affection for it among other national parks.

During my high school and college years, road trips to national parks  like Crater Lake were all I could afford, but what they offered was  priceless: awe, adventure, and connection.

For families across this Nation, these parks provide an affordable  way to explore, learn, and build lifelong memories.

Just as Oregonians are gearing up for a summer of enjoying our most  treasured places, Trump is driving out the public servants who protect  them. Kevin Heatley, Crater Lake National Park's superintendent, has  resigned.

Trump cut off one-half of his permanent staff, leading to  unsustainable workloads and the deterioration of the care that Crater  Lake demands.

Experienced professionals are being driven out under this  administration's corrosive leadership. Our public lands deserve better,  and Americans deserve better.

I will not stand by while Trump attacks our public lands. We must  protect our national parks and the public servants who protect them.

Hands off Crater Lake, and hands off our national parks.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Nunn of Iowa.) I would like to welcome  all of the students to your Congress. Thank you for joining us here  today.
