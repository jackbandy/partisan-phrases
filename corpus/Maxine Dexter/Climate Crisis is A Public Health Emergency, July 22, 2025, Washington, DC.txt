Climate Crisis is A Public Health Emergency

Ms. DEXTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to declare that climate  crisis is a public health emergency, and the Federal Government must  treat it as such.

In the last decade, more than half of the 120 public health emergency  declarations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services were  a result of climate-related events: extreme heat, wildfire smoke,  hurricanes, floods, and the spread of disease.

Last week, I introduced the Climate Health Emergency Act to address  this reality head-on. It directs the Secretary of the Department of  Health and Human Services to declare the climate crisis a public health  emergency.

This declaration will unlock emergency powers and coordination to  allow an effective response to the rapidly escalating public health  threat posed by climate change. Enabling interagency coordination, this  bill will break down silos, maximizing our ability to effectively and  efficiently respond.

As a lung and critical care physician, I have seen the direct harm  climate change has on our patients: organs shutting down from heat  exposure and lungs failing from smoke inhalation. I will not stand by  silently as our government continues to fail to meet this crisis with  the urgency it so demands.

Madam Speaker, I urge your support. Our children deserve a healthy  future. Our job is to fight for it.
