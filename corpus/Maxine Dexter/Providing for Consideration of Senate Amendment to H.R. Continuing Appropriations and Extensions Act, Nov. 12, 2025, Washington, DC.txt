Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  rule and the underlying bill.

As a physician who spent 20 years saving lives, I did not come to  Congress to let healthcare be decimated by Congress. I came to fight  for my constituents who deserve to be able to see a doctor they trust,  afford their medication, and keep their families healthy.

If House Republicans let the ACA tax credits expire, they are  complicit in forcing Oregonians to make impossible choices, like  whether to keep their insurance or put food on the table.

As a physician, I know what comes next. People go without. They go  uninsured, they delay care, and they skip refills. They get sicker, and  sometimes they end up in medical debt that is devastating.

The cost of living is already too damn high. Republicans are  committed to cutting Americans' care. They patently rejected amendments  to protect Americans, ignoring millions of American families who are  desperate for relief.

I will be an absolute ``no'' on the rule and the underlying bill, and  I refuse to give up on ensuring affordable healthcare for all.
