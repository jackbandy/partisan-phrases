Your Tax Dollars Are Funding This

Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell the American people  exactly what their tax dollars are being used for: imprisoning  children, even infants.

Last month, DHS agents detained a sick 7-year-old and her parents in  an urgent care parking lot while they were trying to get her medical  attention.

Then they sent that child to the Nation's largest family detention  facility, recently reopened by Trump, a facility where families report  there is contaminated food, limited access to clean water, and where  there have been confirmed measles cases.

Your tax dollars are funding this.

Last Friday, I traveled to Texas to fight to bring Diana and her  family home to Oregon. I am grateful that Diana is home safe in  Gresham.

This never should have happened in the first place. It is immoral to  jail children. It should enrage every American that their tax dollars  are being used to do so.

Congress controls the power of the purse. It is past time to reassert  that authority and end this horrific practice. We must draw a bright  red line: Taxpayer dollars cannot be used to imprison children. That is  the bare minimum.
