Condemning Anti-Semitism


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, this year, I received a letter from Rachel,  a mother in my district with stage IV lung cancer who is living on  borrowed time. She is depending on future innovation driven by NIH  research to see her son grow up.

Her words are more powerful than mine, so I will read them directly.  ``I could write endless words about how many will be devastated by  these funding cuts, but this is not that kind of letter. Despite my  generous nature, cancer has taught me to be selfish.

``Every single day, I think about my mortality. How long do I have  left? Is that shoulder pain or something else? Will I be alive to see  my son graduate from high school? He turned 11 [in February], and I  made him a lemon cake.

``NIH funding cuts will no doubt shorten my life. There is no truth  about which I have ever been more certain.''

Mr. Speaker, our constituents are literally begging for their lives.  As a physician and mother, I cannot speak enough about the harm that  this bill, this cut to NIH funding, will do. I understand the  importance of NIH funding because that is the driver of innovation and  scientific discovery.

To my Republican colleagues, now is the time to show courage. Stop  these cuts to the NIH. Do not undermine scientific innovation.

To Rachel, I will fight for you with everything I have. You deserve  to see your son graduate.
