Providing for Consideration of H.J. Res. Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Department of Energy Relating to ``Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer Gas-Fired Instantaneous Water Heaters''; Providing for Consideration of H.J. Res. Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Environmental Protection Agency Relating to ``Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems: Procedures for Facilitating Compliance, Including Netting and Exemptions''; and Providing for Consideration of H.

Ms. DEXTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule  which allows for consideration of the Republicans' extreme budget that  slashes funding for vital programs like Medicaid, SNAP, and Federal  housing assistance to bankroll $4.5 trillion in tax breaks for  billionaires and big corporations.

Last week, I got a devastating call from Susan who lives in Sandy,  Oregon. She and her husband worked all their lives and saved diligently  for retirement but had a single accident that wiped out their savings.  They are now in their seventies and rely on Medicaid, SNAP, and utility  assistance to just make ends meet each month.

The legislation in front of us today would rip these benefits from  Susan and her husband, denying them access to healthcare, forcing them  to ration their food, and jeopardizing their ability to remain in their  home. For what? To line the pockets of the ultrawealthy, to pad the  bottom line of corporations already raking in profits.

I offered six commonsense amendments to this bill to safeguard  critical programs for people like Susan and so many Oregonians like  her. Republicans rejected every single one of my amendments.

Ms. DEXTER. Madam Speaker, as has been true all along, they have no  interest in protecting America's middle class.
