Ongoing Massacre in Gaza


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a mother, a physician, and a  Member of Congress horrified by the ongoing massacre in Gaza.

This is not a humanitarian crisis in abstract. It is the result of  choices, choices leading to preventable famine.

While bombs are leveling entire cities, the only so-called aid group  allowed in, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, is annihilating the very  principles of neutrality and humanitarian relief.

Now, we are hearing reports that aid will be contingent on a cease- fire.

Let me be clear: That is morally bankrupt.

You do not negotiate over food. You do not bargain with medicine. You  do not turn aid sites into deathtraps.

Palestinians in Gaza deserve safety, dignity, and the right to self- determination, not starvation.

Oregonians have been clear: The United States has a moral obligation  to use its power to end this tragedy. A critical step is demanding the  U.N. Relief and Works Agency is immediately reinstated in Gaza for  large-scale aid delivery.
