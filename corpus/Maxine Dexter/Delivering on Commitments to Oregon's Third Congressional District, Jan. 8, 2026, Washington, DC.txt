Delivering on Commitments to Oregon's Third Congressional District


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, in my first year in Congress, I made a  simple commitment to my district: to listen and to get things done.

This week, I am proud to share that I am delivering on that  commitment. I secured over $6 million in Community Project Funding for  seven transformative community-led initiatives across the district in  Portland, Gresham, Sandy, and Multnomah County.

These investments will help prevent youth violence, modernize  emergency response systems, strengthen wastewater infrastructure,  expand behavioral healthcare, and protect the clean water our  communities depend on.

Each project came directly from local leaders working to solve urgent  issues on the ground, and I fought to make sure every single one  received funding.

This is what government should be: responsive, collaborative, and  focused on our people delivering results for them and our families.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this progress, and I am just getting  started for the people of Oregon's Third.
