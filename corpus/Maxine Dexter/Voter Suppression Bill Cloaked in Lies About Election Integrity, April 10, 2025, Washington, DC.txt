Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, today, House Republicans betrayed their  mothers, their sisters, their daughters, and every woman in their life.

The so-called SAVE Act is an antiwoman, antidemocracy, voter  suppression bill cloaked in lies about election integrity.

With this vote, House Republicans have jeopardized access to the  ballot box for nearly 70 million American women. That isn't just a  number; it is personal. It is the working mom in Sandy who can't afford  to take time off work to go get paperwork. It is the woman in Portland  whose name no longer matches her birth certificate and doesn't have  $160 for a passport.

In the year 2025, I cannot believe I have to come to the House floor  to argue for a woman's right to vote, but I will fight this Republican  effort to disempower women today and every single day if I need to.

As a mother, I will not allow this country to continue to strip our  daughters of their rights. We cannot force them to grow up in a world  where they have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers. I  call on my Senate colleagues to show courage and defeat this despicable  bill.
