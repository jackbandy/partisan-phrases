Protect Children's Innocence Act


Ms. DEXTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to say as clearly as I  possibly can: Politicians have no role in the medical exam rooms.

As a physician who spent 20 years caring for patients, I know  responsible care requires building trust and understanding between a  patient, their parent, and their physician. I never consulted a  politician, and no doctor ever should.

At a time when our country is facing a critical physician shortage,  Republicans are threatening them with going to prison simply for  providing evidence-based care.

This legislation fundamentally breaks a critical trust between  patients, their parents, and their physicians, pulling them into a  dangerous political crusade that targets our vulnerable transgender  youth.

I offered two amendments: One to ensure no doctor can be imprisoned  for providing evidence-based care and one to provide parents with  protection when supporting their children's health. Republicans refused  a vote on both.

We should be empowering doctors to take care of their patients, not  locking them up. I will be relentless to keep politicians out of the  exam room.
