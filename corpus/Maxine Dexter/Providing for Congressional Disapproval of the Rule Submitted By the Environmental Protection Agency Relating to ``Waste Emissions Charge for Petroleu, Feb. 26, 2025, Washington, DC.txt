Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  resolution to roll back a critical component of the Methane Emissions  Reduction Program.

The Oregonians I represent know that climate change poses a real and  existential threat. As a mother, I understand intimately the anxiety  our children are grappling with every day with the warming Earth that  they are inheriting. It is my commitment to mitigating climate change,  while working to adapt to it, that drives my work here.

We cannot kick this can down the road and wait to take action. As our  kids are forced to grapple with this reality, I am sick and tired of  Republican efforts to let Big Oil and corporate polluters off the hook.

The methane polluter fee that would be rolled back by this resolution  corrects a serious market failure that makes it cheaper for polluters  to waste methane than install or upgrade equipment to prevent leaks and  flaring. I will vote ``no'' because I have no interest in protecting  corporate polluters at the expense of a cleaner world for our children.

To the Oregonians watching, please know that I will come back to this  House floor time and again to ensure our message is heard loud and  clear. The climate crisis is real. It is our children who will suffer  if we do not stand up to Big Oil and corporate polluters. I implore my  colleagues to stand with me.
