Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Colorado for his  advocacy against this Congressional Review Act resolution.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to these dangerous and  unprecedented resolutions. A resource management plan is not some  obscure rule. It is the playbook for how we manage America's public  lands: balancing energy, grazing, and recreation with protecting clean  water, wildlife, and the long-term health of the land.

The three plans under attack today took years to develop. They  reflect extensive Tribal consultation, public input, and the expertise  of career scientists.

As the gentleman just said, these resolutions don't just undo those  protections. Under the Congressional Review Act, once a plan is  overturned, the Bureau of Land Management is banned from writing a new  one that is even remotely similar. In other words, the agency's hands  are tied and not just today but for years to come. That is  unprecedented.

If we go down this road, we will politicize the very foundation of  how we steward America's public lands. We will silence communities,  ignore science, and block future administrations from protecting our  climate and our health.

Mr. Speaker, public lands belong to all of us. They are a shared  inheritance and our shared responsibility. I urge my colleagues to  stand up for our public lands and vote ``no.''
