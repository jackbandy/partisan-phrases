Medicaid is Not A Handout

Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, House Republicans' all-out attack on  Medicaid is morally indefensible.

In my district alone, over 255,000 Oregonians, including 59 percent  of our children, rely on Medicaid for lifesaving care.

These aren't just numbers. They are the cancer patients fighting for  their lives, children with disabilities getting essential support, and  seniors reliant on long-term care.

Republicans want to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from the  Medicaid committee, gutting healthcare for the most vulnerable, while  billionaires and corporations get another payday.

As a critical care physician, I know what this means. Without  Medicaid, patients go without preventive care. They get sicker. They  defer lifesaving medications. Too often, they don't survive.

Medicaid is not a handout. It is a lifeline. Cutting it to fund tax  breaks for the ultrawealthy is unconscionable because healthcare is a  human right. It is not a bargaining chip.

Oregon won't stand for these cuts, and neither will I.
