Funding Crisis Pregnancy Centers

Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  proposal Republicans voted on to take money from families in need and  divert it to anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers.

As a medical doctor, I want to be crystal clear. Crisis pregnancy  centers are not medical facilities. They do not even have to employ  licensed medical professionals.

Women who seek help at these centers routinely report being misled,  pressured, or given false information during one of the most vulnerable  periods in their lives.

Democrats offered commonsense amendments that would have required  facilities receiving these Federal funds to provide medically accurate  information. That should not be too much to ask. Republicans rejected  those amendments.

The American people deserve to know exactly what that means:  Republicans are knowingly funding centers that do not have to uphold  basic medical standards, and they are doing it at the expense of  families who are already struggling.

Let us not ignore the cruelty of the timing. The day before the  anniversary of Roe v. Wade, which Trump gutted, Republicans are making  it even harder for women to get honest information to make decisions  about their own bodies.
