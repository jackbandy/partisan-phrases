Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this cruel and callous  amendment.

Mr. Chair, there are 20 days until the government shuts down. There  are 8 legislative days. What are Republicans focused on? They are  focused on flags, Pride flags.

Republicans are spending valuable floor time, time that could be used  by the government to lower costs for working families.

Ms. DEXTER. I am not waving it, Mr. Chair.

We are--

Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Chair, we are wasting valuable time trying to ban the  display of Pride flags in any workplace or common area at the  Department of Defense. This is time that could be used to fund the  government or lower costs for working families.

This obsession with attacking, dehumanizing, and villainizing our  LGBTQIA+ community is as sick as it is a waste of time.

Trump is using the same tired playbook authoritarian regimes have  used throughout history. He is dehumanizing our most vulnerable to  divide us and distract us from the fact of his failure to meaningfully  improve the lives of the people he was elected to serve.

Mr. Chair, we see this for what it is, and we refuse to let them win.  We will not erase the LGBTQIA+ community.
