Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Chair, I rise today not just as a Member of this body  but as a physician who has spent nearly two decades caring for patients  in the intensive care unit, many of them fighting for their lives  because of a system that has failed to support them before a crisis  hit.

In Oregon's Third District, we see every day how critical prevention,  treatment, and recovery programs are. We need those programs that my  colleague from New Jersey just referred to as being cut. This bill does  nothing to repair those cuts.

These aren't abstract policy ideas. They are the difference between  life and death for many of my constituents. They are critical for the  health and safety of Oregonians and Americans across this country.

That is why efforts to sustain and strengthen these programs matter  deeply to the communities I represent. They are essential for the  parents working two jobs while navigating recovery, for the young  people trying to build a future after surviving an overdose, and for  families trying to heal.

Let's not kid ourselves. While Republicans bring this reauthorization  bill to the floor, they stand by as the Trump administration dismantles  the very agency responsible for implementing these programs. They have  fired experts, erased offices, and rescinded over a billion dollars  already allocated to State and local response. Just 2 weeks ago, they  passed the largest Medicaid cut in history out of this Chamber despite  the fact that Medicaid covers 40 percent of Americans addicted to  opioids.

This wasn't fiscal accountability. It was a decision to directly  undermine the access of care for millions of people who need it most.  These are people who desperately need our compassion and care.

Do not be fooled by this game of smoke and mirrors. This kind of  hypocrisy cannot go unchallenged. Claiming to support recovery while  simultaneously gutting the programs that make it possible is politics  at its worst.

My Republican colleagues cannot honestly stand for people's need to  access treatment while kneecapping the agency that is accountable for  providing it.

Lives are at stake, and the American people are watching. They do  know what it means when elected leaders say one thing and do another,  and they deserve honesty and real action.

Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for this debate.
