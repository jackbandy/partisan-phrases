Gulf of America Act


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  ridiculous bill.

Let's be honest: This bill, along with the executive order it  reinforces, is absurd. It is unserious, ineffective, and beneath the  dignity of this institution.

Changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico won't change the fact that  the world will keep calling it exactly what it is, the Gulf of Mexico.

This isn't just about a name. It is about an administration using the  power of the Federal Government to bully the press, going so far as to  ban reporters from the Oval Office for refusing to go along with this  charade. Let's call that what it is: an assault on free speech.

Our courts have stood up against these attacks, but we can't ignore  the chilling message this sends to journalists everywhere: If you don't  fall in line, you will be punished.

That, Mr. Speaker, is a page right out of the authoritarian playbook.

Americans didn't ask for this, and they didn't vote for this. They  are struggling with real challenges, such as putting food on the table,  accessing healthcare, and rebuilding after disasters. Yet, here we are,  wasting time on political theater instead of working to actually help  them.

In the United States, we are constitutionally guaranteed the right to  challenge power, to speak truth to it, and to laugh when our leaders  make ridiculous claims. That is not disrespect. It is critical for a  healthy democracy.

That is why I offered an amendment to this bill, an amendment  Republicans refused to even take up. My amendment would have made it  absolutely clear that nothing in this bill could be used to censor the  press or authorize retaliation against news organizations for using  accurate names. This administration may have no regard for the  Constitution, but Congress must.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to remember this and to vote  against this bill.
