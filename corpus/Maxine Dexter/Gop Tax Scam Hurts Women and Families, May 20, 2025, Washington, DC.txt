Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families

Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, of all of the titles I hold, the most  important is ``mom.'' Like fierce, fighting mothers across this  country, we want a better future and a safer future for our children,  like Tiffany George. She is a courageous mother in Hood River who has  two beautiful children, Wylie and June.

Wylie, her youngest, was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder at 18  months. Very quickly, Tiffany and her husband were overwhelmed with  medical bills, doctor visits, therapies, medical equipment, and  hospital visits.

Mr. Speaker, 10 hospital visits almost put them into bankruptcy.  Medicaid was a lifeline. Without Medicaid, Wylie's lifesaving  medications would cost $9,000 a month. That is $9,000.

Democrats are united against this cruel Republican budget because we  are willing to fight for families, for their future, and for their  health.

Without food stamps and healthcare, children like Wylie will suffer.  Families will be pushed to the brink. I am here fighting every day for  Tiffany, for Wylie, and every other mother and American family who  deserves that stability.

We must fight this awful Republican budget bill.
