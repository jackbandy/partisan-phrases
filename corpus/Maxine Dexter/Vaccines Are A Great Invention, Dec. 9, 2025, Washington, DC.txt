Vaccines Are A Great Invention

Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, vaccines are one of mankind's greatest  inventions.

In the last 50 years, the World Health Organization's global vaccine  efforts have saved 154 million lives. Every single person alive today  owes something to that progress.

Yet, last week RFK, Jr. and his panel of antiscience, cherry-picked  cronies recommended ending the decades-long practice of immediately  vaccinating all newborns against Hepatitis B.

This will lead to more disease, cancer, and preventable deaths. It  will increase healthcare costs.

I am calling on acting CDC Director O'Neill to reject this  recommendation and protect our children.

I continue to call on RFK, Jr. to resign. His time at HHS has been an  embarrassment and has caused deep harm to our country.

To lead our Nation's health system, you must rely on facts and data,  not conspiracy and ego.

I will continue to stand with the Democratic Doctors Caucus fighting  against RFK, Jr.'s rejection of science and data.
