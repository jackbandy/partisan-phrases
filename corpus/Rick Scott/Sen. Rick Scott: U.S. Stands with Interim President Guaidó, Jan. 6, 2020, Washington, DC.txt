Sen. Rick Scott: U.S. Stands with Interim President Guaidó


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following violent efforts yesterday by the Maduro regime to block Juan Guaidó from a special session of the National Assembly, where he was expected to be re-elected as the legitimate President of Venezuela.

Senator Rick Scott said, "Maduro and his regime are demonstrating, once again, how desperate they are to hold on to power. Their attempts to use violence and intimidation to impede the fair re-election of Interim President Guaidó is disgraceful and won't be tolerated. Thankfully, Venezuela's political parties united in a strong showing of support for Juan Guaidó's re-election. The United States, and freedom-loving countries around the world, have recognized Juan Guaidó as the legitimate President of Venezuela, and this sad attempt to block legitimate elections won't stop our unwavering support. Maduro must go. Hopefully his actions yesterday will convince nations sitting on the fence that it's time to stand with those fighting for freedom, democracy and human rights."
