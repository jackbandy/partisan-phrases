Sen. Rick Scott: Anyone with Symptoms Should be Able to Get Tested for Chinese Coronavirus for Free


Today, as cases of the Chinese Coronavirus continue to climb in the United States, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement calling for free tests for anyone experiencing symptoms.  

Senator Rick Scott said, "We are facing a public health crisis. Nothing should get in the way of Americans' ability to protect themselves and get tested for the Chinese Coronavirus -- especially cost. Anyone experiencing symptoms should be able to get a test for free, and I'm calling for Congress to include funding for the tests in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill and pass this funding now."
