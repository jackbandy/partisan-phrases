Senator Rick Scott to Apple: Help FBI Unlock Pensacola Terrorist's iPhone


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following requests from the FBI to Apple Inc. to help unlock two iPhones that may contain information regarding the terrorist attack at NAS Pensacola.

Senator Rick Scott said, "Every American should be greatly concerned about last month's terrorist attack that killed three brave sailors in Florida. It is unthinkable that any American business would refuse to offer their resources to help get to the bottom of an attack on our nation. Fourth Amendment protections don't apply to dead terrorists. I hope Apple Inc. decides to comply with the FBI as soon as possible and be proactive in the effort to prevent future terrorist attacks."
