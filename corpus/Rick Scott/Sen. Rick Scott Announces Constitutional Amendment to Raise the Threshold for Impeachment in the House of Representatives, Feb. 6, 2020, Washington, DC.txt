Sen. Rick Scott Announces Constitutional Amendment to Raise the Threshold for Impeachment in the House of Representatives


Today, Senator Rick Scott announced a constitutional amendment that would raise the threshold to approve articles of impeachment in the House of Representatives. The amendment would require a super-majority vote of three-fifths in the House to impeach a public official. The current threshold is a simple majority.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "The partisan charade Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats made of this impeachment process over the last few months shows that the fears of our Founding Fathers were realized. They warned that impeachment could be used as a partisan tool by partisan actors. The Democrats used the impeachment process as a tool to hurt President Trump, regardless of the outcome of the Senate trial. It's a dangerous precedent and the process has to change.

 

"Our country should never again have to suffer from this partisan hackery. An act as divisive as impeachment must have bipartisan backing and overwhelming support. It should be harder -- much harder -- for either political party to take the process our Founders created as a last resort against a tyrannical leader and use it instead as a tool for the tyranny of a political majority. I look forward to all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, joining me in this effort to protect the integrity of our nation and our constitution."
