Sen. Rick Scott Provides Updates on Florida's Mobile Testing Sites


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement commending the 20 Florida counties that have implemented mobile testing sites, and continuing his call for robust testing across the state. Last week, Senator Scott called for every county in the country to have at least one mobile testing site -- with counties in hot spots like New York and South Florida needing more than one.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "I thank those Florida counties that were quick to implement mobile testing sites. Robust testing is the best way to stop the growth of the Coronavirus and help Americans get back to their normal lives. I am working with local officials across the state to make sure robust testing is available in every county and they have all the federal resources they need to keep Floridians safe."
