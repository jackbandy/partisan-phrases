Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement applauding the Department of Justice for charging Nicol√°s Maduro and 14 current and former Venezuelan officials with narco-terrorism, corruption, drug trafficking and other criminal charges.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "I've encouraged the Trump Administration to do everything in its power to hold Maduro accountable for his crimes and the genocide he is committing on the people of Venezuela. I am glad the Department of Justice is taking the historic step to indict Maduro. His brutal regime is crumbling and it's time for him to back down.
