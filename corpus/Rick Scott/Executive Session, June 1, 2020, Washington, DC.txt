Executive Session


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to proudly support  the confirmation of Judge John Badalamenti to serve as a U.S. District  Court Judge for the Middle District of Florida. Judge Badalamenti has a  distinguished record of public service, during which he has  demonstrated a deep and abiding respect for the rule of law and a  commitment to upholding the U.S. Constitution. 

  He served as an Assistant Federal Defender in the Middle District of  Florida for nearly a decade, and, as Governor of Florida, I had the  privilege to appoint him to the Second District Court of Appeal in  2015. During his time on the State appellate bench, he has consistently  demonstrated his keen legal acumen and devotion to upholding the proper  function of the judiciary in our democratic system. 

  I am proud of the work he has done, and I am proud to support his  confirmation to the Federal bench today, where he will continue to  serve our State and Nation well.
