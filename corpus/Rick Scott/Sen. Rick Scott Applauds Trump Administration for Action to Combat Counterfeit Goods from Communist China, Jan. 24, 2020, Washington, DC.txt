Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Trump Administration for Action to Combat Counterfeit Goods from Communist China


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the decision by the Trump Administration to crackdown on counterfeit goods sold online. This decision comes after Senator Scott sent a letter to the President in November asking him to work to make sure that counterfeit goods from Communist China do not enter our country. Senator Scott also has a bill, the Promoting Responsibility In Markets and E-Retailers (PRIME) Act, which will require online retailers to list the country of origin for each product they sell and requires digital apps to disclose their country of origin.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "I applaud the Administration for taking swift action to combat the growing threat of counterfeit goods from Communist China. We have to get serious about where our money is going, and we must remain vigilant about where our products come from. Protecting Americans from counterfeit goods is a positive step, but we must keep working. American consumers should know where the products they buy online are made, and my PRIME Act will create more transparency in the online retail space so consumers can make informed choices for themselves and their families."
