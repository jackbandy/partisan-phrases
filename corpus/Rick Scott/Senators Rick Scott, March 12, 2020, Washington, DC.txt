Senators Rick Scott, Josh Hawley Introduce Legislation to Ban TikTok from Government Devices


Today, Senators Rick Scott and Josh Hawley introduced legislation to ban all federal employees from using TikTok on government devices. The State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and TSA have already banned TikTok on federal government devices due to cybersecurity concerns and possible spying by the Communist Chinese government.

Senator Rick Scott said, "The use of apps like TikTok by federal employees on government devices is a risk to our networks and a threat to our national security, and I'm proud to join Senator Hawley to put an end to it. We should all be very concerned about the threat of Communist China, and I hope my colleagues will join me to implement this ban immediately and protect our national security."

Senator Josh Hawley said, "TikTok is owned by a Chinese company that includes Chinese Communist Party members on its board, and it is required by law to share user data with Beijing. The company even admitted it collects user data while their app is running in the background -- including the messages people send, pictures they share, their keystrokes and location data, you name it. As many of our federal agencies have already recognized, TikTok is a major security risk to the United States, and it has no place on government devices."
