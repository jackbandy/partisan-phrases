Letter to President Donald Trump - Rubio, Scott Urge POTUS to Approve Florida Request for Major Disaster Declaration


Dear Mr. President: We write to express support for the request made by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis that a major disaster declaration be issued for Florida as a result of the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19). According to the Florida Department of Health, there are 1,171 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and new diagnoses are rising daily. Federal government resources as well as coordination between federal and state and local officials are critical to Florida's efforts to effectively and expediently combat the COVID-19 pandemic.  We urge you to promptly approve Governor DeSantis's request for a major disaster declaration, so that the State of Florida can use a fuller range of resources to manage the unprecedented difficulties posed by COVID-19.  Thank you for your consideration of this request. Sincerely,
