Sen. Rick Scott Statement on Killing of General Qassem Soleimani


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the United States airstrike that killed General Qassem Soleimani, leader of Iran's Quds Force.

Senator Rick Scott said, "President Trump was faced with a choice: continue the Democrats' preferred strategy with Iran of sending them pallets of unmarked bills and asking them nicely to stop killing Americans or take action. He chose the latter, and the result was the death of one of the world's worst monsters. Soleimani was responsible for the death and maiming of thousands of Americans and tens of thousands worldwide.

"We should all be concerned about the potential for retaliatory strikes and escalating tensions with Iran. No one wants more war. Enough American blood has been spilled in deserts halfway around the world. But for today, let us remember the lives that were lost at the hands of this ghoul and the justice that was served."
