Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  60th anniversary of the passage of an essential piece of legislation:  the Older Americans Act. As the chairman of the Senate Special  Committee on Aging and Senator from Florida, I am committed to honoring  and supporting the more than 59 million older Americans who enrich our  communities. Florida is blessed with a dynamic senior population. In my  State and across the Nation, seniors thrive when given opportunities to  be active members of their communities and receive adequate support.

This historic bill provided the supportive, community-based framework  that has helped generations of seniors age with dignity and give back  to their communities and families, all while living rich, vibrant  lives. The Older Americans Act continues to impact more than 10 million  older Americans a year by promoting social connection and contributing  to programs aimed at supplying nutritional services, continued  education, and transportation for our aging neighbors. It has improved  the life expectancy, health outcomes, and quality of life for millions  of seniors, and that is why I am proud to be leading the fight to  reauthorize this important legislation alongside my good friend and  colleague Mr. Bill Cassidy, Senator from Louisiana and chairman of the  Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.

I will continue to fight for the reauthorization of the Older  Americans Act to ensure it is available to provide this same life- affirming support for generations to come.
