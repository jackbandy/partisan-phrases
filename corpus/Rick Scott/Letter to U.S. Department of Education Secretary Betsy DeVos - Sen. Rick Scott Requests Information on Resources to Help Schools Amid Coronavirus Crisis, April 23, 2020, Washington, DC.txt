Letter to U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos - Sen. Rick Scott Requests Information on Resources to Help Schools Amid Coronavirus Crisis


Dear Secretary DeVos:

I am extremely concerned about the outbreak of the Coronavirus and the effect it is having on our nation, including our schools. Our hearts break for the families of the individuals lost to this horrible sickness, and we must do everything we can to stop the spread of the Coronavirus and save lives. Schools across Florida and the nation have closed as we work to protect families.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) mitigation strategy includes school closure as one tool to reduce community spread of the Coronavirus. While Florida has temporarily closed schools, there is a potential that schools may be closed for a longer period of time - requiring distance learning. In an effort to prepare for any future impacts, I'm requesting the following information:

What resources are available to schools to detect and respond to cases of Coronavirus within the school?Does the Department provide guidance or best practices to schools regarding how to effectively perform online class at various grade levels?What steps should states be taking to more seamlessly transition to online education?Thank you for your efforts to continue our students' education with limited interruption as we work to end the Coronavirus. I look forward to your response as we keep working to keep Americans safe.

Sincerely,

Rick Scott

United States Senator
