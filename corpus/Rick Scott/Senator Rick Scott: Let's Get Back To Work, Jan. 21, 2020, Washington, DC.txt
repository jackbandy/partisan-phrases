Senator Rick Scott: Let's Get Back To Work


Today, Senator Rick Scott announced his "Let's Get Back To Work" video series. Throughout the impeachment trial, Senator Scott will release videos of Floridians highlighting everything Congress is not getting done for the American people, like lowering the cost of prescription drugs, passing No Budget, No Pay and securing the border.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "The House Democrats have made a mockery of our government. And you know who gets hurt the most during this trial? The American people, who are getting nothing from the federal government as long as this goes on. I knew Washington was dysfunctional, but this is a whole new level. While the Democrats continue their impeachment obsession, I remain focused on getting back to work on all the things Floridians care about, and I won't stop fighting."
