Sen. Rick Scott Applauds President Trump's Action to Hold Communist China Accountable


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following President Trump's announcement that the United States will terminate its relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO). This follows Senator Scott's calls for the WHO to be held accountable for its role in helping Communist China cover-up the coronavirus pandemic.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "I applaud President Trump for providing a clear and concise message today about the growing threat of Communist China. We know Communist China hid information and misled other nations about the coronavirus, killing hundreds of thousands around the world. Pulling out of the World Health Organization, which has proven to be nothing more than a mouthpiece for Communist China, was a bold and necessary step to protect Americans.

 

"We also know Communist China is actively trying to sabotage American efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine, which is why I introduced a bill to make sure that doesn't happen. The President made clear that Communist China's aggression and complete refusal to respect Hong Kong's autonomy that was promised during the handover in 1997 will not be tolerated. I've long called for the United States to stand against Communist China and with those fighting for freedom. The President is right to begin to revoke Hong Kong's favored trade status with the United States, take steps to suspend the entry of certain foreign nationals from China who are determined to be security risks, and study the risks Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges pose.

 

"It's time we get serious and open our eyes to Communist China and General Secretary Xi's plan for global domination, and I am glad our nation is beginning to act to hold Communist China accountable."
