Senator Rick Scott Applauds Decision to Make Bases Safer, Pushes for Hard Reset of Foreign National Training Program


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after today's update on the findings of the FBI investigation into the shooting at NAS Pensacola last month.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "I'm glad federal officials are taking steps to make our bases safer, including sending a number of potentially dangerous individuals back to their home country. This is a positive step, but more must be done when it comes to addressing the failures in this program that led to the tragic terrorist attack at NAS Pensacola. Given the FBI's confirmation that a number of Saudi nationals engaged in troubling conduct, it's clear we need a hard reset. I'm calling on the Saudi government to recall all Saudi nationals training in the U.S. back to their home country until the Department of Defense can conduct a full review of the program. I will continue to work with Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Inhofe and administration officials to get to the bottom of exactly what went wrong so we can figure out if these training programs are safe to continue."
