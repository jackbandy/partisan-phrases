Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, I rise, on behalf of all  Floridians, to recognize the meaningful visit of Ecumenical Patriarch  of Constantinople, His All-Holiness Bartholomew of the Orthodox Church  to our Nation's Capital. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has been on  the forefront of religious freedom for his entire ministry, and now as  the longest serving Archbishop of Constantinople in the two millennia  history of Christianity, he has worked to bring people together for the  purpose of advancing greater cooperation and mutual understanding. He  has been honored with the Congressional Gold Medal and, soon, the  Templeton Prize. Florida is home to many Orthodox churches, Orthodox  Christians, and communities who share deep gratitude for the leadership  of His All-Holiness Bartholomew and his mission to serve others. I join  with Floridians and the U.S. Senate in welcoming His All-Holiness  Bartholomew to the United States and our Nation's Capital.
