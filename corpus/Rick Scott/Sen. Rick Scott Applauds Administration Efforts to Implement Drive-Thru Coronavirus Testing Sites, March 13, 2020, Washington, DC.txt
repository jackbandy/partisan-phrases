Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Administration Efforts to Implement Drive-Thru Coronavirus Testing Sites


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after President Trump announced the Administration's plans to develop drive-thru Coronavirus testing sites across the country. This comes after Senator Scott's discussions with both the President and Vice President yesterday, where he urged them to implement mobile testing as the fastest way to contain the virus and keep healthcare workers safe. Yesterday, Senator Scott introduced the Coronavirus Mobile Collection Site Act to expand access to Coronavirus testing by directing HHS to reimburse states for the costs incurred to setup and run as many mobile testing sites as possible.

Senator Rick Scott said, "I applaud the President's decision to declare a national emergency and to move forward with implementing mobile testing sites across the nation. In our discussion yesterday, the President agreed with me that mobile testing is one of the best things we can do to stem the spread of the Coronavirus and give Americans the information and peace of mind they need. We must continue to do everything we can to protect the American people, including screening all passengers for a temperature before they board mass transit."
