Sen. Rick Scott: Americans Must Reject Disgusting Rhetoric and Behavior by Bernie Sanders


Today, Senator Rick Scott issued the following statement denouncing Sen. Bernie Sanders for his recent actions.

Senator Rick Scott said, "Bernie Sanders has made it clear that he is shamefully ignorant and has no respect for those fighting for freedom. His comments in support of the brutal Castro regime, and now his accusations against AIPAC for 'bigotry,' are disgusting, but not surprising from a far-left socialist pushing an anti-Israel agenda. The United States must reject this behavior and rhetoric, and stand with those fighting for freedom, democracy and human rights."
