Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Treasury Department for Sanctioning Russian Oil Firm for Supporting Maduro Regime


Today, Senator Rick Scott issued the following statement applauding the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for designating Rosneft Trading S.A., the Swiss-incorporated, Russian-controlled oil brokerage firm pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13850, as amended, for operating in the oil sector of the Venezuelan economy. OFAC also designated the chairman of the board of directors and president of Rosneft Trading S.A., Didier Casimiro, for purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Rosneft Trading S.A.

Senator Rick Scott said, "Nicolas Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela. He is a thug and a dictator who is perpetrating a genocide on his people and profiting off their suffering. I'm glad the Treasury Department is taking action against foreign entities that prop up the corrupt Maduro regime. The quickest way to end his brutal regime is to cut of the supply of money and this is an important step in that direction. We must remain vigilant. The United States and all freedom-loving nations around the world need to do everything in our power to isolate Maduro in Venezuela."
