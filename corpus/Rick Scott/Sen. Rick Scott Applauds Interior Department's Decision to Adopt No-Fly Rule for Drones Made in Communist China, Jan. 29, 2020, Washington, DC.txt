Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Interior Department's Decision to Adopt No-Fly Rule for Drones Made in Communist China


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the Department of the Interior's plan to formally adopt a no-fly rule aimed at drones made in China or with Chinese parts. Senator Scott introduced the American Security Drone Act of 2019, which prohibits the U.S. Government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats, like Iran and China.

Senator Rick Scott said, "Following many conversations between my office and the Interior Department, I'm glad to see the Department is putting national security first and adopting a no-fly rule for drones made in Communist China. The Trump administration sees the risks associated with using taxpayer dollars to purchase tech from a Communist government that is trying to spy on us. This is great news for our security. Now, we must pass my bill to codify this policy and extend it to all federal agencies, as well as local law enforcement agencies that use federal grants. We must take the threat from Communist China seriously."
