Sen. Rick Scott: Bernie Sanders' Support for Castro is Shameful


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after reports that Bernie Sanders told a political prisoner in Cuba that he didn't understand why others criticized Cuba.

Senator Rick Scott said, "This is just another disgusting example of Bernie Sanders' ignorance and undying support for the Castro regime. His continued refusal to stand up for freedom and for the people of Cuba who have endured six decades of atrocities, oppression and misery at the hands of the regime is shameful. This is not what America stands for, and every Democrat needs to do what is right -- stand for freedom and condemn Sanders."
