Letter to Florida's Seaports and Airports - Sen. Rick Scott to Florida Ports and Airports: We Must Take Action to Protect Americans from the Coronavirus


Dear Directors of Florida's Seaports and Airports:

I am extremely concerned about the threat of the coronavirus outbreak, which has already infected individuals in the United States. As the coronavirus becomes an increasing threat to our nation, I applaud you for your diligence and for taking proactive measures to protect the health of American families and travelers. Your work to protect Florida's ports is essential in combating and preventing the spread of this virus.

I urge you carefully follow all guidelines outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We have to remain proactive about the threat of coronavirus coming from China, who can't be trusted to coordinate in a transparent and efficient manner, and do everything we can to protect Americans.

Last week, I urged the Trump Administration to protect Americans by declaring coronavirus a public health emergency. While all of the cases are still travel-related, we must take every precaution. Just like we did in Florida to curb the spread of the Ebola and Zika viruses, we must take action to make every resource available to stop the disease and keep Americans healthy. As U.S. Senator, the health of the American people is my top priority and I will do everything I can to protect their safety and well-being.

Again, thank you for your hard work to protect American families. If I can be of assistance in any way, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office. I encourage you to continue doing everything you can to secure Florida's ports and prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Sincerely,
