Sen. Rick Scott: We Must Stop Growth Rate of Coronavirus to Save Lives and Economy Releases Daily Update on Coronavirus Growth Rate by State


Today, Senator Rick Scott released an update on the growth rate of cases of the Coronavirus by state, as of March 23, 2020, according to Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering data. Senator Scott will be releasing this information daily to show which states are slowing the growth of Coronavirus. Please note: data provided from John Hopkins is compiled from federal data and may have discrepancies from latest state updates.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "Last week, I put out a 30-day plan to help Americans return to their normal lives as soon as we can, but it will take everyone in the nation to implement this plan. We cannot completely close our economy. When states completely close their economy, it hurts the poorest families' ability to put food on the table. Our goal has to be to get the economy back open and that will happen once we stop the growth of Coronavirus in our nation. We're in this together and we're going to beat this. However, we can't get back to normal if we don't stop the Coronavirus. We need to start looking at the growth rate of cases by state to see which states are stopping the spread of the virus so we can share best practices. Once robust testing is available, we will be able to see which states are making better progress, with the goal of no new cases."
