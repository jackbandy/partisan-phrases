Senator Rick Scott Statement on China Trade Deal


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the President's signing of Phase 1 of the China trade deal.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "I applaud the President for trying to negotiate deals that put American businesses first. But Communist China never lives up to its commitments and I don't believe they will honor this deal. Communist China is militarizing the South China Sea, breaking the agreement to give Hong Kong autonomy and freedom, and attacking religious freedom by detaining possibly more than one million Uyghurs in internment and re-education camps. Our relationship with China is about more than just trade. We have to talk about human rights and we have to talk about China's growing influence around the world. The United States has been down this road before with Communist China. They never live up to their agreements, so why should we believe them now?"
