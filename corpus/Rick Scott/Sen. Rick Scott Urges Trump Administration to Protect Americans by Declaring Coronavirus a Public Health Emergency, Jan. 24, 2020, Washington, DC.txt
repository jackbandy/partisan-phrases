Sen. Rick Scott Urges Trump Administration to Protect Americans by Declaring Coronavirus a Public Health Emergency


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement amid reports of more confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States and following a briefing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). On Wednesday, Senator Scott sent a letter to the CDC Director requesting information about the agency's plan to combat the threat of the coronavirus and urging quick action to protect the health of American families.

Senator Rick Scott said, "We have to get serious about the threat of coronavirus coming from China. I don't trust Communist China to coordinate in a transparent and efficient manner when it comes to combatting the treat of the virus, so we have to do everything we can to protect Americans. Today, I'm calling on the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States. While all of the cases are still travel-related, we must take every precaution. Just like we did in Florida to curb the spread of the Ebola and Zika viruses, we must take action to make every resource available to contain the disease and keep Americans healthy.

 

"At the same time, we must examine the ways the virus is transmitted -- including outside the body. Until we have a greater understanding of how the virus is transmitted, we must increase screening and inspections on all products and produce coming into the United States from China."
