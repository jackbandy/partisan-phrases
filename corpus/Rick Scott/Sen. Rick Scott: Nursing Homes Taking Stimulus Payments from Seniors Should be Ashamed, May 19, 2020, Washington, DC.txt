Sen. Rick Scott: Nursing Homes Taking Stimulus Payments from Seniors Should be Ashamed


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that nursing homes in several states are requesting residents sign over their stimulus checks.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "I am sickened to hear reports that nursing homes are stealing stimulus checks from seniors. It is disgusting and unthinkable that anyone would EVER take from our most vulnerable, especially in the middle of a crisis. Anyone found to be withholding checks from seniors will be held accountable to the full extent of the law. As a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I will be working with my colleagues on ways to address and remedy this issue immediately so these citizens can receive the money they are entitled to."
