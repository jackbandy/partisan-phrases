Sen. Rick Scott Applauds President Trump for Standing with Venezuela's Rightful Leader Juan Guaidó


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement applauding President Trump for inviting Interim President of Venezuela Juan Guaidó to the White House. On Saturday, Senator Scott met with President Guaidó in Miami to discuss how the U.S. can continue to help the fight for freedom and democracy and end Maduro's murderous regime.

Senator Rick Scott said, "I encouraged President Trump to meet with Interim President Guaidó when we spoke Monday, and I am glad President Trump is taking this historic step today. This meeting, as well as having President Guaidó as his guest to last night's State of the Union, sends a clear message to Maduro that his time is up. We will never stop fighting to free the people from Maduro's brutal regime, and the United States will always stand with those fighting for freedom, democracy and human rights."
