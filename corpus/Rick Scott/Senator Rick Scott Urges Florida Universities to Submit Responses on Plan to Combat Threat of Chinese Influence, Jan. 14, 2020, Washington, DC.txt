Senator Rick Scott Urges Florida Universities to Submit Responses on Plan to Combat Threat of Chinese Influence


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following his letter to Florida university presidents requesting information on the steps they have taken to safeguard technology and intellectual property from the influence of foreign adversaries, including Communist China.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "We cannot take the threat from Communist China lightly. They are actively trying to use strategic relationships to advance their geopolitical and economic goals, which threatens our nation's security. I appreciate the responses I've received from some Florida universities detailing the steps they are taking to protect their information from Communist China. But I'm still waiting to hear from many universities in Florida. Everyone needs to understand this risk, and I look forward to hearing back from every institution as we work to protect our universities and our students."
