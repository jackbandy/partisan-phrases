Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Trump Administration for Releasing Puerto Rico Disaster Relief Funds and Heeding His Call for Transparency and Accountability


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) release of $8.3 billion in disaster relief funding to help Puerto Rico's ongoing recovery after Hurricane Maria. HUD will also appoint a Federal Financial Monitor, which follows Senator Scott and Congresswoman Jenniffer González-Colón's letter to President Trump asking the Administration to appoint a Federal Coordinator to oversee responsible implementation of Puerto Rico's disaster funding. The Coordinator will ensure disaster relief funding gets to the Island's families in a transparent and efficient manner.

Senator Rick Scott said, "I am proud the Trump Administration is releasing disaster aid funding for Puerto Rico to help the Island recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. I've spoken to President Trump multiple times about the importance of getting Puerto Rico the resources they need in a transparent and efficient manner. I'm glad the Administration decided to appoint a Federal Financial Monitor, which I fought for to make sure that families in Puerto Rico get the help they need following the devastation of Hurricane Maria and that U.S. taxpayer money is spent wisely. I will continue to do everything I can to support our brothers and sisters on the island."
