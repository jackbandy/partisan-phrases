Sen. Rick Scott: Senate Democrats Stand for Infanticide and Late-Term Abortion


Today, Senator Rick Scott issued the below statement following Senate Democrats' decision to block consideration of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Act.

Senator Rick Scott said, "Today's votes should have been common sense -- the unborn and newly-born infants are the most vulnerable among us and deserve to be welcomed with open arms. By voting against these two bills, Democrats showed how far they have shifted in their stance on abortion. Today, Democrats stood for radical, late-term abortion and infanticide, rather than to preserve the right to life for defenseless children. Their decision is horrific and shameful. I will always stand for the unborn and oppose the radical abortion agenda of today's Democrat Party."
