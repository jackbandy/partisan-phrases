Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Trump Administration For Heeding His Call to Declare Coronavirus a Public Health Emergency


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following President Trump's decision to declare the 2019 Novel Coronavirus a public health emergency in the United States, and announcement that people who pose a risk of transmitting the disease will temporarily be suspended entry into the United States. This decision follows Senator Scott's call last week for the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States.

Last Wednesday, Senator Scott sent a letter to the CDC Director requesting information about the agency's plan to combat the threat of the coronavirus and urging quick action to protect the health of American families.

Senator Rick Scott said, "Last week, I called on the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States, and I am glad they heeded that call today. Just like we did in Florida to curb the spread of the Ebola and Zika viruses, we must take action to make every resource available to contain the disease and keep Americans healthy. We still need to take additional steps to protect Americans, including increased screening and inspections on all products and produce coming into the United States from China.

"China needs to do more to keep the world community accurately informed about the spread of the virus and follow America's lead to ground Chinese commercial flights."
