All Passengers on Zaandam Ship Must be Tested and Quarantined


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement calling for measures to protect passengers and Floridians ahead of the Zaandam cruise ship's expected arrival to Port Everglades in Florida. The ship reportedly contains over 100 sick passengers and several deaths have occurred on board.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "This situation is absolutely horrific, and your heart goes out to all of those on board. We need to make sure everyone on this ship is cared for without spreading the virus further, and that we are doing everything we can to protect Floridians. If this ship docks in Florida, the federal government must coordinate with the state to make sure that every single passenger on board gets tested for Coronavirus. The ship must be held in port while everyone is tested, and all passengers must be quarantined for 14 days, even if they are not currently showing symptoms. The federal government and the state must also coordinate to determine which hospitals will be designated for those that require immediate attention. We have to ensure the sick are getting properly treated, but we can't take any chances."
