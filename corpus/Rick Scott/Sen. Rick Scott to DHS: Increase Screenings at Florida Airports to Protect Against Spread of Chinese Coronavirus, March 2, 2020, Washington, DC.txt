Sen. Rick Scott to DHS: Increase Screenings at Florida Airports to Protect Against Spread of Chinese Coronavirus


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement calling for increased screening at all of Florida's international airports following reports of two individuals testing presumptively positive for the Chinese Coronavirus in Florida, as well as the increased number of cases in Latin America to include two cases in Mexico, two cases in Brazil, one case in the Dominican Republic and one case in Ecuador.

Senator Rick Scott said, "My top priority is the health of Floridians. I'm calling on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to immediately increase screening procedures at every one of Florida's international airports. We must also work with the newly-infected countries to make sure they are conducting proper screenings of outgoing passengers. With new cases reported in Florida, as well as the increased threat of the Chinese Coronavirus from Latin America, we have to do everything we can to prevent the virus from spreading in our state -- and that starts with the thorough screening of travelers. I've been in constant contact with federal, state and local officials, and am confident they have the resources to keep families safe, but everyone must stay vigilant."

On Friday, Senator Scott sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requesting information on security protocol and resources at Florida's airports and seaports in response to new cases of the Chinese Coronavirus being reported in Latin America.
