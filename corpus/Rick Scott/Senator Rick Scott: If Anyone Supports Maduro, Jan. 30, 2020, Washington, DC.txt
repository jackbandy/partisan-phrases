Senator Rick Scott: If Anyone Supports Maduro, I Won't Stay Quiet


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement after the law firm of Foley & Lardner heeded the Senator's call to drop its client, Inspector General Reinaldo Muñoz, the top lawyer for Nicolas Maduro's brutal regime in Venezuela.

Senator Rick Scott said, "This week, I raised questions about the $12.5 million Foley & Lardner received to represent the illegitimate Maduro regime and announced that I would no longer meet with anyone from that firm. I'm glad they made the right decision to drop the Maduro Regime as a client and return the money. It's unfortunate they made the decision to give this murderous dictator legitimacy in the first place. I would recommend to Foley & Lardner that they get involved in support of the people of Venezuela. 

"Nicolás Maduro is perpetrating a genocide on the people of Venezuela. I've been to the border between Venezuela and Colombia. I met young mothers who trek hours through the jungle just to get their only meal of the day. I met children who travel through FARC-controlled territory to Colombia to go to school -- the only way they can get an education. Thousands have died, millions have fled, and Maduro and his cronies have gotten fat and rich. I hope the last few days will serve as a lesson to any other lobbying firms, consultants or organizations that if you support Maduro and his gang of thugs, I won't stay quiet."
