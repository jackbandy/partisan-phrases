Sen. Rick Scott Urges States to Act to Provide Much-Needed Financial Relief


Today, as many payments are due for families across the nation, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement calling on all states to take action to provide financial relief to individuals and small businesses that are struggling because of the Coronavirus.

 

Senator Rick Scott said, "Today is April 1, and so many across our nation are struggling to pay their rent, mortgage and other financial obligations. Congress passed a moratorium on evictions, which will provide much-needed relief and peace of mind for many Americans. Today, I'm calling on all governors in the nation to do everything they can to implement moratoriums on financial payments, including rent, mortgages, credit card payments, taxes, and utilities. I thank the many governors that have taken action to prevent evictions and foreclosures in their states. But we have to go even further to provide much-needed relief for Americans -- and we have to do it today."

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act just passed by Congress includes a nationwide moratorium on evictions, but doesn't go far enough. As part of his 30-day plan for Americans to get back to their daily lives, Senator Scott called for a moratorium on financial payments, including rent, mortgages, credit card payments, taxes, and utilities.
