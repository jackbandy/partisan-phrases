Sen. Rick Scott on the Peace Corps Ending Programs in Communist China: I'm Glad They Finally Came to Their Senses


Today, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the Peace Corps announced its decision to wind down operations in Communist China. This decision follows months of Senator Scott calling for the Peace Corps to get out of Communist China, and the introduction of Senator Scott's Peace Corps Mission Accountability Act, which prohibits all Peace Corps activity in hostile countries, including Communist China.

Senator Rick Scott said, "I'm glad the Peace Corps has finally come to its senses and sees Communist China for what it is: the second largest economy in the world and an adversary of the United States. Communist China continues to be a horrible human rights violator, one of the largest polluters in the world and a geopolitical threat. There is no reason we should prop up our adversaries with U.S. tax dollars. I've repeatedly asked the Peace Corps to pull all volunteers and resources from Communist China immediately, and I'm glad they finally decided to start protecting both taxpayer money and the American people. I will also be asking the Peace Corps to present their plan to me to ensure a speedy withdrawal of their resources in Communist China."
