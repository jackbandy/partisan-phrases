Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, I call up Lee amendment No. 4234  and ask that it be reported by number.

Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, I would like to thank my  colleague Senator Lee for working with me to stop Democrats' wasteful  spending in this package and bring accountability for the American  people.

Our Nation is nearly $39 trillion in debt, running $2 trillion  deficits, and spending billions of dollars--up to 10 percent of our  Federal spending--on fraud and abuse.

This waste is fueled, in part, by billions upon billions of wasteful  earmark spending by Democrats who treat taxpayers' cash like candy. We  should be looking at each dollar to make sure it is spent wisely.

I did that as Governor of Florida, and I was able to balance our  budget.

Let's start by looking at one earmark, $500,000 for new immigrant  community empowerment in New York City. This is an organization that  serves immigrants who are here illegally. Why should the American  taxpayer foot the bill to support illegals in sanctuary cities when so  many American citizens are struggling themselves?

We will never get inflation under control and interest rates down  until we balance the Federal budget. I ask my colleagues to support my  amendment to stop wasteful spending and wasteful earmarks.
