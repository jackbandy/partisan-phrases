Moment of Silence for Congressman William Clay

Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, as I sat on the bed this morning, trying to  get up, I received a phone call to tell me that Congressman Bill Clay  had just passed. I sat there for a few minutes, feeling sad.

Then it occurred to me that death is not the greatest loss in life.  The greatest loss in life is to die with a life not lived and still  inside a man.

Bill Clay did not die with hope for his country inside him. He did  not die with his brilliant writing inside him. He did not die with  creativity. Bill Clay did not die without working every day he walked  into this place for the people of St. Louis.
