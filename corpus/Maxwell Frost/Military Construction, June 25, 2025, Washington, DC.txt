Mr. FROST. Mr. Chair, the theme for congressional Republicans in  Congress is putting corporations over people. That is exactly what they  are doing in this bill.

Instead of focusing on supporting our veterans, they have added one  of the most reckless giveaways to the gun lobby that we have ever seen,  gutting the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the very  system that keeps guns out of the hands of abusers, felons, and people  who might be a danger to themselves and others.

Republicans want to ensure that even if the VA determines that a  veteran has a mental health condition to the point where they can't  cash their own check, the check has to be given to a family member  because they are going through a crisis, congressional Republicans want  that person to be able to go to a gun store and buy a weapon.

Most veteran suicides involve firearms. This will deeply worsen the  veteran suicide crisis. This does not protect veterans' rights. This  protects the gun lobby's profits over the lives of our veterans.

If my colleagues vote for this, they are voting for veterans to die.  Mr. Chair, don't let them tell you this bill is about liberty and  freedom.

Mr. FROST. Mr. Chair, there is no liberty in a coffin, and there is  no freedom in a funeral. Veterans will die if this passes, and anyone  who votes for it should be ashamed of themselves.
