Republican Hypocrisy and Gop Budget Plan


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688241/republican-hypocrisy-and-gop-budget-plan


Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, what we are seeing right now is nothing short  of a great betrayal. Donald Trump, president Elon Musk, and every  single Republican in this Chamber who voted to advance the Republican  budget resolution last night have been looking their constituents in  the face and lying.

They want to make cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and  SNAP. These are programs that millions of Americans rely on to survive.

They want to tear apart the safety net that millions of seniors,  veterans, disabled folks, working people, and over 38 million children  rely on.

They are willing to leave you and your families to suffer. After they  voted for the bill, they clapped about it.

Why? It is because, in a few months, they want to pass massive tax  cuts for billionaires and mega-corporations, and they want your  children and your grandparents to pay for it. This isn't just about  politics. It is an attack on everybody who has to clock in and out  every day for work.

Yesterday, House Republicans wanted to forcibly remove me from a  committee for calling out this administration's grift, but they don't  have a single damned thing to say when it comes to protecting  healthcare for children and seniors.
