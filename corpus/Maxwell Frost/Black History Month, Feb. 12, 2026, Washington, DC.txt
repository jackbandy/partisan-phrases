Black History Month


Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, in celebration of Black History Month, I rise  today to recognize extraordinary Black luminaries from central Florida  for their work and impact on the community that I proudly represent.

Through tireless advocacy, they have strengthened our neighborhoods,  expanded opportunity for those too often left behind, and improved the  lives of countless families across Orlando: Admiral David Brewer, Alvin  J. Cowans, Jennifer Desir Hilaire, Chet Glover,  Florida Supreme Court Justice James Perry, Anne Piervil, Lisa Williams,  the late great State Senator Geraldine Thompson, and the late  Eatonville Mayor Eddie Cole.

Today and always, we celebrate their achievements and continue to  honor Black excellence, not just Black history, but also the history we  are continuing to create.
