Grassley Named to Task Force Focused on Post-Pandemic Economic Re-Opening


Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and Senate president pro tempore, will join the bipartisan task force focused on safely re-opening America following the current public health crisis. The task force includes Democrat and Republican members of both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. "The resilience and ingenuity of Americans has, for decades, made the U.S. the world's number one economy. As this public health crisis begins to safely fade, individual Americans and businesses will once again lift our country to those great heights. I'm focused on what we in government can do to help jump start activity once public health officials and the public at large are ready for America's re-opening," Grassley said. "Iowans and their fellow American workers, farmers and small businesses have done their best to weather this crisis, and I'm working to make sure their concerns are heard." Grassley joined the task force at the invitation of President Trump and will provide advice and input on potential steps the government can take to safely restart business and re-open public activity while safeguarding the health of all Americans. Grassley has played a leading role in developing the legislative response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in the oversight of its implementation.
