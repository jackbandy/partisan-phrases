Iowa Safe Schools Annual Governor's Conference


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Iowa Safe Schools is holding its 15th  annual Iowa Governor's Conference on May 11, this time as a virtual  conference, given the circumstances. I understand this has been an  annual tradition starting in 2006. It is an effort to help end bullying  in our schools and to create leadership opportunities for LGBTQ youth  students from not just Iowa but from States across the Midwest. I wish  all the participants a successful conference. I hope you have a good  time.
