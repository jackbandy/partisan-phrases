Department of the Treasury Nominations

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I placed a hold on three  Department of the Treasury nominees. The nominees are Brian Morrissey,  Jr., of Virginia, to be General Counsel for the Department of the  Treasury; Francis Brooke, of Virginia, to be an Assistant Secretary of  the Treasury; and Jonathan McKernan, of Tennessee, to be an Under  Secretary of the Treasury.

During consideration of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, I worked with  my colleagues to provide wind and solar an appropriate glidepath for  the orderly phase-out of the tax credits. Ultimately, Congress  enshrined in statute a 12-month transition period based on when  projects ``begin construction.''

What it means for a project to ``begin construction'' has been well  established by Treasury guidance for more than a decade. Moreover,  Congress specifically references current Treasury guidance to set that  term's meaning in law. This is a case where both the law and  congressional intent are clear.

The Department of the Treasury is expected to issue rules and  regulations implementing the agreed upon phase-out of the wind and  solar credits by August 18, 2025.

Until I can be certain that such rules and regulations adhere to the  law and congressional intent, I intend to continue to object to the  consideration of these Treasury nominees.
