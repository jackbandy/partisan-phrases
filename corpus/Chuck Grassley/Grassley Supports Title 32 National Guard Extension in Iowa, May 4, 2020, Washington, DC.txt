Grassley Supports Title 32 National Guard Extension in Iowa


en. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) today sent a letter to President Donald Trump asking that he grant Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds's request to extend the authorization of 1,000 members of the Iowa National Guard to serve in Title 32 status through June 30, 2020. "Iowa is taking aggressive action to combat COVID-19 and the soldiers and airmen of the Iowa National Guard play a vital role in Iowa's response. Iowa's soldiers and airmen are providing critical support of testing, screening, distribution of PPE and medical supplies to all the counties in Iowa, and food packing and distributions to food banks who have seen a significant rise in demand for assistance due to the coronavirus crisis. Governor Reynolds has stated she will do all she can to only use Title 32 502(f) authority and funding if absolutely necessary," Grassley wrote.
