Coronavirus


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. COVID-19, as we all know, has thrown a wrench into  America's corners of commerce and manufacturing, in addition to  threatening lives and the loss of lives. The unprecedented effort to  stop the spread has shut down life as we know it, closing schools,  movie theaters, gyms, salons, and restaurants in a hysterical approach  to it. 

  I always say we have had pandemics before, but never have we shut  down the government, shut down Congress the way we have. Our moves have  disrupted our food supply chain and pulled the rug out from underneath  our economy. Yet, across my home State, Iowa businesses and industries  stepped up to the plate. Ethanol plants, local distilleries, and others  teamed up to produce hand sanitizers for hospitals, nursing homes, and  local law enforcement. Others retooled their factories and redirected  their workforce to sew masks and produce face shields and other  supplies to replenish personal protective equipment for our frontline  workers. Across Iowa, businesses have shown there is nothing halfway  about the Iowa Way.
