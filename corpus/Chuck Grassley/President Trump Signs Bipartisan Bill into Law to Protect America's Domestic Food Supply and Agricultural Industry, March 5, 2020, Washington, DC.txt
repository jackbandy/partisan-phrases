President Trump Signs Bipartisan Bill into Law to Protect America's Domestic Food Supply and Agricultural Industry


President Donald Trump signed into law a bipartisan bill cosponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to address the shortage of agricultural inspectors who protect the nation's food supply and agricultural industry at the border. The Protecting America's Food & Agriculture Act of 2019 would ensure the safe and secure trade of agricultural goods across our nation's borders by authorizing U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to hire additional inspectors, support staff and canine teams to fully staff America's airports, seaports and land ports of entry. "We've seen how a variety of diseases can devastate agricultural communities around the world. Now is the time to be proactive. Additional agricultural inspectors and resources along our border will continue to make safety a top priority. This is great news for our farmers and consumers. President Trump said he would stand with our farmers and he has once again demonstrated that by signing this bill into law," Grassley said.
