Tiananmen Square Massacre Anniversary


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today marks the anniversary of the 1989  Tiananmen Square Massacre, when students led demonstrations for greater  accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, freedom of the  press, and freedom of speech. One million people participated in these  historic protests.  

  Tragically, the Chinese Communist Party responded with ruthless  force, killing demonstrators and bystanders. Troops with assault rifles  and tanks fired at demonstrators and those trying to block the  military's advance into Tiananmen Square. Several hundred to several  thousand people were killed that day. 

  China has been ruled by a brutal, authoritarian regime, a communist  regime, since 1949. 

  This regime has not changed its nature, and we see that today in the  South China Sea, Hong Kong, against Taiwan, and in its response to the  COVID-19 pandemic.
