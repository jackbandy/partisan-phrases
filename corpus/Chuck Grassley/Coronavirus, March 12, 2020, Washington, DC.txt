Coronavirus


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Iowa has had 14 presumptive positive  cases of COVID-19. My staff and I remain in constant communication with  Federal agencies to ensure that the Federal Government is properly  managing emergency threats to the public health. I am also in regular  touch with the Iowa Department of Public Health, which is meeting daily  with its partners to share information with all Iowans. 

  While each day brings updates regarding COVID-19, what remains  constant are the prevention efforts that we have all heard about, and  just to name a couple: washing your hands often and covering your  cough. 

  To find further updates and guidance about the COVID-19, please visit  my website at grassley.senate.gov.
