  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on Friday, President Trump declared a  national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease outbreak.  This proclamation frees up additional resources to further efforts to  contain and combat the virus. 

  Over the weekend, my Governor of Iowa, Kim Reynolds, confirmed Iowa's  first case of community-spread COVID-19, which was in Dallas County,  Iowa. 

  It is very important to continue to take commonsense precautions.  Stay home if you are sick, wash your hands, avoid large gatherings, and  heed the advice of health officials. Extra caution now will save lives  later.
