Coronavirus


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, as the coronavirus spreads, U.S.  Federal health and intelligence agencies are working hard to protect  the public. It is critical that their hard work not go to waste.  Federal health agencies must have access to all intelligence community  information that could help combat this pandemic. To help with that  access, the intelligence community must guard against overclassifying  information. In situations like this, information is power. Our Federal  health and intelligence agencies are the best in the world. Let's show  the world that America can stop the spread of this virus. 

  My tweet for the morning is this:  

       2day at 948AM we just received the bill from the House the       ``Families First Coronavirus Response Act'' What business do       democrats hv blaming McConnell all wknd for not calling a       vote when we can't do anything until the House sends it over?       They know better Stop the politics!  

  This is in response to 172 calls my office got yesterday wondering  why we have not voted on this important bill. So it is important for me  to remind everybody that the Senate can't pass this bill or even debate  this bill until the House sends it over. We have now received it, and I  assume we will soon do that.
