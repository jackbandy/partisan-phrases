Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues. I am going  to give a 1-minute remark on things that probably should have been said  on January 21.

In January, Americans celebrated one of its greatest rituals of our  Republic; the peaceful transfer of power. I was honored to bear witness  to history. I look forward to working closely with President Trump to  advance the golden age in America.

As part of the ceremonies, my wife Barbara and I joined the inaugural  luncheon in Statutory Hall. We enjoyed a delicious meal featuring food  from America's heartland, including Nebraska beef and Minnesota apples.

An Iowa-born artist provided a feast for the eyes at that luncheon.  Her magnificent painting hung behind President Trump. It is entitled  ``American Horizon.''

Jane Wilson was born on her family farm near Seymour, IA in 1924. It  is the first time a female artist's work was selected for this  occasion. She painted American Horizon 25 years ago, 10 years before  her death at age 90.

Senator Klobuchar told us she selected the piece for its vast, open  landscape, noting how its enduring horizon reflects our enduring  democracy.

I am proud to pay tribute to an Iowan whose work became part of  history at the 60th inauguration ceremony here in the U.S. Capitol.
