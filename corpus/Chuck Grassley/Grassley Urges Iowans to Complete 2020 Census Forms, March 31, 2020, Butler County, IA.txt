Grassley Urges Iowans to Complete 2020 Census Forms


Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is encouraging Iowans to participate in National Census Day tomorrow, April 1, 2020, and complete their forms online, by phone or through mail. Audio of Grassley urging Iowans to participate in National Census Day can be found HERE. "The coronavirus is affecting everything, including the U.S. Census. As Iowans know, it's taken once every 10 years. And it's happening right now, during this pandemic. I want Iowans to spread the word to their family members and friends who may spend their winters outside of Iowa. If you live most of the year in Iowa, be sure you are counted in Iowa, even if you aren't in Iowa on April 1st. The census count determines representation in Congress. And it factors into where Uncle Sam sends out hundreds of billions of dollars every year for roads, food assistance, health care benefits and public services Iowans depend on. Every Iowan counts. And I want every Iowan counted in Iowa," Grassley said.
