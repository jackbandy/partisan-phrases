Iowa Caucuses


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this coming Monday, the first in the  Nation Iowa caucuses kick off the Presidential nomination process. The  Presidential preference part of the caucus is just one part, however.  In truth, the Iowa caucuses are an example of grassroots democracy.  Iowa voters for each political party gather in each of the 1681  precincts across my State. At these neighborhood meetings, voters  discuss issues of local and national importance and elect party  officers and convention delegates. The platform planks approved and the  officers and delegates elected often have a longer lasting impact on  the political parties than the Presidential preference votes. 

  Mr. President, in a week, all political focus will be set on my home  State of Iowa for the first in the Nation precinct caucuses. Many  pundits ask why Iowa should be awarded this much impact in the  Presidential nomination process? Iowans take this job seriously. They  study the candidates' backgrounds and positions on issues and they  thoughtfully listen to the debates. In Iowa, Presidential candidates  must explain and discuss their positions and answer tough questions  directly to citizens instead of relying on advertising. Candidates who  have done this successfully will be rewarded with momentum and  excitement that could launch the rest of their candidacy.
