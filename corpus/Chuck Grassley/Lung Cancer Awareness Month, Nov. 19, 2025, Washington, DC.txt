Lung Cancer Awareness Month

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month.  One in eighteen people receives a lung cancer diagnosis during their  lifetime. Twelve percent of the diagnoses have had no tobacco exposure.  This disease impacts hundreds of thousands of families across our  country.

My friend Marlys Carlson of Stratford, IA, finished her battle with  lung cancer in July of this year and is now with her Lord and Savior. I  want to raise awareness for lung cancer in her honor today.
