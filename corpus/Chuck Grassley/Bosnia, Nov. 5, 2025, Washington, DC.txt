Bosnia

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I came to the floor of the Senate  earlier this year warning my colleagues that the leader of one of the  subdivisions within the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Dodik,  was ignoring rulings by the national-level Bosnia court. He was  threatening to have half the country secede, which, of course, drags up  memories we should never forget about the war and the genocide in those  countries in the 1990s in which many Bosnian Iowans lost family.

Well, I am glad that he has since complied with the court ruling by  stepping down from his position as leader of the RS entity and walked  back some of his destabilizing actions. In return, the United States  has dropped sanctions against Mr. Dodik and his family.

I am all for rewarding this good behavior, but there are very good  reasons to believe that Mr. Dodik has not seen the error of his ways.  Mr. Dodik, since, falsely alleged that he was still the rightful  President of RS, questioned whether Bosnia and Herzegovina should  continue to exist--and can you believe this?--he was photographed  embracing Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Belarus.

Mr. Dodik should be on notice then that the United States is watching  to see that he stays on the straight and narrow that he wants us to  believe that he is on.

I can assure you that this Senator will be on the lookout for any  destabilizing actions that threaten the peace in Bosnia. And I will  work with the Trump administration to make sure that all actors in the  region respect the Dayton Peace Accords that ended the violence and  genocide that took place in 1995.
