  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the pandemic has disrupted just about  everything Americans take for granted in life, including our food  supply. Empty grocery store shelves have greeted U.S. consumers,  perhaps for the first time in their lifetimes. The pandemic shines a  national spotlight on the ``farm to fork'' supply chain. Market  disruptions are forcing farmers to make tough choices--milk being  dumped, eggs destroyed, and market-ready hogs may have nowhere to go.  Farmers are shouldering a heavy burden, with profound impact to their  livelihood and mental health. 

  As a champion for American agriculture, I am leading efforts to help  our farmers get through these tough times. There is a lot of help  coming from other people as well. 

  As always, Iowa pork producers want to do what they do best, which is  put food on our tables. They are teaming up with local meat lockers and  food banks to do what is called Pass the Pork, a statewide initiative  launched by Iowa Governor Reynolds. The Pass the Pork Program aims to  stock food pantries with hogs donated by local farmers and from  financial contributions to cover the costs of processing and  distribution. Where there is a will, there is a way. We all know it. 

  I salute Iowans pulling together the Iowa Way.
