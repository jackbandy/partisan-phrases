Medical Student ``Match Day'' Achievement


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, recently, medical student Match Day took  place all across America. On Match Day, thousands of medical students  learn where they will train for the next few years.

In Iowa, our State continues to lead in producing top medical talent.  At Des Moines University, 32 students were matched to residency  programs in Iowa--the State with the highest number of matches for the  Des Moines University Class of 2025. At the University of Iowa, about  25 percent of the students matched in our home State. In 2020, as then- chairman of the Finance Committee, I helped pass a law that added 1,000  new, permanent Medicare-funded medical residency programs. So far, Iowa  has gained 12 new permanent medical residency slots out of the 600  distributed nationally. Iowa will have a chance to compete for the  remaining 400 slots.

I am committed to ensuring the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services distributes these slots as the law prescribes. That law says  that at least 10 percent of these medical residency programs should go  to rural areas in our country. Now, I am concerned that CMS isn't  meeting this 10 percent requirement, so I have made my concerns known  to the Agency, and I want that Agency to know that I will be watching  closely to ensure that rural America gets a fair shot--nothing more  than the law requires. When medical students have a chance to train in  rural America, we know that they are more likely to stay in rural  America.

Finally, I want to applaud the University of Dubuque for announcing  the John and Alice Butler College of Osteopathic Medicine. This will  help educate more doctors in the State of Iowa.

With all of these efforts, Iowa is set to continue leading in the  training of medical professionals needed in our communities.
