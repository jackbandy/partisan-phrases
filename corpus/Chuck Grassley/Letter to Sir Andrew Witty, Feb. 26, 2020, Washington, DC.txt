Letter to Sir Andrew Witty, CEO of Optum - Grassley, Wyden Warn Optum to Comply with Insulin Probe


Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) wrote to Optum, a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), warning it to fully comply with the committee's investigation into skyrocketing insulin prices. Grassley and Wyden wrote that Optum's production of irrelevant, already publicly available or duplicative documents is not considered responsive to the committee's request. "Optum's unwillingness to provide the documents we requested fits an industry-wide pattern of fighting efforts to shed light on PBMs' practices," Grassley and Wyden wrote. "Families are struggling to keep up with rising costs, and they do not understand why they continue paying more money for a therapy that has remained largely unchanged for decades. Americans are demanding answers from PBMs and pharmaceutical companies, and we expect your company to begin providing them promptly." Grassley and Wyden have engaged Optum for nearly a year and have repeatedly communicated concerns about Optum's shortcomings with their request.
