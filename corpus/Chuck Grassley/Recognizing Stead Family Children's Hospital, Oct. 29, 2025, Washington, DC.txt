Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my colleagues may get tired of me  braying about great things in Iowa, but I am here again to do that.

The University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital continues to  set the standard for pediatric care in our State and our region.

In the 2025-2026 U.S. News and World Report, Iowa's Stead Family was  ranked No. 1 in Iowa and No. 12 in the Midwest under a category called  the Best Children's Hospitals ranking.

Stead Family Children's Hospital has appeared in rankings every year  since the U.S. News and World Report launched these indexes in 2007.  These rankings reflect more than numbers; they represent the hospital's  commitment to high-quality, compassionate, and innovative care.

Stead is home to Iowa's only level 4 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and  level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center, offering the highest levels of  critical and emergency care.

In 2020, Stead Family also earned the Gold Beacon Award for  excellence from the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, the  world's largest specialty nursing organization.

This award recognizes hospital units that exemplify exceptional  patient care, strong leadership, and a sustained commitment to safety  and quality.

Achieving the gold-level designation reflects Stead Family's success  in fostering an environment where collaboration, evidence-based  practice, and compassionate care thrive.

The University of Iowa Health Care system has also maintained Magnet  designation for nursing excellence in 2008, 2013, 2018, and 2023.

The Magnet Recognition Program is considered the gold standard for  nursing quality. Fewer than 10 percent of hospitals in the United  States have earned this distinction, and even fewer have achieved  redesignation multiple times.

Each of these recognitions affirms what Iowans already know: Iowa  Stead Family Children's Hospital is a place of hope, healing, and  leadership.

The future of children's health in Iowa is bright, thanks to the  tireless work of everyone at the University of Iowa Stead Family  Children's Hospital.
