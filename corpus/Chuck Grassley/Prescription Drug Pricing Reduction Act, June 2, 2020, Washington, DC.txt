Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the virus pandemic is disrupting our  daily lives in unimaginable ways. The National Institutes of Health is  working with a private sector biotech company and has already begun  early-stage human trials for a potential vaccine, so there is hope on  the horizon. However, the soaring prices of prescription drugs are  making lifesaving treatments and cures simply unaffordable for many  Americans. 

  This pandemic made clear two issues: Americans urgently want a cure,  and when lifesaving therapies and cures come to the market, Americans  must be able to afford them when their providers prescribe them. 

  My bipartisan Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act is needed now  more than ever.
