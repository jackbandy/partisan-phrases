  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, people often think of prisons as  places only to send criminals and then forget about them. But as I have  noted here before, most inmates will one day be released. 

  Helping former criminals become productive citizens is very much an  important function of our prison system. In recent weeks, inmates in  the Iowa prison system have acquired what you might consider strange  skills--but they are new skills--and even monetary allowances. They  have done this by producing personal protective equipment, like face  shields and masks. During this time of the virus pandemic, we all know  what those are used for. 

  I commend these efforts by our prisoners and our prison system  promoting this sort of training. They will help to protect the health  and safety of the prisons and our State in the short term, but they  will also help inmates in the long term. 

  These inmates are providing an essential public service, and for that  they deserve our appreciation. It is an important contribution that I  hope they will long remember and that will help them to be productive  members of society when they finish their sentences.
