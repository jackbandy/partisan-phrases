BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, my Iowa offices are located in Cedar  Rapids, Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des Moines, Sioux City, and  Waterloo. My State staff serves as my eyes and ears in communities from  one side of the State to the other. From the Mississippi to the  Missouri Rivers, my staff has their fingers on the pulse of Iowans, and  this pandemic is no exception. They are working tirelessly to  troubleshoot problems Iowans are facing related to the public health  emergency and the economic fallout. No matter the concern, the problem,  or circumstance that is affecting a farm, a business, school, or local  hospital, my staff is on the ground ready to help. 

  In the early weeks of the pandemic, they helped troubleshoot issues  for Iowans who were overseas to get them back home to the United  States. One example: In Peru, several young people were stranded and  wanted to come home. They didn't get them home very fast, but they are  home now. 

  Since Congress passed the CARES Act, my staff has answered countless  questions from Iowans about the Paycheck Protection Program, economic  injury disaster loans, and economic impact payments. Whatever the  question or redtape may be, my staff goes the extra mile to serve  Iowans. They do whatever it takes to track down an answer and help make  government work for the people as the government should work for the  people. 

  As always, they are in the trenches during this pandemic, working to  help Iowans get through this and get through it together.
