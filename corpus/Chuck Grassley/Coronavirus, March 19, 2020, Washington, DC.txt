Coronavirus

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, much has been said on the Senate floor  these past few days regarding our Nation's response to the coronavirus.  But this morning, after our prayer to the Lord and after the pledge to  our Nation's flag, I want to take this opportunity to send Iowans' and  our Nation's parents my commendation because schools are closing, and  as these schools close, the work of a parent or grandparent is more  important than ever. I know many children are scared or don't  understand why they can't play with their friends, and this puts an  extra burden on their parents on top of all of the other challenges  that these families have. 

  Those of you who are parents are raising America's future, and I want  to recognize the importance of what you do every day.
