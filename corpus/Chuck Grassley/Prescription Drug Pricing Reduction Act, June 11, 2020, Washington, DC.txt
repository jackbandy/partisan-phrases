Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. The miracles of scientific innovation have cleared  illnesses that a generation ago delivered a death sentence to many  Americans. Dr. Jonas Salk's polio vaccine in 1953 eradicated the fatal  effects of the virus that killed thousands of children in the first  half of the 20th century. 

  I have every confidence that our scientific community will unlock a  vaccine to stop the coronavirus pandemic. Testing, developing, and  reviewing vaccines take time, but all of that is well underway. 

  However, there is no time to lose for Congress to pass my bipartisan  Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act. We have the responsibility to  ensure that pharmaceutical treatments, therapies, and vaccines are  affordable for all Americans facing this pandemic or any of the future  ones.
