Grassley, Wyden Joint Statement on French Digital Services Tax Hiatus


Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) today released the following joint statement regarding a digital services tax agreement between the U.S. and France.

 

"If reports are accurate, we're pleased that the United States and France have come to an agreement that would postpone a discriminatory tax on American technology companies until the multilateral process is complete. We urge other countries that have proposed digital services taxes to follow suit. The multilateral OECD process offers the greatest potential for long-term success in resolving complex tax issues created by digitalization. We will continue to support that effort," Grassley and Wyden said.
