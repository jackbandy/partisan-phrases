Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the first Sunday in June is National  Cancer Survivors Day. According to the National Cancer Institute, there  are 18.1 million cancer survivors in the United States.

We have made great strides in recent decades to prevent and to battle  cancer. The disease is the second leading cause of death in our  country.

I know how a cancer diagnosis impacts a family, as a result of my  wife Barbara's own diagnosis and victory over breast cancer 38 years  ago. For sure, early detection and access to treatment saved Barbara's  life.

Now, Iowa is a rural State. A majority of our States are rural  States, and every State in the United States has rural areas in it.

Of course, it is difficult to deliver quality healthcare in rural  America, but it is being delivered. To accomplish that, I have  championed policies to keep the delivery of healthcare services  accessible in rural America.

Access to quality healthcare should not be determined by your ZIP  Code. Keeping rural and community clinics open and telehealth services  available is a lifeline for cancer patients.

This day, National Cancer Survivors Day, is dedicated to celebrating  cancer survivors and acknowledging the struggle and strength it took to  overcome the disease.

We stand with you.
