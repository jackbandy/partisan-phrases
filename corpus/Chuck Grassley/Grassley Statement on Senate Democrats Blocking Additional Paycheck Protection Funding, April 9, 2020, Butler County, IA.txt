Grassley Statement on Senate Democrats Blocking Additional Paycheck Protection Funding


Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) issued the following statement after Senate Democrats this morning blocked additional necessary funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, which was established in the CARES Act to help small businesses keep employees on the payroll through the public health crisis. "On the same day that we learn 6.6 million more Americans have filed for unemployment, Senate Democrats decided to block additional funding for a bipartisan program that they agreed to just a few short weeks ago. These funds would have helped small businesses keep people on payroll, providing stability and security for families and workers across the country. "Senate Democrats blocked help for workers. That's not how you govern, especially in a crisis when the health and livelihood of so many Americans are on the line."
