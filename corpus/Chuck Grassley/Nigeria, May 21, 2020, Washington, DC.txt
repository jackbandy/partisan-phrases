Nigeria


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we all ought to be very concerned, as  I am, about the ongoing religious persecution happening in Nigeria. It  may be happening in a lot of countries, but I just want to mention  Nigeria today. 

  In the last 6 months, there have been multiple attacks. This includes  the murder of 11 Christians by extremists identified as part of ISIS,  and--can you believe it--the beheading of a pastor by Boko Haram  militants. West Africa released a barbaric video of a child of about 10  years old executing a Christian. 

  The Nigerian authorities need to stop this persecution right now, and  our own government, the U.S. Government, needs to do what it can to  support that effort. For sure, those responsible must be held  accountable for their actions.
