  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, despite the hardships and headaches  and heartaches that so many families are experiencing right now, there  are countless acts of kindness that show humanitarian goodness taking  place in the entire country, but I notice them across my State of Iowa.  From rainbow art decorating windows to inspirational chalk messages on  sidewalks, Iowans are donating their time, talent, and treasure to  support local businesses, food pantries, and grab-and-go meals for  students. 

  As just one example, the residents of a retirement community are  sewing 35 to 40 masks per day for healthcare professionals and laundry  service workers at the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics. They are  also supplying local food banks and others who need them in their  community. The Iowa City senior threaders are among the countless  silver linings that are lighting America's path to recovery.
