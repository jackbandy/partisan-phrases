  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement is a major achievement for President Trump and a very big  bipartisan win for the American people. We should all take care,  Republican or Democrat, that this is good. I look forward to signing  this bill and sending it to the President's desk.
