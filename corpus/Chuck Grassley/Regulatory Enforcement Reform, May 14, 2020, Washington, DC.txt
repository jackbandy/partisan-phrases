Regulatory Enforcement Reform


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, an important part of my job--and I  hope for every Senator--is hearing the views, in my case, of Iowans but  in the case of my colleagues, the citizens of their States. But it is  not every day that we hear about the executive branch of government and  its bureaucracy making an effort to listen to the American people.  Fortunately, that is changing under this administration. 

  I have advised the people of Iowa, and I am advising them again--and,  hopefully, my colleagues will have their constituents take advantage of  it--that this administration in January, through the White House, put  out a call to Americans who deal with Federal regulations to share  their ideas on how to ensure that those who face regulatory enforcement  have due process and get a fair shake. Those ideas will now be used to  make regulatory enforcement fairer. Take advantage of this opportunity. 

  Americans who face a burden of complying with regulations should have  a voice in making the process better, and I applaud this administration  for listening to the American people.
