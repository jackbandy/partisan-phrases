  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the Trump administration wants the  U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement to enter into force by June 1. I am eager,  as well, for that to happen, but we must first ensure that Canada and  Mexico are complying with their commitments under that agreement. 

  I am especially concerned that the June 1 date presents unique  challenges for the U.S. oil industry, when it is already facing  significant supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19. 

  As we learned in 2009, the health of the auto industry is critical to  the health of the entire American economy. I urge the administration to  take very seriously the concerns expressed by the highest level of the  auto industry to ensure a reasonable timeline for entry into force of  the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement auto regulations.
