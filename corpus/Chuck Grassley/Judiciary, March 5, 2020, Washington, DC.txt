Judiciary


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, an independent judiciary is one of the  cornerstones of our democracy. Judges serve lifetime appointments, free  from political pressure so they can render impartial judgment without  fear of retribution. 

  Yesterday, unfortunately, our country took a step in the wrong  direction with the Democratic leader's comments at a microphone in  front of the Supreme Court. 

  The Democratic leader harangued and warned Justices Gorsuch and  Kavanaugh by name. He said they would ``pay the price'' and ``won't  know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.'' 

  At best, it was an injection of partisan politics into a process that  should be immune to these Justices. At worst, it was a threat,  targeting two sitting members of the Supreme Court. Either way, I  encourage my colleague, the Democratic leader, to apologize to those  Supreme Court Justices and to do it here on the floor.
