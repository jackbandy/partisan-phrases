Letter to President Donald Trump - Grassley Supports Reynolds Request for Federal Disaster Assistance for Iowa


Dear Mr. President: I respectfully ask that you promptly grant the request made by Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds for an expedited review of the major disaster declaration for the State of Iowa as a result of multiple cases of COVID-19 detected in Iowa. On March 17, 2020, Governor Reynolds declared a State of Public Health Emergency and the confirmed cases continue to rise. The Governor determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments, and supplementary federal assistance is necessary to save lives and to protect property, public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a disaster. Thank you for your prompt consideration of this request. Sincerely,
