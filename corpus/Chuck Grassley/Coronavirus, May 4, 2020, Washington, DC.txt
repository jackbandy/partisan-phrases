  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Americans from coast to coast hunkered  down to stop the spread of the virus. Office workers, including my  staff in Washington, adapted to work from home. But not all Americans  can do their jobs from home. Many must work away from home to provide  essential services for our communities. I am talking about workers who  harvest, process, and deliver our food; the crews who provide  sanitation services and keep our communications, transportation, and  energy grids running around the clock; America's postal workers and  truckdrivers who deliver mail and transport goods across the country;  the grocery store clerks and factory workers who make toilet paper,  diapers, and consumer products we can't live without. 

  On behalf of Iowans and the rest of America, I thank the frontline  workers who are on the job, working away from home, in the line of  duty. Thank you all for your service and sacrifice.
