National Ag Day


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, every American is facing a very  uncertain future that the new virus has brought to our country and to  the world. Our daily lives have become transformed for right now and  maybe, to some extent, for a longer period of time. 

  Grocery stores have been open--in fact, one of the few businesses  that need to stay open. While it may shock some living in large cities,  food does not come from grocery stores; food comes from farms. 

  Today, we celebrate National Ag Day. Let me assure you, American  farmers and ranchers are up to the challenge of producing food to fill  the shelves of every grocery store and the fridges and cupboards of our  households. Farmers are only 2 percent of the population, but they will  provide for the other 98 percent. When you eat today, thank a farmer,  as I will thank the 88,000 family farmers in Iowa.
