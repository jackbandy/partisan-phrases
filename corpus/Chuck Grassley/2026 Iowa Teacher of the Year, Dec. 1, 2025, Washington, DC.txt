Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I travel in Iowa throughout the year,  I meet some very special people. Last month, in Sheldon, IA, at the  high school, I had the honor of meeting Stephanie Pritts, who was  recently named Iowa's 2026 ``Teacher of the Year.''

Now, it goes way back to 1958 that Iowa started the ``Teacher of the  Year'' award, honoring an exceptional Iowa teacher each year. There is  very tough competition each year among Iowa's many outstanding  educators to find the one who best represents student learning through  evidence-based instruction, empowering students with multiple pathways  to postsecondary success; the teacher who learns from and invests in  other fellow educators and, at the same time, serves students in  partnership with their families.

The annual program is sponsored by the Iowa Department of Education,  and it is funded by an appropriation of the Iowa Legislature.

Now that she is 2026 ``Teacher of the Year,'' Stephanie will serve as  an ambassador to schools, an ambassador to higher education, and an  ambassador to various communities across the State.

I would like to congratulate Stephanie, again, and thank her for her  service to our State. Iowans can be very proud that teachers like  Stephanie call our State their home.

I visit about 10 to 12 high schools a year to have a Q&A with young  people because they never come to my open town meetings. One of the  surprises that happens at a high school is meeting Iowa's ``Teacher of  the Year.'' This year, that was Stephanie Pritts, and I congratulate  her for a second time.
