National Religious Freedom Day


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today is a very important day that we  recognize once a year--National Religious Freedom Day. It is a day when  we celebrate America's longstanding commitment to religious freedom. 

  The First Amendment to the Constitution protects that right for  Americans. Unfortunately, this fundamental right we have great respect  for in the United States is under attack internationally in many  autocratic countries. 

  Around the world, people are being persecuted for their faith by  authoritarian dictatorships and terrorist groups. Countries like China,  North Korea, and Russia restrict their citizens' rights to practice  their own religion. 

  China, for example, plans to enforce additional restrictions on  religious groups starting February 1. That is already on top of a very  bad record they have for religious freedom. That is in regard to China,  but it would apply to all countries. 

  I have legislation to require the United States to work to block  World Bank projects in wealthy countries like China and Russia that  abuse religious freedoms.
