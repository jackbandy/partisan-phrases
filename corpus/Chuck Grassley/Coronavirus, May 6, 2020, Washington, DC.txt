  Mr. GRASSLEY. COVID-19 has put America through the wringer. There  will be many lessons learned and stories to tell from this chapter of  our history. 

  Today, I salute the heroes working on the frontlines during this  pandemic. I can't overstate the debt of gratitude we owe the healthcare  professionals who selflessly put their own lives on the line to care  for COVID-19 patients. Our doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists,  nursing home workers, pharmacists, and first responders are among those  who have shouldered physical and mental exhaustion to heal the sick. In  fact, today is National Nurses Day. So I give our nurses an extra  applause on this their day. To the legions of healthcare professionals  across America, thank you for the full measure of devotion you have  shown to your community and to our great country.
