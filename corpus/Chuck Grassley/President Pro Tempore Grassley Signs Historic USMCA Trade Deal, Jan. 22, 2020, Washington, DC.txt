President Pro Tempore Grassley Signs Historic USMCA Trade Deal


Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), as President pro tempore of the United States Senate, today led an enrollment ceremony to sign the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Implementation Act. Grassley's signing of the legislation is the final step before it goes to the president for his signature to become law. Grassley was also joined by Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and Martha McSally (R-Ariz.).

 

" After three years, we've seen some success from the President's trade policy and USMCA is the best example of this right now 176,000 jobs as a result of this and what it does for agriculture, getting a lot of our agriculture products into Canada that we would never be able to get in there under NAFTA, and also in regard to helping manufacturing, particularly in the automobile industry. It's very helpful," Grassley said.
