Prescription Drug Costs


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, our colleague Senator Martha McSally,  of Arizona, announced her support yesterday for the bipartisan  Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act. I like to refer to it as the  Grassley-Wyden prescription drug bill, reducing prices. Senator McSally  and I worked together on several parts of the bill. Her Arizonans  should know that Senator McSally's leadership is making all the  difference in moving this bill forward. I thank her for her  cosponsorship. 

  President Trump, Vice President Pence, and nearly a dozen Senate  Republicans have, so far, endorsed this bill. Several other Senate  Republicans will soon announce their support as well. I expect to  introduce an updated version in the coming weeks. 

  I am confident that, if this bill were to be brought up for a vote,  it would pass overwhelmingly. Let's not miss an opportunity then to  deliver real progress for Americans. This always shows up--in other  words, drug pricing legislation--as one of the three, four, or five top  issues of the upcoming election.
