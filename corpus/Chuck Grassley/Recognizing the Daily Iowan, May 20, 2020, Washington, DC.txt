Recognizing the Daily Iowan


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Journalists, as we all know, serve as the watchdog for  accountability, particularly to keep government responsible. These  journalists inform and investigate issues important to their readers,  from human interests to public interests. Right now, a lot of focus is  upon the COVID-19 pandemic. 

  The University of Iowa's independent newspaper, the Daily Iowan, has  been named the ``Best All-Around Daily Student Newspaper'' by the  Society of Professional Journalists. This prestigious honor follows its  recognition as the 2020 ``Newspaper of the Year'' by the Iowa Newspaper  Association. 

  I come to the floor to commend the team of collegiate journalists in  the student-run newsroom at the Daily Iowan. These awards show that the  staff's hard work and commitment to their craft rise above the rest. 

  You are the cream of the crop. Congratulations and keep up the good  work.
