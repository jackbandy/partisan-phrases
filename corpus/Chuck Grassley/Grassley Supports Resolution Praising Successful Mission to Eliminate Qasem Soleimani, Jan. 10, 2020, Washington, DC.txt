Grassley Supports Resolution Praising Successful Mission to Eliminate Qasem Soleimani


U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) joined Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and 41 Senate colleagues in supporting a resolution honoring the members of the military and intelligence community who carried out the successful mission that killed Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) and a designated terrorist. The resolution is modeled on a resolution unanimously supported by the U.S. Senate in 2011, after American forces killed Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. "The U.S. response to Iran's increasing provocations had been too measured, to the point that we risked Iran's leaders mistaking restraint for weakness and encouraging further escalation. I support President Trump's action and am proud to join this resolution honoring our men and women in uniform who led this successful mission," Grassley said.
