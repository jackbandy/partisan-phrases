Letter to Richard Grenell, Acting Director of National Intelligence - Grassley, Johnson to ODNI: Unmask Classified Footnotes in IG Report on Russia Probe


Dear Ambassador Grenell: On January 28, 2020, we sent a classified letter to Attorney General Barr requesting that he declassify four footnotes that we identified after reviewing the Justice Department Inspector General's classified report on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.[1]  In the unclassified cover letter, which we have attached hereto, we explained that this classified information provides insight essential for an accurate evaluation of the entire investigation, and the public interest in the disclosure of the information outweighs the need to protect it. Since sending that letter, we have had very fruitful discussions with the Justice Department.  We very much appreciate Attorney General Barr's focus on transparency and his understanding that this important information ought to be public.  However, there are several sections of the footnotes that certain members of the Intelligence Community are concerned about declassifying.  Accordingly, we are forwarding you our classified letter to Attorney General Barr, and we request that you ensure that all the footnotes are declassified to the fullest extent possible so that the American people have a full understanding of what transpired during the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.  If you have any questions about this request, please contact Joshua Flynn-Brown of Chairman Grassley's staff at (202) 224-4515 or Joseph Folio of Chairman Johnson's staff at (202) 224-4751.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely,
