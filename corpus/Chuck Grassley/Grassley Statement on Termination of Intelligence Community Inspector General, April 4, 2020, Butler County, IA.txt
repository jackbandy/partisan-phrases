Grassley Statement on Termination of Intelligence Community Inspector General


U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) today released the following statement regarding President Trump's termination of Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson: "Inspectors general play a critical role in protecting against fraud, waste, abuse and misconduct, and their work helps ensure the government efficiently serves the people. And they often serve as an outlet to whistleblowers who shine a light to problems in government. They help drain the swamp, so any removal demands an explanation. Congress has been crystal clear that written reasons must be given when IGs are removed for a lack of confidence. More details are needed from the administration. "The intelligence community inspector general is particularly essential to ensuring the nation's secrets are well protected and powerful, highly invasive surveillance authorities are not abused. Going forward the ICIG must step up its focus on investigating those abuses and preventing leaks of classified information."
