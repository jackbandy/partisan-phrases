Prescription Drug Costs


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to bring my colleagues up  to date on a bipartisan bill to lower drug prices and also, at the same  time, give an update on the pharmaceutical industry's opposition to  this legislation. 

  Beware the next time Big Pharma claims what we are trying to do to  lower drug prices, in their words, ``undermines the free market.'' Just  remember this. The pharmaceutical industry supported ObamaCare. 

  Big Pharma doesn't want a free market. Take note that this industry  opposes every proposal that would cost it money and supports every  proposal that ensures another government revenue stream. That is  exactly what ObamaCare did and that is what Medicare and Medicaid do  now. 

  Big Pharma has become so big and entitled that they have the gall to  claim that limiting taxpayer subsidies is somehow socialism. ObamaCare  has a stream that does that, as does Medicare and Medicaid. In fact,  this is what ending corporate welfare and demanding accountability to  taxpayers is all about. It seems to me that ending those subsidies  would be a very conservative principle. 

  The Grassley-Wyden prescription drug bill saves tens of billions of  dollars of taxpayer money and has no negative impact on pharmaceutical  innovation. That is exactly what the CBO has said and that is why even  the free-market, libertarian CATO Institute has endorsed this  legislation. 

  So I encourage my Republican colleagues to join me and Senator Wyden  in that bipartisan effort.
