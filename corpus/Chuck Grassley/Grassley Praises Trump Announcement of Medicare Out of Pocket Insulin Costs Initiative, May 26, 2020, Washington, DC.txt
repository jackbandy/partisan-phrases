Grassley Praises Trump Announcement of Medicare Out of Pocket Insulin Costs Initiative


Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) commended President Trump's announcement of a new Medicare Part D initiative to lower out of pocket insulin expenses for seniors. Grassley issued the following statement today. "Today's announcement of a voluntary model is an encouraging step to lower costs for seniors. The president and CMS should be commended for this effort, and it is encouraging that there is robust participation from drug companies and plans. This announcement also highlights President Trump's continued focus on lowering prescription drug prices for Americans. The Grassley-Wyden bill would provide a permanent legislative fix to the issue that this voluntary program addresses and make other important changes that help control the costs of life-saving insulin."
