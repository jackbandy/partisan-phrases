Grassley Meets with Dubuque Councilperson


Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) today met with Brad Cavanagh, a Dubuque City Councilperson from Ward 4, during his visit to Washington, D.C. for the League of Cities conference. "I was glad to meet Brad in his role as a new councilman and discuss federal priorities for Dubuque, including transportation infrastructure. We had a positive conversation about how Dubuque has used federal funding, including the grant and tax credit projects that are currently underway related to the airport, roads and revitalizing the historic core of Dubuque. I look forward to continuing to partner with the City of Dubuque on projects and policies that will help the community continue to thrive," Grassley said. Grassley and Cavanagh discussed broadband, transportation and other infrastructure priorities. They also discussed the status of multiple projects that have received federal funding through competitive grant programs.
