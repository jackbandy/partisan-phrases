Letter to Charles Rettig,  Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service - Ernst, Grassley Call for Prompt Biodiesel Tax Credit Processing


U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a relentless advocate for Iowa's biofuels producers, and her colleague Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), fought hard to include the biodiesel tax credit in the year-end funding package last year. Now, the two Iowa senators are calling on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to promptly process 2018-2019 biodiesel tax credit claims.

In a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, Ernst and Grassley write: "With our strong support, Congress took action and renewed the tax incentive for five years in order to support this important industry and provide a positive market signal. Timely payment of claims for 2018 and 2019 is necessary for the recovery of the entire biodiesel industry, including producers, blenders and farmers."
