Iowa


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on my annual tour of Iowa's 99 counties,  I visited recently the Boys & Girls Club of Cedar Valley in Waterloo,  IA. This was during our last congressional State work period. I held a  Q and A with the young Iowans who participate in that afterschool  program. We talked about the importance of those programs, advice on  how to be a good citizen, and celebrating African-American History  Month.

I was impressed by the students and appreciated the opportunity to  hear directly from them. So I encourage Iowans to volunteer with this  organization or any civic organization in need of such volunteers.  Giving your time to others helps keep our communities strong. If there  is anything you can do to benefit the next generation, you should do  it.

Besides this example of the Boys & Girls Clubs, I make a practice of  going to about 10 or 12 high schools a year, and there are always a  couple lessons that I am asked about: how to be a good citizen and  ``What advice you would give to us?''

So I try to explain to these young people that the reason I go around  to meet young people at high schools is because they never come to my  open town meetings. You never get anybody under 18 years of age to do  that.

So I like to tell them that I consider representative government a  two-way street: Those of us elected are one half of it, and our  constituents are the other half of it. If you are going to have  representative government, you have to know what is on the  constituents' minds, and the best way to do that is to have dialogue  face to face with your constituents. Obviously, it is not the only way  you get opinions, but it is the best way to get that opinion.

Then they say: Do you have any advice for us?

I say: In America, you have a chance to either govern or be governed.  You have a chance to rule or be ruled. And I hope, as young people, you  choose the course of helping govern.
