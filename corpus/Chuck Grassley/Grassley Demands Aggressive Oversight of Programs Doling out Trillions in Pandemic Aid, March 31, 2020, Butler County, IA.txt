Grassley Demands Aggressive Oversight of Programs Doling out Trillions in Pandemic Aid


U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and President pro tempore, today called for stringent oversight of federal programs administering more than $2 trillion in coronavirus relief -- the largest aid package in U.S. history. "All across our country, people are hurting. Congress acted boldly to deliver the most expansive economic relief package in history to help families, workers and businesses weather the economic storm caused by the pandemic. Now, more than ever, it's critical that we ensure that this money is used as intended. The administration, the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Relief, the Pandemic Relief Accountability Committee and all of us in Congress must keep a watchful eye on these programs to guard against fraud, waste and mismanagement. Taxpayers and those coping with the economic fallout from this pandemic deserve accountability and an investment of this magnitude demands it," Grassley said.
