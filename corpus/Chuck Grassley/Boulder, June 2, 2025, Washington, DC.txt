Boulder, Colorado Attack

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yet again, I am here to draw attention  and to condemn another outrageous attack that was aimed at the Jewish  community here in the United States--specifically, Boulder, CO.

Yesterday, a deranged individual took a homemade flamethrower and  Molotov cocktails to attack individuals marching for the release of  Israeli hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas. This deranged  individual allegedly yelled the words ``free Palestine.'' He yelled  this during the attack.

Reporting suggests that the individual may have overstayed his visa  that the Biden administration gave him and was then in the country  illegally.

This is the third high-profile attack on the Jewish community in the  last 2 months. This sort of hate is completely unacceptable in our  society, and, of course, we all know it needs to stop.

I commend FBI Director Patel for quickly responding and launching a  full investigation into this targeted attack. I trust that the FBI and  law enforcement will do their job and swiftly find justice for these  victims.
