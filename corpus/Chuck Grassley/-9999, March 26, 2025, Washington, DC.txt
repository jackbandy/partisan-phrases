Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last night the Senate passed my  bipartisan resolution to bring attention to a very important issue but  one that isn't discussed often enough: It is the deaths by blood clot.

We call March Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Awareness  Month. So that is a fancy name for blood clots, and last night the  Senate took this action. It took that action because we want to bring  attention to the fact that this health problem affects about 900,000  Americans and contributes to $10 billion in medical costs annually.

While blood clots can be life-threatening, they are preventable and  treatable. Sadly, they are among the leading causes of preventable  hospital deaths. Cancer patients, pregnant women, older Americans, and  patients having surgery all face increased risks of blood clotting.

So I have a constituent who is very active in this movement, and I  have met with him over the last 3 or 4 years that he has led a national  effort to bring attention to the problems of blood clotting.

I am thankful that Des Moines, IA, resident Todd Robertson is working  on this issue and was in my office yesterday to discuss what can be  done, even beyond passing this resolution naming a whole month for this  attention. He has the title of National Blood Clot Alliance patient  liaison.

I want to give thanks to Todd in a big way about his passion because  we are all more aware of the risk of blood clots and the necessary  steps to prevent blood clotting and preserving our Nation's health with  the people that have this problem.

So I would encourage all Americans to visit stoptheclot.org so every  American can understand possible risks with clotting and how you can  prevent that in your own life.
