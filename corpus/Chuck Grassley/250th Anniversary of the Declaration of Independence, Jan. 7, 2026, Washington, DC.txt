250th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence


Mr. GRASSLEY. At the start of this new year, one of the dates is  coming up that we always honor, but this is a special honor of that day  because, on July 4 of this year, the United States of America will  celebrate the 250th anniversary of our Nation's founding.

Throughout our history, Americans from all walks of life have shaped  our story, including, and most importantly, the 56 colonists who signed  the Declaration of Independence. These men--if it were happening today,  there would be women in that group. These men reflected profiles in  courage, pledging their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor  on a piece of parchment paper. As benefactors of their bold commitment  to freedom, we must never take for granted the remarkable risk and  providential promise that they embraced.

Since July 4, 1776, Americans can trace a shared heritage--a heritage  of freedom--to that founding document proclaiming our unalienable  rights and self-evident truths: equality, life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.

The Declaration of Independence launched the American experiment that  continues from one generation to the next. This experiment is unique in  the 6,000-year history of humans.

Earlier this week, the Washington Monument, here on our National  Mall, was illuminated to mark keystones in American history: discovery,  independence, westward expansion, the Industrial Revolution,  innovation, and the future.

Last August, the yearlong Great American State Fair was launched at  the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, IA. On this Fourth of July, fair  exhibits from all 50 States will be featured on the National Mall,  right here in Washington, DC. I encourage Americans of all walks of  life to participate in local celebrations across our beautiful country.

I am grateful to celebrate 250 years of freedom and honor all those  who served in uniform to keep us free for generations yet to come.
