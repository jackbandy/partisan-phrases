Prescription Drug Costs


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Last night, in the State of the Union Address,  President Trump called on Congress to put bipartisan legislation to  lower prescription drug prices on his desk and that he would sign it. 

  Here are the facts. The House is controlled by Democrats. The Senate  requires bipartisanship to get any legislating done. There are only a  couple of months left before the campaign season will likely impede  anything from being accomplished in this Congress. So the time to act  is right now. 

  I am calling on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get off  the sidelines and to work with me and Senator Wyden, as President Trump  already is, to heed the call to action that he gave us last night and  pass the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act. It is the only  significant bipartisan bill in town. President Trump, the AARP, and the  libertarian Cato think tank, to name just a few people involved, have  all endorsed the bill. 

  If you are serious about fulfilling promises to lower drug costs, my  office door is open, as Senator Wyden's door is open. It is time for  the Senate to act and to deliver for the American people.
