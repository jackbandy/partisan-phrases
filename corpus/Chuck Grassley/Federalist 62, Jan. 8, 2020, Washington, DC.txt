Federalist 62


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is a story that we often hear  about in high school and government classes where George Washington is  said to have told Jefferson that the Senate was created to ``cool''  House legislation as a saucer is used to cool hot tea. 

  Whether that is historically accurate or not, it is a good summation  of the role of the U.S. Senate. Now I am going to quote from Federalist  62 what Madison said. He could have made this quote a little easier to  understand, but here it is anyway: ``The necessity of a senate is not  less indicated by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies  to yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be  seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious  resolutions.'' 

  That is the end of Madison's quote, Federalist 62. 

  Now, considering Madison's admonition, it should be no surprise to  anyone whatsoever that the Senate passes fewer bills than the House and  always has. But how come those who parrot the partisan talking points  that the Senate is a legislative graveyard don't also talk about the  over 200 Senate bills on Speaker Pelosi's desk?
