Government Funding

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on Thursday, I sounded the alarm as the  lapse in government funding endangered food assistance for 42 million  Americans and rapidly approached. That was November 1, the approach  date. I called on Senator Schumer to end the partisanship and vote for  a clean extension of government funding.

Forty-five Democrats have opposed a clean extension of funding 13  times. Republicans have voted for it 13 times.

The Trump administration is putting a temporary bandaid on the  program, tapping into emergency funds that will cover half a month of  food stamps.

Meanwhile, I have Iowans calling my office, asking me where they can  get food for their families.

This is a sad commentary on the politics in our Nation--in a nation  of abundance.

I always say you are only nine meals away from a revolution. Just  think, if you are a family, you have children, 3 days without any food,  what action you might take if you can't properly feed them. We have  seen those sorts of revolutions in other countries.

So let's feed the American people with the bipartisan cooperation  they deserve and the bipartisan cooperation that has always been a part  of the Food Stamp Program because, over decades ago, two famous  Senators, Dole and McGovern, in a bipartisan fashion, came up with the  idea that why should we have people that are nutrition deficient in the  United States when the Federal Government has warehouses full of plenty  of food. That is the basis for the Food Stamp Program. We should  continue that bipartisan cooperation.

I hope the Democrats will wake up and give families a permanent  solution to the government programs they rely on.
