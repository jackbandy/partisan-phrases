Grassley Statement on Brexit


Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) today released the following statement regarding the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. "The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom has lasted for centuries and will live on for centuries to come. The United States stands ready to negotiate a trade agreement with the United Kingdom that will further strengthen our alliance and integrate our economies. A comprehensive trade agreement offers great potential for job creation and economic growth in both of our countries. This presents opportunities for British and American farmers, manufacturers, service providers and all workers. "For the past year, I've been meeting with U.K. government officials as well as the U.S. Trade Representative. We're eager to begin negotiations soon after the United Kingdom publishes its negotiating mandate, which is expected shortly. The United Kingdom and the European Union will maintain their current trade relationship during an implementation period through December 31, 2020. During this period, we are legally able to negotiate and complete a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom. However, the agreement could not take effect until after the conclusion of this implementation period."
