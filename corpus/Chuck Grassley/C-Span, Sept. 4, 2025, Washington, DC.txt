C-Span

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow up on a topic  that I discussed with my Senate colleagues. That topic was on June 2,  and it was on the 39th anniversary of C-SPAN covering the Senate. I led  the Senate with Senators Klobuchar, Young, and Wyden in passing a  resolution highlighting the importance of continuous Senate coverage  for all Americans and the need for live coverage of C-SPAN to be  accessible on all platforms.

Yesterday, both Hulu and YouTube announced that YouTube TV and Hulu +  Live TV will be carrying the C-SPAN networks so Americans can watch  Congress's actions in realtime and see our democracy at work through a  nonpartisan lens.

I thank all of these entities for being committed to this public  service.
