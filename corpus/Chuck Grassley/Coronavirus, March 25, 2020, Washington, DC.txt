  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Finance Committee  and the head of the Tax Task Force, I want to highlight a few areas of  the bipartisan economic relief bill we will be voting on today. 

  Recovery checks to give Americans needed cash to provide for their  families and get through our current health crisis look like this:  $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for married couples, and $500 for each  child. There is no minimum, no phase-in. It starts out at the lowest  level. 

  Anyone with a Social Security number who is not a dependent of anyone  else should be eligible for a check under the income caps. 

  We also have very strong unemployment compensation additions to the  present program in this bill. We also have incentives to help charities  because they play a very important role in this recovery. 

  My colleagues across the aisle said last week that the business tax  issues were corporate bailouts. That couldn't be further from the  truth, and I think my Democratic colleagues now agree. This is about  helping our workers keep their jobs. 

  Our economic relief package to recover this economy has provisions to  help businesses so that they have the cash to keep the doors open and  keep making payroll. We all worked hard, along with the administration,  to get this job done. 

  Now it is time to vote on this bill and deliver relief for the  American people and to recover this economy--get the strong economy  back that we had.
