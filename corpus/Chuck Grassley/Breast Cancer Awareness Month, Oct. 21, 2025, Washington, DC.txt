Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, October is Breast Cancer Awareness  month. October is the month that we bring attention to the plight of  those who have had breast cancer and educate others on the importance  of early detection.

My wife Barbara is a 38-year breast cancer survivor. We are fortunate  that her breast cancer was detected very early. We know with certainty  that early detection can dramatically increase a woman's chance of  defeating breast cancer.

A regular mammogram is the best way to find breast cancer early. As  screening and treatment have improved, we have also learned more about  the accuracy of mammogram tests. However, if you have what is called  dense breast tissue, it can make it harder for the radiologist reading  the mammogram to see the breast cancer. So last year, the Food and Drug  Administration started requiring that all mammogram reports sent to  patients must include breast density, which should be described as  either ``not dense'' or ``dense.''

If someone is notified that they have dense breasts, they should talk  to their healthcare provider to discuss the next steps, as an MRI or  ultrasound may be recommended to confirm the mammogram reading.

This new yet simple requirement by the Food and Drug Administration  will better inform patients and help them advocate for themselves.

Early detection was critical for my wife. Today, patients will be  better informed when they do get checked. As my wife often says: Just  keep on getting checked.
