Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is no longer business as usual in  America, so let's end business as usual in Washington. 

  We are experiencing a deadly pandemic. The United States is firing on  all cylinders to fight it and to find a vaccine, but it does us no good  if Americans can't even afford the vaccine or related treatments. Even  before the coronavirus outbreak reached our shores, President Trump  called upon Congress to deliver a bill to his desk that lowered drug  prices for Americans. He mentioned that in his State of the Union  message. The Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act does just that. It  is time for Congress to support the American people.
