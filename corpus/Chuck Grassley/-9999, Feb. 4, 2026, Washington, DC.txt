Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to honor a young Iowan who has  probably had a lifetime of hard work preparing for something that is  coming up very soon in the 2026 Winter Olympics. They begin on Friday  in Italy.

As the Senator from Iowa, I am proud that West Des Moines, IA, native  Zach Stoppelmoor will be representing Team USA. Zach will be competing  in his first Winter Olympics in the 500-meter speed skating  competition.

He first began skating at around 6 years old at a place called Skate  South roller rink in Des Moines. Zach credits his Iowa coaches for  instilling a strong work ethic, and he used that Iowa work ethic to win  the U.S. trials in January. Zach's goal is to win a gold medal.

I look forward to watching Zach and all Americans compete in the  Winter Olympics over the next few weeks, and we should all say: Go Team  USA.
