Iowa


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are in the middle of what is known as  March Madness. I am not talking about budget reconciliation or tax  season; I am here to congratulate and say thank you to our outstanding  student athletes who have competed their hearts out on the court and on  the mat these last few weeks.

First, I want to pay tribute to our Iowa teams who made it into the  NCAA Division I basketball tournament. That includes Iowa State  University women's and men's teams, the University of Iowa women's  team, and the men's team at Drake University in Des Moines.

Division I wrestlers from the Iowa Hawkeyes, Iowa State Cyclones, and  my alma mater, the University of Northern Iowa, competed earlier this  month in Philadelphia.

I want to congratulate two teams from my home State who won their  respective collegiate championships this month. In the NCAA Division  III wrestling national championship, the Knights from Wartburg College  returned from Rhode Island as cochampions and with their 16th national  title--the most in Division III history. The women's basketball team at  Dordt University in Sioux Center returned to the NAIA national  championship held last week in Sioux City, IA. The Dordt Defenders  defended their title and are back-to-back champions.

Sports brings communities together from one generation to the next.  As loyal UNI Panther fans and proud boosters for Dike-New Hartford  athletics, Barbara and I would say that sports are like glue that  sticks, a refreshing antidote in these polarizing times.
