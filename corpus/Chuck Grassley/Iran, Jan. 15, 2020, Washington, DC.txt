Iran


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when President Obama signed the Iran  deal, we were led to believe that this rapprochement with the Iranian  regime would induce Iran to moderate its aggressive foreign policy and  that Iran would likely spend the money made available through that deal  on economic development for the good of its people. Instead, under the  direction of General Soleimani, Iran accelerated its effort at regional  domination, funding terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah in  the Palestinian territories and Lebanon, pro-Iranian militias in Iraq,  the Assad regime in Syria, and the Houthi rebels fomenting civil war in  Yemen. Iran did all of that with money from the Iran agreement. 

  Meanwhile, the suffering Iranian people staged widespread  demonstrations against their government, which were met with a violent  crackdown that killed hundreds. Years of appeasement didn't work, but  it looks like President Trump's deterrence is having positive effect.
