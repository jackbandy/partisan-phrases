Grassley-Backed Emergency Funding Addressing Coronavirus Passes Congress


Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) issued the following statement after both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives approved an emergency supplemental appropriations bill providing funding to combat the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). "There's a lot of uncertainty and a lot still unknown about the coronavirus. But one thing that's very clear is that we can take steps now to combat the crisis. This new funding will help our federal and local government agencies prepare and bolster efforts already underway so we can fight the spread at every level of government. I know President Trump has been ready to sign this bill, and I'm glad Congress could act so quickly in a bipartisan way to get it to his desk."
