Grassley Joins Rare Disease Congressional Caucus


Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) joined the Rare Disease Congressional Caucus, a bipartisan, bicameral group of legislators with the shared goal of addressing policy issues surrounding rare diseases. "I'm glad to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues to give a voice to people battling lesser-known diseases. It's important that we hear their challenges and success stories. Making health care more accessible and affordable has always been one of my top priorities. In my Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act, there are provisions that would specifically help those with rare genetic diseases. I look forward to continue working with my colleagues on this issue," Grassley said. Grassley partnered with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to introduce the bipartisan Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act to lower the price of prescription drugs for all Americans. This legislation makes many reforms to both Medicare and Medicaid and puts patients first. One provision would allow Medicaid to pay for gene therapies for rare diseases through new risk-sharing, value-based agreements, which will increase access to life-saving, miracle treatments for the most vulnerable. Grassley is also the author of the Advancing Care for Exceptional (ACE) Kids Act to improve the delivery of care for children with complex medical needs. The Rare Disease Congressional Caucus was established in 2010 and has more than 120 members from the House and Senate. Throughout each legislative session, they host caucus briefings to discuss pertinent issues relating to rare diseases. More information can be found at https://rareadvocates.org/rarecaucus/.
