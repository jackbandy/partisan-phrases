Mr. GRASSLEY. On June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress passed a  resolution creating what we know today as the United States Army. Since  its establishment 250 years ago, tens of millions of American patriots  have put their lives on the line to protect national security, defend  our allies, and fight tyranny and terror from distant shores.

Today, the Army is comprised of roughly 450,000 Active-Duty  servicemen, 325,000 National Guardsmen, and 176,000 members of the  Reserve, making the U.S. Army the largest branch of the military.

I want to thank our brave men and women in uniform for their  sacrifices to our country. Their dedication and their selflessness have  made our Nation safer, and the first priority of the Federal Government  ought to be our own national security.

Now, we have to think back to President George Washington's first  annual address to Congress, where he said: To be prepared for war is  one of the most effectual means of preserving the peace in the world.

That includes a nonnegotiable tenet of America's national security,  which is ``peace through strength.''

I have said before and I want to reiterate, we must be prepared at  all times to stamp out aggression because weakness is provocative. An  ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and a strong and capable  military is the best way to do that.

In a few short weeks, we will celebrate Independence Day. I encourage  all Americans to recognize and appreciate the freedoms that the Army  has defended for 250 years, and I will continue to defend that in the  future. And I want to thank President Trump for bringing attention to  the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army with the festivities that are going  on this weekend in Washington, DC.
