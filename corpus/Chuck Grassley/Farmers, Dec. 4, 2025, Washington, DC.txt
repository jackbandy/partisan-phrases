Farmers


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is real concern in rural America,  particularly among family farmers. Farmers know that margins matter.  Farmers don't want to see their revenue continue being eaten up by  input suppliers.

So we need to do what we can to ensure that competition in seed and  fertilizer industries is fair and that markets are transparent to our  farmers. That is a very important consideration, at this very time, as  the Trump administration and we Members of Congress look to provide aid  to farmers.

This is a top concern that I hear from many family farmers. My  farmers are concerned that Federal dollars meant to help the farmers  will simply get passed on to seed and fertilizer companies.

That concern brings me to my legislation and bringing it to the  attention of my fellow Senators. Passing the Fertilizer Research Act is  the first step in addressing those concerns. I hope my colleagues on  the Agriculture Committee will join me to provide transparency for  farmers through this very important legislation that I am offering.

So please take a good look, a very hard look, at the Fertilizer  Research Act.
