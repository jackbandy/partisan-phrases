Central Texas Floods

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 32 years ago today, I joined President  Clinton, Governor of Iowa Terry Branstad, and members of the Iowa  congressional delegation to tour catastrophic flood damage in my home  State. The great flood of 1993 ravaged nine States in America's  heartland.

This reminds me of a poster we in the Midwest showed at that  particular time, and I was hoping I could round it up and show it again  to the Senate. But it had a picture of the Great Lakes in the  satellite, and then it had a picture of the flooded areas of the  Midwest. And the blue that shows up where the water is was almost as  blue in the Midwest that was flooded along with the same color of the  Great Lakes.

Flooded tributaries at this time of the 1993 flood overtopped levees,  devastating communities, businesses, and the livelihoods connected to  those businesses. More than 15 million acres of farmland were  underwater. Barge traffic on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers  stopped for 2 long months. A quarter of a million residents in Des  Moines went without running water for 11 days. At least 54,000 people  were evacuated.

The 1993 flood amassed the largest financial loss from flooding in  modern history. The second costliest flood swept the Midwest 15 years  later in 2008.

Of course, the loss of life is the most significant tragedy of any  natural disaster. Fifty precious lives were lost in the 1993 floods.  Iowans know firsthand the anguish and despair caused by natural  disasters. So, on behalf of my home State, we mourn the loss of life in  Texas Hill Country from flash flooding along the Guadalupe River on  July 4 of this year.

As the road to recovery gets underway, Iowans stand with Texans. The  grit and resilience we have in the Midwest runs just as deep in the  State of Texas.
