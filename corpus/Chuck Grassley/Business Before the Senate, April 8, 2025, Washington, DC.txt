Business Before the Senate

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have another point to make, which I  think I have made once or twice before. Remember last December, we got  to December and didn't pass 12 appropriations bills. We didn't pass a  farm bill. We didn't debate the DOD authorization bill. We didn't solve  the high prescription drug prices, and about 65 Senators backed bills  doing that.

So I want to remind my colleagues that there are 14 Fridays between  now and the end of this fiscal year on September 30, and we ought to  think about, do we want another December 2025 without doing 12  appropriations bills, without doing a farm bill, without doing the DOD  authorization bill, without a debate in the Senate, and not doing  anything about high prescription drug prices?

Now is the time to start thinking about whether a 2- or 3-day working  week in the U.S. Senate is enough time to do all this important stuff.
