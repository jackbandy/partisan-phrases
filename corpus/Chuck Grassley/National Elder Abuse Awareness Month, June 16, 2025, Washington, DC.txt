Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I come to the Senate to recognize  June as National Elder Abuse Awareness Month. I am introducing a  resolution with Democratic Senator Blumenthal for this very purpose.  This is a time to shed light on a crisis that too often remains in the  shadows.

Last year, an estimated one in six older Americans experienced some  form of abuse in a community setting, whether physical, emotional,  financial, or neglect. For every elder abuse case that is reported, as  many as 24 go unreported, it is estimated.

These aren't just numbers. They are our parents, our grandparents,  our neighbors, and our veterans. Elder abuse isn't limited by geography  or income. It occurs in nursing homes and private residences, the very  places meant to offer these elderly people care and protection.

With a fast-growing senior population in our country, the urgency to  act has never been greater. This month, we recommit to building a  society that views aging not as a burden but as a source of wisdom,  experience, and continued contribution.

We recommit to raising awareness of elder abuse and implementing  protections for those in our society who protected us first. I urge my  colleagues to join me in honoring older Americans this month.

In the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, I am working to  support Protect Our Seniors. So tomorrow, I am holding a hearing to  examine how scammers are targeting older Americans.

This continues my effort to ensure that seniors are protected from  financial predators and can live with the security and the dignity that  these seniors deserve.
