Government Funding


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Federal Government has a full lapse  in funding and has for 30 days. This is not a new revelation.

I want to alert Senator Schumer to a grave concern I have. On  November 1, 42 million Americans including 131,000 Iowa families will  lose their food stamps. Food stamps cost 9 billion a month to  administer.

I am calling on Senator Schumer to notify 42 million Americans that  due to the Schumer Shutdown, their families won't be able to buy  groceries with food stamps.

Let's wake up to the fact that Washington is an island surrounded by  reality. Iowans in the Real America aren't glued to the TV. Iowans are  living their lives, working hard, raising their families. Their world  doesn't revolve around Congress. But guess what? Senate Democrats are  taking away their food stamps as leverage for unrelated political  demands.

Get the word out, Leader Schumer. Don't let Americans figure this out  at the grocery store this weekend. That is unfair to the American  people. Senate Republicans have voted 13 times to fulling fund  government including food assistance. Fourty-four Senate Democrats have  opposed fully funding government 13 times. Americans are suffering  because Democrats are holding government hostage.

I can't understand why Senate Democrats want Americans to lose access  to their food assistance, law enforcement to go unpaid, and air traffic  controllers to call in sick for work.

I am begging Senator Schumer to return the government to the American  people, as it is their government.
