In Memory of Recent Gun Violence Victims


Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago a heinous and horrific act of  terror took place in the district that I represent in Boulder,  Colorado.

As families gathered on the idyllic Pearl Street Mall, a group of my  constituents, Jewish members of our community, took part in a peaceful  walk and vigil to call for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza as  they have done every week for the past 2 years.

As they gathered, they were viciously targeted, ambushed, and  attacked by a man who attempted to burn them alive with Molotov  cocktails and incendiary devices.

We are praying hard for the 12 victims, several of whom I know  personally. It shocks the conscience that on the eve of the holiday of  Shavuot, our Jewish brothers and sisters were subjected to yet another  brutal, horrific, and anti-Semitic act of violence.

The scourge of anti-Semitism has metastasized across our country, and  we have to do more now to stop this hatred and violence.

We continue to stand with the Jewish community today and always and  will be united in supporting the victims and their families in the  weeks and the months ahead.

Davids).
