Bolts Ditch Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693453/bolts-ditch-act


Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I thank the gentlewoman  from Oregon (Ms. Hoyle), my colleague and the ranking member. I also  thank Chairman Westerman for his support and his team and his staff for  giving us the opportunity here to consider a number of bills that are  bipartisan, common sense, and certainly mean a lot to the folks who I  represent out West.

Mr. Speaker, as you may know, I represent Colorado's Second  Congressional District. It is an incredibly large geographical  district. It is a district that spans across more than 8,000 square  miles. It is larger than eight States on the eastern seaboard and spans  12 counties and over 55 towns.

I have the privilege of representing this incredible district each  and every day back home in Colorado. When you represent a district of  that size and scale, you learn early on how important it is to be  present in your communities to be able to listen directly to  constituents, local leaders, the folks on the ground, about problems  that you can ultimately help to solve.

This bill is a perfect example. It is a bill that has been described  well by the chairman and the ranking member that, in effect, would  ensure that a number of different water authorities--specifically, the  Eagle River Water and Sanitation District and the Upper Eagle Regional  Water Authority--would have access, as the town of Minturn already  does, to the Bolts Ditch structure.

It builds on legislation that we successfully got across the finish  line several years ago. It is common sense. It is bipartisan, and it  means a great deal to the folks that I represent in western Colorado.

I hope that my colleagues can support this measure. I look forward to  doing everything that needs to be done to get it to the President's  desk.
