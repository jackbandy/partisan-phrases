Medical Bills Are Too High

Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative  McClellan for hosting this tonight and for hearing the cries of our  district, what they are suffering and the political anxiety that they  are living in just thinking that healthcare for them and their families  will be stripped from them.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today for a woman named Maria. Maria lives in  Broward County. She is a home health aide who works full time, raising  two children, and still cannot afford health insurance without the tax  credit from the Affordable Care Act.

Because of those credits, Maria can take her blood pressure  medication, and her son can see a specialist for his asthma. These are  not extras. These are basic human survival and dignity matters.

If these credits expire, Maria's premiums will more than double. She  will be forced to choose which child sees a doctor and which child  stays home and waits to get better.

Mr. Speaker, that is not a choice any mother should have to face.  That is not freedom. That is fear.

Maria is not alone. In Florida's 20th District, more than 200,000  people depend on these tax credits, and many are already dealing with  serious gaps in their healthcare.

This is not a policy debate. This is not a question of who we choose  to value. This is a question of dignity for all Americans and their  right to survive.

I am calling on every Member in this House to look beyond party  politics, party games, and trying to get the limelight to actually put  human beings' lives front and center.

The shutdown may be over, but our responsibility to protect the  health and dignity of the American people is not.

If we do not pass the ACA tax credits, we will be guilty of political  malpractice for each person who goes without healthcare and has an  unfortunate demise.

Once again, I stress to every Member in this body to make sure we  retain healthcare and the dignity of all Americans in this country and  their right to have healthcare and survive like anyone else.
