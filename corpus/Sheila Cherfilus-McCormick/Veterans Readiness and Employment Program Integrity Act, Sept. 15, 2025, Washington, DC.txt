Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to co-lead H.R.  3579 the Veterans Readiness and Employment Program Integrity Act  alongside Congressman Ciscomani.

This bipartisan bill expands economic opportunities for our veterans  and brings much-needed transparency for the Veterans Readiness and  Employment Program which helps veterans with service-connected  disabilities transition to civilian careers.

Serving over 125,000 veterans each year, the VR&E program is  critical, especially for veterans in Florida and nationwide, helping  them gain the skills and opportunities needed to build successful and  dignified lives after service.

To ensure veterans receive the support they deserve, the Department  of Veterans Affairs must provide timely and accurate data on program  outcomes. Veterans should not have to endure excessive wait times  before accessing their critical services. This requires the VA to  report on employment rates, wages, and average wait times, guaranteeing  that veterans receive prompt and effective assistance.

These measures will improve program effectiveness and ensure veterans  benefit from high quality and timely support.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  encourage the Senate to act quickly.
