Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the  following proclamation honoring Band CaRiMi.

Whereas, music has long been a unifying force that       transcends borders and generations, preserving culture and       celebrating heritage. Few bands have embodied this mission       more profoundly than CaRiMi, a pioneering group that has       played an instrumental role in shaping and elevating Haitian       music and culture. Through their infectious rhythms, they       have inspired generations and brought people together through       the universal language of music;

Whereas, the band's founding members--Carlo Vieux, Richard       Cave, and Mickael Guirand--left their homeland of Haiti to       pursue education but never abandoned their passion for music.       Their name, ``CaRiMi,'' derived from the first two letters of       their       names, became a symbol of unity, passion, and innovation in       the music industry;

Whereas, their impact quickly transcended borders,       garnering international recognition with Best Album of the       Year in Haiti, topping music charts in Guadeloupe, Paris,       Martinique, French Guiana, Canada, and beyond. Their success       led to a distribution deal with Virgin Records Worldwide,       further cementing their reputation as global ambassadors of       Haitian music;

Whereas, their high-energy performances have left an       indelible mark on audiences worldwide, from the prestigious       Olympia in France to the electrifying spectacle of Haiti's       Carnival, where they performed before 300,000 fans. With       sold-out concerts across multiple continents, CaRiMi has       solidified its place in music history and has helped shape       and modernize Konpa while remaining deeply rooted in its       traditions;

Whereas, as they reunite for their final concert at Amerant       Bank Arena, this momentous occasion is not just a celebration       of their remarkable career, but also a tribute to the unity,       resilience, and cultural vibrancy of the Haitian community.       Their music has uplifted hearts, provided solace, and       reinforced a shared cultural identity among Haitians       worldwide, making this reunion a truly historic and emotional       event; and

Therefore, be it proclaimed that we, the 20th Congressional       District of Florida, do hereby commend CaRiMi for their       dedication to innovation, artistic excellence, and cultural       preservation, and express gratitude for the joy and       inspiration they have provided countless fans worldwide.       Their legacy is a testament to the power of music to unite,       heal, and inspire, and their contributions will be celebrated       for years to come.
