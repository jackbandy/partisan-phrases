We Must Extend Aca Tax Credits

Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Madam Speaker, in just 14 days, hardworking  families, seniors, and veterans across America will face the largest  healthcare insurance premium increase in history, which will make  healthcare unattainable for so many Americans.

When healthcare becomes unattainable, it turns treatable illnesses  into a death sentence. Americans will be forced to figure out their  healthcare. For people with high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart  disease, figuring it out means going without medication that is  lifesaving. This is cruel and simply unacceptable.

Congress has the responsibility to act and finally make healthcare  affordable for all Americans because a single mother in Lauderhill who  is rationing her medication to keep the lights on is counting on us.  The disabled veteran in Riviera Beach who is working two jobs is  counting on us. The recent college grad in Tamarac who makes enough  money only to pay rent is counting on us.

We must deliver and extend the ACA tax credits because America is  counting on us to survive, to thrive, and to have another chance.
