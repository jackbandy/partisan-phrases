Medicaid

Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out  against the Republicans' latest budget proposal, which could deny  American families of the healthcare they need to survive.

In my district alone, more than 149,000 people on Medicaid are now at  risk of losing their healthcare. This includes more than 84,000 kids  and over 21,000 seniors. Medicaid is a lifeline for the most vulnerable  Floridians.

In Palm Beach County, Medicaid has allowed Reverend Latifah Griffin  to care for her 10-year-old son who suffers from pain and has severe  difficulty walking. Her son has cerebral palsy and depends on a  wheelchair and pediatric extended care.

In Alachua County, Medicaid has meant that Virginia, an adult with a  disability, has a home health aide to care for her every single day so  that she won't just survive, but so that she can thrive at home, in her  environment.

These are the people who will suffer the most if these proposals move  forward. I will do whatever it takes to push back and to make sure that  every vulnerable American has the services that they need.
