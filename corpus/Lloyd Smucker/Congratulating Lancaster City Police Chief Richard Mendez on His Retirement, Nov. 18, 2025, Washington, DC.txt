Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize and congratulate  Chief Richard Mendez on his retirement as Chief of the Lancaster City  Bureau of Police Chief, and I thank him for his 25 years of dedicated  service to the Lancaster community.

A native of the City of Lancaster and a graduate of McCaskey High  School, Chief Mendez joined his hometown police department in 2000.  Over the course of his distinguished career, he served as a patrol  officer, K-9 officer, member of the Selective Enforcement Unit, member  of the Lancaster County Special Emergency Response Team, and platoon  leader. Demonstrating an unparalleled work ethic, he rose through the  ranks, and in 2021, was appointed Captain of Patrol, the largest  division of the Lancaster City Bureau of Police.

In July 2022, Chief Mendez was sworn in as Chief of Police, becoming  the first Hispanic police chief in the bureau's history. During his  tenure, the bureau achieved accreditation from the Pennsylvania Chiefs  of Police Association and implemented significant improvements to its  recruitment process. Chief Mendez helped to advance community-focused  initiatives such as the Police Social Worker Program, the Office of  Community Engagement, and expanded bike patrols, all of which  strengthened trust and collaboration between law enforcement and  residents.

Chief Mendez has devoted the past 25 years to keeping Lancaster safe.  I am extremely grateful for the positive impact he has had on the  community. I wish him the best in his well-earned retirement.
