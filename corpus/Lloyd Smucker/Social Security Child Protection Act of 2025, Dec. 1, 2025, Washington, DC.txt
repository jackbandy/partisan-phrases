Social Security Child Protection Act of 2025


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for the opportunity  to bring this up in committee and then for moving it out of committee.  I thank the leader for bringing it to the floor for a vote.

This is about helping kids. I know when we talk about Social  Security, we don't often think about kids. But remember, every child  receives a Social Security number that follows them around for the rest  of their life. Every year, there are kids whose Social Security numbers  are lost or stolen in the mail and exposed to fraudsters.

Because children don't open bank accounts, they don't apply for lines  of credit, and they don't seek employment, it can take them years to  discover that their identity was stolen or to realize the effects of a  stolen identity.

Under current policy, even if the child is aware that the Social  Security number was stolen, a child must become victimized by actual  fraud before the Social Security Administration will give them a new  number.

That is ridiculous. If my bank issued a credit card and I didn't  receive it in the mail, they wouldn't send me another copy of the same  card. They would cancel the old one and send me a new card. Why would  we treat our children any differently? We shouldn't.

That is why, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for the Social  Security Child Protection Act. This bill would simply require that the  Social Security Administration issue a new, different Social Security  number to a child under the age of 14 if the card has been lost or  stolen while being issued to the child in the mail.

Mr. Speaker, it is a simple fix to protect our children and make the  process of interacting with the Social Security Administration easier.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
