Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize and congratulate  Solanco High School students Robert Baxter, Lucas Vilk, and Caleb Reed  on their success in the 2025 Student Drone Challenge.

The Student Drone Challenge is hosted by the Interaction of Ionizing  Radiation with Matter University Research Alliance (IIRM-URA), which is  a collaborative partnership between universities, laboratories, and  industrial companies. Funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency,  the IIRM-URA's primary concern is to mitigate threats against weapons  of mass destruction. The competition is an opportunity for students to  learn and engage in the fields that IIRM-URA supports.

The 2025 challenge involved a virtual drone simulation where students  conducted reconnaissance to identify radiological threats in a building  captured by friendly forces. Pitting over 800 competitors including  those from university, high school, and middle school--the Solanco High  School students took the top spots on the podium. Robert Baxter placed  1st overall, Lucas Vilk placed 2nd for high school students, and Caleb  Reed placed 3rd for high school students.

I am grateful for educational programs that broaden our students'  horizons. I congratulate the winning students, and I look forward to  what their bright futures hold.
