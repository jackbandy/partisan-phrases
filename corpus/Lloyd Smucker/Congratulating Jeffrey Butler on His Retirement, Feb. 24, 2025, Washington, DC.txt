Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate East Donegal  Township Manager Jeffrey Butler on his retirement.

For over four decades, Mr. Butler has dedicated himself to our  communities, both in the private sector and in the public sector. After  graduating from Millersville University, Mr. Butler worked as Manheim  Township's Director of Zoning and Planning, Director of Planning at  Dave Miller/Associates, and Assistant Township Manager in East Donegal  Township. In 2009, he was promoted to Township Manager, where he has  served East Donegal since.

During his tenure as Township Manager, Mr. Butler helped with the  Donegal Region's Comprehensive Plan, which coveted the three  municipalities within Donegal School District. Mr. Butler has also done  much to assist with parks and recreation as well as housing in the  township.

As he transitions into a well-earned retirement, the community thanks  and honors Jeffrey Butler for his dedication to public service.
