Recognizing Mr. Ethan Albright for His Achievement in Local and International Science Fair


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize  Mr. Ethan Albright of Hempfield High School for his achievement of  third place in the `Material Science' category at the 2025 Regeneron  International Science and Engineering Fair, a competition including  1,700 students and representing over 60 countries.

Mr. Albright, a rising senior at Hempfield High School in Lancaster  County, was also the Division Champion at the 2025 North Museum Science  and Engineering Fair. Mr. Albright is the first North Museum Science &  Engineering champion to win an award in international competition since  2017.

In both competitions, his project centered on experimenting with and  designing fully biodegradable fishing lures as an eco-friendly, cost- effective replacement for plastic lures. The worm-shaped lure, made  from a biopolymer recipe, could substitute for traditional soft plastic  lures which can break off hooks and sink to the bottom of waterways.  Mr. Albright cites his early memories of swimming and fishing on the  Susquehanna River with his father as the driving motivation for his  desire to keep our community's waterways clean and plastic-free.

I want to congratulate Mr. Albright on his achievement at the local  and international level, and to recognize the hard work, dedication,  and innovative spirit that went into his project. As a fisherman  myself, I am grateful for Mr. Albright's contributions to solving the  pollution issue. I wish him continued success in his studies and  pursuits.
