Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Rohrer  Seeds, of Smoketown in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, for over a  century in business.

Rohrer Seeds began in 1919 when P.L. Rohrer bought the business he  worked for and introduced a mail-order seed catalog. Four years later,  P.L. Rohrer built the company's retail store and headquarters in  Smoketown, where it remains to this day.

What began as a small seed store has since adapted to the changes in  both the market and in Lancaster County. While the customer base was  once mostly agricultural, Rohrer Seeds shifted and found success in  gardening and lawncare. Today, Rohrer Seeds sells hundreds of different  kinds of seeds, alongside gardening and lawn supplies, to customers and  other businesses. Their original service, the mail order catalogue, is  still released annually and attracts customers from across the region.  Rohrer Seeds continues to be family-owned and is led by P.L. Rohrer's  great-grandson, Doug Rohrer.

Few businesses can say they have lasted a century, and even fewer can  say that they have remained family owned during that time. I  congratulate Rohrer Seeds for their longevity, and I appreciate the  services that they have provided to generations of constituents. I wish  them another century of success.
