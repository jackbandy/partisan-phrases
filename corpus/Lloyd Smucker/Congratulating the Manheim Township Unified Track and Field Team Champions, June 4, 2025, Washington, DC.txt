Congratulating the Manheim Township Unified Track and Field Team Champions


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate the Manheim  Township Unified Track and Field team on their first-place victory at  the PIAA Unified Track and Field championship on May 23 and 24.

The Manheim Township Blue Streaks excelled at the meet, collecting 59  points and earning the gold medal. Malakai Minguez nabbed gold in the  400-meter race with 58.01 seconds. Bronze medals in the 800-meter race,  earned by Cole Richards with a time of 2:23.08, and in the 400-meter  relay helped to spur the Blue Streaks to victory.

Manheim Township's championship in 2025 is their third consecutive  team title since Unified Track and Field's introduction in 2023.

The Unified Track and Field program is organized by the Special  Olympics. Each team has a proportional number of athletes who are  eligible to participate in the Special Olympics and includes boys and  girls from grades 9 to 12.

As Manheim Township celebrates another Unified Track and Field team  championship, I sincerely congratulate the athletes and coaches that  have made this accomplishment possible, and I look forward to seeing  what these students accomplish next.
