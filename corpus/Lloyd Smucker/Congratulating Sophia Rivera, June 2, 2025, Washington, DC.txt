Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate Sophia Rivera  of Ephrata High School on winning gold medals in both girls' shot put  and girls' discus at the 2025 PIAA Class 3A Track and Field  Championship, held on May 23 and 24.

The 2025 PIAA Class 3A track and field championship took place on May  23 and 24,  during which Ephrata junior Sophia Rivera excelled in shot put and  discus. On the first day, Rivera captured the state title in girls'  shot put with a distance of 43 feet, 3 inches. Her domination continued  into girls' discus the following day, where a throw of 143 feet, 3  inches nabbed the gold medal.

Sophia Rivera's two state titles crown a spectacular season and a  complete sweep in the postseason, as Rivera won gold medals in both  events during the Lancaster-Lebanon League championship and the  District Three championship weeks prior.

With two state titles and a total of 6 gold medals during the track  and field postseason, Sophia Rivera has firmly established herself as  one of Pennsylvania's best in shot put and discus. I offer my sincere  congratulations to Sophia on her success this year and look forward to  seeing what she accomplishes next.
