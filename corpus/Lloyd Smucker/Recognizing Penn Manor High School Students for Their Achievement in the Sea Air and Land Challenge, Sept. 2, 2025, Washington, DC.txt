Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize  Mushna Subba, Ben Thomas, and Wyatt Clare from Penn Manor High School  for achieving two first-place finishes in the Sea Air and Land  Challenge (SEAL) at Millersville University.

SEAL is a STEM competition sponsored by the Office of Naval Research.  Millersville University is one of the many schools in the Nation that  host this program, bringing in teams of high school students from  across the region. The competition requires that students design and  build robotic systems to use in challenges mimicking military-inspired  missions.

Entering their drone into two challenges designed by the United  States' finest special operations forces, Ms. Subba, Mr. Thomas, and  Mr. Clare secured two first-place wins. Their hard work as a team and  application of their classroom lessons gartered them their victory.  This achievement marked the second year in a row a Penn Manor High  School team placed in the top two positions.

Mr. Speaker, these brilliant young individuals represent our Nation's  next generation of STEM innovators. They serve as inspirations for  those around them to pursue opportunities in science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics. Their success helps provide recognition  for the important role STEM plays in keeping our country safe. I thank  them for their ambition and drive to participate in such a program. I  wish them all the best in their future endeavors.
