Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate Cocalico High  School's girls' soccer coach, Mr. Dan Hogan, on receiving the 2025 W.  Gene Davis Memorial Award as Class 3A girls Coach of the Year by the  Pennsylvania Soccer Coaches Association (PSCA). I am equally pleased to  recognize his colleague, Mrs. Lynn Parmer, for being named the  Assistant Coach of the Year by the PSCA.

The Cocalico Eagles soared under Hogan and Parmer's leadership.  During their stellar 20-2-3 season, the girls' soccer team won the  Lancaster-Lebanon League section title and advanced to the District  Three 3A championship. Beaten in the finals in the previous two years,  the Eagles defeated their opponents 3-1 for their first District Three  Class 3A title. The Eagles then made it to the PIAA tournament  quarterfinals before falling in overtime to the eventual tournament  champions.

Having served as head coach for the last 26 years, Coach Hogan  developed a history of success that culminated in their historic 2025  run. The PSCA's W. Gene Davis Memorial Award cements his legacy and  marks him as one of the best soccer coaches in the state.

Equally deserving of commendation is Cocalico's Assistant Coach Lynn  Parmer. Her significant role in Cocalico's success merited statewide  recognition as PSCA's Assistant Coach of the Year for 2025. I  congratulate the Cocalico girls' soccer team on their accomplishments  in 2025 and coaches Hogan and Parmer, for their well-deserved  recognition. I wish them continued success both on and off the field.
