Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor and congratulate Mr.  Bill Kepner on his retirement as CEO of United Disabilities Services.

Bill Kepner has a storied history with United Disabilities Services,  a nonprofit that helps disabled individuals, veterans, and seniors live  more independent and fulfilling lives. He first served as a board  member and board president for ten years in two separate stints and  joined the organization as their Chief Operating Officer in 2008.  Following the departure of Gerry Meck, Bill became CEO in 2010 and has  marked his tenure as a vocal advocate for people with disabilities.

Before his position with UDS, Bill was the Chief Operating Officer  for the Inglis Foundation, a Philadelphia housing and community  services organization for disabled individuals, and he was Regional  Vice President for Apria Healthcare and CEO for the Kairos Foundation.  Additionally, he served as president of the Pennsylvania Providers  Coalition Association and developed Non-Profit Management Solutions, a  nonprofit LLC that assists other nonprofits with management services.

As he settles into his new role as Senior Consultant, I thank Bill  Kepner for his invaluable and selfless work at United Disabilities  Services. UDS has transformed the lives of people with disabilities  across Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District and beyond, and I am  proud to represent both their CEO and their foundation in Congress.
