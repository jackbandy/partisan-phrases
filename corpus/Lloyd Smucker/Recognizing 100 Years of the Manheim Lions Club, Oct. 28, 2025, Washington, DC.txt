Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize  the Manheim Lions Club for their 100th anniversary.

Located in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the Manheim Lions Club is  a dedicated community partner, exemplifying the Lions International  motto of ``We Serve'' since their chartering in 1925. The club is  heavily involved in youth activities, sponsoring a 14U baseball team  and the Cub Scouts, and presenting educational awards to local  students. It also runs programs that support vision care, such as an  eyeglasses drive, and engages in a variety of community service and  humanitarian relief efforts.

These efforts are supported through Easter egg hunts, 5K races, broom  sales, and food stands at the Manheim Farm Show. This does not include  past traditions like car shows at the football field and plastic boat  races on the creek. Ultimately, the money raised within the community  is reinvested back into the community.

The Manheim Lions are currently led by Club President Aaron  Henderson. They are one of 49,000 Lions clubs across 200 countries and  regions, and Lions Club International boasts 1.4 million members  worldwide.

As the Manheim Lions Club celebrates 100 years of community service,  I would like to thank the club and its members for their long-standing  record of selflessness. Their efforts have made Pennsylvania's 11th  Congressional District a better place, and I wish them another century  of positive impact.
