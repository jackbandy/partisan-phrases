Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize  Cole McAnany from the Ephrata Area School District for achieving a  perfect score in the prestigious Mathematical Olympiads for Elementary  and Middle Schools.

A middle school student in the 11th Congressional District, Cole's  accomplishment embodies the educational excellence found in Lancaster  County. After competing in the Math Olympiad since he was in 5th grade,  Cole was confident in his ability to score big. His hard work in and  out of the classroom paid off, placing him among an elite group of just  201 students who also achieved a perfect score. He is in the top two  percent of his peers.

Cole represents the high caliber of students in Pennsylvania's 11th  Congressional District. His dedication and remarkable abilities reflect  his willingness to strive for excellence in everything he does. I  congratulate him on this impressive achievement and wish him the best  in his future endeavors.
