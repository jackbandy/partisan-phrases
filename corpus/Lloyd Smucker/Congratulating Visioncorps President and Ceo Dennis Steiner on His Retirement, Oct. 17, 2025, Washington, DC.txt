Congratulating Visioncorps President and Ceo Dennis Steiner on His Retirement


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor and congratulate Mr.  Dennis Steiner on his retirement as President and CEO of VisionCorps.

VisionCorps is a non-profit organization that provides  rehabilitative, preventative, educational, and employment services to  the blind and vision impaired. Mr. Steiner's history with the company  stretches back 41 years when he joined the agency in 1984 as a case  manager. In 2008, he became President and CEO of the agency.

A strong advocate for the blind and visually impaired, Mr. Steiner  shifted the focus of VisionCorps toward independence and autonomy. He  introduced summer youth programming, implemented free rehabilitative  services to clients, and utilized new technology such as smart glasses  and magnifiers. He also oversaw the expansion of VisionCorps from one  facility in Lancaster to rehabilitation and employment sites in Adams,  Chester, Lebanon, and York Counties, as well as in Little Rock,  Arkansas.

Additionally, Mr. Steiner serves as the North America/Caribbean World  Blind Union representative for the National Industries for the Blind.  He is a board member for VisionServe Alliance, the Pennsylvania  Association for the Blind, UniqueSource, and the National Association  for the Employment of People Who Are Blind, the last of which he served  as the president from 2014 to 2016.

Under Mr. Dennis Steiner's leadership, VisionCorps has helped  thousands of individuals lead independent and successful lives.  Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District is grateful for Mr.  Steiner's impact, and I wish him all the best in his well-earned  retirement.
