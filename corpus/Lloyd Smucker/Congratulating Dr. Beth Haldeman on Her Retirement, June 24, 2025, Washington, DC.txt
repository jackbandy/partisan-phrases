Congratulating Dr. Beth Haldeman on Her Retirement


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor and congratulate Dr.  Beth Haldeman on her retirement after 25 years with Cocalico School  District.

Dr. Beth Haldeman's history with Cocalico School District, located in  northern Lancaster County, began in 2000 as the reading specialist and  principal at the former Schoeneck Elementary School. She served in a  similar capacity when she became principal of Denver Elementary in 2002  and then principal at Reamstown Elementary in 2008. In 2019, Dr.  Haldeman joined the district administration as assistant superintendent  for curriculum and instruction. In this crucial and wide-ranging role,  she oversaw state and local assessments, library services, professional  development, special services, and academic supports.

Though she will be greatly missed by the Cocalico School District,  Dr. Haldeman's experience and contributions to education will be  utilized in her new role as the director of professional development  for the Pennsylvania Principals Association, where she will be training  future principals across Pennsylvania.

Dr. Beth Haldeman's contributions to the Cocalico School District  have left a lasting impact on both the school district and  Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District, which has no shortage of  selfless educators.

I thank Dr. Haldeman for her service and wish her all the best in her  new career.
