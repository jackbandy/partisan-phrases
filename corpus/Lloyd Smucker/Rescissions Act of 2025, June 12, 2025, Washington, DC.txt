Rescissions Act of 2025


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692542/rescissions-act-of-2025


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, this bill represents a tiny fraction of the  total we are spending annually. It is a tiny fraction, 0.2 percent,  one-fifth of a percent of what President Biden added to the debt over  the last 4 years. Yet, Democrats are saying that these savings are  cruel. They literally said this will destroy America as we know it. No  one outside of the beltway will take them seriously.

Have my Democratic colleagues even looked at what is in this bill  before attacking? Is it cruel to suggest that American taxpayers  shouldn't have to pay $60,000 to celebrate DEI in the Netherlands or  $30,000 to foster ``queer-feminist discourse'' in Albania?

Is it cruel to cut a program spending $700,000 to expand fruit and  jam sales in Honduras?

By the way, speaking of jam, my last name is Smucker, but even I know  that is a bad deal.

Mr. Speaker, I can tell you what will destroy America as we know it,  and that is this unsustainable debt that we are passing on to our kids  and grandkids. I urge my colleagues to support this rescission package.
