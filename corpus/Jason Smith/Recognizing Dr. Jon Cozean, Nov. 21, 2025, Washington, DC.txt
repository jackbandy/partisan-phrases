Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Dr. Jon Cozean of Farmington, Missouri. Dr. Cozean, a veteran of the  U.S. Marine Corps, died November 11, 2025, at the age of 87.

Jon was a lifelong learner. He started a radio station. He studied  journalism at the University of Missouri, earned a master's degree from  George Washington University and a doctorate in international relations  from the American University. He worked for the New York Times at its  Washington D.C. bureau. It was the sudden death of his father in 1985  that brought Jon back to Farmington to lead the family business. He was  a fourth-generation owner of Cozean Memorial Chapel and was inducted  into the National Funeral Directors Association Hall of Excellence.

He was a man of quiet dignity, sincere kindness, and genuine interest  in people. Jon was a fixture at community events. He invested in his  hometown in a variety of ways from taking photos of the high school  football games to teaching at Mineral Area College to serving as Mr.  Country Days in 2018. Jon was best known for his passion for local  history. He loved to share details about the Farmington community with  audiences who came to appreciate their heritage more because of the way  Jon brought their hometown story to life.

Dr. Jon Cozean is part of the fabric of Farmington. He leaves a  legacy of caring that's exemplified by the many lives he touched. I  join with the Farmington community in mourning his loss but celebrating  his life of service today before the United States House of  Representatives.
