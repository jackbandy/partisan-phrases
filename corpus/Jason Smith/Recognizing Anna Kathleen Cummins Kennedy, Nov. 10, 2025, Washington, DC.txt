Recognizing Anna Kathleen Cummins Kennedy


Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Anna  Kathleen Cummins Kennedy of Poplar Bluff, Missouri, whose life  exemplified service to country, devotion to family, and tireless  commitment to community. Born on January 1, 1925, near Falmouth,  Kentucky, Anna Kathleen was the seventh of ten children on her parents'  farm. When her mother died at age 12, she immediately assumed the  duties of running the household, caring for her younger brothers,  cooking, and keeping the home, all while continuing her education and  graduating from Falmouth High School in 1942. During those formative  years she became an extraordinary cook, an immaculate homemaker, and a  steadfast caretaker to her family.

After contributing to the wartime labor force in Cincinnati, Ohio,  she enlisted in the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service in  early 1945 and trained in New York. She served with the U.S. Navy Nurse  Corps at Naval Air Station Memphis, Tennessee, where she ministered to  service members during the final months of World War II. She was  honorably discharged in January 1946 after devoting service to her  country.

In the closing days of her service, she met Ardell O. Kennedy at the  Memphis Naval Air Station. They married in January 1946 and began their  family in 1947. Ardell and Anna enjoyed 71 amazing years together  welcoming their four children: Karen Delleen, Bonnie Lee, Mark Alan,  and Douglas Ray. They both made education a priority, ensuring each  child completed college and pursued careers in nursing, teaching, and  law.

The Kennedys made Poplar Bluff their permanent home in 1950. For two  decades Kathy raised her children while serving as a devoted wife and  mother and as an active leader in her church and community. She was a  charter member of Fellowship General Baptist Church and served as Den  Mother, PTA member, Vacation Bible School director, Sunday School  teacher, and participant in mission and quilting societies. She devoted  herself to food, clothing, and fund drives and served Eastern Star for  more than 50 years, holding local and state offices.

Once her children were grown, Kathy worked for more than 25 years as  a clerk at livestock auctions across Missouri and Arkansas. She  cherished family gatherings, hosted Sunday dinners, and traveled with  relatives to nearly every state. She was a talented craftswoman whose  creativity touched every part of her life. She enjoyed bowling for both  fun and friendship, and her love of reading kept her mind curious and  engaged. She became grandmother to 10 and great-grandmother to 16,  creating cherished quilts and paintings for each and continuing to  nourish her family with homemade meals as long as she was able.

It is my honor to recognize Anna Kathleen Cummins Kennedy for a life  defined by courage in service, devotion to family, and enduring  generosity to her community. Her legacy of care, craftsmanship, and  commitment stands as a model of the quiet, steady contributions that  strengthen families and towns across our Nation. On behalf of myself,  Congressman Jason Smith and the community she served, I offer profound  appreciation for her remarkable life.
