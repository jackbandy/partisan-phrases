``Executive Branch'' Club

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the latest photo of the  founding of another billionaire private club here in Washington, D.C.,  in Georgetown, for the superrich, spearheaded by Donald Trump, Jr.; JD  Vance; and their billionaire buddies.

Members can join for the low price of half a million dollars. They  offer the richest of the rich a red carpet to buy influence and their  way to power.

Meanwhile, working Americans are being crushed with high interest  rates, 401(k)'s losing value, unaffordable housing, and rising grocery  prices. At a time when reckless U.S.-Canada Trump-era tariffs are  devastating our farmers and manufacturers, when layoffs are funding  cuts and gutting communities, and the Trump elite are toasting  champagne and eating caviar. Really?

This executive branch club isn't just an insult to the working class,  but it is a vivid, grotesque portrait of ruling billionaires focused on  totally enriching themselves and neglecting our Nation. Imagine what a  half million dollars would buy in our communities for children or for  seniors.

This excess reminds me of the disgusting behavior of Emperor Nero,  who rightly has been relegated to the dustbin of history.
