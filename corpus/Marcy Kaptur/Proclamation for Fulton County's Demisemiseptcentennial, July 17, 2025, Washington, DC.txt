Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of representing Ohio's 9th  Congressional District, a region that embodies the industrious spirit,  deep-rooted history, and resilient communities of Northwest Ohio.  Today, I am privileged to join in commemorating an extraordinary  milestone in our shared story--the 175th anniversary of Fulton County.

Whereas, on April 1, 1850, the State of Ohio officially       established Fulton County, carved from portions of Lucas,       Henry, and Williams Counties, as well as territory once       disputed by the State of Michigan; and

Whereas, the county was named in honor of Robert Fulton,       visionary inventor of the steamboat, reflecting the       pioneering innovation and transportation legacy of the       region; and

Whereas, Fulton County was one of the last counties       organized in Ohio, emerging from the resolution of the Toledo       War and the shifting of state lines that helped shape the       boundaries of Northwest Ohio; and

Whereas, from its early seat in Ottokee to its present-day       seat in Wauseon, Fulton County has grown alongside the       railroad, agriculture, and industry--serving as a vital link       in both Ohio's past and its future; and

Whereas, its 406.8 square miles of rich farmland, flowing       rivers, and vibrant towns have been home to generations of       Ohioans committed to hard work, community, and service; and

Whereas, for 175 years, Fulton County has stood as a proud       testament to the enduring values of self-reliance, civic       engagement, and American perseverance;

Now, therefore, I, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, do hereby       recognize and celebrate the Demisemiseptcentennial of Fulton       County, and offer heartfelt congratulations to its residents,       leaders, and communities on this momentous 175th anniversary.

In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand to honor       Fulton County and its distinguished history on this momentous       occasion. May the legacy of Fulton County's past continue to       inspire progress, unity, and pride for the generations to       come.
