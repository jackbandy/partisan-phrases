American People Deserve the Truth


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, release the Epstein files. The American  people deserve the truth. The President promised the release of the  Epstein files, and yet very rich and powerful interests are still  working to bury them.

Who are they protecting? Are they protecting the Washington elite,  the billionaires, the politicians, the establishment class that think  they are above the law? Maybe they are even protecting the President  himself?

We won't know for sure unless and until the President honors his  promise to release the entirety of the files immediately.

No one is above the law, not the rich, not the well connected, not  those who abuse the vulnerable and hide behind their privilege.

The victims deserve justice. Our citizenry deserves transparency. Our  democracy demands accountability. Every day these files remain hidden  is another day the elites laugh at the American people.

I call on the Trump administration and its Department of Justice to  release all the Epstein files unaltered.

I call on each of my colleagues to not shield the powerful. Shine the  light on the truth. That is the least we owe the violated victims and  the very least we owe our Nation: Truth. Release the files.
