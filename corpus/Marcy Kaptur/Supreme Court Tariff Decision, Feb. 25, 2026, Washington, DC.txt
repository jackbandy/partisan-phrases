Supreme Court Tariff Decision

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today and every day on behalf of the  people of northwestern Ohio: farmers, factory workers, small business  owners, nurses, veterans, and retirees. They carry the heavy burden of  President Trump's reckless trade war.

Tariffs hit our region harder than almost anywhere in our country.  Why? We make and grow America.

Our soybean growers saw foreign markets slam shut and prices tumble,  all because the President acted carelessly. Many are still waiting to  be made whole as export markets vanish.

Our manufacturers, from steel processors to auto suppliers, are  writing off huge losses, paying more on parts for materials, squeezing  margins, and laying off workers.

Small retailers, restaurants, and childcare centers face higher costs  they cannot absorb. Every family pays more at the checkout counter, and  tariffs and reckless trade wars raise prices.

The Supreme Court affirmed that our Constitution still matters and  President Trump overstepped his authority. These policies must be  thoughtful, and Americans deserve stable markets and leadership that  fights for our producers and workers.
