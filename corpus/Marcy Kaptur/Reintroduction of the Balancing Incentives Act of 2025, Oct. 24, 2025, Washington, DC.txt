Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reintroduce the ``Balancing  Incentives Act'' of 2025, Bipartisan legislation to restore fairness  and integrity to America's patent system.

Innovation is the beating heart of American progress. From workshops  and factories to classrooms and garages, inventors across our Nation  embody the creativity, determination, and optimism that define the  American spirit. They turn ideas into opportunities and dreams into  progress.

Yet too many inventors face an uneven playing field that makes it  harder to protect their work. The ``Balancing Incentives Act'' ensures  that inventors have a fair chance to defend their creations.

By doing so, we reaffirm that innovation belongs to everyone with an  idea and the determination to bring it to fruition.

With the ``Balancing Incentives Act,'' we stand up for the spirit of  American ingenuity that built our middle class, that powers our  industries and continues to light the way toward a more prosperous and  inventive future.

By standing up for inventors, we stand up for America's future.  Because what America makes and grows, makes and grows America.

I urge my colleagues to join myself and Congressman Thomas Massie in  supporting this vital legislation.
