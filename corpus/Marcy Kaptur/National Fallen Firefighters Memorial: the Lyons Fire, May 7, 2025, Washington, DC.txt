National Fallen Firefighters Memorial: the Lyons Fire


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the members of Ohio's  Lyons-Royalton Fire Department, a pillar of the Lyons community.

Firefighters recently saved the life of a local man while responding  to a fire call. Homeowners Barb and Steve Bates reported a fire that  had sparked in the woods. When the fire crew arrived, they contained  the fire with the help of Mr. Bates, who then, sadly, experienced  cardiac arrest.

Firefighter and EMT Tim Ellithorpe, Fire Chief Devon Kelble, and  Lyons Fire Chief Zachary Miramontes launched into action, performing  lifesaving efforts. They succeeded.

This illustrates how our brave first responders will always answer  the call.

In honor of the bravery of all first responders lost in the line of  duty and recognizing National Fallen Firefighters Memorial weekend, let  us celebrate those who are sworn to serve and to their dedication to  public service to others.

As members of our community who have made great sacrifices, first  responders truly are the backbone of public safety. They are the heroes  and sheroes of our northwest Ohio community.
