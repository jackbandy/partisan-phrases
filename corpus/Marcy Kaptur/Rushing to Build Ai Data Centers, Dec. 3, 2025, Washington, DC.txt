Rushing to Build Ai Data Centers


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697372/rushing-to-build-ai-data-centers


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, citizens nationwide and across our district  are pushing back on AI data centers. They are concerned these  facilities demand massive amounts of energy and water, driving up  rising regional utility costs even more.

How much more will our citizens be forced to pay for power and water?  They have a right to know.

Will our building trades be true partners in economic growth or just  temporary labor, while facing higher utility bills at home?

How many permanent jobs will these largely opaque facilities actually  provide? Exactly which out-of-town interests will get the profits if  these firms succeed?

Residents across our region complain State and local approvals are  moving too quickly. In Ohio, the crooked PUCO and Ohio's Legislature  have granted giant tax breaks to data centers, while local township  officials remain in the dark about details. That is not fair.

Ohioans know what secrecy and inside deals bring. FirstEnergy  scandals led to indictments, prison terms, and even suicides. Ohio  Statehouse corruption rewards big business and harms the public. The  American people deserve to know how AI data centers will affect their  communities. Public hearings must be more robust and factual, not  merely road shows by proponents.
