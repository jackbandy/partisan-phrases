Recognizing Steve Martin of Northwest Ohio


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, there is always good news in America. It is  contained in the hearts of its people.

I rise today in recognition of an extraordinary citizen of northwest  Ohio, Mr. Steve Martin, for his selfless dedication to our community.  Steve creates community.

Since April of last year, Steve has volunteered with I Want to Mow  Your Lawn, a nonprofit providing free lawn care to elderly individuals,  veterans, people with disabilities, and families in need.

Through his hard work and generosity, Steve has completed 30 visits  to care for the homes of Nancy Kinkaid and Bill Orzechowski, two  neighbors facing serious health challenges.

His service not only maintains their yards, he has given them peace  of mind, dignity, and the knowledge that their community cares.

Steve's contributions exemplify the very best of the northwest Ohio  spirit, neighbors helping neighbors and lifting each other up in times  of need. His work reminds us all that small acts of kindness can have a  profound impact.

I am honored to recognize Steve Martin today. Let's thank him for his  unwavering commitment to making our communities a better place for all.
