Resisting the Temptation to Divide

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as I returned home to northwest Ohio this  weekend, I found soul searching among people who I represent following  the tragedies of last week in Colorado and Utah.

Then, in the Point Place neighborhood of Toledo, I saw a church sign  that read:

Love Always Heals. Hate Always Harms. All Welcome Sunday.

These are simple words but profound.

Governor Spencer Cox of Utah observed that social media is a cancer  on our society right now, and he encouraged people to log off, turn  off, touch grass, hug a family member, and go out and do good in their  community, and I couldn't agree more.

Today in Toledo, we did exactly that. We celebrated the completion of  a $13.5 million water project to restore the Delaware, Clark, and  Horseshoe Islands in Walbridge Park on the Maumee River, the largest  river that flows into the Great Lakes.

This restoration means cleaner water, aquatic and wildlife habitats  renewed, and a healthier Lake Erie. As co-chair of the Great Lakes Task  Force, I am profoundly grateful that our citizens united to restore the  heart of our islands along the mighty Maumee by, quite literally,  constructing bridges for the future. Our  community keeps delivering progress, and we all must lift our Nation's  motto up: ``e pluribus unum''; ``out of many, one.''

Not against one another but working together for the future of  America.
