Russian Air Attack on Kyiv

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to speak of a grave act  that took place last week in the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv. The Putin  dictatorship continues its illegal war with a double crime--a double- tap strike attack.

A double tap is a merciless attack when a target is struck, but then  struck again within minutes in an attempt to kill survivors and first  responders. I repeat: A double tap is a war crime.

Sadly, dictator Vladimir Putin's criminality against a free nation is  nothing new, and Ukraine has repeatedly seen double-tap strikes  specifically targeting first responders over the past 4 years, with  over 500 killed.

Yesterday, 3 days after that attack, Sergiy Smolyak, a 56-year-old  responder, was laid to rest. This champion of healing and compassion  served as a medic for 25 years and had relocated to Kyiv when Russia  invaded his hometown in the southern Kherson region nearly 4 years ago.

A nurse who worked with Smolyak said, before his funeral, that he was  very kind, always calm, and even-tempered. He saved so many people.

Mr. Speaker, we must do more to deter illegal Russian aggression,  inspire more healers, or innocent Ukrainians will continue to be laid  to rest in a nation that longs to be free.
