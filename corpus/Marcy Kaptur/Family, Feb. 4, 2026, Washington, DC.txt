Family, Sacrifice, and the Rocket Spirit

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heart full of joy to  celebrate a story that reminds us why sports, family, and community  matter.

At the University of Toledo, sophomore Rocket Miriam Diala was  greeted after a hard-fought win by her mother, Francisca. Her mom had  traveled 4,300 miles from Germany to see her daughter play women's  college basketball at UT in person for the very first time.

Francisca often stays up past midnight to watch Miriam's games on TV  because of the 6-hour time difference. We can just imagine the embrace  in the stands, the tears, the joy, and the gratitude.

Miriam's performance showed talent, discipline, and resilience, but  the real victory was love made visible. This community wrapped an  international student in a sense of belonging, friendship, and a second  family. That is the spirit of Toledo. That is the promise of America.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Francisca for her sacrifice to Miriam and for  inspiring us. To the Rocket family, keep lifting one another higher.
