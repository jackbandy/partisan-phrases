Recognizing National Egg Day

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as Representative of the Ohio region that  produces the most eggs in our Nation, I rise to say happy National Egg  Day: Easter eggs, chocolate eggs, egg yolks, egg whites, egg souffle,  meringue pie, egg salad, and so much more.

Egg prices still cost 25 percent more at the grocery store. The  answer is: Don't ignore the devastating impact of bird flu decimating  flocks across our district and Nation. Meanwhile, the big egg  conglomerates like Cal-Maine are posting record profits, tripling them,  while millions of Americans struggle to afford basic staples. Can't  they pack six eggs per pack to help buyers afford some eggs rather than  no eggs at all?

Our district is home to millions of egg-laying hens and countless  family-run poultry operations. Ohio families and farmers deserve better  than price gouging and political spin.

If we want to protect our food supply and keep our family farms  alive, we must accelerate development of a safe and effective vaccine  and flu remedy as well as coop control and sanitary protocols. Farmers  can't afford to have their flocks wiped out time and again.

On this National Egg Day, I stand with the people who make our  breakfast, not the ones making excuses and delaying scientific  progress.
