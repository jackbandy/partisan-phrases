Request to Name U.S. Vessel After Rear Admiral Duerk


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce bipartisan legislation,  alongside my northwest Ohio colleague, Representative  Bob Latta.

Our purpose is to honor a legendary Ohioan and pioneer of American  military history, Rear Admiral Alene B. Duerk.

Admiral Duerk was the first woman in the United States Navy to  achieve the rank of Rear Admiral. Our legislation would require the  Navy to rename a naval vessel in her honor.

Admiral Duerk was born in Defiance, Ohio, raised in Holgate, and  graduated from the Toledo Hospital School of Nursing in 1941. Over her  long career, she treated wounded servicemembers during World War II and  the Korean war. In 1972, she became the first woman in naval history to  attain flag rank.

In August, I also joined Representative Tim Kennedy in sending a  letter to the Secretary of Defense asking to rename a vessel in her  honor and in September sponsored a separate amendment to this year's  National Defense Authorization Act.

Our added legislation continues our effort to properly honor Rear  Admiral Duerk. I look forward to working with colleagues, on both sides  of the aisle, to ensure Rear Admiral Duerk's legacy of service,  sacrifice, and excellence is properly honored and commemorated by the  people of the United States of America.

Go Navy.
