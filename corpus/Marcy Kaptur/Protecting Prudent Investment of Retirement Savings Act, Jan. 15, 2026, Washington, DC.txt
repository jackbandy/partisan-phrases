Protecting Prudent Investment of Retirement Savings Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699158/protecting-prudent-investment-of-retirement-savings-act


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, this bill unnecessarily restricts the free  market. It dictates what private sector fiduciaries can and cannot  consider when making investment decisions that directly affect the  savings and retirement savings of hardworking Americans.

For this reason and at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill back to committee.

If House rules permitted, I would have offered the motion with an  important amendment to this bill. My amendment would have been the text  of H.R. 1357, the Susan Muffley Act.

Ms. KAPTUR. H.R. 1357 is a bill that addresses a true injustice to  thousands  of workers and retirees across this country, a bill to restore the  Delphi salaried retirees' pensions.

For decades, the men and women who built Delphi--and they worked  hard--were told that if they worked hard and kept their end of the  deal, their retirement benefits would be there for them.

However, that promise was broken through no fault of their own when  Delphi collapsed, leaving more than 23,000 salaried workers, including  over 5,000 in Ohio, with sharply reduced or eliminated pensions. Those  are the folks that I mean. This is simply wrong. It is un-American.

Mr. Turner, Ms. Tenney, Ms. Moore, and I have a bipartisan bill to  restore dignity, fairness, and economic security to people who earned  it the hard way. They worked hard.

For too long, Delphi retirees have been asked to wait, to be patient,  and to accept less than what they were promised and worked for and  earned. Many are now well into their retirement years. It almost seems  like a conspiracy to keep their retirement benefits away from them.  They face rising healthcare costs, higher prices at the grocery store,  and fixed incomes that were unjustly cut.

These are not abstract numbers. These are real people who planned  their lives around commitments and promises that were made to them and  then broken.

Let me remind you that when the auto rescue moved forward, corporate  interests were stabilized, made whole, but working people were left  behind, and that imbalance has lingered for two decades. Shame on us as  a country. Shame on us and the people who allowed that to happen.

The Susan Muffley Act corrects that injustice. It directs the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation to recalculate benefits without arbitrary  gaps that punished Delphi retirees alone. It is a narrowly tailored  fix, but one that delivers profound relief and long-overdue justice.

This legislation is also about reaffirming a core American value: If  you work hard, play by the rules, and keep your word, your company and  country should keep its word to you.

These retirees did not speculate. They did not gamble. They paid into  a system that was supposed to protect them. Congress has a moral  obligation to fix what was broken. Too bad the market can't do it  alone.

Every year of delay compounds the harm. The Susan Muffley Act will  finally make these workers whole. I hope my colleagues will join me in  voting for the motion to recommit.

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
