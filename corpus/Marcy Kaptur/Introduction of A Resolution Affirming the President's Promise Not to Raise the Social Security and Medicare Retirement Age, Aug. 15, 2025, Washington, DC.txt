Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today I introduced a Resolution Affirming  the President's Promise Not to Raise the Social Security and Medicare  Retirement Age.

Social Security and Medicare are solemn promises made to generations  of American workers who have paid into these hard-earned benefits  during their working years.

Yesterday, Social Security celebrated its 90th birthday, and our  resolution demonstrates continued support from Congress for this  program so it can continue to support Americans throughout their  retirement for decades to come.

As more than 11,000 Americans turn 65 each day, many will turn to  these programs to access care and start their retirement. It is our  duty to ensure these programs will be here for them to utilize in their  golden years and not create delays to access these benefits.

Raising the retirement age would reduce benefits for millions of  Americans, placing an unnecessary burden on seniors and those close to  retirement who can't afford to wait to access their earned benefits.

I promise to oppose any changes to the retirement age for these vital  national programs, just as President Trump stated on July 8, 2024. I  agree with President Trump that we mustn't raise the Social Security  and Medicare Retirement Age.

In a time of division, I'm glad to be able to find issues where  people from both parties can agree.

I thank my colleagues who have already joined my resolution, and I  urge all my colleagues to consider supporting this resolution which  demonstrates the House of Representatives dedication to protect  retirement security by not raising the retirement age.
