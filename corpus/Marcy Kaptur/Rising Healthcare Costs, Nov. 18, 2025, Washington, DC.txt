Rising Healthcare Costs

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, in recognition of National Health Month, let  me put some quotes out there from individuals that I represent.

Just in Ohio, we know health insurance will become unaffordable for  tens  of thousands of people across our northwest Ohio district, over half a  million Ohioans, and 15 million Americans.

Please let me share some examples. A constituent from Clyde, Ohio,  said it clearly: High insurance prices will allow people to die by  making healthcare unaffordable. It was terrible before the ACA. We need  affordable health insurance.

Another citizen from Edon in Williams County shared how their  medications had become so costly that they now have to seek out patient  assistance programs. Their prescription insurance has increased by $119  a month, which is unmanageable on a fixed income.

A Toledo resident told me that everything is going up. Groceries cost  more as well as childcare and rent. Unless Congress acts, health  insurance premiums for us will double. Our family cannot make it. We  don't have an extra $100 per month.

Mr. Speaker, I hope you are listening to these pleas because unless  we address the cost of health insurance in this country, too many  people are going to die.
