Medicaid and Snap

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, please let me share the story of two of my  constituents who will be hurt by the cruel bonanza for billionaires  budget bill.

Bonnie is 82 years of age. She is the primary caregiver for her 63- year-old nephew, Michael. He is deaf, neurodivergent, and lives with  multiple chronic health conditions.

For years, Bonnie has been his primary support so he can live  independently, manage complex health needs, and navigate programs like  Medicaid, Medicare, SNAP, and subsidized housing.

Bonnie handles most of Michael's communications with medical  providers as he is unable to due to his ability to communicate by mouth  or by ASL. Michael has relied on Medicaid for hearing aids, surgeries,  dental work, housing, and more. If he loses his coverage, she believes  Michael will become frustrated and either go to jail, self-harm, or  die.

Michael's mother passed away when he was 19. With no other family to  step in, Bonnie worries about what will happen to her nephew after she  is gone. This is just one of many examples of who will be harmed by  unreliable and onerous work requirements.

Mr. Speaker, I think it is absolutely morally wrong that millionaires  and billionaires will be given $4 billion plus $4 trillion.

What is being done for families like this?

Cruelty is not an answer.
