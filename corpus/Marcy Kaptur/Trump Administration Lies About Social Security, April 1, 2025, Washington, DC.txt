Trump Administration Lies About Social Security

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight this  administration's lies to the American people about Social Security.

On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to protect your hard- earned Social Security benefits. However, now he has sent trickster  Elon Musk and his flimflam government agency, DOGE, after the Social  Security database.

Michelle King was the deputy commissioner for operations at the  Social Security Administration for only 28 days before stepping down  because she refused to grant the fraudsters at DOGE access to the  Social Security database and all the sensitive personal data it holds  on everyday Americans. Bravo to Michelle.

The administration got rid of her and replaced her with Leland Dudek,  a man who was already under investigation for sharing highly sensitive  data with the DOGE team.

While courts across our country step in to try to stop DOGE, its  destabilization continues at an alarming rate. I am concerned Elon Musk  wants to privatize Social Security and, through his new computer  company he just bought, is going to try to be paid by the government to  manage those accounts.

DOGE has created serious tech problems, gutted the staff, and  overwhelmed call centers, creating much confusion in their wake.

Americans should pay attention to their Social Security. They earned  these benefits, and nobody else has a right to them.
