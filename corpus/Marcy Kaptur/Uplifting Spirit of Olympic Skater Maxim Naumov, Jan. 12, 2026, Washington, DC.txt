Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to uplift the inspiring and  persevering spirit of our Nation's people, embodied in an extraordinary  young American, U.S. Olympic figure skater Maxim Naumov.

Despite having endured unspeakable loss, the tragic American Airlines  crash over Arlington, Virginia, in January of last year that claimed  the lives of both his parents, Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova,  Maxim stepped onto the ice this past weekend with courage, composure,  and grace under pressure.

At the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, he delivered a powerful  short program for 85.72 points, fourth place, and a spot on the U.S.  Olympic team. He then spoke with humility and love, paying tribute to  his beloved parents who shaped his life.

President John F. Kennedy defined true grit as courage, grace under  pressure, perseverance in the face of adversity. Maxim personifies that  ideal. He teaches us that determination can rise even from the deepest  loss and that discipline and artistry can become a language of hope.

Bravo, Maxim.

Maxim's dedication as a genuine athletic ice artist inspires every  young American to a higher purpose. May he stay the course. He makes  America proud for his generation.

Onward, Maxim. Onward, America.
