A Plea for Small, Family-Owned Farms


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699499/a-plea-for-small-family-owned-farms


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise with an urgent plea for small,  family-owned farms, especially across the American heartland and  communities I represent. Seven of the eight counties I represent in  northwest Ohio are predominantly rural and home to hardworking farmers  who produce the nutritious food that feeds and fuels our Nation. They  deserve our unwavering support because what America makes and grows  makes and grows America.

Yet their work has never been harder. Over the past year, they have  endured setback after setback--including during the driest spells we  have witnessed in more than a decade--due to tariffs, losing markets  all across the world, and we think permanently. The severity of this  physical, as well as tariff, drought runs straight through our  district.

Our farmers need certainty. We need to pass a farm bill. We don't  need recklessly imposed tariffs that break their backs due to lost  export markets and then paying Argentina $40 billion for their beef  when our cattlemen are going out of business.

Something's wrong here. Farmers are hurting. They need leadership  that invests in their success, Mr. Speaker. Don't cut their rural water  infrastructure or weaken the science that our farmers depend upon.
