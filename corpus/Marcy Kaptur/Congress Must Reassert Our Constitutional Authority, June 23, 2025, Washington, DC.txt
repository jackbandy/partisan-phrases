Congress Must Reassert Our Constitutional Authority

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise with grave concern for our Republic  and the long-term safety of our people, our military, and U.S. assets,  both domestically and abroad.

For our Nation's President to launch military force on a foreign  nation without Congressional approval--Article I, Section 8--is a clear  violation of the most important legal document of our country.

History brutally taught our country what asymmetrical warfare is  after enduring 9/11 here at home.

Congress must reassert our constitutional authority before the  American people are dragged into a very endless war by those whose  radical acts of retribution will not cease.

This is a time to pay attention, to study history a little bit, and  to abide by the Constitution of the United States.
