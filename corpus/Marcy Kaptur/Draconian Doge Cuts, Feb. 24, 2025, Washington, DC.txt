Draconian Doge Cuts

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, why is the Trump administration, Mr. Musk,  and their secret meat grinder called DOGE hurting working Americans?

Inflation is going up, unemployment is up, the stock market is  rickety and went down again today, egg prices are up, and Walmart sales  are down.

So far, there is little evidence that DOGE is helping families.  Indeed, they are causing more unemployment. They are not keeping us  safer, and they are not helping anybody.

A young U.S. Department of Agriculture specialist just moved to Ohio  to assist local farmers sell produce locally. That job is gone.

A young farmer with a newborn daughter and a single mother with two  children just back from maternity leave were hired to help citizens  understand how to save money through the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services. They are out in the cold too, and so will the  American people be.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects to be combating the bird  flu which is spreading to cows and now even people, but guess what, Mr.  Speaker? They don't have the vets to do the job. No. They were fired.

A mom who spent her life working in our national parks and is trying  to send her kids to college, does she still have her job? No, she is  looking for work. This doesn't seem like a plan that is really helping  the American people, and all the statistics show it.
