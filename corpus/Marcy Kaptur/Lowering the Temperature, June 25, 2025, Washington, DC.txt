Lowering the Temperature

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, it is time for Americans to lower the  temperature. Political extremism and dangerous divisions among  Americans are causes for serious reflection.

As inexplicable hate is spewed out, my gratitude goes out to law  enforcement in all forms working around the clock to keep our Great  Lakes communities and Nation safe. Yet, rising gun violence, drugs, and  outlandish behaviors, such as cars driving on the turnpike at 90 miles  an hour, remain as fallout from the pandemic. They must be addressed.

The heroic police deputies in Minnesota who addressed a deranged,  extreme perpetrator did their job. We applaud them for their brains and  valor.

Restoring some calm to America is not a Democratic or Republican  challenge. It is an American challenge.

I welcome the suggestion of Sophie and Colin Hortman, children of  slain Minnesota State House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband,  Mark. In their children's words: ``If you would like to honor the  memory of Mark and Melissa, please consider the following: Plant a  tree. Visit a local park and make use of their amenities, especially a  bike trail. Pet a dog. A golden retriever is ideal, but any will do.  Tell your loved ones a cheesy dad joke and laugh about it. Bake  something--bread for Mark or a cake for Melissa--and share it with  someone,'' like your local firefighters. ``Try a new hobby and enjoy  learning something. Stand up for what you believe in, especially if  that thing is justice and peace.''

Mr. Speaker, I hope all listening today take this message to heart.
