Perkins High School Stem Achievement


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, last week I visited Perkins High School in  Sandusky, Ohio. My role: to celebrate excellence in STEM education.

This year, Kia Preston won the Ninth Congressional District App  Challenge for a project titled ``Light Teachings.''

Kia's interactive app helps users understand fundamentals of ray  tracing, a computer graphics technique that simulates how light  interacts with objects to create realistic images in video platforms.

Kia's app will be honored here in our Nation's Capital later this  year.

I also paid tribute to the school's robotics club that has partnered  with NASA. They were the only high school in the United States of  America selected alongside other higher education institutions like  MIT.

Bravo Perkins.

After 4 school years building a satellite named ``Foras Promineo,''  which is Latin for ``outreach,'' it was launched to the International  Space Station back in September.

Thanks to computer science teacher Mike Leffler and Robotics Club  adviser John Stout for lighting the way for these bright, young minds  who are going to lead America into the future and beyond.

Mr. Speaker, I am just so proud of them.
