Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight a bipartisan  resolution introduced alongside my northwest Ohio colleague,  Bob  Latta. It proclaims May 9 to May 18, 2025, as National American Birding  Week.

Each spring, 3.5 billion birds from over 350 species migrate through  the United States to their breeding grounds. They stop along the shores  of our Great Lakes flyway before continuing their journey to Canada and  beyond. They don't have to pay any tariffs.

Birding in our abundant freshwater kingdom draws environmental  stewards from around the globe. Nationwide, 95 million birders generate  over $90 billion annually for our economy.

The biggest week in American birding is sponsored by the Black Swamp  Bird Observatory in Oak Harbor, Ohio. This event leverages public- private partnerships to promote conservation of migratory bird  populations and promote millions of dollars of economic development  through nature tourism, research, education, and outreach.

Ohio is proud to host our guests from near and far. We welcome  everyone during America's Birding Week. Let this continue for  generations to come.
