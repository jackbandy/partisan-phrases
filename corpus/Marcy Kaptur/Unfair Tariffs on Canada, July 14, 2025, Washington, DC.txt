Unfair Tariffs on Canada


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as more Trump administration tariff news  broke, heading into this past weekend, I rise to ask a genuine  question: Why is the Trump administration doing this ying-yang again?

President Trump's latest 35 percent tariff threat against Canada is  pure economic malpractice. It is reckless, rushed, and devastating to  firms and working families across Ohio.

Canada is Ohio's largest trading partner. Over 100,000 jobs in Ohio  depend on trade with Canada. Our State exports $21 billion in goods  annually to our neighbor to the North, our largest fair-trade partner.

From Toledo Jeep and General Motors to the parts manufacturers in  Sandusky, Lorain, and Defiance, these aren't just numbers. These are  paychecks, pensions, and livelihoods.

The last time this administration tried tariff stunts, $6 trillion in  U.S. wealth vanished in days. Workers were laid off, and Ohio is  already among the top 10 States experiencing rising unemployment. We  have all seen Trump chicken out before, and maybe Taco Tuesday will  come again soon.

Mr. Speaker, people in my region want a job they can count on. They  don't want ying-yang on U.S. trade and tariff policy. Let's get back to  normal.
