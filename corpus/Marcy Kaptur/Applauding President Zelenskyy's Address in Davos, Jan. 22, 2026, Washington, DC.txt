Applauding President Zelenskyy's Address in Davos


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699337/applauding-president-zelenskyys-address-in-davos


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, please allow me to begin by applauding  President Zelenskyy of Ukraine on his exceptional and historic remarks  in Davos, Switzerland, earlier today.

I heard an astoundingly unapologetic plea by a new world leader whose  remarks resounded across our globe as he championed the cause of  liberty in our modern era.

Despite his own nation being bordered by tyranny, on almost all  sides, rooted in Russia and all of its repressed client states, he  raised his valiant voice strong and clear before the free world's  leaders.

They all know that today's spider web of tyranny is spinning and  stretching its ugly net from Russia to Brazil, India, North Korea, and  South Africa, seeking a global necklace of repression and domination.

Yet, at Davos today stood the unvanquished, courageous leader of the  poorest and most embattled nation in Europe. On behalf of his valorous  people, he delivered his eloquent plea.

Bravo, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. You singlehandedly challenged  the scions of the global order. Your firm supplication and urgent  request for liberty were extraordinary, rising far above global  niceties.

You delivered the raw choice, as our own Nation's Founders did:  Liberty or tyranny?

Your clear invitation for these leaders to choose forward hangs in  the balance, and your plea is historic, passionate, soulful, inspiring  not just world leaders but people everywhere as they weigh  recalibrating the dial for liberty.

It is your voice that history will remember, rising to energize our  world forward from inside the grim, fierce cauldron of struggle that is  Ukraine.

For any freedom lover to miss your message would be a tragedy, for if  your words, coupled with the ongoing martyrdom of your people, do not  give rise to crescendos of applause and recommitment, then will liberty  cede its worth to dictators, charlatans, plunderers, and fools?

Your call is to bold leadership from a new generation of freedom  lovers. Let us all rise to answer that call. Freedom means never  surrender.

Bravo, Ukraine. Bravo, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. You inspired  freedom lovers across our globe.                            JD Vance Visits Toledo

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, on another front, today, Vice President JD  Vance traveled to Toledo, Ohio. He came to talk about the Trump  administration's so-called record to bring jobs and help grow  manufacturing in our region.

This came as quite a surprise to me. Indeed, his words were empty  because his administration's reckless tariffs and disastrous trade wars  have increased manufacturing job losses not just in our region of Ohio  but across our Nation.

The Wall Street Journal documents that, over the last year,  manufacturing  unemployment has risen in our country by 68,000 more unemployed  workers. You can't Make America Great Again unless you restore American  manufacturing on our home soil.

The Trump administration's reckless tariffs and disastrous trade wars  are straining the pocketbooks of our workers, farmers, and consumers.  Prices keep rising for everything--food, housing, utility bills,  lumber, and cars. This is true across the entirety of our northwest  Ohio region, in both urban and rural communities.

Vice President Vance says he is now interested in lowering drug  prices, but his party consistently voted against those efforts, which  were championed under a prior Democratic administration. I know because  I voted to help cap insulin costs at $35 a month for seniors on  Medicare. I voted for prescription drug negotiations that are saving  seniors thousands of dollars as we speak here tonight.

Unsurprisingly, the Vice President avoided discussing the awful,  unwise decisions by his administration to rip away almost $150 million  from the city that he was in by taking away $45 million from the Libbey  Glass Company to purchase two new glass furnaces that were to compete  against Chinese, Mexican, and French producers. We are known as The  Glass City. He took it away. He didn't bring us anything; he took it  away. The money evaporated. Even though Congress had passed it--it had  all been vetted and everything--they took it away. That hurts a  manufacturing company which is a lodestar company in our community.

Then, his administration canceled--are you ready for this?--$57  million more for another manufacturing company, Owens-Illinois, which  competes globally.

Then, if that wasn't enough, they canceled over $16 million for our  local Kraft Heinz facility in the agricultural sector to compete  against foreign products.

Another $28.5 million was taken away from our region via rescissions  over the summer for major repair work in the heart of our city on Front  and Main Street, on the side of the river that he traveled to. The  streets he rode over should have been repaved, but they took away the  money. He didn't mention them because he helped cancel them.

That is over $146 million that would have helped to invest in new  possibilities to modernize our entire region. Those investments were  critical to American manufacturing, with new-age furnaces and  technology, not only to compete with foreign glass producers but also  to help reduce emissions here at home for the people who work in those  plants and to make work safer for our workers. How would you like to  sit in front of a 98-degree furnace all day long?

Now, the administration has announced plans to eliminate $14.6  million in Ohio from the Ohio Manufacturing Extension Partnership,  which has launched dozens of small and midsized regional food  businesses driven by the creativity of our people. The U.S. Department  of Commerce used to care about those businesses, the small, creative  new launches, like Willy's Fresh Salsa, which just got into Winn-Dixie.  That was invented by a gentleman who came from Toledo. There is also  Gertie's Premium BBQ Sauce. That is a product on our shelves created  through that program to create wealth, opportunities, and jobs.

So many more, dozens and dozens of these companies, have been  created, and jobs. Why destroy something that is working? Can somebody  tell me how else do we sprout and grow our local economies?

I thought when the Vice President said he was coming to Toledo, he  might help announce the $20 million in Department of Transportation  RAISE funds, which had been awarded to improve connectivity in Toledo's  heart, in our Junction neighborhood, in the downtown, in the heart of  our city on both sides of our Grand Maumee River, but that announcement  never came.

If this administration really wants to help Toledo, they better stop  driving backward. Mr. Vice President, can you please bring our check  which the administration owes us?

All of these awards were passed by Congress, authorized,  appropriated, and signed into law. Our community should never be  shortchanged. Our taxpayers send their dollars here. They have a right  to get them back. Our people work too hard for a living. We need to  respect them, and we need to build our communities forward, not  backward.                               Year-round E-15

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I now turn to a very important issue that  arose today because of something that happened with Speaker Johnson.

America's farmers are hurting. They need every bit of help Congress  can deliver. So do truckers and working families paying more for  groceries and at the pump just to haul goods, get to work, and move  around their communities. Prices are going up, not just in America's  heartland, but across our great country.

Republican leadership today had a chance to authorize year-round E15,  a commonsense blend of ethanol and gasoline, but guess what. They  walked away from it again.

Instead, and I can tell you this for the farmers I represent, half  their income comes from raising grains that go into fuels. Without that  market, they wouldn't exist.

This is serious business for agricultural America, and instead,  Speaker Johnson has set up another delay, a council set to report back  within another month on next steps.

Next steps on what? We want to make E15 year-round. That is not too  complicated. That may sound like progress with another task force, but  we don't really need it.

Farmers want E15 year-round. They can't keep punting our farmers up  field. The time to act is now. The solution is within their hands. Why  did they delay?

Let's hope this process the Speaker has now set up for another month  or 6 weeks is not just another fig leaf for more delay. Year-round E15  sales protect our small refineries, too.

Can Congress achieve this so-called compromise? Ohio farmers and  refiners are already hurting. Let's stand up for biofuels and for our  farmers. Surely, the hardworking farmers across all of the counties I  represent would benefit.

What America makes and grows, makes and grows America. Let me just  say to the Speaker, ``please, shake a leg.''                          Honoring Steven D. Fought

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I will move on now to remember someone that  was an extraordinary American.

It is my great privilege, Mr. Speaker, to offer deepest gratitude on  behalf of Ohioans and Americans as we recognize the life of an honored  and indefatigable public servant in the truest sense.

Steven D. Fought was born in Rapid City, South Dakota, on June 2,  1954, and passed recently at 71 years young. He passed from this life  after a truly valiant final fight, on January 10, 2026, in Nebo, North  Carolina, surrounded by his beloved family.

Steve was a precious and trusted friend, a brilliant adviser and  public servant, incorruptible, compassionate, acerbic, and funny all at  the same time, with a twinkle in his eye, you can just see it, and  hearty laugh to tie it all up with a bow.

One colleague described him as the most intelligent, frustrating,  hardest working, disorganized, nicest person they ever had the pleasure  and honor to work with.

Steve Fought truly loved his country and the democratic process. He  was always both an ardent participant and learned scholar of democracy.  He floated in books. Steve was a lifelong student, earning degrees in  literature, history, business administration, and law. He never stopped  learning.

He loved baseball. Do not get in his way when there is a baseball  around and basketball, as well. He was at one time the ``beloved Little  League coach of Celina, Ohio.''

He was always reading, always learning. He could call up any fact. He  conversed with the depth of knowledge which at times was actually  astounding.

Steve Fought began his professional career as a newspaper reporter.  He paid attention to details, and he followed that pursuit with decades  in public service, first with the State of Ohio and then with the  United States Congress.

He served under then-Secretary of State Sherrod Brown in Columbus,  our capital, and would later serve in his office for a decade here in  this House. It  was during that time that alongside myself, Sherrod, and others that  Steve helped lead the consequential fight against NAFTA on this very  floor, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was anything but  free to America's workers and farmers. We all knew the harm it would do  to the region we call home. It was a worthy and passionate fight then.  We were proven to be right many times over since when we go to the  hollowed out cities and towns of our country. I just feel so honored  that he was a part of that great struggle for America's people.

Following his service with Sherrod Brown, Steve would join our office  where he became a trusted adviser, serving as our legislative director  for 5 years and then transitioning to communications director for  nearly a decade.

Even in retirement, he continued in public service at the local level  for the city of Toledo. He even ran for Congress in a long-shot bid to  succeed the retiring Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner.

Though he came up short, Steve believed that everyone deserved a  choice and that no one should receive a rubber-stamped, gerrymandered  seat in Congress without having to work for it.

He always fought the good fight. His favorite music was Aaron  Copland's ``Fanfare for the Common Man.'' Steve loved this land and  worked to preserve its future. This was embodied in legislation he  drafted to add an international designation to the Detroit River and  Ottawa National Wildlife Refuges, which border our dear neighbor to the  north, Canada.

He was an avid proponent for countless species and preserving  unspoiled lands. Steve helped us to cement our region as the home of  the biggest week in American birding, which today attracts birders from  around the globe.

To the last, he was an active participant in the American experiment.  He wrote Op-Eds and organized, kept reading and studying, even through  his final, difficult illnesses.

Steve Fought's life is beautifully summed up by his nephew: ``Steve  was many things to many people and had a knack for somehow being  everywhere all at once. In addition to being a public servant, he was a  deep thinker and conversationalist, a world traveler who visited 41  different countries, a voracious reader and eternal student, a big- hearted hellion, an old hippie who loved rock and roll and bluegrass  music, a Zags basketball fanatic, and a passionate champion for  underdogs everywhere. But most of all, until the very end, Steve was an  outspoken believer in the decency and value of common people, the  collective public good, and the principles of democracy, diversity, and  equality. He was loved deeply by his family, his friends, his  associates from work, and will be severely missed.''

Our Nation expresses deepest gratitude for the selfless service of  Steve Fought, his true friendship, his humanity, and his abiding and  honorable service. We celebrate the difference he made with a lifetime  of intention and of active citizenship for this beautiful land and our  people.

Those who know him can rest assured they will never ever meet his  likes again. May God protect him, bring him peace, and allow his spirit  to soar with the eagles.

Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to enter this into the Record.                      Honoring Robert ``Rex'' Baumgartner

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Robert ``Rex'' Baumgartner,  a true American hero, a man of the law. Rex embodied the very best of  our Nation: honor, respect, bravery, duty, and unwavering courage.

Born in east Toledo, Rex answered the call to serve early, joining  the United States Air Force and serving as an air policeman and sentry  dog handler around the globe. He later dedicated over four decades to  the Toledo Police Department.

His instincts, integrity, and fearless commitment to justice as a  detective made our community safer and stronger. His work earned him  countless honors including induction into the Birmingham Hall of Fame  and the National Law Enforcement Officer Hall of Fame.

Even after retiring, he continued to serve, spending another 15 years  at the Lucas County Prosecutor's Office, focusing on protecting the  elderly from crime. He retired at the young age of 83. He truly made a  difference in a lifetime of extraordinary public service.

Yet, Rex's greatest legacy was the love he poured into his family and  community. He was a mentor, a coach, a storyteller, and a steady hand.  He was always present, always giving, always leading with heart.

For over 30 years, Papa Rex made Halloween camping trips legendary.  From silly costumes to spooky decorations, he poured his heart into  making those weekends memorable. They became traditions that his kids,  grandkids, and now great-grandkids will carry on for years to come.

Beyond all the arrests, titles, and awards, Rex was wise. He told the  best stories, made everyone laugh until they cried, always showed up  when he was needed most, and taught everyone how to live with  integrity, humor, and genuine heart.

With his beloved wife of 62 years, Linda; his children, Debbie,  Patti, Robert, and Julie; 13 grandchildren; 10 great-grandchildren; and  countless other family and friends who loved him dearly, I join to  celebrate a life of purpose and courage well-lived. May his example  forever inspire all those who knew him.

I thank the Speaker for allowing me to enter his life into the  Record.            Celebrating the Life of William ``Bill'' J. Darah, Jr.

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of William  ``Bill'' J. Darah, Jr., of northwest Ohio, a husband, father,  grandfather, and Toledo businessman.

Bill Darah embodied the American Dream through hard work, integrity,  and devotion to family. For more than four decades, this truly good man  helped clothe our police officers, firefighters, workers, building  Superior Uniform Sales with grit, wisdom, and a gift for bringing  people together.

He was so friendly. He was a natural leader, a storyteller, and a man  whose word mattered.

Bill's life was deeply rooted in faith, in heritage, and in routine,  whether it was at St. Elias church, the Monday cousins' lunch he  sustained for 45 years, or cheering for the Yankees, the Rockets, and  the Buckeyes.

Yet, at the center of everything was his family. His pride in his  family was unmistakable. They include his wife, Amira; his daughters,  Natalie and Alyssa; and his grandchildren.

This week, Bill would have celebrated his 76th birthday. Today, we  wish him in memoriam a happy birthday. We honor a life truly well- lived. May his memory be eternal.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to enter his story into the Record.                          Honoring Sydney Boisselle

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight with a heavy heart and deep  gratitude to remember Sydney M. Boisselle, a young woman whose life  proved that impact is not measured in years but in courage, character,  and how we lift others.

Sydney shattered expectations. She became a leader in the  International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 8, a teacher in  the trades, a voice for women, and a standard-bearer for excellence.  She worked hard, spoke honestly, laughed loudly, and made room for  others to grow. She was, as all those who loved her say, pint-sized and  full of spice, unforgettable in every way.

Above all, Sydney loved fiercely: her family; her friends; her dog,  Waylon; and the community she served. In her final act, she gave the  gift of life itself through organ donation, offering hope to families  she would never meet.

We honor the strength of her family who made this courageous decision  with love and grace. Sydney's passing reminds us that even in sorrow,  goodness endures. One life lived fully and generously can change the  lives of many.

Sydney Boisselle was a shero to working people and to so many who  came to know her. May her name be honored forever. I thank the Speaker  for allowing me to enter her story into the Record.                      Honoring the Life of Timothy Haase

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Timothy Haase, a  devoted son, brother, caregiver, and the steady heart of Dino's Family  Restaurant in Maumee. I know Dino defines family not just as his family  but the family he created, as he created  community in Maumee and the surrounding neighborhoods.

For more than two decades, Tim showed up before dawn, fed neighbors  with kindness, and reminded us that dignity lives in every service. His  tragic loss on New Year's Eve has left an empty chair at the counter  and a deeper ache in a community that loved him and that he helped  build, a community of people.

We also honor the family that Dino's created. In a simple diner,  friendships were forged, stories were shared, and strangers became  regulars. A community was brought closer together.

Owner Dean Yakumithis and his team built a place where hard work  mattered. Coffee stayed warm. People felt seen and appreciated. Though  the doors have now closed, the spirit of that table endures in every  single life that Tim touched. There were thousands.

Let us keep Tim's memory alive by caring for one another, watching  out for our neighbors, and cherishing the small places that bind a town  together. Every person is a part of that necklace of life in America.  May his light guide us forward.

On behalf of northwest Ohio, we offer gratitude, prayers, and an  enduring promise to remember.
