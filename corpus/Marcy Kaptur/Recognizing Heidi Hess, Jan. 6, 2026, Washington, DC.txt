Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate what matters in America:  good character in the personhood of a remarkable woman, Heidi Hess,  whose quiet strength has shaped the very heart of emergency care in  northwestern Ohio. I thank Heidi for 36 years.

Heidi stood at the front of the classroom at Owens Community College,  and she prepared over 1,000 men and women to answer the most urgent  calls and tackle those lifesaving moments when every second counts. You  know how hard that is?

Her students become paramedics, EMTs, and lifesavers. They learned to  carry with them her calm, steady voice and deep compassion for  humanity.

Heidi's gift has never been just in teaching technique. It has been  in teaching purpose. She instilled in each student that service is  sacred and that courage and empathy partners in every response. Her  gifts saved thousands of lives and comforted families.

Through wisdom and devotion, Heidi built a living legacy of  protection and care across our region. From all of us in northwestern  Ohio and every life touched by those she trained, thank you to Heidi  Hess. What a great American she is.

I thank her for giving her heart and skills to others for decades. I  wish her joy, good health, and satisfaction in her well-earned  retirement. I and our citizenry are so proud and thankful for you.
