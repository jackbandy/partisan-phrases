Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Boyle for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand against the GOP's billionaire  bonanza. It cashes out precious healthcare dollars and enriches  ultrawealthy billionaires and leaves ordinary Americans to pick up the  tab.

My colleagues across the aisle proposed to add an astounding $14  trillion more to our debt over the next decade.

Why? It is to fund more tax cuts for billionaires.

How? Speaker Johnson cuts hundreds of billions of dollars from  Medicaid, a lifeline for millions of our citizens, including more than  200,000 in the district I represent. Every hospital I represent  sustains itself with Medicaid and Medicare.

This debate isn't just about the numbers on a balance sheet. It is  about the health of the American people. How will we keep our hospitals  open and our nursing homes open? How do we take care of the American  people's health?

This Republican resolution is totally irresponsible. It is an  abdication of our duty to serve all the American people, not just those  at the top.

Mr. Speaker, the top 1 percent of earners in this Nation control more  wealth than the bottom 50 percent. It is time for economic fairness.  Vote ``no'' on this resolution.
