Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, with March Madness coming to a close last  night, it is with joy that I rise to celebrate two exceptional young,  local basketball stars from northwest Ohio: Makhi Leach from Whitmer  High School and Elise Bender from Anthony Wayne High School, who were  named the 2025 All-Blade Basketball Players of the Year.

Makhi Leach is a force to be reckoned with on the court. He dazzled  all of the audience with his skill, determination, and unshakable  leadership. A playmaker in every sense of the word, Makhi not only put  up impressive numbers but also lifted his teammates, making everyone  around him better.

Elise Bender has proven that hard work and passion are unstoppable  forces. A true competitor, Elise has set the standard for what it means  to be an elite student athlete, not just through her impressive  performance, but through her sportsmanship, commitment to her team, and  relentless drive to push beyond her limits.

Both of these young athletes have represented their schools,  families, and communities with honor, and this is only the beginning.  Makhi will play next year for Bowling Green State University, while  Elise will suit up for Villanova. Their talent, determination, and  leadership will take them far. Northwest Ohio will be cheering them on  every single step of the way. They are the future.
