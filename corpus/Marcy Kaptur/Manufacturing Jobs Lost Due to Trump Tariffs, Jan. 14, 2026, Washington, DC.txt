Manufacturing Jobs Lost Due to Trump Tariffs

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the 68,000  manufacturing jobs lost across our country in 2025 as a direct result  of President Trump's reckless tariffs and DOGE cuts.

Why did he visit Detroit yesterday when his insistence on continuing  these tariffs actually cuts investment in American manufacturing? It is  all backward, and it puts America backward and America's workers  backward.

In December, manufacturing jobs continued an 8-month decline that  began after President Trump falsely promised these new tariffs would  lead to an economic resurgence for American workers.

Instead, his broad across-the-board tariffs have driven prices up for  everyday goods and all supply chains. Tariffs create uncertainty in the  job market, leaving hardworking families worse off.

When manufacturing jobs disappear as costs rise, Ohio families feel  it. Lost jobs and rising costs are not an abstract economic theory for  us. They are a harsh reality. Thousands of families I represent have  been touched. Another company just closed in Fulton County.

Mr. Speaker, let's make manufacturing more competitive, not less.  Let's create jobs in the USA.
