Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  proclamation:

I have the honor of representing Ohio's 9th Congressional District, a  region that embodies the industrious spirit, deep-rooted history, and  rich educational traditions of our great state. Today, I am privileged  to join in commemorating an extraordinary milestone in our community-- the 175th anniversary of Defiance College.

Whereas, Defiance College, founded in 1850 as Defiance Female  Seminary, has served as a beacon of higher education for 175 years,  fostering a tradition of academic excellence, service, and leadership;  and

Whereas, the institution has remained steadfast in its commitment to  scholarship, social responsibility, and inclusion, evolving over the  decades to meet the needs of a changing world while preserving its core  values; and

Whereas, Defiance College has played a vital role in the development  of Northwest Ohio and beyond, shaping generations of students into  leaders in their professions and communities, and providing a rigorous  education rooted in the liberal arts and experiential learning; and

Whereas, during the presidency of Kevin McCann, Defiance College  experienced significant growth, expanding its campus, enhancing  academic facilities, and welcoming national figures, including  President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who laid the cornerstone for the  Anthony Wayne Library of American Study in 1953 and returned in 1963 to  deliver a commencement address; and

Whereas, Defiance College remains a distinguished institution  dedicated to the betterment of society, housing the Thoreau Wildlife  Sanctuary, supporting service initiatives, and providing an education  that encourages critical thinking, ethical leadership, and civic  engagement; and

Whereas, the college's commitment to its students, alumni, faculty,  and staff has created a legacy of intellectual curiosity, innovation,  and community engagement that continues to inspire future generations;  and

Whereas, on this occasion of its demisemiseptcentennial, we celebrate  Defiance College's enduring legacy, its significant contributions to  the educational and civic landscape, and its bright future in the years  ahead;

Now, therefore, I, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, proudly recognize and  commend Defiance College on its 175th anniversary. May this milestone  serve as a testament to its remarkable history, its commitment to  academic and community excellence, and the enduring impact it has had  on Northwest Ohio and beyond.

In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand to honor Defiance  College and its distinguished history on this momentous occasion.
