Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696730/continuing-appropriations-and-extensions-act-2026


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member DeLauro for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, Congress should vote today for affordable health  insurance for Americans and reduce its rising costs. Instead, in the  dead of night, eight Senate Republicans slipped into this bill a payola  for themselves, literally raking in millions of dollars to themselves.

This payola is called corruption. It is corruption. Millions of  taxpayer dollars now are slated for Senators Graham, Hagerty, Hawley,  Sullivan, Tuberville, Johnson, Lummis, and Blackburn. Each is teed up  to personally rake in a minimum of $500,000 up to $1.5 million.

Meanwhile, the American people need more affordable health insurance,  but these Senators, with their House allies, are lining their own  pockets. I say: No more tax breaks to billionaires and no payoffs to  U.S. Senators. This is what happens when power serves itself instead of  the people.

This isn't leadership. It is corruption disguised as legislation.

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, let's cleanse America of disgusting  corruption. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
