Moment of Silence for Mary Rose Oakar


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I, along with my Ohio colleagues, rise in  grateful memory of Ohio Congresswoman Mary Rose Oakar, who served from  1977 to 1993 in this House. She was the first Democratic woman elected  to Congress from Ohio.

Mary Rose was elected from the heart of the working class of people.  She exhibited raw courage, loyalty, perseverance, high learning,  precious humor, and stellar insight into human nature. Her hearty  giggle elevated people's spirits, and she suffered no fools. She stood  her ground, and she plowed her own ground, establishing herself as a  preeminent advocate for women's economic rights.

She championed senior citizens and the refinancing of Social Security  in April of 1983, serving on the House Select Committee on Aging, while  also advocating for housing, pay equity, improved healthcare for women,  breast cancer research, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, and  the NASA Glenn Research Center, to name a few. Eventually, she moved  into the ranks of House Democratic leaders where she firmly stood as  vice chair of the Democratic Caucus.

As the first Arab-American woman, the first Syrian-American woman,  and the first Lebanese-American woman to serve in Congress, she  fiercely dedicated herself toward peace in the Middle East.

Mary Rose worked hard to promote an economy that serves everyone  across northern Ohio and throughout our Nation. Her abilities sparkled  as she brought joy, wit, keen insight, kindness, and dynamism to every  occasion. She and her heart of gold were truly one of a kind.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House join me in a moment of silence.

In addition to the eloquent words offered in tribute to our late  colleague, the following statement commemorates the extraordinary  accomplishments of Congresswoman Mary Rose Oakar.

Congresswoman Oakar's career was defined by trailblazing leadership,  moral clarity, and a fierce devotion to those who too often lived in  the margins of public policy. A daughter of Cleveland, she carried the  voices of working families, seniors, women, and immigrants into the  halls of Congress at a time when few women were present to do so.

Among her enduring accomplishments, Congresswoman Oakar:

Championed economic justice through the Pay Equity Act of 1984,  ensuring that the federal government could not undervalue work  performed by women.

Fought for inclusion in medical research, shaping the NIH  Revitalization Act of 1993 so that women and minorities could no longer  be excluded from the clinical studies that guide lifesaving treatments.

Co-founded the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, a bipartisan  forum that remains a cornerstone of women's advocacy in Congress today.

Secured a historic increase in federal breast cancer research  funding, exceeding $400 Million, and mandated insurance coverage for  mammograms--work that continues to save lives.

Advanced protections for America's seniors, authoring legislation to  combat elder abuse and later advising President Bill Clinton at the  White House Conference on Aging.

Beyond her legislative record, Congresswoman Oakar was instrumental  in shaping Cleveland's future--helping bring the Rock and Roll Hall of  Fame to her beloved city, securing affordable housing for seniors, and  championing NASA Glenn Research Center as a hub of innovation.

She also stood as a symbol of representation. Her legacy of courage  and conviction inspired countless women and minorities to enter public  service, knowing that their voices would be heard at the national  table.

Congresswoman Oakar's public service was marked by persistence,  compassion, and vision. She left our country better than she found it,  and her record of achievements continues to touch lives every day. In  remembering her, we not only honor her history, but we recommit  ourselves to the unfinished work of justice and inclusion she so  valiantly advanced.
