Tariffs Are Taxes

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the United States has not had a trade  surplus in over half a century. Trade deficits translate into lost jobs  and lost wealth for the American people. Balancing U.S. trade accounts  is an imperative and a worthy objective, but Trump administration  tariffs on the American people's purchases are taxes that cost them  more money on everything, a lot more: a lot more for food, for gas, for  building materials, for cars, for trucks, for everything.

Today, after the market bled off nearly $10 trillion in lost U.S.  wealth last week, the President adjusted some tariffs, but nothing he  did is reshoring American reinvestment here in our country. Our Nation  imports three-quarters of our fruits and vegetables. We need  agricultural reinvestment here in the good old USA.

NAFTA caused the cataclysmic outsourcing of U.S. manufacturing in  autos and trucks. The President should focus on incentives to reshore  U.S. production, not build more barriers.

Focus on free trade among free people. Help us with our best trade  ally, Canada, especially those of us who live in the north. We believe  in our fair trade partners around the world. Build on success. The  American people need economic growth, not any more tourniquets around  their necks because of tariffs.
