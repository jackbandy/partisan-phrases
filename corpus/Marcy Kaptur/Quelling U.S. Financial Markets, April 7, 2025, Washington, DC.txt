Quelling U.S. Financial Markets

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, needless chaos on U.S. financial markets  must be quelled. Today's continuing historic losses on top of last  week's are unprecedented, totalling over $6 trillion. That is trillion.  This has never happened before. America's enemies are applauding.

Congress needs to act to rein in this chaos. Trump tariffs of this  magnitude equate to new taxes on everything the American people buy or  own. Today, the Dow Jones and Standard & Poor's continued their  nosedive with the worst 3-day performance in nearly a half a century.

These are not just numbers. They represent people losing wealth they  worked for. It is evaporating retirement savings, businesses losing  capital, cars not being sold, and rising unemployment that has started  in industrial and agricultural America.

Our people produce real products for market, and we know what pink  slips are. Too many families are fearing for their financial futures,  with senior citizens unable to meet the rising cost of living,  including for food and medicine.

Mr. Speaker, Congress must pass legislation to support sustained  growth, not destroy wealth. The Trump extreme taxes must be stopped.
