Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Brannon Rains on his  career with the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

A Dundee, Oregon native and 2018 graduate of Oregon State University,  Brannon began his career in the U.S. House of Representatives as an  intern for his home state Congressman, Representative Greg Walden (OR- 02) before joining the House Committee on Energy and Commerce in 2018  as a Staff Assistant for Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers. Since that time,  he has served as a Legislative Clerk, Policy Analyst, and most recently  a Professional Staff Member for the Subcommittee on Commerce,  Manufacturing, and Trade. When I became Chairman in January, Brannon  stayed on as a valuable member of my team as a policy expert in  critical areas such as artificial intelligence, data privacy, and  children's online safety. During his time in the United States House of  Representatives, he has helped develop important pieces of legislation  including the RANSOMWARE Act and the American COMPETE Act. Brannon was  also crucial in planning legislative hearings regarding technology  policies, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Commerce.

Recently, Brannon accepted a role in Senator Todd Young's office as a  Policy Advisor. I thank him for his service, congratulate him on his  new role, and wish him the best.
