Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jake Tyner for his  career in the United States Congress.

A Towson, Maryland native, Jake began his career in Washington, D.C.  in 2016 as Director and Associate Policy Counsel of the Global Energy  Institute for the United States Chamber of Commerce after receiving his  bachelor's degree from Elon University and his Juris Doctorate from the  University of Baltimore School of Law. In 2020, Jake came to the United  States of House of Representatives as Policy Advisor and Counsel to  Congressman David McKinley (WV-01) before becoming General Counsel to  Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska. Through these roles, Jake proved his  expertise in energy and environmental policy. As Chairman of the House  Committee on Energy and Commerce, I was pleased to have him as a member  of my team as Chief Counsel for the Environment Subcommittee to help  develop and implement the committee's legislative agenda.

Recently, Jake accepted a role in President Trump's administration to  serve under Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum, as Deputy Solicitor for  Energy and Mineral Resources. I know Jake will be a valuable asset to  Secretary Burgum, President Trump, and the American people, the same  way he was for me and the members of the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce. I thank him, congratulate him on his new role, and wish him  the best in his future.
