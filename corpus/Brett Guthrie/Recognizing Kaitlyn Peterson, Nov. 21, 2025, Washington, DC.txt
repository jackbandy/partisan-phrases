Recognizing Kaitlyn Peterson


Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kaitlyn Peterson for  her service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

A graduate of the University of Minnesota and native of Massapequa,  Long Island, New York, Kaitlyn began her career in Washington, D.C. as  a Staff Assistant and Deputy Scheduler for former Chairman of the House  Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rep. Fred Upton (MI-06). She later  became his Legislative Correspondent and Special Projects Director  before joining the House Committee on Energy and Commerce as Lead  Legislative Clerk for the Subcommittee on Energy, Climate, and Grid  Security and the Subcommittee on Environment, Manufacturing, and  Critical Minerals under Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers. She then joined  my team and became Policy Analyst for the Subcommittee on Environment  where she led the committee efforts behind H.J. Res. 87, H.J. Res. 88,  and H.J. 89 which were signed into law in June of this year.

After serving the U.S. House of Representatives for nearly four  years, Kaitlyn will depart the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  to take a position with the Senate Committee on Environment and Public  Works, handling a portfolio of energy, fish, and wildlife issues. I  thank her for her service to the committee and wish her well in her new  endeavor.
