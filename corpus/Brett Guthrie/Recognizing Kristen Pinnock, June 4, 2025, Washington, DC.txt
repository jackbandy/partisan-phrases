Recognizing Kristen Pinnock


Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kristen Pinnock for  her service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

A Gales Ferry, Connecticut native, Kristen graduated with a Bachelors  of Arts in Secondary Science and Social Science Education from DePaul  University in 2011. While completing her Masters of Art/Ph.D in  Measurement, Evaluation, and Assessment from the University of  Connecticut, Kristen began her career in Washington, D.C. as a Student  Trainee for the U.S. Government Accountability Office before becoming  an Analyst and Senior Analyst. In March 2023, she joined the House  Committee on Energy and Commerce as a U.S. Government Accountability  Office Detailee for the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations  where she has been a critical team member in leading investigations  into Anti-Semitism in medical schools and hospitals and supported the  Committee's role in the bipartisan AI Task Force report that came out  in the 118th Congress. Kristen was also essential in Committee efforts  in writing letters pertaining to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.  Most recently, Kristen completed another degree graduating with a  Master of Arts in Defense and Strategic Studies from the Naval War  College in 2024.

Kristen's time as detailee with the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce is ending this week and she will return to the U.S. Government  Accountability Office. I know Kristen will continue to be as valuable  of an asset for the U.S. Government Accountability Office as she was  for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. I wish her the best and  thank Kristen Pinnock for her service to the House Committee on Energy  and Commerce.
