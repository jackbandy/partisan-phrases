One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the One Big Beautiful Bill  Act, which includes the work of the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce, to unleash American energy, promote innovation, and protect  healthcare for the most vulnerable Americans.

We claw back wasteful and unnecessary spending. We unleash affordable  and reliable American energy. We support technological innovation by  reauthorizing the spectrum auction authority. We secure Medicaid for  those who need it most. This includes mothers, children, seniors, and  people with disabilities.

Democrats continue to fearmonger and misrepresent what is in this  bill, but let me be clear: House Republicans are eliminating waste,  fraud, and abuse to focus Medicaid on the most vulnerable and not on  able-bodied adults who choose not to work.

We are fighting for commonsense policies to protect America's  children, pregnant women, mothers, individuals with disabilities, and  low-income seniors.

Mr. Speaker, this bill delivers on the promises the President and  congressional Republicans made to the American people, and that is why  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
