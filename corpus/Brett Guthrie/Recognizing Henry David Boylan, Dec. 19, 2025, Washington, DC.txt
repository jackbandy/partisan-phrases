Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the birth of  Henry David Boylan.

Hank was born on November 24, 2025 at Virginia Hospital Center  weighing eight pounds, two ounces to loving parents Ansley and Matt  Boylan. Ansley serves as a valuable member of my team on the House  Committee on Energy and Commerce.

I am grateful to have Ansley as a part of the Energy and Commerce  family, and I am excited for her and Matt to start their family with  their newest addition.
