Recognizing Emily Hale

Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Emily Hale for her  service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

A Louisville, Kentucky native, Emily graduated with a Bachelors of  Arts in Political Science from the University of Kentucky in 2024.  During her time in college, Emily volunteered her time as a Court  Appointed Special Advocate in Lexington and served as an intern in my  Washington, D.C. office. Upon graduation, Emily began her career in  Washington, D.C. and joined my team to serve the constituents of  Kentucky's 2nd District as my Staff Assistant in the summer of 2024,  where she gave phenomenal tours, treated my constituents with kindness,  and navigated the unpredictable 2025 Presidential Inauguration with  grace. After I became Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce, I knew I wanted Emily's optimism and readiness to serve on my  new team. She transitioned to become the Staff Assistant for the Energy  and Commerce Committee in January of this year and was a critical farce  in making sure committee markups and hearings went smoothly, including  a nearly 27 hour long markup to help pass our portion of President  Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill.

Soon, Emily Hale will depart the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce to serve another member of the Kentucky delegation, Dean of  the House Hal Rogers (KY-05), as his Legislative Correspondent--a role  I know she will excel in. I wish her the best in all her bright future  and thank her for service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  and to the constituents of Kentucky's 2nd Congressional District.
