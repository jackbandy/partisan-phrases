Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Christopher Krepich  for his career in the U.S. House of Representatives.

An Altoona, Pennsylvania native, Christopher began his near decade  long career on the Hill a year after graduating from Pepperdine  University in 2014. Christopher has served in many different roles  during his tenure and worked for Representatives Sean Duffy (WI-07),  Keith Rothfus (PA-12), Jim Sessenbrenner (WI-05), and Brad Wenstrup  (OH-02). I came to know Christopher when he began working as a Press  Secretary for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce under Chair  Cathy McMorris Rodgers in 2022, where he served a vital role informing  the public of the work the Subcommittee on Health was fighting for  while I was Subcommittee Chairman. Christopher then went on to become  the Communications Director of the full Committee on Energy and  Commerce. Since becoming Chairman of the full committee, Christopher  has been an expert policy communicator as a dependable and reliable  member of my team serving as Senior Communications Advisor.

Recently, Christopher departed the Committee on Energy and Commerce  to accept a role as the Director of the Office of Communications for  the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services--a role I know he is sure  to succeed in. I wish him the best, congratulate him on his new role,  and thank Christopher Krepich for his near decade long service in the  U.S. House of Representatives.
