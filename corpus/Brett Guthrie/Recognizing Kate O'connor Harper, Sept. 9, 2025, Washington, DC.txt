Recognizing Kate O'connor Harper


Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kate O'Connor Harper  for her service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

A native of Chicago, Illinois and a graduate of the University of  Chicago, Kate began her career as a Staff Assistant for Senator Mark  Kirk (IL) before becoming Legislative Assistant and Correspondent for  Senator Dan Sullivan (AK). In 2018, Kate joined President Trump's  administration serving as Deputy Director of Legislative and  Intergovernmental Affairs for the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration where she proved to be a valuable asset and  became Chief of Staff in 2019. Later that year, Kate returned to  Capitol Hill to become Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee on  Communications and Technology for the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce under Ranking Member Greg Walden. She continued to lead in  this role under Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers and when I became  Chairman, I knew I wanted to have her at the helm of this subcommittee.  Under her leadership, her team passed historic legislation including  the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversaries Act and the  reauthorization of the FCC's spectrum auction authority.

After serving three Chairmen and two Subcommittee Chairmen, Kate will  soon depart Capitol Hill to work in the private sector as a  telecommunications expert. I wish her the best, congratulate her on her  new role, and thank Kate O'Connor Harper for her service to the House  Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States Congress.
