Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have supported the 2026  National Defense Authorization Act. This bill is a generational  investment in our national defense.

House Republicans, alongside President Trump, are investing in our  military-industrial capabilities, securing all servicemembers a well- deserved pay raise, making meaningful strides to secure our southern  border, and so much more.

As a graduate of West Point and the proud Representative of Fort  Knox, I am excited by the commitment this bill makes to Army Reserve  Aviation and the strategic partnerships it creates with local  communities to inspire the next generation of warfighters by preserving  local museums like the Patton Museum.

Make no mistake, this NDAA restores peace through strength, rightly  refocuses our military posture, and puts America first.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting this historic investment in our national defense.
