Recognizing Kaley Stidham


Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kaley Stidham for her  service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

A London, Kentucky native, Kaley began her career as an intern for  her hometown member and Dean of the House Congressman Hal Rogers (KY- 05) followed by an internship with Senate Republican Leader Mitch  McConnell (KY). During her Senior Year at the University of Kentucky,  Kaley became the Staff Assistant for Congressman Andy Barr (KY-06) in  his Lexington, Kentucky office and upon graduation in May 2023  transitioned to his Washington, D.C. office and shortly after took on  the role as Press Assistant as well. When I became Chairman of the  House Committee on Energy and Commerce in January of this year, Kaley  joined my team as the Press Assistant where she became a valuable team  member in keeping the American public updated on what our committee has  been doing to restore the American Dream.

Recently, Kaley departed the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  to take on a new role as the Communications Director for Congresswoman  Kat Cammack (FL-03). While she will no longer be working for a member  of the Kentucky delegation, I know she will succeed in her new role. I  wish her the best, congratulate her on her new role, and thank Kaley  Stidham for her service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
