Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to  honor the lives of Sarah Milgrim and her partner, Yaron Lischinsky, who  were tragically killed in an anti-Semitic attack outside the Capital  Jewish Museum here in D.C.

Sarah grew up in Prairie Village, Kansas, a community that I have the  honor of serving in Congress. She graduated from Shawnee Mission East  High School and the University of Kansas.

She was a devoted member of Congregation B'nai Jehudah and was  dedicated to building understanding and connection between Israel and  the United States. Her partner, Yaron, also shared that commitment.

This hateful and targeted violence is not only heartbreaking, but it  is unacceptable. Anti-Semitism has no place in our country, and yet we  are seeing a deeply disturbing rise in acts of hate.

To Sarah and Yaron, may their memories be a blessing.

To the Jewish community in Kansas, Colorado, and across the Nation,  we want them to know that we are all standing with them. We mourn with  them. We recommit to creating a world where no one fears for their  safety because of who they are. Mr. Speaker, I can tell you that Sarah  was committed to that.

Mr. Speaker, I now ask my colleagues to please rise and join me in a  moment of silence to honor the lives that we have lost.
