Murkowski Welcomes NEPA Modernization Effort


U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, today welcomed President Trump's decision to propose a modernization of federal environmental review and permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1970.

"While I am still reviewing the details of this proposal, antiquated federal regulations often stand in the way of critical infrastructure and other important projects that can create jobs, improve our standard of living and energy security, and yet still fully protect the environment," Murkowski said. "The President and his advisers deserve credit for leading the charge to bring our 1970s-era permitting processes into the 21st century."

The White House's Council on Environmental Quality published its proposal to modernize NEPA regulations in the Federal Register. It is available here. The public can provide comments until March 10, 2020.

In February 2013, then-Ranking Member Murkowski released Energy 20/20: A Vision for America's Energy Future. The blueprint called for "mandatory timelines for completion of the NEPA process" and a broader reform plan "that consolidates, but does not deteriorate, the input of the various federal agencies" involved in the process.

Murkowski is chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
