Sullivan & Murkowski Direct Feds on Flowers: "Buy American!"


U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), and Angus King (I-Maine) yesterday introduced the American Grown Act, legislation requiring all federal agencies to only procure cut flowers and cut greens grown in the United States. Congressman Don Young (R-Alaska) first introduced the legislation in the House in May of 2019.

"Alaska has a burgeoning peony and flower industry that offers world-class blooms during our long, sunny summer growing season, and jobs and opportunities for Alaskans," said Senator Sullivan. "There is no reason for our federal government to devote taxpayer dollars to foreign-grown flowers. We should use the buying power of our government to support hard-working domestic growers. America's events, ceremonies and galas should be decorated with American flowers. My proposal with Senators Murkowski, Feinstein and King would make this commonsense, patriotic concept the law, and I urge all of my Senate colleagues to join us in our effort."

"When it comes to America's flower industry, most do not immediately think of Alaska. But in recent years, our state's peony industry has gained global recognition for growing some of the largest, most vibrant peonies in the world. And just as Alaska's peony growers contribute to our state's economy, American cut-flower growers, nationwide, provide economic opportunities for themselves and the many wholesalers, retailers, and employees who rely on them," said Senator Murkowski. "I am proud to sign on as an original cosponsor of this legislation led in the Senate by Senator Sullivan and first introduced in the House by Congressman Young. I believe the White House and our federal agencies should be proud to bring attention to and support the American flower industry. I am hopeful that this legislation will come to a vote quickly."
