Murkowski Commends "Phase One' Trade Deal with China


U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) released the following statement in support of the U.S.-China Phase One Trade Agreement, which the President signed Wednesday:

"As the major air cargo hub serving Asia, Ted Stevens International Airport puts Alaska right at the center of U.S. and China trade relations. China is our state's top trade partner. In fact, about 60 percent of our seafood--$800 million worth--has been exported there," said Senator Murkowski. "President Trump's phase 1 deal is a significant step to strengthening relations between our countries. As an energy producing state, we will also benefit from the $52 billion of U.S. energy China has agreed to purchase over the next two years. This agreement works to strengthen a market economy, support jobs, drive down costs, and is significant for the Alaska seafood industry. The agreement also demonstrates some movement in opening market access for spruce and hemlock logs, which is important to Alaska's timber industry. I applaud the administration for the progress made towards a comprehensive agreement between the world's two largest economies and for measures taken to hold China accountable."

Yesterday, Senator Murkowski voted in support of H.R. 5430, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (USMCA), a trade pact which modernizes the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The measure passed 89-10 and now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law.
