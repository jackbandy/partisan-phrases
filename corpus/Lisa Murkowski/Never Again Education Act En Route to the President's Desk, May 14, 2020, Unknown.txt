Never Again Education Act En Route to the President's Desk


U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, welcomed the Senate's passage of H.R. 943, the Never Again Education Act, which will help raise awareness of the Holocaust by providing educational resources for teachers and students. 

"The Holocaust is a scourge in world history, when racism and intolerance led to the murder of over 11 million people because of their Jewish heritage, ethnicity, religious or political views, and other differences," Murkowski said. "More than 70 years later, we have seen a resurgence in hate with a global rise in anti-Semitic acts, and too many American youth have little to no knowledge of the Holocaust. This bill will provide important educational and online resources to ensure it never happens again." 

H.R. 943 authorizes the Director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to develop and disseminate educational material about the Holocaust to middle and high school teachers. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council will oversee the program. Federal appropriations may be supplemented by private donations, gifts, bequests, and devises of property.  

The House passed H.R. 943, which is sponsored by Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.-12, and 302 other members of the House, by a vote of 393-5 in January 2020. The Senate version of the bill, which was referred to another committee, was sponsored by Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., and 76 other senators. 

Murkowski, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, helped facilitate the passage of H.R. 943 by discharging the bill from committee and working with her colleagues to pass it by unanimous consent.
