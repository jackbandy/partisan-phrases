Murkowski Votes for War Powers Resolution


U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) issued the following statement after joining her colleagues to pass a bipartisan bill, the Iran War Powers Resolution:

"My vote today was to terminate the use of hostilities against Iran." said Senator Murkowski. "The passage of this resolution in no way restricts the president's ability to defend our troops nor does it place them in greater danger. It clearly establishes the lines and responsibilities of the executive and legislative branches of government. As the resolution indicates, the President's powers, while still substantial, are limited. The Constitution clearly states that the authority to declare war lies with Congress, not the President."

The measure passed 55-45.
