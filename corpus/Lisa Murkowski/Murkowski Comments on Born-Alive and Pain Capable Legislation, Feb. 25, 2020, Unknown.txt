Murkowski Comments on Born-Alive and Pain Capable Legislation


U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today made the following statement after voting in favor of S. 311, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which ensures legal protections for babies born alive following the failure of an attempted abortion:

"This legislation addresses complex and sensitive issues of a medical and ethical nature that deserve serious consideration. My vote today was centered on my support of protections for infants born alive. We often talk about access to care--so ensuring a baby born alive has the same protections and opportunities for care as other babies born of the same gestational age, regardless of where they are born, only makes sense."

Today, the U.S. Senate also voted on S. 3275, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Having voted against identical legislation in the 115th Congress, Senator Murkowski made the following statement, emphasizing the need for a broader scope of limitations within the bill: 

"While I support a woman's right to make her own reproductive choices, that support is not without limits. I oppose late-term abortion and support restricting abortion after 20 weeks, provided there are clear and workable exceptions, particularly for victims of rape and incest and in cases where the life or physical health of the mother is threatened. For example, requiring a teenage girl who was raped by her father to report to law enforcement or a government agency prior to obtaining an abortion is simply not workable. While I do not support this particular bill because of the narrow scope of limitations, I could support legislation that provides more protections for women in situations beyond their control."
