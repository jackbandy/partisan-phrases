USMCA Passes Senate


In 2018 alone, Alaska exported $680 million of goods to Canada and Mexico. Today, U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) voted in support of H.R. 5430, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (USMCA), a trade pact which modernizes the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The measure passed 89-10 and now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law.

"As an economy that depends on exporting our rich natural resources to global markets and leveraging our geostrategic location as a significant hub for the global air cargo industry, Alaska relies on strong international frameworks for free trade," said Senator Murkowski. "Fair trade with Mexico and Canada supports millions of American jobs. The USMCA is a pro-growth trade pact that will deliver trade certainty, create new jobs, and increase economic development here in the U.S. It has the potential to benefit all of America, including Alaska, and to enable our nation to provide needed goods and services competitively for our largest trade partners. I was happy to support the President's USMCA and look forward to more agreements that strengthen international trade and boost our economy."
