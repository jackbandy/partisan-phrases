Senate Passes Legislation to Protect Civil Liberties and National Security


U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) issued the following statement after voting in favor of the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act, which passed the Senate in a 80-16 vote:

"Even though the FISA Reauthorization did not go as far as I would like in terms of protecting Americans' civil liberties, it is an improvement over current law. The Inspector General report released in December detailed serious flaws and abuses taking place in the FISA application process that should concern every citizen of this country, and it is clear more oversight and participation from someone other than the government in the process is needed.  The Lee amendment I cosponsored and voted for will supply a healthy measure of both.  While I'm disappointed the other two amendments I supported were not adopted, the bill is a step in the right direction."
