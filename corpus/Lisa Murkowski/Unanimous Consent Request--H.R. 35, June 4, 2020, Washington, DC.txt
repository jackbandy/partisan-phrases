  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, before my colleagues exit the Chamber,  I want to acknowledge their words. I want to say thank you. The  passion, the emotion, the true rawness in your words are words that I  think all of us, as Members of the Senate, should hear, reflect, and  respect. I just want you to know I am thankful I was on the floor to  personally hear. Because we can read words, but it is when we have the  ability to hear and to feel those words that their true meaning comes  out, so I appreciate and I thank you for that
