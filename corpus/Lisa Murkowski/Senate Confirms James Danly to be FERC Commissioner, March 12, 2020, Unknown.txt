Senate Confirms James Danly to be FERC Commissioner


U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, today issued the following statement after the Senate voted to confirm James Danly to be a Member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on a bipartisan basis. Danly will serve the remainder of a term that ends on June 30, 2023.

"I congratulate Mr. Danly on his confirmation and am pleased that FERC is gaining a well-qualified member. FERC is essential to ensuring the reliability and affordability of our nation's electric system, and I am glad we have now filled a seat that had been vacant for more than 14 months," Murkowski said.

Murkowski is chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The committee held a hearing for Danly on November 5, 2019, and favorably reported his nomination to the full Senate with bipartisan support on December 2, 2019. The President re-nominated Danly in February 2020 and the committee re-reported his nomination on March 3, 2020, again with bipartisan support.
