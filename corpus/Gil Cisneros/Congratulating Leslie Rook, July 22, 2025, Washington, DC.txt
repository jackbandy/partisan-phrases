Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate  Leslie Rook of Monrovia, California.

Earlier this year, Leslie completed a truly impressive feat of  running 50 marathons in all 50 States with an average of three  marathons each year.

Over the past 14 years of this challenge, Leslie ran more than 1,300  miles during these marathons alone, but thousands more to train for  this incredible accomplishment.

Leslie balanced her love of running with her already busy life as an  occupational therapist, wife, and mother of two. I am truly amazed by  Leslie's dedication, stamina, and drive.

Madam Speaker, I congratulate Leslie on this remarkable achievement.  She has made our district proud.
