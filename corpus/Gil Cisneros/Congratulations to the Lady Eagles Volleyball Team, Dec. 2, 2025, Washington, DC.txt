Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the South El  Monte High School Lady Eagles volleyball team on their first-ever CIF  Southern Section Division 9 championship.

In a hard-fought match, the Lady Eagles fell behind two sets to one  before rallying back with determination and grit to take the lead. They  forced a decisive fifth set, battling point-for-point until the score  was tied 12-12. Senior Zaira Garcia then delivered back-to-back kills,  sealing the championship for South El Monte.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Lady Eagles volleyball team on this  historic achievement.                     El Monte High School Eagles Football

Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the amazing  victory of the South El Monte High School Eagles football team in the  2025 CIF Division 14 championship game. The team claimed the school's  first-ever championship in a nail-biting 14-6 win.

Under the leadership of their head coach, Frank Gallardo, the team  devoted countless hours to training this season. Their hard work and  competitive spirit carried them forward when the game was tied at six.

In the final minutes, Eagles quarterback Michael Maldonado stepped up  under pressure and delivered a perfect 10-yard touchdown strike to  Gabriel Canchola. This touchdown pass put the Eagles in the lead.

With 21 seconds still left, the Eagles' Ivan Lopez broke through the  line to sack the opponent's quarterback and seal the championship.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Eagles football team for their first  championship. Their hard work and teamwork shined through, and myself  and our community are very proud of them.                         Baldwin Park Braves Football

Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the inspiring  2025 football season of the Baldwin Park Braves.

After enduring a five-game losing streak, the Braves turned their  season around with determination and teamwork and ultimately secured an  at-large bid into Division 11 playoffs.

In the playoffs, the Braves became a different team and dominated  their way to the CIF Division 11 championship game.

This was the first CIF Southern Section championship appearance for  Baldwin Park since 1991. Unfortunately for the Braves, the goal of a  championship would end when their opponent kicked the game-winning  field goal with 8 seconds left on the clock.

Although they did not take home the title, their teamwork and  determination reflected the true spirit of a champion and serves as an  inspiration to all of us.

Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Baldwin Park Braves football team on their  success this season. Their perseverance and commitment have made their  community incredibly proud.
