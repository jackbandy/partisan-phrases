Gulf of America Act

Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my generous colleague for allowing  me to speak today.

As Members of Congress, we are elected to champion the voices of our  people and pass legislation to make their lives better. Instead, House  Republicans are using their position to introduce a nonsense bill to  rename the Gulf of Mexico.

The Gulf has been known as the Gulf of Mexico since the 16th century.  Why are they making a big deal out of this now? It is because they want  to stroke the ego of Donald Trump.

Back home in California, my constituents are concerned about putting  food on the table. They are feeling crushed by high rent and afraid  that they won't be able to buy a home one day. They are worried about  how they can afford healthcare once these Medicaid cuts take effect.  Seniors are scared their Social Security checks are going to dry up,  but Republicans want to focus on renaming a body of water thousands of  miles away from where we are today.

Instead of addressing the things that actually matter to people back  home, House Republicans are trying to distract us from the harmful  policies they are forcing on all of us. This does nothing to improve  the lives of our constituents. It does nothing to make our country  safer, lower costs, help parents feed their kids, or give our seniors  the support they deserve.

This is a waste of time, and it is a disgrace to the people who  elected us to serve in this body.
