Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement  of a dedicated public servant in California's 31st District.

Enrique Zaldivar has served the city of Baldwin Park as chief  executive officer since 2021.

Demonstrating years of leadership and honoring a commitment to serve  the nearly 80,000 residents of Baldwin Park as the city's first  Mexican-American chief executive officer, Mr. Zaldivar paved his own  path to enhance city operations and make our community a better place.

Throughout his tenure, he helped establish the city's Mexican  Consulate on Wheels, oversaw new public safety upgrades, and brought  vibrant programming to the community.

Mr. Zaldivar is a respected and revered leader. Our community is  better because of him.

I congratulate Mr. Zaldivar on his well-deserved retirement.
