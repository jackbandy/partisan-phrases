Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement  of a dedicated public servant from California's 31st District.  Assistant Fire Chief Mike Fountain has served the community of West  Covina and the West Covina Fire Department since 1995.

Over his 30-year distinguished career, he has served as a  firefighter, paramedic, fire captain, and assistant fire chief. He has  worked tirelessly to ensure the community has the medical supplies and  equipment it needs at all times.

His impact on the community extends well beyond the firehouse walls.  Mr. Fountain committed countless hours to mentoring newly minted  firefighters and leading the firefighters' union as president.

Through his example, Mike Fountain has shown us what leadership is  all about. Mike has ensured the readiness of the West Covina Fire  Department and made the firefighters and the community a top priority.  That community is safer because of his work.

Mr. Speaker, we congratulate Mr. Fountain on an incredible career and  a well-deserved retirement.
