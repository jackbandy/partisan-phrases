Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, I will just say if this administration was  keeping their promises, we would actually have a President, who, when  asked if it is his responsibility to uphold the Constitution, wouldn't  say I don't know, and instead of passing laws  about renaming bodies of water, we would actually be doing things to  help the American people.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the winners of this  year's Congressional Art Competition.

Art is a cornerstone of educational success for our students, giving  them a healthy, creative outlet to process their emotions and share  their stories with the world.

We had over 80 talented young artists submit their work to my  Congressional Art Competition as the California 31st Congressional  District's Representative.

I am proud to announce Marely Gutierrez, an Azusa High School senior,  as our first-place winner. Her charcoal and graphic artwork, Heartfelt  Gaze, will be hung in the Cannon tunnel for the next year for everyone  to see.

I had the pleasure of meeting Marely and the other talented young  artists at a ceremony we hosted last month. Our ceremony was held in  the beautiful Vincenzo's Terrazza in San Dimas, where we celebrated  with students, parents, teachers, and everyone who participated in this  year's competition.

It was such a joy to meet many of California 31st District's bright  young artists and hear about the impact art has on their lives.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Marely again and all the students who  submitted their artwork. I am so proud of each and every one of them.
