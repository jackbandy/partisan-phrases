Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Baldwin Park  Police Officer Samuel Riveros, who lost his life in the line of duty  while attempting to rescue a fellow officer.

Known for his infectious smile, love of the Dodgers, and  snowboarding, Officer Riveros served in the Baldwin Park Police  Department for over 8 years and was a member of the SWAT team.

Officer Riveros' absence leaves a wake of grief that will only be  tempered by time, never to subside.

However, amidst our sorrow, may we find solace in his courage,  character, and the oath he kept until the end. Officer Riveros' legacy  as a hero will live on in the hearts and minds of the Baldwin Park  community and the 31st Congressional District.

This devastating event also claimed the life of Darius Wong, a  resident of Hacienda Heights and a beloved son, brother, husband, and  father.

Both of these men should still be here, and it breaks my heart that  their lives were cut so short from this disgusting act of cruelty.

Let us keep them and their families in our thoughts. May they rest in  peace.
