Pope Francis Led By Example


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690602/pope-francis-led-by-example


Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, Pope Francis led by example. He showed  compassion and empathy to all. He reminded us of our shared humanity,  and he treated everyone with dignity and respect. Pope Francis  understood what it meant to care for one another.

Many of my Republican colleagues often talk about their Christian  values. They should practice what they preach. The reconciliation bill  shows no compassion and no concern for the American people. Their bill  is predatory.

The latest proposal to place so-called per capita caps on Medicaid  funding would still jeopardize healthcare for millions of Americans.  This includes over 282,000 people in my district. Mr. Speaker, 103,000  children under the age of 19 and 37,000 seniors would have their care  ripped away.

I urge my Republican colleagues to stop with their empty platitudes,  to stop catering to the cruel authority of President Trump, to stop  putting billionaires over the American people. I urge them to take Pope  Francis' message of compassion, of respect, and of moral courage to  heart.
