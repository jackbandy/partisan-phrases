Graham Earns 'A' Rating For Protecting Life


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today received an "A" rating on the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) National Pro-life Scorecard. This scorecard recognizes members of Congress who have championed pro-life policies in the 116th Congress.

"Senator Graham has voted consistently to protect the lives of unborn babies and infants as well as the consciences of taxpayers who don't want their hard-earned tax dollars paying for abortion domestically or internationally," wrote SBA List in announcing Graham's rating. 

As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Graham has led the charge to confirm 187 federal judges nominated by President Trump and promote policies that protect the lives of the unborn.

Senator Graham is the sponsor of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which limits abortion after 20 weeks post-fertilization, the point at which there is scientific evidence that abortion inflicts tremendous pain on the unborn child. Senator Graham also cosponsored the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to criminalize infanticide and protect infants born alive following attempted abortions.
