Chairman Graham Statement on IG Horowitz's Lack of Confidence that FBI Complied with Standards for FISA Warrant Applications


Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement after Department of Justice Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz announced the initial findings of the FISA process audit, which examined a sample of eight FBI field offices and 29 FISA warrant applications involving U.S. citizens. 

IG Horowitz stated he does "not have confidence" that the FBI complied with key steps, known as "Woods Procedures," which ensure accuracy in these FISA warrant applications. 

"I have just been briefed on Inspector General Horowitz's audit of FISA applications involving American citizens. This random audit shows discrepancies regarding verification of the information under the Woods Procedures.

"I intend to have Inspector General Horowitz come to the Committee to explain his findings and receive his recommendations about how to change the program," said Graham.

IG Horowitz's audit comes after a December 2019 report exposing FISA abuse targeting the Trump campaign.
