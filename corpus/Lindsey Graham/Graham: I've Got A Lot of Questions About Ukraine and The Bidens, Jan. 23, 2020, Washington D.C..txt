Graham: I've Got A Lot of Questions About Ukraine and The Bidens


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today spoke to reporters ahead of the third day of the impeachment trial.

GRAHAM: "I want the public to understand that the claims [the House impeachment managers] are making that there's no "there' there in the Bidens -- nobody's looked!  Somebody should and I've looked and I've got a lot of questions. Were they buying insurance by hiring Hunter Biden? Because they sure as hell weren't buying expertise." https://youtu.be/UAbldiFeaoI?t=273GRAHAM: "Does it make sense to hire the son of the guy in charge of the [Ukraine] portfolio for the American government? And from the time they raided the [Burisma] President's home, Joe Biden called the President of Ukraine four times, got on a plane, and said if you don't fire this guy you don't get the billion dollars. I love Joe Biden, but I can tell you if the name was Trump, there would be a lot of questions asked." https://youtu.be/UAbldiFeaoI?t=249GRAHAM: "The one thing I can tell you is that we don't want to start a process where you can do impeachment in the House and 48 days, shut legal issues off and drop them into the lap of the Senate, and deal out the courts -- I'm not going to do that." https://youtu.be/UAbldiFeaoI?t=563
