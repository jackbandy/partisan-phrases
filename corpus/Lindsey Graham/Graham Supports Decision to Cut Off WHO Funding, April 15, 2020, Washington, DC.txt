Graham Supports Decision to Cut Off WHO Funding


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement on news that the United States will halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) while a review is conducted to investigate the WHO's role in mismanaging and covering up the spread of coronavirus in China.

"Cutting off funding at this time is the right move. This is a critical time for worldwide public health and we cannot afford China apologists running the WHO. I support a suspension of funding by the United States until there is new leadership at the WHO.

"I have a lot of respect for Bill Gates and his work in the public health arena. The Gates Foundation, under Bill and Melinda's leadership, has a reputation for investing in programs which are well-run and produce results. However, Bill Gates' decision to defend the performance of the WHO during the coronavirus crisis and current WHO leadership ignores overwhelming evidence of China bias and incompetence.

"If someone like Bill Gates were in charge of the WHO I would gladly support increased funding. But I have lost all confidence in the current WHO leadership and capabilities.

"The world needs a competent WHO. But the days of throwing money at an incompetent organization are over under President Trump's leadership."
