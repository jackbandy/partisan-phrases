Graham on Yemen War Cease Fire


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made the following statement in response to reports that the Saudi-led coalition declared a cease-fire in the Yemen war. 

"I appreciate and support the efforts of the Saudi-led coalition to bring about a unilateral cease-fire to the conflict in Yemen and move towards a political solution. I hope and expect that all parties will take advantage of this moment to end this conflict and to give relief to the long suffering people of Yemen. 

 "Iran needs to step up to the plate and push their Houthi proxies to the negotiating table to reach a comprehensive solution to stop the suffering. The Yemen conflict has created great instability throughout the region and untold suffering for the citizens of Yemen. I know both Congress and the Trump administration will be supportive of any reasonable effort to end this conflict."
