Graham Will Vote to Acquit President Trump


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today spoke on the Senate floor about the articles of impeachment against President Trump.  Graham will vote against both articles of impeachment.

GRAHAM: "It's never enough when it comes to President Trump. This sham process is the low point in the Senate for me. If you think you've done the country a good service by legitimizing this impeachment process, what you have done is unleash the partisan forces of hell. This is sour grapes." https://youtu.be/-65jk4sBZfQ?t=75GRAHAM: "This is not about protecting the country -- this is about destroying the President. There are no rules when it comes to Donald Trump. Everybody in America can confront the witnesses against them, except Donald Trump. Everybody in America can call witnesses on their behalf, except President Trump. Everybody in America can introduce evidence, except for President Trump. He's not above the law, but you've put him below the law." https://youtu.be/-65jk4sBZfQ?t=120GRAHAM: "I can say this without any hesitation: I worry about the future of the presidency after what's happened here. Ladies and gentlemen, you will come to regret this whole process. And to those who have [Speaker Pelosi's impeachment pens]: I hope you will understand history will judge those pins as a souvenir of shame." https://youtu.be/-65jk4sBZfQ?t=467
