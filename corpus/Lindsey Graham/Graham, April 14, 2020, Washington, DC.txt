Graham, Scott Hold Call With South Carolina Religious Leaders


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today held a conference call with Senator Tim Scott and South Carolina religious leaders.

During the congressional recess, Graham and Scott have been holding numerous conference calls with the local, business, and state leaders to discuss the latest on coronavirus and the CARES Act which President Trump signed into law. The legislation provides wide-ranging financial assistance to businesses, individuals, and charitable organizations who have been negatively impacted by conoravirus.

Graham made this statement after the call:

"Senator Scott and I had a great call this afternoon with religious leaders throughout South Carolina whose congregations are suffering as we battle coronavirus.

"We explained the benefits that are available to religious organizations and the congregations. We also thanked them for their work in continuing to speak with their members about the need to contain the virus.

"In difficult times our faith is important. We all look forward to the better days which lie ahead."
