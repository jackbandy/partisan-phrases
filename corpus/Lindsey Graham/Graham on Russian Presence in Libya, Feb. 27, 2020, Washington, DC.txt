Graham on Russian Presence in Libya


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made the following statement after meeting with Libyan Ambassador to the United States Wafa Bughaighis.

"I just met with the Libyan Ambassador to the United States and I am very concerned about Russian presence in Libya. Oil-rich Libya is now the focus of proxy wars and one of the leading offenders is Russia.  In addition, several American allies are supporting different sides in Libya and our Italian allies are very much impacted by the continued chaos.

"It is obvious there is no military solution to the troubles facing Libya.  I appreciate the United States' efforts to resolve this conflict, but the whole world needs to up its game when it comes to Libya.

"One of the worst outcomes would be for Russia to carve up oil-rich Libya to their benefit, dramatically impacting the balance of power in the region.

"While Libya does not require an American military presence, it does and will require a full scale diplomatic effort to stand regional players down who are supporting chaos in Libya.

"It is in the U.S. national security interest that Libya not become a foothold for Russia, the abundant oil resources are secured for the Libyan people, and the civil war end sooner rather than later."
