  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think we probably can get there if we  talk. We just got this thing at 5:30 last night. It is a grant program  to try to strive for better policing, less bias. I get that. Count me  in for that concept. 

  There is a civilian review process about prosecutorial decisions that  I don't quite understand. Senator Lee came up and asked me questions  about the bill. 

   I hope we can get it as  part of a broader agenda. On June 16, we are going to have a hearing  about all things related to police and race, and we will try to make  this part of a package. 

  So at this time, I do object, and let it go through the committee.
