Dr. Rabbi Ari Berman


Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my honor to introduce Rabbi Berman,  who just gave the prayer and who is president of the Yeshiva  University.

Thank you for your blessing this morning.

In his prayer, Rabbi Berman reminded us that America's strength lies  not just in power but purpose; not just in might but in our pursuit of  the good. He has lived that principle. He is a global faith leader,  distinguished scholar, educational visionary who is shaping  contemporary discourse at the intersection of faith, ethics, and higher  education.

As the fifth president of the Yeshiva University, he has redefined  the role of faith-based universities in the United States. He gave the  benediction at President Trump's inauguration.

Yeshiva University, for more than a century, has been contributing to  the common good and advancing the goals of faith with purpose. It is  one of the flagship universities in the entire world for the Jewish  faith, and he has brought his aperture there to bring us all together.

Finally, I want to recognize the need to succor. You said: Why are we  here? I am here because Anita said I needed to be here to recognize  Rabbi Berman. Anita is a fellow South Carolinian. She is a trustee at  Yeshiva University, and she has contributed to our State, to the values  that serve us in education, that bind us together. Anita called me  about you and she was dead right.

Welcome and well done. God bless you.
