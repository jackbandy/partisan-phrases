Graham Backs Reduction in U.S. Aid to Afghanistan


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made the following statement after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the United States will reduce aid to Afghanistan by $1 billion.   

"I totally support Secretary of State Pompeo's decision to reduce $1 billion in U.S. aid to Afghanistan. If the two major candidates for president are not able to work together to form a functioning government, all future aid should be reevaluated because you're throwing good money after bad.

"Without a functioning government, Afghanistan is becoming a hopeless cause. This is a terrible outcome for the people of Afghanistan, the United States, and the region. The only way to avoid this is for the two candidates to reconcile their differences quickly.

"I have been the strongest supporter of our continued presence in Afghanistan because I believe it is vital to U.S. national security. However, if there is no political reconciliation soon, Afghanistan will be moving toward hopelessness. The day I believe we have reached that point, I will, with great sadness, say so."
