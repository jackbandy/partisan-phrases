Chairman Graham Condemns House of Representatives for Withholding Articles of Impeachment


Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) introduced a Senate Resolution demanding that the Speaker of the House immediately transmit the two Articles of Impeachment against President Trump to the Senate.

The Graham resolution criticizes Speaker Pelosi for claiming "the power to effectively veto a resolution passed by a duly elected majority of the House of Representatives" and notes that the refusal to forward the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is a "gross infringement on the constitutional authority of the Senate to try impeachment." 

"This resolution is a simple statement by the Senate. It is our job as Senators to dispose of the articles that were lawfully passed. The Speaker's attempt to shape or delay the trial is unprecedented. It cannot stand.

"In addition, I am very pleased to see Democrats are raising their voices in support of the idea that Speaker Pelosi should transmit the Articles of Impeachment for disposition in the Senate. I believe this is a turning point in the debate. What the Speaker has been doing is inconsistent with the Constitution and unfair to the President and the American people.

"I hope and expect that this constitutional standoff will end soon."

Twenty-six Republican Senators have signed on to the resolution.
