Statement from U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement.

"It is my opinion, based on the law and facts, that additional testimony is unnecessary in this case.

"For the sake of argument, one could assume everything attributable to John Bolton is accurate and still the House case would fall well below the standards to remove a president from office.

"It is clear to me that there is ample evidence for the President to be concerned about conflicts of interest on behalf of Hunter Biden and that Vice President Joe Biden's failure to take appropriate action was unacceptable. This combination, in my view, undercut America's message on reforming corruption in Ukraine. There is a mountain of evidence to suggest the Bidens' behavior was harmful to the United States.

"The House managers' claim that the sole reason President Trump temporarily paused the aid was purely personal and political, not public, does not withstand scrutiny.

"However, I am concerned when John Bolton's credibility is attacked, it makes it more likely some will feel the need to call him as a witness. 

"In that event, it would be important for the President and his team to call witnesses on other issues."
