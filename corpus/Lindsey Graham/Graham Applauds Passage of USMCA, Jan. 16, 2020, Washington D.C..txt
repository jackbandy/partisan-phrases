Graham Applauds Passage of USMCA


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made the following statement after the Senate passed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

"This agreement is a giant step forward for free and fair trade with our North American neighbors.  I strongly supported passage of the USMCA.   

"This agreement is good for American workers, as it modernizes intellectual property rights, one of the crown jewels of the American economy.  It is also good for manufacturing and agriculture, two cornerstones of the South Carolina economy.

"I congratulate President Trump and his trade team for negotiating the USMCA.  It will help grow the American economy for decades to come."
