Scott, Sasse, Graham Demand Immediate Fix to Life-Threatening Drafting Error in Emergency Bill


In an effort to prevent a drafting error in the coronavirus emergency legislation from incentivizing layoffs and risking life-threatening consequences to critical industries, U.S. Senators Tim Scott (SC), Ben Sasse (NE), and Lindsey Graham (SC) issued the following joint statement:

"A massive drafting error in the current version of the coronavirus relief legislation could have devastating consequences: Unless this bill is fixed, there is a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work. This isn't an abstract, philosophical point -- it's an immediate, real-world problem.  If the federal government accidentally incentivizes layoffs, we risk life-threatening shortages in sectors where doctors, nurses, and pharmacists are trying to care for the sick, and where growers and grocers, truckers and cooks are trying to get food to families' tables. This isn't who we are as Americans; this isn't what we do in a crisis. We must sadly oppose the fast-tracking of this bill until this text is addressed, or the Department of Labor issues regulatory guidance that no American would earn more by not working than by working."
