Graham on Trump Statement About Georgia Business Re-openings


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement on President Trump expressing concerns about business re-openings in the State of Georgia.

"I agree with President Trump's concern about Georgia going "too far too fast' with business re-openings. 

"I have great respect for Governor Kemp and believe that future re-openings can occur rather quickly but we must get Phase I right.  I totally understand Governor Kemp's desire to allow businesses to reopen as small business owners are under great stress. 

"President Trump and his team have given us a sound roadmap on how to safely reopen the economy.  I strongly suggest, as a nation, we follow it.  The best path forward is to follow the guidelines set by President Trump and his team. Barber shops, hair salons, tattoo parlors, and other close quarter business activity will come after a successful Phase I.

"I am confident that in the coming weeks -- if we follow the guidelines -- more and more businesses will be safely reopened.  Our goal is to achieve a bump in the economy without creating a spike in the virus. 

"We are fifty individual states but when it comes to the virus we are all in this fight together.  Because of the sacrifices we have made as a nation there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Better days are ahead."
