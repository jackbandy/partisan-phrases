Graham on 'Unmasking' General Flynn


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement on the list of officials who unmasked the identity of General Michael Flynn.

"I very much appreciate DNI Grenell releasing names of the Obama Administration officials who made the unmasking requests of American citizen conversations with foreign entities.

"The unmasking of General Flynn by the Obama Administration regarding conversations during the presidential transition are deeply troubling and smell of politics, not national security.  

"In light of General Flynn's unmasking by the Obama Administration, the job of Congress will be to perform oversight of these unmasking requests to ensure the process was used for legitimate national security concerns, not reprisals or political curiosity.

"I specifically want to know how many unmasking requests were made, if any, beyond General Flynn regarding members of the Trump campaign team, family, or associates."
