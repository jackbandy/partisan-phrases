Graham: House Managers Are Misleading When They Claim Bidens' Conflict of Interest Baseless, Been Debunked


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) made the following statement in response to House impeachment manager Schiff's comments today on the Senate floor.

"House impeachment manager Schiff has suggested we put ourselves in the Bidens' shoes.

"I would assume that if you did what the Bidens did -- allowing Hunter Biden to turn Ukraine into an ATM machine receiving an estimated $3 million from one of the most corrupt companies in a corrupt country -- I dare say you should expect some questions coming your way. If you are a Republican, you could expect Mr. Schiff to be your worst nightmare.

"If Vice President Pence and his son were in this spot, I'm confident Mr. Schiff and our Democratic colleagues would be demanding someone look into this matter, not simply sweep it under the rug.  Every media outlet in the country would demand an accounting and Democrats would be howling for an investigation. 

"It is clear to me that the House managers are misleading the Senate and the country when they say that the Bidens' conflict of interest in Ukraine is baseless and has been debunked.

"When this trial is over, I expect either congressional oversight or an independent investigation into the Biden matter."
