Graham Applauds New China Trade Deal


U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement following President Trump's signing of a new, partial trade deal between the United States and China.

"I was very honored to attend the signing of the United States and China Phase One Trade Agreement. This is a historic agreement that opens up Chinese markets to American companies, particularly in the areas of manufacturing and agriculture.

"Most importantly, this agreement is a giant step towards China changing their unfair business practices, including currency manipulation and forcing American companies to transfer technology as a price of doing business in China.

"We have more to do with China, but this is a tremendous step forward.  Chinese trade behavior has been very predatory against American interests, and I hope it will lead to further trade deals that are truly a win-win.

"This is a historic accomplishment for the Trump Administration."
