Abolishing Ice

Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of abolishing ICE.

ICE is out of control. Just in the past month, against American  citizens, ICE has shot and killed a 37-year-old mother of three, tear- gassed a 6-month-old baby in his parents' car, and hauled out a  grandfather in 14-degree weather in nothing but his underwear.

Thanks to Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, our communities constantly  live in fear of those who are supposed to protect them.

When an agency structure consistently produces harm instead of  justice, there is no way to reform it. We must abolish ICE.
