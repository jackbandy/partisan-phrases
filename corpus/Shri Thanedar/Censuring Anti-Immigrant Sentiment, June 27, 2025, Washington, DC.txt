Censuring Anti-Immigrant Sentiment

Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor immigrants.

Throughout American history, immigrants of all kinds have made our  country great. Sergey Brin invented Google, and Madeleine Albright  blazed trails as the first female Secretary of State.

Instead of celebrating this diversity, many Republicans want to shame  immigrants. On Tuesday, Zohran Mamdani, an immigrant from Uganda, won  the New York mayoral primary. Representative Andy Ogles promptly went  on an unhinged, anti-immigrant, racist rant throughout yesterday and  today, calling this freely elected man and U.S. citizen ``Little  Muhammad'' and called for revoking his citizenship and for him to be  deported with no just cause.

We must always condemn hate. I have introduced a censure resolution,  H. Res. 553, against Andy Ogles for his horrific anti-immigrant  sentiment. Immigrants make our country great.
