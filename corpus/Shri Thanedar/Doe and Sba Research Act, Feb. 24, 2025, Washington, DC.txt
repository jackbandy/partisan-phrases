Doe and Sba Research Act


Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 788.

First of all, I thank Chairman Williams and Ranking Member Velazquez  for their bipartisan work. As a serial entrepreneur in the technology  innovation sector, I couldn't be happier to stand here and support this  bill along with my amazing colleagues, Representative LaLota and  Representative Morrison.

Mr. Speaker, I recognize the indispensable role in enhancing  collaboration between the Small Business Administration and the  Department of Energy, all in the name of improving research and  development efforts.

Let's not forget small businesses are a cornerstone of this country.  The innovation we stimulate within this sector is not just important,  it is vital for America's future. This legislation does not simply  propose research collaboration. It carves a path for our small  businesses to lead the way.

It mandates a collaborative report within 2 years of its enactment.  This report will empower us to monitor and comprehend the effectiveness  of our research collaborations, providing us with the opportunity to  revise and refine strategies as necessary.

I am excited, and I hope my colleagues share my enthusiasm about the  potential growth and broadening capabilities the DOE and SBA Research  Act promise to bring.

Let's always keep sight of the ultimate goal of this legislation  which is creating high-paying jobs for our fellow Americans and  safeguarding our Nation's competitive edge on the global stage.  Remember, this isn't just about legislation. It is about our future.
