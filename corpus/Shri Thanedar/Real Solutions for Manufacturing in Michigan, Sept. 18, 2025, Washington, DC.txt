Real Solutions for Manufacturing in Michigan

Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about manufacturing.  Manufacturing is not just what we do in Michigan. It is who we are.  Detroit built the Motor City, the Big Three automakers, and America's  middle class.

Today, when we still lead in auto manufacturing, Michigan faces some  of the Nation's highest unemployment rates while families are  struggling with rising costs.

Mr. Trump promised that tariffs would protect our jobs. Instead, they  have driven up the cost of steel, aluminum, and auto parts while plants  close and workers are left behind. When a plant shuts down in Detroit  or Wayne County, it doesn't just hurt the workers inside of it. It  hurts every business, schools, and families.

We need real solutions, like job training, stronger unions, and  building the future of mobility right here in Detroit.
