Fighting for Detroit


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698889/fighting-for-detroit


Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, the last time Donald Trump visited  Detroit, he insulted our city, saying the whole country would end up  like Detroit if Kamala Harris was elected. Mr. Trump promised to bring  manufacturing jobs and economic success.

For the last 8 months, we have lost 68,000 jobs. Unemployment has hit  a 4-year high. His tariffs have hurt Detroit's auto industry.

Mr. Speaker, Detroit does not need any more of Donald Trump's lies  and insults. Detroit needs affordable housing, not Trump's insults.  Detroit needs skilled jobs, not Trump's insults.

Mr. Speaker, I am fighting for Detroit, fighting to bring costs down,  and make life more affordable for all.
