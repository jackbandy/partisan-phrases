Unlocking Our Domestic Lng Potential Act of 2025


Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, House Republicans and President Trump  remain firm in our commitment to lowering costs for families and  restoring American energy dominance.

I am proud to represent parts of the Utica and Marcellus shale  formations, where natural gas development has transformed local  economies and strengthened our Nation's energy security. Boosting  natural gas production in Ohio and expanding LNG exports are essential  to our vision of energy dominance.

Under the last administration, President Biden repeatedly undermined  the domestic energy producers, including imposing a ban on new LNG  export permits. This misguided action discouraged investments in  American natural gas and harmed our allies abroad, who are working to  reduce their dependence on Russian energy.

The Unlocking our Domestic LNG Potential Act ends political  interference in the permit process and unleashes America's full energy  potential.

Here are the facts on LNG:

Increasing LNG exports would add over $70 billion to the U.S. economy  and create over 400,000 American jobs by 2040.

American LNG is more than 40 percent cleaner than Russian LNG.

Since we have increased our LNG exports, domestic natural gas prices  have remained affordable and stable.

Under President Trump, we are restoring American energy leadership.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman August Pfluger for leading this  important legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
