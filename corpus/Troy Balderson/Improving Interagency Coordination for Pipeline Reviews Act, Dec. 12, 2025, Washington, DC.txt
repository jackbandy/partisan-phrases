Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Improving  Interagency Coordination for Pipeline Reviews Act. This legislation  will bring much-needed reforms to the Federal permitting process.

Natural gas has become the foundation of America's energy mix,  accounting for almost 40 percent of our total energy production and 43  percent of electricity generation.

The shale revolution has ushered in a new era of American energy  independence and revitalized communities in Ohio and across the  Appalachian region as they tap into the vast natural gas reserves  beneath our feet.

In order to move this energy from the well pad to the customer, we  need modern and reliable infrastructure. Far and away, the best way to  transport natural gas from point A to B is by pipeline. It is safer,  more efficient, and cheaper, and further reducing costs for consumers.

Because of the outdated regulations, a lack of coordination, and  political obstruction, critical pipelines that provide reliable and  affordable energy for our constituents have been delayed or blocked  altogether.

The truth is America's power demand is surging. To meet this  challenge and power the future, we need pipelines. This legislation  streamlines regulatory oversight, establishes clear timelines for  environmental reviews, and helps lower costs for American families by  unleashing our full energy potential.
