Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Chair, communities in my district and across the  country continue to feel the devastating impact of the opioid and  fentanyl crisis. We all know someone who has been affected, and many of  us felt that loss ourselves.

The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, first signed into law  by President Trump in 2018, brought vital resources to those on the  front lines: patients, families, first responders, and recovery  providers.

Since then, overdose deaths have dropped significantly, but as we all  know too well in Appalachian Ohio, there is much more work to be done.

Today's reauthorization builds on that progress. This bill ensures  access to lifesaving medications for first responders, expands  treatment for pregnant women, strengthens prescription drug monitoring,  and supports recovery centers and workforce reentry programs.

By continuing this critical work, we can save more lives, restore  more families, and bring hope to communities hit hardest by the  addiction.
