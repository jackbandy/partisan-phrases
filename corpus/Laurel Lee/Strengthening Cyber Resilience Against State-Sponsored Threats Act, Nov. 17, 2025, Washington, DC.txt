Ms. LEE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2659, the Strengthening Cyber Resilience Against State-Sponsored  Threats Act.

I thank Congressman Ogles for his leadership on this legislation and  for his commitment to enhancing the security of our Nation's critical  infrastructure.

In recent years, the United States has faced an alarming surge in  malicious cyber activity originating from  groups aligned with the Government of the People's Republic of China.

These actors have demonstrated a level of sophistication and planning  that reflects both significant resources and a deep understanding of  the essential systems that keep our country functioning.

Groups associated with the PRC, including those known as Volt  Typhoon, Salt Typhoon, and others, have directed their attention toward  the networks that deliver power, water, communications, transportation  services, and other foundational systems relied upon by millions of  Americans every day.

Their operations have shown a clear pattern. They look for ways to  enter sensitive environments. They work to remain there as long as  possible. They study the systems they infiltrate so that their presence  blends into normal activity.

This type of long-term access is particularly concerning. When an  adversary establishes persistent access to critical systems, even  access that appears dormant, it creates the possibility of disruption  at a future date.

The United States cannot allow foreign actors to position themselves  in ways that could compromise public safety, interrupt essential  services, or hinder our ability to respond in times of crisis.

The scale of targeting has also continued to expand. These cyber  actors are now looking across multiple sectors at once, which means  that our national response must be organized in a way that can match  the breadth of the threat.

Federal responsibilities for protecting critical infrastructure are  distributed across several departments, and each department has  specific missions and authorities. That structure often works well  during normal operations, but when confronted with a fast-moving and  coordinated foreign threat, it can create gaps in communication and  delay collective action.

H.R. 2659 provides a clear and practical solution to this challenge.  The bill directs the creation of a joint interagency task force led by  the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency with support from  the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

This task force will bring together the agencies responsible for  overseeing individual sectors, the intelligence community, and other  Federal partners. The purpose is to ensure that all relevant entities  are sharing information, planning together, and taking action with a  common understanding of the threat.

The legislation also strengthens the role of Congress by ensuring  that we receive timely, comprehensive assessments of the threat  landscape. These reports will help us understand sector-specific  vulnerabilities, the methods used by the PRC-linked cyber actors, the  potential consequences of disruption during a crisis, and the extent to  which Federal agencies may need additional tools or authorities.

This ongoing visibility is vital for effective oversight and for  developing policies that reflect current and emerging challenges.

H.R. 2659 is a thoughtful and necessary step toward improving the  resilience of our critical infrastructure. It lays the groundwork for a  more unified and prepared Federal approach. It supports the operators  who manage vital systems across our country. It strengthens our  national posture against a foreign adversary that has already shown its  willingness to target essential American services.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation.
