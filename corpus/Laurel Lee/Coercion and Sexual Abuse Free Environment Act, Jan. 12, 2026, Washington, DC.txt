Ms. LEE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 6732, the Coercion and Sexual Abuse Free Environment Act, and I  thank my colleague from Arizona (Mr. Biggs) for his leadership on this  critical issue.

Madam Speaker, as technology advances, so do the tactics of predators  who seek to harm our children. Current Federal statutes were not  written with this kind of remote, organized, and coercive abuse in  mind. When the law lags behind the tactics of predators, Congress has  an obligation to act.

We are now confronting a deeply disturbing trend in which organized  online networks target vulnerable minors, manipulate them through fear  and blackmail, and coerce them into committing acts of violence against  themselves, others, or even animals.

These online groups use mainstream platforms to gain access to  children, extract personal information or images, and then weaponize  that material.

The result is severe psychological coercion and abuse--children  forced into self-mutilation, cruelty to animals, or even suicide, all  at the direction of anonymous criminals who often operate across  borders and behind ever-changing online identities.

Our laws must be able to meet this threat head-on. H.R. 6732 does  exactly that. This bill modernizes Federal criminal law by clearly  criminalizing the coercion or enticement of a minor to engage in self- harm, animal crushing, or other abusive or degrading conduct.

This legislation closes dangerous gaps in current law and sends an  unmistakable message: Compelling a child to destroy themselves or to  harm others is child abuse. It is criminal, and it will be prosecuted.

Madam Speaker, protecting children is one of Congress' most solemn  responsibilities. H.R. 6732 is a necessary, targeted, and responsible  response to a real and growing threat.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
