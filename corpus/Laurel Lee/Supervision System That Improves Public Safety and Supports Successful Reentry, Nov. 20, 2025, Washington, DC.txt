Ms. LEE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Safer  Supervision Act, a bipartisan bill backed by Federal law enforcement,  probation officers, and public defenders. This broad coalition shares a  common goal: a supervision system that improves public safety and  supports successful reentry.

Today, more than 110,000 Americans are on supervision. Probation  officers are carrying caseloads so large that it is difficult to focus  on the individuals who truly need the greatest oversight.

The Safer Supervision Act restores individualized judicial  decisionmaking, creates a responsible path to early termination, allows  treatment-based responses, and focuses resources where they make the  greatest impact.

This is smart-on-crime reform that strengthens safety and supports  second chances.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Safer Supervision  Act.
