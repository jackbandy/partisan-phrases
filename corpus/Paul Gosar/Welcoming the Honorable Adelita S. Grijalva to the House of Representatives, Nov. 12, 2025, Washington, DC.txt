Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to  congratulate our newest colleague and our fellow Arizonan on her  swearing in as the Representative for Arizona's Seventh Congressional  District, Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva.

Congresswoman Grijalva has concentrated her career on issues  advocating for students and supporting families.

As she follows in her late father's footsteps--and, boy, those are  some footsteps, especially with those bolo ties, wow--I have no doubt  she will bring to the Halls of Congress the same energy that has  defined her years of public service.

As dean of the Arizona congressional delegation, I wish to  congratulate Congresswoman Grijalva and welcome her to the United  States House of Representatives.

I now yield to the gentleman from Mr. Arizona (Mr. Stanton), my  friend.
