Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today like every other person with a  heavy heart to honor the life of my dear friend and colleague, the  gentleman, the giant from California, Doug LaMalfa.

Doug was a devoted public servant, a fierce advocate for rural  America and the West, and a man who deeply loved his country and the  people that he was honored to represent.

As a lifelong resident of northern California, he understood the  land, the communities, and the values of his district in a way that  cannot be taught, only lived.

He fought tirelessly for the farmers, the ranchers, and the  communities too often ignored by the coastal elites, and he did so with  candor and conviction and a sense of humor that made even the hardest  days feel better.

Doug was more than a colleague. He was a friend. He was a brother.  His leadership, his wisdom, and his heart for service will be deeply  missed. Doug's legacy of faith and service and love endures.

Lord, accept this gentle giant, this dedicated giant, Doug LaMalfa.  May his family have the goodwill to know that he lies in your comfort.
