In Memory of Congressman Raul Grijalva


Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, it is no mystery that Raul and I never saw  eye to eye on pretty much anything, but it actually benefits this whole  group because it is about the debate. We can come with our ideas to the  floor and we can debate each other, and that is the way it should be.

If you had your idea yourself, Raul would make it so it was important  to  you to fight for it. He always was very principled. His humor was  unwitting. He laughed and I chuckled when he laughed.

He emulated all of us and what we can do in this body. There are good  ideas, there are bad ideas, and that is why we have to have this  debate.

God bless Raul and his family.

Remember him in your hearts and say a prayer.
