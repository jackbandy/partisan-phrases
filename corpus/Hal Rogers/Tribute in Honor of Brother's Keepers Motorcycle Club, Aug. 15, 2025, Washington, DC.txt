Tribute in Honor of Brother's Keepers Motorcycle Club


Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the  Brother's Keepers Motorcycle Club of Kentucky. What started out as a  group of firefighters whose main purpose was to strengthen their  brotherhood through recreational motorcycle rides, has now grown into a  club with much greater purpose.

The Brother's Keepers Motorcycle Club focuses on safety and  motorcycle awareness nationwide. However, realizing the strength of  their unity, these firefighting bikers have turned their fun and  relaxation into fundraising and charitable work. For example, their  Kentucky chapters collectively support the Shriners Hospital and  Transportation, Scars Uncovered, and the Hoosier Burn Camp for Kids.  The five chapters in Kentucky include Lexington, Louisville,  Campbellsville, Sturgis, and Paintsville. Together, they host the Burn  Run, a two-day event for charity that has resulted in more than  $300,000 in funding for pediatric burn victims.

Every day, our firefighters bravely answer the call of duty to save  lives and rescue homes, businesses, and community facilities from total  destruction. The charitable work of this club is evidence that a true  heart of service never clocks out when an emergency ends. Even in their  spare time, they are serving and protecting the most innocent lives in  Kentucky by raising support for young burn victims. Thanks to their  fundraising efforts, more essential resources are available for  families, including educational programs, healthcare initiatives, and  recreational opportunities for patients who need them the most.

I salute the Brother's Keepers Motorcycle Club of Kentucky for  providing a beacon of hope for families across the Commonwealth, going  far beyond the call of duty to help those in need.
