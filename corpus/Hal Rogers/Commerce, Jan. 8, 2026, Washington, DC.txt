Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for the  introduction. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the CJS Subcommittee, I rise  in support of H.R. 6938.

From national security and law enforcement to American innovation and  space exploration, the CJS bill before us puts the Nation on a path to  greatness while reinforcing President Trump's bold agenda on trade and  combating illicit drug trafficking.

To continue the fight against the drug cartels that are ravaging  American communities, the Drug Enforcement Administration receives an  increase of $63 million in this bill.

The bill also streamlines and enhances support for the National  Weather Service to ensure Americans receive lifesaving information in  times of need.

This bill is pro-law enforcement. It includes increased funding for  State and local police through the Byrne Formula Grant Program and COPS  hiring grants, while also making cuts to wasteful grant programs.

I thank Chairman Cole for his steady leadership. This has been a  courageous effort on his part and our committee to restore regular  order to the way we apportion taxpayer moneys that are entrusted to us.  This legislation is a product of good faith, bipartisan negotiations.

I thank and recognize Ranking Member Meng and Ranking Member DeLauro  for their partnership as well as staff for their hard work on the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
