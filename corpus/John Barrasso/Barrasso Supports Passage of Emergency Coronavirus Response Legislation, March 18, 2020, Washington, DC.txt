Barrasso Supports Passage of Emergency Coronavirus Response Legislation


Today, Senator John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, released the following statement after he supported the passage of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.

"America is in an unprecedented health and economic crisis that is changing rapidly by the hour. Congress has a responsibility to provide relief to those impacted. It's critical that we get it right. To save lives and save our economy, Congress has a duty for the duration of this emergency to help Americans who find themselves facing this global pandemic. To help stop the virus from spreading, this legislation ensures that patients can receive testing and treatment. It also provides paid sick leave to employees of small businesses. We are not finished. Congress will pass additional targeted, temporary relief for many Americans and small business owners who suddenly find themselves out of work or forced to close their businesses."
