Barrasso: Now the Senate Gets Back to Work


U.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY), chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement after the Senate acquitted the president on the articles of impeachment.

"The time for political stunts is over. The Senate had a fair trial, and clear acquittal. Republicans stayed true to the Constitution. Now the Senate gets back to work for the American people.

"I invite Democrats to join us -- join us in working for a stronger economy, a safer America, lower costs for prescription drugs, and rebuilding our roads and bridges."
