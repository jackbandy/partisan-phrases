Justice Will Finally be Done in the Senate


U.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY), chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement after the House of Representatives transmitted articles of impeachment to the Senate.

"Today House Democrats sent to the Senate the most rushed and unfair impeachment articles in modern history. They held secret hearings, released misleading information, and denied the president due process. This was a political stunt. Just one in three Americans say the process in the House was fair. Justice will finally be done -- that will be in the Senate."
