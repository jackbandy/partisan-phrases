Barrasso Statement on Senate Passage of USMCA


Today, U.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) issued the following statement after the Senate passed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

"President Trump ran on a promise to put America first with respect to our trade policy. Today we made good on that promise when the Senate passed a modernized trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. Twelve million American jobs depend on trade with our North American neighbors. The United States--Mexico--Canada Agreement (USMCA) protects those jobs by ensuring American businesses, farmers and ranchers have access to Canadian and Mexican markets for years to come.

"The USMCA isn't the only important trade deal in the books. Since taking office, President Trump implemented new deals with South Korea and Japan. He also forced China to the negotiating table and signed an important deal to open Chinese markets to a variety of American products, including Wyoming beef and energy exports. Together these trade deals will strengthen our growing economy, protect American jobs, and build on the president's successful work to refocus and modernize U.S. trade policy."
