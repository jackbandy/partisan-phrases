Barrasso: Time Is Of The Essence


Today, Senator John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, released the following statement after Paycheck Protection Program funding was finally replenished after being blocked by Senate Democrats. The deal included funding for rural hospitals affected by coronavirus, a priority for Senator Barrasso as co-chair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus.

"Two weeks ago, Senate Republicans put forward a bill to prevent the Paycheck Protection Program from running out of money. Last week, the program officially ran out of money. Democrats claim on-camera to be fighting for the same people they're holding hostage off-camera. Pelosi and Schumer blocked funding and burned weeks of precious time for America's small businesses.

"I'm ready to move forward with the deal reached today. The House must immediately pass this bill. No more delays. In addition to supporting small businesses, the legislation includes important funding for rural hospitals in Wyoming. I will get them whatever they need to continue their important work."
