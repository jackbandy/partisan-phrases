Barrasso: The Pelosi-Schumer Paycheck Blockade Must End Now


Today, Senator John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, released the following statement after Paycheck Protection Program funding was exhausted following Senate Democrats blocking a unanimous consent request for more funding last week. Senate Democrats had previously unanimously supported funding for this program as part of the CARES Act.

"American workers need their paychecks. The Pelosi-Schumer paycheck blockade must end now. The Paycheck Protection Program has made sure millions of Americans keep getting paid during this crisis. We need further funding to continue this vital work. The program is out of money, and there's no time to delay. The millions of Americans who work for small businesses deserve better than to be used as bargaining chips by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. Republicans are offering a simple solution to keep businesses alive and to keep people on the payroll. Democrats need to stop playing politics with our economic survival."
