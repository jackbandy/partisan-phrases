Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to extend a warm welcome to  His All-Holiness Bartholomew, Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome,  and Ecumenical Patriarch, on the occasion of his official visit to the  United States. His All-Holiness is a respected spiritual leader whose  presence is deeply meaningful to many people across our great Nation.  His visit coincides with his acceptance of the distinguished Templeton  Prize, a testament to his lifelong dedication to advancing spirituality  and humanity.

During his visit, he is scheduled to meet with administration  officials, Members of Congress, distinguished leaders, and  representatives from various faith communities. These meetings provide  a wonderful opportunity to discuss ways to promote our shared values of  faith, peace, and understanding. I hope these meetings will prove to be  productive and insightful for all involved.
