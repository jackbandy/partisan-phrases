Barrasso: Answer Call to Put Aside Partisan Politics, Pass Historic Infrastructure Plan


Today, U.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) released the following statement in response to President Trump's call to pass America's Transportation Infrastructure Act (ATIA) during his State of the Union address. Barrasso is chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW).

"The president spoke loud and clear tonight about putting partisan politics aside to pass a monumental American infrastructure plan," Barrasso said. "This is our moment. We passed a bipartisan bill out of my committee. It's the largest highway infrastructure bill in our history to rebuild our roads, highways, and bridges. Even more important, it cuts red tape so we can build better, smarter, faster, and cheaper.

"Impeachment has been a costly distraction. We should answer the president's call and the call of American workers, to put the partisan fights behind us, and get this done now."

On July 30, 2019, the EPW Committee unanimously advanced S. 2302, America's Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019. The bill authorizes $287 billion over five years, including $259 billion for formula programs to maintain and repair America's roads and bridges. ATIA includes provisions to codify key elements of President Trump's "One Federal Decision" policy to streamline project delivery and federal approvals. The legislation also includes provisions to improve road safety, protect the environment, and grow the economy.
