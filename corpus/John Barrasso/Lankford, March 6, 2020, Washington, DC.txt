Lankford, Inhofe Applaud President's Commitment to Save Blue-Collar Refinery Jobs


Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Barrasso (R-WY), Pat Toomey (R-PA), John Kennedy (R-LA), Mike Lee (R-UT), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) today issued a statement following reports that President Trump will appeal the Tenth Circuit's decision on small refineries:

"We're encouraged by the reports that the administration will appeal the Tenth Circuit's decision on small refineries," the Senators said. "Thousands of blue collar workers' jobs are at stake if the ruling were to stand. We're grateful for President Trump's commitment to the hardworking men and women of small refineries, and look forward to working with the administration to ensure follow through on the President's decision."

This week, Lankford joined multiple Senators in a letter to EPA Administrator Wheeler urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to continue granting relief to small refiners as required by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).
