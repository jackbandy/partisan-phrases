Barrasso Statement on CARES Act


Today, U.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, released the following statement after supporting the passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

 "The American people need relief, and they are watching.

"The twin health care and economic crises have hit our country hard. The CARES Act provides needed funding for health care workers and hospitals caring for coronavirus patients. It brings direct financial relief to families and small businesses.

"This is the largest health care and economic rescue package in the history of our country. It is a rescue operation for the American people.

"I urge the House to get this to the president's desk with all possible speed."

Background:

The CARES Act was written in a bipartisan way and yet was blocked by Senate Democrats twice over the past three days. It is phase III of the Senate's work to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, and provides hundreds of billions of dollars in immediate financial assistance to families, workers, and small businesses. The bill also surges resources to support health care workers in their response to the coronavirus. This follows over $8 billion in emergency medical funding, and the passage of the Families First bill last week, which provided free testing and paid sick leave for those who need it.
