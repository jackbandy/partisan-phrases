Barrasso Statement on Coronavirus Emergency Funding


Today, U.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) issued the following statement after the Senate voted to approve more than $8 billion in funding for the United States to combat the coronavirus. 

"The coronavirus emergency funding provides a surge of more than $8 billion in resources to combat the virus. That is what experts have told us they need for research efforts, vaccine development and treatment. It also includes millions of dollars for response and prevention efforts in Wyoming. We have worked together -- Republican and Democrat, House and Senate -- to make sure America is well-prepared to fight this virus. I look forward to the president's quick signature on this measure."
