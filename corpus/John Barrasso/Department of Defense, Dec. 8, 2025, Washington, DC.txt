Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor just having listened  to the minority leader talk about our nominees for various positions in  the Trump administration, and I am happy to report that this month,  December of 2025, we will confirm nearly 100 more of President Trump's  qualified nominees. This is going to bring the total number of nominees  confirmed this year to nearly 420--we will surpass 400--and this far  surpasses the number that Joe Biden confirmed in his first year in  office.

One of these highly qualified nominees is Arjun Mody, whom I would  like to talk about now.

Arjun is an extraordinary leader and a trusted friend. Arjun has been  nominated to serve as Deputy Commissioner of the Social Security  Administration. Now, in choosing Arjun, President Trump has chosen the  very best. I have known him for 15 years, and he has helped shape my  work in the Senate. He ran three of my Senate leadership offices, and  in each one, he transformed how we served the Members of this body.

Prior to that, Arjun worked for Senator Elizabeth Dole of the  Presiding Officer's home State of North Carolina and for Senator Kay  Bailey Hutchison of Texas.

When you hire staff, you need people you can trust completely. I saw  Arjun earn that trust in moments both big and small.

Here is the truth about Arjun: If something needs to get done, he is  going to get it done with excellence. He doesn't just know policy and  process; he knows and understands people. He doesn't just build high- impact teams; he builds loyalty among the teams. He doesn't just work  hard; he works well with everyone.

When the stakes are the highest, he always delivers results. I have  watched Arjun take on the toughest challenges and find solutions that  other people have missed. That is exactly what Social Security needs  right now in our Nation because for 90 years, Americans have relied on  Social Security--not just for income but for the independence these  people have earned. They count on it to keep a roof over their heads  and to put food on the table. That promise matters, and it needs  leaders who understand both its importance and its challenges.

Arjun is going to modernize the Social Security Administration, he is  going to help strengthen its core mission, and he is going to ensure  that payments are timely, accurate, and secure. At the same time, he is  going to work with this committee, with the Senate, and all across the  government. Most importantly, he will never forget that behind every  case number is a person and that every beneficiary matters, whether  they are a senior, whether they are a survivor, or whether they are  someone with a disability. Social Security works because Americans can  trust it month after month, year after year. With Arjun, that trust is  in capable hands.

I have trusted Arjun to lead my staff, and the President has trusted  him to strengthen Social Security. Now I urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to trust him with their vote.
