"America's small businesses are the backbone of our nation, but they face a life-or-death situation in the midst of the #coronavirus. Starting today, small businesses can take part in the #PaycheckProtectionProgram that the #CARESAct established.

The #PaycheckProtectionProgram provides eight weeks of cash-flow assistance to small businesses who maintain their payroll during this emergency. There is nothing more pro-worker than keeping workers on payroll, & that is exactly what this program does."
