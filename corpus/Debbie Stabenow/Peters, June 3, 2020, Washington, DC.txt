Peters, Stabenow Announce Over $5.7 Million for Transportation Services in Battle Creek, Ottawa County Through the CARES Act


U.S. Senators Gary Peters (MI) and Debbie Stabenow (MI) today announced that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is providing the City of Battle Creek a $4 million grant and the Harbor Transit Multi-Modal Transportation System in Ottawa County a $1.79 million grant. Peters and Stabenow helped secure this funding as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The funds will help ensure that these transit services will remain operational during the Coronavirus pandemic.

"While the Coronavirus has upended our daily lives, Michiganders still rely on public transit -- whether it be for getting to work or buying essentials like groceries and medicine," said Senator Peters, a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. "These funds will help ensure transportation services can continue supporting critical functions in both Battle Creek and in Ottawa County."

"Public transportation is critical to get people to and from the doctor, grocery stores, and work, especially during this public health crisis," said Senator Stabenow. "This funding will help the City of Battle Creek and Harbor Transit Multi Modal Transportation System continue to provide reliable transportation to families and essential workers in their communities."
