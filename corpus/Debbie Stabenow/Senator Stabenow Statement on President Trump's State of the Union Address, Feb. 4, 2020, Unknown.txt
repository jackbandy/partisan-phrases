Senator Stabenow Statement on President Trump's State of the Union Address


U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) released a statement following President Trump's State of the Union Address:

 

"Contrary to the President's remarks this evening, this Administration has been relentless in its efforts to take health care away from Michigan families. Health care is personal--not political. That's especially true for Michigan's Andrea Pietrowsky, who joined me tonight as my guest at the State of the Union. Her 5-year-old daughter, Louisa, was born with a severe congenital heart defect and has undergone three major surgeries. Without the Affordable Care Act, Louisa would likely be uninsurable and her family would face bankruptcy. Andrea is concerned about her family's future and the future for families across our state. Health care is a basic human right, and I remain focused on protecting care and lowering costs for Michigan families."
