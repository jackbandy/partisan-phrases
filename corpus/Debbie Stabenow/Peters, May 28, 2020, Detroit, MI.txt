Peters, Stabenow Announce Over $64 Million in Funding for the Detroit Department of Transportation Through the CARES Act


U.S. Senators Gary Peters (MI) and Debbie Stabenow (MI) today announced that the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT) will receive a $64,300,000 grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Peters and Stabenow helped secure this funding as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The funds will allow the DDOT to more frequently disinfect buses, provide additional personal protective equipment to employees and continue transit service throughout Metro Detroit during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"This federal funding we helped secure will ensure that critical transportation services in Detroit can continue running during this unprecedented crisis. It will also ensure there's more personal protective equipment for workers and resources to clean buses," said Senator Peters, a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. "I'm going to continue working to ensure that Michigan not only has the resources needed to get through this pandemic, but also that essential workers receive the compensation they've earned for putting their health at risk."

"The leadership and workers of the Detroit Department of Transportation work hard to make sure that people can get to their jobs, doctor appointments, and grocery stores," said Senator Stabenow. "This funding will make sure that they're able to continue to safely provide these vital services for their community while keeping transit workers and riders safe through cleaning and more personal protective equipment."
