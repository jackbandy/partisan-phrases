"I just voted for the CARES Act to address the impact of the #COVID19 crisis. I voted to put Michigan families, workers, & health providers first. We came together in a bipartisan way to provide critical health care funding & economic stability to families.

This bill includes major health care investments to tackle the #coronavirus pandemic and help provide the masks and other personal protective equipment our medical workers need to stay safe on the front line of this crisis.

It also ensures that Michigan families and workers have financial stability during this crisis with continued income, no matter what your job is.  This crisis is impacting every family across our state. I know that Michigan is strong and we will weather this crisis together."
