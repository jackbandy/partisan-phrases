"Testing saves lives. And a comprehensive strategy for rapid testing is essential in order to get our economy going again and allowing Americans to get back to work."

"Today @SenateDems released a report highlighting that the U.S. is leading the world in confirmed #COVID19 cases and deaths but lags in testing. Without a national testing strategy, we've left our loved ones vulnerable to #COVID19."

"When compared to countries like South Korea, the impact of the lack of a national testing strategy is obvious. With no plan, the spread of the virus has not been controlled and cases have dramatically spiked."

"We are only testing 150,000 people per day. Experts say that the U.S. needs at least 500,000 tests per day to control this outbreak."

"Democrats are pushing for a national testing strategy so that we can protect health care providers and contain the spread of the disease.   With widespread, rapid testing, we'll save lives."
