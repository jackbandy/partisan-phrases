Stabenow Statement on President Trump's Decision on Fuel Efficiency Standards


Senator Debbie Stabenow released the following statement following the Trump Administration's announcement to roll back automobile fuel efficiency standards.

 

"The Administration has failed to bring people together and put forth a rule that is good for our auto industry, workers, consumers, and the environment. Instead, they are taking us backwards. This rule creates more uncertainty for our auto industry and makes it more difficult for us to compete in the global market. We need a strong, achievable, national standard that maintains an urgent focus on combatting the climate crisis and tackling fuel efficiency. This rule takes us in the wrong direction."
