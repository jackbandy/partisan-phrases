Senator Stabenow Announces Over $54 Million in New Funding For Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics Across Michigan


U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow today announced that 18 Michigan community mental health organizations have been selected as Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. Michigan will receive $54,452,014 in new funding for the clinics. This is a result of the passage of the Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act by Senator Stabenow and Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO). This law established new Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, which are transforming the way behavioral health and addiction treatment services are delivered across the country. These clinics are required to provide a comprehensive set of services including 24/7/365 crisis services; outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment services; immediate screenings, risk assessments, and diagnoses; and care coordination with emergency rooms, law enforcement, and veteran groups.

 

Stabenow secured $200 million in the FY 2020 appropriations bill and $250 million in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act for the national Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic Expansion Grants program. This program is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. To date, Senator Stabenow has secured over $88 million in funding for Michigan community mental health centers.

 

"The COVID-19 crisis has shown a spotlight on the urgent need to fund community mental health and addiction services. Now, more Michigan families who are struggling during this pandemic will get critical behavioral health services they need close to home," said Senator Stabenow. "This funding provides a major boost in services to individuals in our state during this difficult time and provides momentum to fully fund certified behavioral health services in our country."
