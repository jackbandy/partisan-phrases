Ranking Member Stabenow Statement on USDA Appeal of Harmful Food Assistance Rule


U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, & Forestry, today released a statement regarding the Trump Administration's decision to appeal a court ruling that has halted a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) nutrition rule. The rule would make harmful changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

"It is outrageous that the Trump Administration is trying to take food assistance away from families when millions of Americans are out of work and struggling to put food on the table. Republicans and Democrats have already overwhelmingly rejected this callous proposal during Farm Bill negotiations. Instead of wasting time and resources in a time of crisis, the Trump Administration should focus on bipartisan solutions that feed families in need."

Congress considered and chose not to include similar changes to SNAP in the bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill. In fact, an amendment to SNAP was rejected by the House of Representatives by a vote of 83-330 in 2018. A similar amendment proposed in the Senate was rejected by a bipartisan vote of 68-30. After the rule was proposed last year, 47 Senators from both parties urged the Administration to withdrawal the rule.
