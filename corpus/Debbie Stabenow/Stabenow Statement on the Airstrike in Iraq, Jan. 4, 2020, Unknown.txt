Stabenow Statement on the Airstrike in Iraq


U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow released the following statement after the Trump Administration conducted a deadly airstrike at the Baghdad International Airport killing Qassem Soleimani and high-level Iranian military officials.

 

"Soleimani was responsible for the death of many American service members and inciting chaos throughout the Middle East. However, a single action without a meaningful plan will lead to more risk for Americans at home and abroad. The Administration is required to provide a clear rationale to Congress for its actions. They also must consult with Congressional leaders on a meaningful strategy to protect American lives and interests around the world."
