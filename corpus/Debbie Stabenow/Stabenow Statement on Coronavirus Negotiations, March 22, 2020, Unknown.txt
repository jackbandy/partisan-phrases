Stabenow Statement on Coronavirus Negotiations


"We are working night and day to come to an agreement on the most effective way to address the overwhelming and immediate needs in this crisis. While the need is urgent, we have to get this right because too much is at stake. We can't lose sight of the fact that this is a public health crisis first. Our most urgent priority must be to address the need for an immediate infusion of resources to fully support our hospitals and brave health care providers. In addition, any economic package must put the needs of Michigan families, our workers, and small businesses first. I intend to stand strong in these negotiations on their behalf."
