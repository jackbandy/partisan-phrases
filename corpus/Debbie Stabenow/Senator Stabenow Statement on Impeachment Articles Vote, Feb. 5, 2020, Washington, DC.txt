Senator Stabenow Statement on Impeachment Articles Vote


U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) released a statement after voting to convict on the two articles of impeachment:

 

"Today was a serious and pivotal moment in our nation's history. I am disheartened that partisanship won over the willingness to have a fair, bipartisan trial with credible witnesses and documents. Common sense says that if President Trump's top staff members had evidence of his innocence, he would have insisted that we hear from them, as we should. Unfortunately, the exact opposite happened, which only strengthens the case presented by the House of Representatives.

 

"I am also deeply concerned that the message being sent by this trial is that this President, and future Presidents, are above the law. That, of course, is the opposite of what should be true in our democracy. Despite the arguments put forward by the White House, in America, no President is above the law, and it is illegal to accept help from a foreign country to influence an election. 

 

"We are here because President Trump used his power as President of the United States to pressure a foreign nation to help him with his upcoming re-election. Ukraine is at war with Russia, and our ongoing military assistance is not only critical to them, but it is vital to our own nation's security. Holding up this aid for the sake of politics was a clear abuse of power.

 

"Today's vote and President Trump's actions put our 2020 U.S. elections at even greater risk of foreign interference.

 

"As we move forward, all of us should look for common ground on the things we care deeply about in Michigan and do our part to lessen the divide within our families and our communities.

 

"I intend to continue to focus on the issues that bring us together -- protecting our Great Lakes, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and helping create good-paying jobs. Together, we can move forward in a positive way for our families."
