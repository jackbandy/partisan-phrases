This bill gives Michigan the resources and flexibility needed to provide unemployment benefits to laid off workers and other workers who may need income assistance during this crisis.

To apply for unemployment benefits visit http://Michigan.gov/UIA or call 1-866-500-0017.

Michigan will also receive almost $850 million to improve health care services through Medicaid, depending on the length of the pandemic.

For more information on Medicaid coverage, visit http://Michigan.gov/Medicaid."
