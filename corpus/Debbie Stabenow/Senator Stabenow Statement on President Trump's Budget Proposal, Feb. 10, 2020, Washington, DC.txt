Senator Stabenow Statement on President Trump's Budget Proposal


U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) released the following statement on the Trump Administration's budget proposal:

"A budget is a statement of our nation's values and priorities, and President Trump fails to deliver for Michigan families. After pledging to protect health care in his State of the Union, his budget today cuts Medicaid and Medicare, which covers millions of Michigan families. His budget also fails to adequately invest in the Soo Locks and puts our Great Lakes at risk of invasive species like Asian carp by not investing in the Brandon Road Lock and Dam project. President Trump's budget fails to meet our Michigan test for what is important."
