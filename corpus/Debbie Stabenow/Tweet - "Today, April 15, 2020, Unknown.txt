I'm honored to call @JoeBiden my friend. Working side by side with someone can tell you a lot about who they are and what they care about. In the U.S. Senate and as Vice President, Joe always, always put workers and their families first.

.@JoeBiden has been there for Michigan and now we need to come together and be there for him this November. I'm going to do everything I can to help him win and I'm counting on your help!"
