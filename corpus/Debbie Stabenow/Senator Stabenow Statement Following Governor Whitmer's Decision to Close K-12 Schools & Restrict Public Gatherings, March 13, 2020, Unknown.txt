Senator Stabenow Statement Following Governor Whitmer's Decision to Close K-12 Schools & Restrict Public Gatherings


U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement after the Governor's decision to close all K-12 school buildings and restrict public gatherings. Stabenow has oversight of school meals and child nutrition as Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.

 

"Governor Whitmer has taken decisive action to keep our children, families and the public safe. I spoke with our State Superintendent, Dr. Michael Rice, this morning and have been working closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ensure there are no administrative obstacles in the way to make sure our children continue to receive healthy meals while our schools are closed.

 

"I am also working with my colleagues on emergency legislation to help Michigan families impacted by this crisis. We need paid sick leave, free coronavirus testing for anyone who needs it, food assistance for families in need, support for small businesses, and other resources to help families during this crisis." --U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
