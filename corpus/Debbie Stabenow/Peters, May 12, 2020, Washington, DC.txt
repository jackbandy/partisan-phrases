Peters, Stabenow Announce $19 Million in Funding for Flint Mass Transportation Authority


U.S. Senators Gary Peters (MI) and Debbie Stabenow (MI) today announced that the Flint Mass Transportation Authority (MTA) would receive a $19 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Peters and Stabenow helped secure this funding as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The funds will help ensure that Flint MTA services remain operational for the duration of the Coronavirus pandemic.

"The Coronavirus pandemic has upended everyone's daily lives. Public transit is vital towards ensuring frontline workers can get to their jobs and Michiganders can still buy essentials, including groceries and medicine," said Senator Peters, a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. "I applaud this funding, which will support transportation in Genesee County and is especially critical during this unprecedented crisis. I'm going to continue working to ensure that Michigan not only has the resources needed to get through this pandemic, but also that frontline workers receive the compensation they've earned for working despite the risks and have the personal protection equipment to protect themselves."

"Public transportation is critical to get people to and from the doctor, grocery stores, and work, especially during this public health crisis," said Senator Stabenow. "This funding will help Flint Mass Transportation Authority continue to provide reliable transportation to families and essential workers in Flint."
