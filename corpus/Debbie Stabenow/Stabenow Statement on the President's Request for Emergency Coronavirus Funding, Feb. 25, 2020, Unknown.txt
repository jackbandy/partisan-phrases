Stabenow Statement on the President's Request for Emergency Coronavirus Funding


U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow released the following statement in response to President Trump's coronavirus budget request: 

 

"I am deeply concerned that President Trump has no plan to fight the serious coronavirus crisis. President Trump's funding request to address coronavirus is overdue and inadequate. This comes a few weeks after his administration proposed a 16 percent cut to the Centers for Disease Control, a critical leader in fighting infectious diseases. Cuts to essential programs like the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund leave Americans vulnerable and unprepared. We need real leadership from the White House to work on a bipartisan basis to keep our loved ones safe and prevent the global spread of this disease."
