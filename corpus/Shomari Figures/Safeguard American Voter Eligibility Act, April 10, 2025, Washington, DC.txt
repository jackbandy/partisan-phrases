Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act


Mr. FIGURES. Mr. Speaker, all of my colleagues today are speaking  about this bill, and it is personal to me because I represent Alabama.  I represent the birthplace of the civil rights movement.

I would be remiss not to mention that election integrity was not an  issue that my colleagues had been pushing until Donald Trump told them  that they should be pushing this issue.

Americans have confidence in elections. For me, it is about too many  people doing too many things too courageously for me to be able to  stand here today. There are names like James Reeb, Jimmie Lee Jackson,  Viola Liuzzo, Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner.  These are people who died for me to be here today. Congressman John  Lewis, who most of you served with, died for me to be here today.

This bill would make it tougher than it has ever been in American  history to register to vote at a time when we have the technological  ability to be able to verify election eligibility, but we don't want to  do that. We want to make it tougher for people to actually get  registered to vote, and that is not what we should be doing. We should  be making it easier for people to vote.
