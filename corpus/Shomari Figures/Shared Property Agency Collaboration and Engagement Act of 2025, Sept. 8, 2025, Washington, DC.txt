Shared Property Agency Collaboration and Engagement Act of 2025


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695011/shared-property-agency-collaboration-and-engagement-act-of-2025


Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3424, the Shared Property Agency  Collaboration and Engagement Act of 2025, the SPACE Act.

This bill requires the Administrator of the GSA to develop new  criteria to help expand the use of office space sharing for Federal  agencies. By sharing amenities, space, and services, Federal agencies  can use shared-space arrangements to make the most effective use of  government-owned real estate. This bill is about efficiency.

A pilot program conducted by GSA allowed six offices across the  country to provide ready-to-use spaces conducive to cross-government  collaboration while saving taxpayer dollars by reducing operational  costs for Federal agencies.

This legislation will allow GSA to expand on these efforts by  establishing standards for shared office spaces and measuring the  success of this initiative.

Mr. Speaker, I support this bill to ensure that we are good stewards  of taxpayer funding when it comes to Federal real estate, and I  encourage all Members to do the same.

Mr. FIGURES. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3424, the SPACE Act. I  encourage my colleagues to do the same, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
