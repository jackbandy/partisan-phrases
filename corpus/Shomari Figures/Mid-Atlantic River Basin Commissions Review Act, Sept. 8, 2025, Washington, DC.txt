Mid-Atlantic River Basin Commissions Review Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3428, a bill to direct the GAO  to review the three Mid-Atlantic River Basin Commissions and report on  the practices and Federal responsibilities of each commission.

The Mid-Atlantic River Basin Commissions serve an important role in  the region by managing, protecting, and improving their respective  river basins.  The commissions were created to consolidate a complex web of State,  interstate, and Federal efforts into one.

For example, the history of the Potomac Basin Commission reminds us  how the commission was formed in response to extreme pollution levels  in our Nation's River that required a regional, cooperative response by  all jurisdictions.

Similarly, the Delaware River Basin Compact, signed in 1961 by  President John F. Kennedy and the then-Governors of Delaware, New  Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York, created a commission with the force  of law to oversee a unified approach to managing the river without  regard to political boundaries.

As a result of these commissions, water quality on the Delaware,  Potomac, and Susquehanna Rivers has, in many ways, vastly improved, but  threats such as population increases, land use changes, and the growth  of impervious surfaces, chemical contaminants, and nutrient and  sediment enrichment still require focused, regional attention.

This GAO study will review these partnerships and how  responsibilities are split between the commissions and the Federal  agencies, as well as examine the transparency and communication  practices of the commissions.

Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3428 and urge my colleagues to do the  same.

Mr. FIGURES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for  his leadership on this issue. I support H.R. 3428, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same. I yield back the balance of my time.
