Establishing New Zip Codes


Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 672 to designate  single, unique ZIP Codes for communities across the United States.

H.R. 672, which includes the community of Mills, Wyoming, would  resolve longstanding issues that have continually impacted a host of  services, ranging from the delivery of mail to confusion for the local  fire department and utilities providers, while also complicating  economic development.

With mail ZIP Code designation intertwined with Casper, Wyoming, the  city has struggled with timely mail delivery, loss of property tax  revenue and franchise fees, and incorrect Census counts. Each of these  issues poses significant challenges for Mills as it continues to grow,  develop, and attract new residents across Wyoming and beyond.

Passage of this bill will go a long way to correct this oversight,  not only for Mills but for communities nationwide.

The city of Mills has been a tireless advocate for this legislation,  and I am immensely proud to be a cosponsor.

I thank Representative Diaz-Balart and Chairman Comer for their  steadfast leadership on this critically important issue, and I support  this legislation to resolve these issues for my constituents in Mills.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 672.
