Recognizing Lou Taubert Ranch Outfitters


Ms. HAGEMAN. I rise today to recognize and congratulate Lou Taubert  Ranch Outfitters of Casper, Wyoming, for being named one of the 50 best  clothing stores in America by The New York Times.

Lou Taubert Ranch Outfitters first opened its doors in 1919 after  being founded by C. W. Taubert, an immigrant from Germany who grew  enamored with the cowboy spirit and the allure of the West.

From its beginnings as a hardware store catering to the local  agricultural community, Lou Taubert has grown to be a cornerstone of  the Casper community. Now, over 100 years later, it does not matter  whether you are a rancher, a cowboy, or a tourist passing through, you  are treated to the authentic spirit of the West at Lou Taubert's.

Please join me in recognizing and celebrating the accomplishments of  Casper, Wyoming's Lou Taubert Ranch Outfitters.
