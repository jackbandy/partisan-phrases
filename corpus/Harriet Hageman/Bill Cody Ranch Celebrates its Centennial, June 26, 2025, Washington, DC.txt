Bill Cody Ranch Celebrates its Centennial


Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable  Wyoming institution, the Bill Cody Ranch, as it celebrates its  centennial. For 100 years, the Bill Cody Ranch has welcomed guests from  across the country, giving them a taste of the American West.

As a flagbearer of Wyoming's dude ranch community, the Bill Cody  Ranch is truly a remarkable testament to the enduring cowboy spirit  that we hold near and dear to our hearts in Wyoming.

The Bill Cody Ranch continues as a living legacy of stewardship,  hospitality, and dedication to our way of life. Please join me in  congratulating the ranch and the many families who have called it home  on reaching this marvelous milestone.

Their commitment to preserving Wyoming's heritage is something that  we are all proud of. I thank them, and congratulate them once again on  this historic milestone.
