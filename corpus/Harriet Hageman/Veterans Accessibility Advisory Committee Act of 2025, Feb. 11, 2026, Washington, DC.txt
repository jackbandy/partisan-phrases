Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025

Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 1383,  the SAVE America Act, which I am proud to cosponsor and hope will pass  the House floor today.

I also note that I think it is shockingly racist and sexist for my  colleagues on the other side to believe that we are not smart enough to  figure out how to get IDs. I can assure my colleagues that we are, even  if we get married.

The SAVE America Act requires individuals to provide documented proof  of U.S. citizenship along with a valid photo ID when registering to  vote. This commonsense legislation strengthens election integrity  through practical measures, including voter ID requirements and  safeguards to prevent noncitizens from voting.

The SAVE America Act is particularly important as we continue to  address the consequences of the Biden-Harris border crisis, which led  to millions of individuals entering the country unlawfully.

Secure elections are fundamental to maintaining public confidence in  our democratic process. The State of Wyoming has already taken steps to  implement many of the reforms outlined in this bill, demonstrating that  securing our elections must be a national priority.

I thank the bill's sponsors, Representative Roy and Senator Lee, as  well as Chairman Steil, for their leadership on this critical issue.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of  the SAVE America Act.
