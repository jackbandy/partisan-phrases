Mrs. McIVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Sahli Negassi, a  NJ-10 student at West Orange high school who received a perfect score  on the SAT this year. Less than 1 percent of SAT test-takers earn a  perfect score each year, and Sahli's accomplishment is nothing short of  extraordinary. His SAT preparation was largely self-directed, relying  on free resources, and using his time and determination to study for  the exam. Beyond  academics, he is deeply involved in extracurricular activities at West  Orange High School. He has been a dedicated member of the cross-country  and track teams since seventh grade and spent two seasons on the color  guard. Sahli is also the president of the math team, chapter president  of the National Honor Society, a varsity chess team member and part of  the Royal Strings ensemble. His involvement in multiple activities and  honor societies speaks to his well-rounded excellence. After graduating  high school, he hopes to attend Harvard and study law. Any school would  be lucky to have such a bright young mind.

What an incredible accomplishment and a shining example of New Jersey  excellence. I Congratulate Sahli. He makes New Jersey proud.
