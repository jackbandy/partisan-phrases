Recognizing the Visit of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mrs. McIVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend a warm welcome to  His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, an esteemed leader  of the Eastern Orthodox Church, upon his visit to the United States.

For more than three decades, Patriarch Bartholomew has stood as a  moral voice in times of global challenge. When Europe faced the refugee  crisis, he joined hands with Pope Francis to affirm the dignity and  humanity of those fleeing Syria, Africa, and beyond in search of safety  and a better life. In an increasingly divided world, he has worked  tirelessly to build bridges--fostering interfaith dialogue among  Christians, Jews, Muslims, and people of all faith traditions. As the  global climate crisis deepens, he has reminded us that creation itself  is a sacred trust, urging us to honor and protect the natural world  with which God has blessed us. For this leadership, he is being awarded  the prestigious Templeton Prize during his visit.

Patriarch Bartholomew's spiritual guidance has inspired Orthodox  Christians across the globe. In my own district, he has been a shepherd  to the congregation of St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church in Union,  New Jersey. Under his leadership, the St. Demetrios community has  flourished as an example of faith in action--welcoming neighbors from  every walk of life to their Annual Greek Cultural Festival and offering  vital community services year-round.

It is therefore my great honor to join my constituents and colleagues  in welcoming His All-Holiness, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, to our  Nation. We are confident that his visit will be both meaningful and  successful.
