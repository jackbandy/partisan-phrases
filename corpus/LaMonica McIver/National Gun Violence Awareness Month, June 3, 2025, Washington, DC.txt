Mrs. McIVER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on an issue that has devastated  families and communities across this country: gun violence.

For years, gun violence has been an unchecked epidemic. In the Black  community, the toll has been heartbreaking and more deadly. Still, very  little meaningful action has been taken to stop the hurt.

Our communities continue to be ravaged, while too many remain silent.  We cannot continue to treat this as normal. There is nothing normal  about burying children. There is nothing normal about the weapons that  turn schools, churches, and neighborhoods into battlegrounds. I am here  for the next generation to say: They deserve better than this.

They deserve a future where they never have to say enough is enough  because we will have already done what is necessary.

I, along with my CBC colleagues, will not stay silent. We will  continue to demand comprehensive gun reform, background checks, closing  loopholes, and a ban on assault weapons because our lives and our  children's lives depend on it.

The time for reform is now. Let's do what is right. Let's do what is  just. Let's do what is necessary before another name is added to  another list.
