Champions of Newark Board of Education's Holiday Basketball Tournament


Mrs. McIVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to say Go Bulldogs and Go Jaguars,  better known as Malcolm X Shabazz High School's boys basketball team  and Arts High School's girls basketball team, the champions of Newark  Board of Education's Annual Holiday Basketball Tournament.

I wish I had been there to see Arts High School's girls basketball  team secure their first holiday tournament title and to see Malcolm X  Shabazz' boys basketball team secure another win to keep them  undefeated, but, even though I wasn't there, I am still cheering all  the way from D.C. for a win that made all of Newark proud.
