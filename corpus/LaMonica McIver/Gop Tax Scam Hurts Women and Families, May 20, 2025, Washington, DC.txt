Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Mrs. McIVER. Mr. Speaker, ``I probably wouldn't be alive because I  wouldn't have been able to afford [my] medicine.'' That is what  Dominique from East Orange, New Jersey, said about Medicaid.

Dominique is one of the 100,000 Americans who lives with the sickle  cell disease, and she is one of the millions of Americans who would be  devastated by Republicans gutting Medicaid.

We need to understand that the suffering they are going to create has  a face, and it is Dominique's.

When she was just 6 years old, Dominique was diagnosed with sickle  cell disease. That is also when her aunt enrolled her in Medicaid.

Medicaid didn't mean that life was easy--Dominique spent much of her  time in hospitals and visiting doctors--but it made life possible.

With Medicaid, she is able to see a hematologist regularly, receive  the appropriate equipment and medications to make living at home  possible, seek mental health care due to the toll of living with this  disease, and receive treatment for any potential emergencies.

Dominique gets to live knowing the care she deserves is within her  reach, in her own words, thanks to Medicaid.
