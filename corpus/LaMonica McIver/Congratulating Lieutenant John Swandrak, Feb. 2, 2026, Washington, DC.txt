Congratulating Lieutenant John Swandrak


Mrs. McIVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Lieutenant John  Swandrak on 30 years of service to the Cranford Police Department and  wish Lieutenant Swandrak the best on his retirement.

His decades of service in patrol, community policing, and the  detective bureau allowed him to build invaluable relationships and  strengthen the bond between the police department and the Cranford  community.

That was demonstrated in profound ways, particularly during his son  Nicholas' battle with leukemia. Cranford Police Department, Cranford  Fire Department, and countless neighbors rallied around the Swandrak  family reflecting the same support and compassion he consistently  showed others.

Lieutenant Swandrak is foundational to the fabric of Cranford, and he  is leaving a legacy of service, fairness, and true community  partnership for all of New Jersey to follow.

On behalf of the New Jersey 10th District, I congratulate Lieutenant  Swandrak on a job well done.
