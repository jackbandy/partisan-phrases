Mrs. McIVER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Bynum and Figures  for organizing this Special Order hour.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate Black History Month and the profound  and vibrant legacy of the many Black Americans who have made our  country.

Black history is a living, breathing narrative that enriches our  Nation and influences our daily lives. It is a powerful testament to  resilience, creativity, and the pursuit of justice.

We think about those who came before us and fought for freedom,  trailblazers like Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth, whose voices  paved the way.

As only the second Black woman ever elected to Congress to represent  New Jersey, I stand on the shoulders of giants, including my colleague,  mentor, and friend, Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman. We both are  here because of the path that leaders like Shirley Chisholm blazed  before us.

With the highest ever membership to the Congressional Black Caucus,  62 members strong, we have never been stronger. We represent the dreams  of our ancestors, and those dreams are in danger by this  administration's hateful policies that hurt Black people nationwide.

Our hard-fought progress is threatened by the racist agenda pushed  forward by this administration, but we will not back down. In the words  of the late, great John Lewis: ``We have been too quiet for too long.  There comes a time when you have to say something. You have to make a  little noise. You have to move your feet. This is the time.''

Together, we must make a little noise and create good trouble to  protect the progress we have fought so hard for. Together, we can  ensure that the stories and contributions of our community continue to  inspire and uplift future generations.
