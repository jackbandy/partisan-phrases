Mrs. McIVER. Mr. Speaker, small businesses are the backbone of our  local economy. COVID-19 shuttered the doors of many beloved local  businesses, and many more are still continuing on a path of financial  recovery. Now, with sky-high prices and rising inflation, small  businesses need our support more than ever.

Today, I join Representative Chu to reintroduce the Investing in Main  Street Act of 2025 to increase access to capital for small businesses  who need it. This bill amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958  by increasing the amount that certain banks and savings associations  may invest in small business investment companies from 5 percent to 15  percent.

As the ranking member on the Small Business Subcommittee on Economic  Growth, Tax, and Capital Access, I know firsthand the challenges  businessowners face. Small businesses contribute so much to our  communities. In fact, they make up over 40 percent of our Nation's GDP,  and it is time we give back to our hardworking businessowners.

These additional investments will create more jobs, allow existing  businesses to expand and thrive, and reduce barriers to entry for small  businesses looking to get off the ground. I am grateful to  Representative Chu for leading the charge on this essential improvement  to SBIC funding, and I am proud to co-lead this crucial bill.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Williams and my ranking member,  Representative Velazquez. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
