Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 980.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and my friend and colleague from  Wisconsin (Mr. Van Orden) for including my bill, H.R. 913, the  Streamlining Aviation for Eligible Veterans Act, in the text of this  bill.

This bill will make meaningful improvements to the way that the VR&E  program serves our disabled veterans, and my section of the bill will  enable those veterans to use their VR&E benefits to pursue vocational  flight training.

Mr. Speaker, as you know, we have a nationwide pilot shortage, and  our veterans make excellent candidates for pilots, having been trained  in a highly technical environment and being trained to follow the rules  and being able to absorb all of the knowledge necessary to be an  exceptional pilot.

Mr. Speaker, there currently are impediments for VR&E benefits being  used in vocational flight training. These benefits are intended, as  currently written, to be used in programs that are degree granting. As  we all know, earning a college degree has nothing to do necessarily  with learning how to fly an aircraft.

This bill will improve that section by granting the VA the  flexibility to have veterans pursue vocational flight training outside  of degree-granting programs.

Mr. Speaker, that will not only incentivize our servicemen and -women  to become pilots and to embark on new careers, but it will also help to  solve the nationwide pilot shortage in our country. Most importantly,  it puts our veterans first.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 980.
