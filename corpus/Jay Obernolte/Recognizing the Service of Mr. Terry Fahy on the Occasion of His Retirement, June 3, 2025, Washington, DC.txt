Recognizing the Service of Mr. Terry Fahy on the Occasion of His Retirement


Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I use today to recognize Terry Fahy who  is retiring from his position as Vice President and General Manager of  the Salem Media Group in Los Angeles after forty-three years of  dedicated service.

After earning his bachelor's degree in English Literature from the  University of California, Santa Barbara, Terry became increasingly  drawn to the copywriting and music industry. Born into a family of  salesmen, Terry began his career in broadcast as a sales representative  for two stations in Santa Barbara--99.9 KTYD-FM and 990 KBLS-AM. As a  testament to his sales development, leadership, and organizational  skills, Terry also led the sales and marketing department at the number  one Christian Teaching and Talk station in the nation.

Throughout his successful career, Terry and his broadcast stations  have earned numerous accolades, including the Marconi Radio Religious  and Gospel Station of the Year in 1995, the National Religious  Broadcasters' (NAB) Station of the Year in 2000, and Radio Ink  Magazine's Best Radio Manager in 2022. In addition to these impressive  awards, Terry served as board chair of the California Broadcasters  Association and executive committee and board chair of the Southern  California Broadcasters Association.

Beyond his service to the Salem Media Group, Terry is a devoted  husband to his wife, Cindy, father to twin boys, Garrett and Brian, and  grandfather to his six grandchildren He is also a proud member of the  Church at Rocky Peak.

Heather and I thank Terry for his years of service, and we wish him  and his family well as they enter this well-earned next stage of life.  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Terry Fahy and  celebrating his retirement.
