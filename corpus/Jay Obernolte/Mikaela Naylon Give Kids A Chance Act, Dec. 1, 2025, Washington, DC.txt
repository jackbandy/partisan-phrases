Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Georgia, for recognizing me.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support as both a member of the Health  Subcommittee and a proud cosponsor of this bill, H.R. 1262, the Give  Kids a Chance Act.

Mr. Speaker, we live in the most technologically advanced society in  the history of human civilization, and modern medicine has recently  come up  with amazing solutions and cures for many of the physical ailments that  have afflicted humanity.

Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, we have many rare pediatric diseases for  which there is no cure. While we are researching the cures for those  diseases, thousands and thousands of children continue to suffer.

Mr. Speaker, we need to give every priority and do everything we  possibly can to speed up the delivery of these treatments for rare  pediatric diseases, and that is what this bill is all about. The Give  Kids a Chance Act will reauthorize the FDA's Priority Review Voucher  system to speed the research and development of these technologies and  innovative treatments and bring them to market. It also clarifies the  FDA's authority over expediting these therapies and reauthorizes needed  funding for the NIH to fund research and development into these cures.

Mr. Speaker, this bill will help us finally bring solutions to these  thousands of suffering children.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my bipartisan cosponsors for their hard work on  this bill. I urge this body to pass it this evening and urge its speedy  consideration in the Senate.
