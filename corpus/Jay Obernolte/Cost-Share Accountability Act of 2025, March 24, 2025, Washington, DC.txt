Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise in support of my  bill, H.R. 359, the Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2025. I thank my  colleague and my friend from Illinois, Congressman Bill Foster, for  leading this bipartisan piece of legislation with me.

Mr. Speaker, cutting-edge research and development and energy  technology is often catalyzed through grants awarded by the Department  of Energy. Normally those grants come with a cost-sharing requirement  usually of around 50 percent. That is important because it makes sure  that the entity that the grant is awarded to has some skin in the game,  and it also ensures the taxpayers get the best value for their dollar  when that grant is performed. However, the Department of Energy has the  ability under Federal law to waive or reduce that grant amount.

It has become clear in recent years that it is not transparent when  the DOE uses that authority. It is hampering our ability as Members of  Congress to provide the oversight necessary into the activities of the  DOE.

This bill will impose a quarterly reporting requirement on the  Department of Energy during which they must report to Congress and the  public occasions under which in the last 90 days they have utilized the  ability to reduce or eliminate the cost-share requirement. This will  provide us in Congress the information we need to do our job of  oversight, and it will also make sure that the ability to reduce or  eliminate the cost sharing is used appropriately and in appropriate  circumstances.

Mr. Speaker, this is transparent, bipartisan, good government  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
