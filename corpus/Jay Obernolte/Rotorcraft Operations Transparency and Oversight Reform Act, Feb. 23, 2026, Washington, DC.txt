Rotorcraft Operations Transparency and Oversight Reform Act

Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to the  ROTOR Act.

This bill is a well-intentioned response to the horrific airline  accident last year at DCA. In the months since the accident, it has  become clear that the accident would have been prevented had the  helicopter that was involved in the collision been broadcasting its  position and its speed through the ADS-B Out system.

This bill would indeed fix that. However, this bill imposes a costly  mandate that every aircraft within the system implement a technology  called ADS-B In.

Mr. Speaker, most of the aircraft that would be affected by this  bill, those with a takeoff weight of over 12,500 pounds, already have  superior technology for collision avoidance called TCAS II.

Mr. Speaker, this is technology that works at all airports. At most  of the general aviation airports in my district, ADS-B Out will not  work near the ground, Mr. Speaker, because you have to be receiving air  traffic control signals for it to work. TCAS II works at all of those  airports.

Moreover, since the ROTOR Act was introduced months ago before the  NTSB report was released, it does not implement many of the  recommendations in that report.

Chairman Graves has a far superior bill called the ALERT Act that  addresses all 50 of those recommendations.

Mr. Speaker, I urge us to reject the ROTOR Act today and to quickly  pass the ALERT Act, conference those changes with the Senate, and get  it on the President's desk for signature.
