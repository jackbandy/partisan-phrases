Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025

Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the Budget  Committee and my friend from Texas for yielding.

Mr. Chair, this year we will borrow almost $2 trillion, which  represents almost a third of all Federal spending.

For the first time in the history of our country, this year we will  spend more on interest paying the national debt that we have already  borrowed, and in several years three-quarters of all Federal spending,  borrowing, will be just to pay interest on the money that we have  already borrowed.

Several years after that, we won't even have enough money to pay the  interest on the national debt, which will signal a devastating default  for our country.

Mr. Chair, we cannot allow that to happen. Yet, Mr. Chair, we have a  spending problem. We do not have a revenue problem. Last year, we  collected more dollars in Federal tax revenue than ever in the history  of our country.

That is why this budget resolution is so important. It starts us,  finally, down the path of reducing Federal spending rather than  increasing Federal spending, and it does it without increasing taxes on  hardworking Americans. That is why I am proud to urge a ``yes'' vote.
