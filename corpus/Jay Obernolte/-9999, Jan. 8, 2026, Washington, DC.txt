Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise with an incredibly heavy heart to  honor the life of my friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.

Doug was one of the most effective Members of this Chamber. He was  deeply passionate about issues that affected his constituents in  northern California.

As most of the Members of this Chamber know, we all have little silos  where people come to us for advice. I always could count on Doug to  give me the straight scoop on anything related to water, agriculture,  or rural America. That is why we elected him as the chairman of the  Western Caucus 2 years ago, and he did a phenomenal job in that role. I  will miss his service there.

I will also miss the man that he was. He was an incredibly decent  man, a man of exceptionally high moral character. Everyone that knew  Doug would remark on his authenticity. When you met Doug, what you saw  is what you got. He was a man of deep kindness, never had a cruel or  unkind word for anyone in the years that I knew him. He was a man of  incredible humility, and anyone in this Chamber knows that we could use  some more of that in here.

Above all, Mr. Speaker, I will miss my friend. I will miss our  conversations about cars. He was a car guy; I am a car guy. I would  tease him every summer when we came back into session because he was  restoring a De Tomaso Pantera, and I would ask him: Doug, what progress  did you make on the Pantera this summer? He would hang his head and  say: Nothing.

On this playing Galaga with him, a little known fact about Doug  LaMalfa, he was a fierce competitor at Galaga. Above all, I will miss  our conversations.

I am honored to be here joining my colleagues in saying farewell to  Doug and to honor his life. Godspeed to my friend, Doug. We will miss  him.
