Recognizing the Achievements of Dr. Barbara J. Finlayson-Pitts


Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Dr. Barbara J.  Finlayson-Pitts who was recently recognized as the North American  laureate of the 2025 L'Oreal-United Nations Educational Scientific and  Cultural Organization (UNESCO) For Women in Science International  Awards.

Each year, the L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science International  Awards acknowledge five exceptional women from each of the world's  major regions. Barbara was selected from an impressive pool of 466  nominees for her pioneering contributions in the realm of environmental  science and atmospheric chemistry. On June 12, Barbara will join the  additional four laureates at the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris, France  for an official recognition of her groundbreaking research.

Barbara embodies the very best of our community's values through not  only her consistent dedication to better understanding the world around  her, but also through her passion for preparing future generations of  researchers as a professor within the University of California,  Irvine's Department of Chemistry.

Barbara holds a bachelor's degree from Trent University, and both a  master's and doctoral degree in chemistry from the University of  California, Riverside. Barbara is a long-term resident of Big Bear  Lake--and in her spare time--she enjoys observing Big Bear Lake's  resident eagles, Jackie, Shadow, Sunny, and Gizmo.

Heather and I thank Barbara for her years of service and significant  contributions to the scientific community. I ask my colleagues to join  me in commending Barbara on this monumental achievement.
