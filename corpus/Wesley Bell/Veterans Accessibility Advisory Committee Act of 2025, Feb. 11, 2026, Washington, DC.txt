Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025

Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, we are debating this bill because Donald Trump  is still trying to overturn an election that he lost 6 years ago. Some  in this body are helping him do it.

The SAVE America Act is built on the lie that the 2020 election was  stolen. That lie has been investigated, litigated, audited, and  debunked over and over again. Instead of accepting reality, the authors  of this bill are using that lie as an excuse to take control of our  elections. This is not on the level.

Let's be honest about where this is coming from. It is coming from  the President himself. We are being asked to trust Donald Trump and his  allies about elections while he is actively trying to subvert them.  That is dangerous, and Congress should not be a willing partner in it.

Mr. Speaker, our democracy does not need a takeover. It needs truth,  and this bill has none of it.
