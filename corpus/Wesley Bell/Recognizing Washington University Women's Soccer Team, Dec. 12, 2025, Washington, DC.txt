Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Washington University  women's soccer team, who just secured their second-straight Division  III national championship. These student-athletes reflect the best of  St. Louis.

What they achieved this season didn't happen by accident. It came  from years of work, a culture of accountability, and a shared belief  that success in the classroom and success in competition strengthen  each other.

St. Louis is proud of them, and WashU is proud of them. Their run  reminds us that our city grows stronger when we invest in our young  people.

I congratulate the players, coaching staff, and entire community. I  will admit, a lot of us are already looking forward to the three-peat  next year.
