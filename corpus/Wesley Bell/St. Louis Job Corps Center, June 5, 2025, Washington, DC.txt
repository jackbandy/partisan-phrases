Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, if anyone stood outside the St. Louis Job  Corps Center last week, they saw what happens when cruelty becomes  policy. They saw students being escorted off campus, bags in hand,  dreams on hold; grandparents crying because their grandkids had finally  found something that gave them a shot, and now it is gone. In St.  Louis, that was over 200 students who were impacted.

Job Corps is exactly the kind of program everyone should all agree  on. It gives young people the tools to succeed, real skills, real  credentials, real jobs. It reduces crime, increases employment, and  pays off for taxpayers in the long run.

This wasn't a budget choice. This was a values choice. It tells our  young people their future doesn't matter, not if they are working  class, not if they are Black or Brown, not if they come from a ZIP Code  that doesn't matter.

I rise today because Job Corps works. It changes lives, and there is  no defense, none at all, for ripping that away from students.
