Missourians' Serious Concerns


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695339/missourians-serious-concerns


Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, I come from Missouri, and the people I  represent have serious concerns. They are worried about paying for  healthcare. They are worried about the cost of food and affordable  housing or raising families with some measure of security. What they  are not worried about is a mid-decade power grab in Jefferson City, but  that is exactly what is happening.

This isn't about fair representation. It is about politicians trying  to lock in their power by carving up Kansas City and silencing voices  they do not want to hear. These include voices like Congressman  Cleaver, a man of integrity, who has served this Chamber, our State,  and our country with dignity and distinction for decades.

No one asked for this, not the stakeholders, not the business  community, and, most importantly, not the people of Missouri.

Let's not mince words. This is cheating. It is cowardice. If we allow  it, we are telling Missourians that their voices don't matter. Our  democracy doesn't belong to partisan mapmakers. It belongs to the  people.
