Stop the Republican Affordability Crisis

Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because working people in St.  Louis and across this country are getting squeezed from every  direction. Groceries cost more. Rent costs more. Childcare costs more.  Healthcare costs more. For too many families, every month feels like a  math problem they can't solve.

For generations, the American Dream meant that if you worked hard,  you could build a stable life, you could afford a home, you could raise  a family, and you could retire with dignity. Today, that dream feels  farther away for millions of people, not because they stopped believing  in it but because it is becoming impossibly unaffordable.

Affordability is not just an economic issue. It is a trust issue.  People don't just feel broke. They feel shut out.

Under President Trump, influence isn't just whispered behind closed  doors; it is put up for sale. Money flows in and policy flows out. That  is not normal. That is not acceptable. In this administration, access  is bought instead of earned. If you are a billionaire or a special  interest, you get a seat at the table. If you are a nurse, a warehouse  worker, or a parent juggling two jobs, you are out of luck. That is how  we end up with policies like tariffs that raise costs for Missouri  families by $600 a year. It is how we end up with an economy that works  great for the people at the top and barely works for everyone else.

When President Trump talks about a great economy, it is clear he is  talking about an economy he has never had to live in, one where you  don't worry about grocery bills, prescription costs, or childcare,  because those concerns have never touched his life, and they don't  guide his decisions.

When decisions are driven by money instead of the public interest,  the result is higher costs, weaker protections, and a growing sense  that the American Dream is slipping out of reach.

It doesn't have to be this way. We can build an economy where the  American Dream is affordable again, where housing is within reach,  healthcare is accessible, and childcare doesn't bankrupt you.

We can stop giving billionaires yet another tax break and start  giving working families some breathing room. Because when government  works for working people, the American Dream stops slipping away and  starts feeling possible again.

That is what House Democrats are fighting for, not an economy built  around pay-to-play politics or shady closed-door deals but one built  around dignity, fairness, and that simple idea that the American Dream  should be within reach for everyone, not just the well-connected.
