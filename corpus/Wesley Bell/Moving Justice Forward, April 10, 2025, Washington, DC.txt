Moving Justice Forward


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690046/moving-justice-forward


Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, every day nearly half a million Americans sit  in local jails without a conviction, overwhelmingly for nonviolent,  low-level offenses. They are not there because they have been found  guilty but because they can't afford bail or are stuck waiting for  their day in court. While they wait, taxpayers pay the price.

That is why I have introduced the Justice Forward Agenda, a target,  results-driven plan to reduce crime and use taxpayer dollars more  wisely. The Community First Pretrial Reform and Jail Decarceration Act  helps local jurisdictions cut unnecessary pretrial detention and expand  proven alternatives.

The DART Act builds off my work as a St. Louis County prosecutor by  giving law enforcement better tools like diversion programs and mental  health courts to connect people with treatment, housing, and support  that actually stops the cycle of incarceration.

This isn't leniency. It is strategy. It is about investing in what  works, in what has proven effective, and building safer, stronger  communities.

Mr. Speaker, let's move justice forward.
