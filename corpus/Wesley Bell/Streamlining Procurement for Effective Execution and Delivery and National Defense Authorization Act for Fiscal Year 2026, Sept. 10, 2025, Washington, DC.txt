Mr. BELL. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment,  though I am not opposed to it.

Mr. BELL. Mr. Chair, we must continue to stand with our Baltic allies  who remain on the front lines of Russian aggression. Estonia, Latvia,  and Lithuania are strong democratic partners that contribute  significantly to NATO's collective defense.

What we saw last night is a reminder of why this amendment is  critical. Vladimir Putin's aggression will not end with Ukraine. His  goal is to reassert control over the former Soviet sphere, including  NATO allies like the Baltic States.

Yet, what is concerning is the current administration has already  announced plans to suspend key European security programs, including  the Baltic Security Initiative. This is not peace through strength. It  is weakness that plays directly into Putin's hands.

Turning our backs on NATO allies would embolden dictators and further  undermine American credibility. Walking away would send a dangerous  signal to Putin and Xi Jinping. We cannot strip away resources from  allies confronting Russian aggression or leave a vacuum for our enemies  to exploit.

Instead, we must reaffirm our commitment, strengthen our alliances,  and provide the tools our partners need to deter aggression and defend  democracy.

I am proud to cosponsor this bipartisan amendment. I am proud to  stand with our Baltic allies and with Ukraine in the fight for freedom  and global democracy.

Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).

Mr. BELL. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
