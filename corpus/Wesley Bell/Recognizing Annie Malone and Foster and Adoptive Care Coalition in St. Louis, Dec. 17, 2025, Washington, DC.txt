Mr. BELL. Madam Speaker, as the holidays roll around, I want to say  this to folks across the St. Louis region: This season isn't just about  what is under the tree. It is about who we show up for.

There is a lot happening in the world right now. Some of it is heavy.  At home, I see a community that still believes in looking out for one  another, especially our children. Not every child has the stability  they deserve, through no fault of their own. When families can't carry  that load alone, the rest of us have to help.

That is what organizations like the Foster and Adoptive Care  Coalition do every day, and it is what Annie Malone has done for  generations, helping young people aging out of the system find their  footing.

As we celebrate with the people we love, I hope we also think about  how we can help others. That is how we make this season matter.

Madam Speaker, I wish St. Louis happy holidays.
