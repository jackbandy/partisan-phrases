Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, another child in the St. Louis region is gone  too early.

Marshaun Futrell, Jr., was 11 years old. He was a football star, a  big brother, and a son. Monday night this 11-year-old was yet another  victim of senseless gun violence.

Across the St. Louis region, 20 children have been shot since the  beginning of 2025. This is not just a crisis, it is a collapse of our  responsibility to protect our children.

Gun violence is ripping through our neighborhoods, and if we truly  believe in public safety, then we must start treating it like what it  is: a public health emergency.

That means commonsense gun reform, investments in trauma-informed  care, and asking ourselves: How many more funerals before we decide  enough is enough?

To the families who have suffered the unspeakable tragedy of losing a  loved one, I hear you, I see you, and I will not stop fighting for the  change we are long overdue for.
