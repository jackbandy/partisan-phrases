In Support of Liheap


Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, winter is here, and families across the St.  Louis region and the country are opening their utility bills with a  knot in their stomachs.

Right now, reckless tariff policies and economic uncertainty out of  the White House are driving up costs across the country and squeezing  working people who are already stretched thin with higher prices at the  grocery store, higher rent, and stagnant wages.

That is why, now more than ever, programs like the Low-Income Energy  Assistance Program, LIHEAP, are so critical. Yet earlier this year, the  Trump administration wanted to eliminate LIHEAP, a program that  supports over 200,000 people in my home State of Missouri.

We should be focused on lowering costs and strengthening essential  programs, not cutting critical, lifesaving programs that people rely on  to stay warm in the winter.

Heating a home is not a luxury, and families in St. Louis should not  be left out in the cold.
