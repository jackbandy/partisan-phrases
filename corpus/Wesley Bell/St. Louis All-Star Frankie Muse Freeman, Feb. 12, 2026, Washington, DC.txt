St. Louis All-Star Frankie Muse Freeman

Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, each month I recognize a St. Louis all-star,  someone who represents the very best of our city. During Black History  Month, I have been highlighting Black leaders who helped shape St.  Louis and expand opportunity for everyone.

However, this week is bigger than one name. That is because long  before the great Bill Clay was elected to Congress, Black Missourians  were fighting through poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation just  to cast a ballot. They were told their voices didn't matter. They  organized anyway.

Countless leaders pushed from the streets, as well as leaders like  our beloved Frankie Muse Freeman, who fought in the courts.

When I see new efforts to make voting more restrictive, more  complicated, and more conditional, I am reminded why their work  matters. Black History Month isn't just about remembrance. It is about  vigilance.

Mr. Speaker, I stand here because they fought to open the door, and I  won't let anyone quietly close it.
