Protect America's Workforce Act

Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2550, the Protect  America's Workforce Act.

Mr. Speaker, we all count on a Federal workforce that shows up every  day to serve, not to bend to political pressure or wonder if speaking  up will cost them their jobs.

That is exactly the risk if collective bargaining rights are wiped  out. It pushes aside a system that has been built over generations to  protect workers, protect taxpayers, and keep politics out of public  service.

Taking away the voice of Federal workers doesn't make government  stronger. It makes it easier for retaliation, harder for  whistleblowers, and worse for the people who we represent.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do right by the people who serve  our country every day by restoring basic fairness and bringing us back  to a system that has worked under both parties for decades.
