Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sergeant Major  Troy Black as he retires from a distinguished 37-year career in defense  of our Nation.

Sergeant Major Black was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky,  before joining the Marine Corps in 1988, rising to become the 19th  Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, the highest-ranking enlisted  Marine.

In 2010, he earned a Bronze Star with Combat V after running through  dangerous territory to reach a fellow Marine who had been struck by an  IED.

He most recently served as the senior enlisted adviser to the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest ranking enlisted  position in all of our Armed Forces.

On behalf of all Kentuckians, we thank Sergeant Major Black for his  bravery, his patriotism, and his service. He has made Louisville and  our entire country proud.
