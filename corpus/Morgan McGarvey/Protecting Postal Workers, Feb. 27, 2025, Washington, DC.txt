Protecting Postal Workers


Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, since before Christmas, I have heard from  Louisvillians every day about mail delays.

I have heard from people who haven't received paychecks,  prescriptions, or W-2s. One woman told me she received a bill so late  that she owed more in late fees than she did on the bill.

What concerns me is if the Trump administration gets its way, things  will get worse.

The USPS has operated independently since 1970, but now Donald Trump  wants to take it over. Why? So Elon Musk can go in and fire letter  carriers and sorters? These are hardworking people who go above and  beyond.

This weekend, I heard about a Louisville letter carrier who wears a  headlamp because she works well into the evening. She deserves support,  not demonization.

Let's fix this. Let's get our letter carriers the resources they  need. Let's get our sorters the machinery they need. Let's ensure  Americans don't pay late fees if their mail is delayed. Let's get this  done.
