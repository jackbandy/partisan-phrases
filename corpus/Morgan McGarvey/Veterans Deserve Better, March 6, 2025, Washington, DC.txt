Veterans Deserve Better


Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, Louisvillian Tim Nicolazzi has dedicated  his life to service. He served in the Air Force and then Army,  deploying to Kuwait and Iraq, where he earned a Bronze Star.

After his honorable discharge, Tim's call to public service brought  him to HUD, where he has helped victims of domestic abuse in Louisville  find safety, helped veterans get off the streets, and helped first-time  home buyers achieve their American Dream.

A few weeks ago, Tim was fired with no notice and no severance or  compassion.

As we speak, the Trump administration is carrying out the biggest  layoff of veterans in history, including tens of thousands announced  just last night.

That is why today I am cosponsoring an act to protect veterans' jobs  and to reinstate veterans who have been illegally fired by Elon Musk  and DOGE.

Veterans put on the uniform. They served something higher than  themselves. They deserve better.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Tim for all of his service. I won't stop  fighting for veterans like him.
