Transparency and Predictability in Small Business Opportunities Act

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Representatives Latimer, Alford,  and Mfume, for their work on this important legislation.

Mr. Speaker, prior to this administration, government contracts  provided small businesses with stability and predictability. The  government was considered a reliable partner that could be trusted to  keep its word and pay its bills.

Yet even before the chaos of the Trump administration, there were  times when requirements legitimately changed and something the  government intended to buy or do was no longer necessary.

In those previously rare instances, the government then canceled the  solicitation. Unfortunately, any small business working on a bid lost  all the time and money they had invested in the proposal.

Last year, a small business owner testified that it cost him an  average of $10,000 per proposal. If that solicitation was later  canceled, the government did not have to provide him with any  assistance or even any information.

This bill will change that. While we cannot make small businesses  whole, we can make sure they are given additional information and  assistance to help them adjust their operations and plans moving  forward and hopefully to continue their participation in the Federal  market.

Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, in closing, we know that providing a  little  more predictability and stability can help reduce the barriers that  keep small businesses from bidding on and winning government projects.  That is what this bill will do.

Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Mr. Latimer and Mr. Alford for their work  to bring this to the floor today and to increase transparency and  accountability for our small business government contractors. I urge my  colleagues to support it, as well, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
