Ice Atrocities

Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, today I speak out of grave concern for my  neighbors in Louisville, in Minneapolis, across the country, and for my  colleagues here in Washington who somehow continue to excuse, dismiss,  and ignore the atrocities that ICE exhibits each day.

Mr. Speaker, do not look away. Watch as people in the freest country  on Earth get dragged from their cars down the street by masked men.  Watch as parents are pinned to the ground in the pick-up line outside  their kids' schools. Watch as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother  of three, is killed in front of her wife.

Watch, because looking away will not absolve you from the violence  and atrocities made possible when you voted to hand over taxpayer money  to fund this government's campaign of terror.

Mr. Speaker, every single day you look away from what this President  is doing is another day that our neighbors face unimaginable cruelty at  the hands of their own government.

Mr. Speaker, do not look away.
