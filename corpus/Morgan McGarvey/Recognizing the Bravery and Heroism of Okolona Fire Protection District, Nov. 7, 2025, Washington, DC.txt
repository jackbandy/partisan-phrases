Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the Okolona Fire  Protection District for their bravery and heroism in response to the  tragic crash of UPS Airlines Flight 2976 in Louisville, Kentucky.

On Tuesday, November 4th, a cargo jet bound for Hawaii crashed  moments after takeoff. Unable to gain altitude, the jet went down just  beyond the airfield, erupting into flames as hundreds of thousands of  pounds of jet fuel ignited. The resulting fire engulfed an area the  size of nine football fields, and the thick, black plume of smoke could  be seen from anywhere in the city. I have lived in Louisville my whole  life and could never have imagined seeing something like this. For a  moment, Louisville looked apocalyptic--it was heartbreaking.

But in these trying times, we saw the best of our community. Within  minutes, Okolona firefighters were there, the first on site,  confronting a scene of unimaginable destruction with discipline and  resolve. In this moment, they showed that heroism is not found in  comfort--it is revealed in crisis. They chose duty over fear. Their  rapid, coordinated response contained the flames, protected nearby  homes, and stopped the disaster from spreading. Their courage in  horrific circumstances saved lives and protected hundreds of families  from losing their homes to the inferno.

Louisville is safer because of the men and women of Okolona Fire and  the more than twenty departments who came from across the city and the  Commonwealth to assist. Their bravery and selflessness reflect their  deep love for this community and stand as a testament to what it means  to serve. I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring these brave  first responders for their extraordinary service and sacrifice.
