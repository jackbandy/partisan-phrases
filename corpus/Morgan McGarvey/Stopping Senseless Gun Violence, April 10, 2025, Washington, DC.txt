Stopping Senseless Gun Violence

Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago today, the blast of an AR-15  shattered a beautiful spring morning in Louisville as a lone gunman  walked into Old National Bank on Main Street and opened fire. We lost  Josh Barrick, Deana Eckert, Juliana Farmer, Jim Tutt, and my friend,  Tommy Elliot. Five friends, neighbors, and loved one were taken too  soon.

Among the eight wounded was Officer Nick Wilt. Just 10 days out of  the academy, he bravely ran toward the gunman and was shot in the head.  Miraculously, he survived. That same day, just blocks away at JCTC, two  people were shot, and Chea'von Moore was killed at just 24 years old.

Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as a lifelong Louisvillian, still sad  my community joined the long list of cities devastated by mass  shootings. On behalf of all of our communities, we can and must do more  to stop senseless gun violence.
