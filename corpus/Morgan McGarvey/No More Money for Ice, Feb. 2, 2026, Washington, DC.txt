No More Money for Ice

Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, Congress is deciding whether to fund an  agency that has already shown us how it wants to spend taxpayers'  money.

When Republicans gave ICE a blank check last year, ICE used it to  kill American citizens. ICE now wants 2 more weeks' worth of money, no  strings attached, to keep their campaign of terror running smoothly.

Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks? Renee Good and Alex Pretti were murdered just 2  weeks apart. During those 2 weeks, 5-year-old Liam Ramos was used as  bait and detained, and three more people died in ICE custody during  those same 2 weeks.

Mr. Speaker, I don't want to be back at this podium in 2 weeks with a  longer list of names. I urge my colleagues to consider what we are  wagering at this point.

Are we going to give ICE 2 more weeks to invade U.S. cities in  exchange for a pinky promise that we will talk about reforms? Forgive  me if I don't believe that this President is negotiating in good faith.  He is not.
