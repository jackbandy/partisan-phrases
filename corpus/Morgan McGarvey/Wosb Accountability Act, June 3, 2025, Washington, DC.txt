Wosb Accountability Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691800/wosb-accountability-act


In recent years, both SBA and Congress have directed changes to the  small business contracting programs to increase accountability and  ensure proper use. The WOSB Accountability Act will continue this work  by moving the Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Program to  full SBA certification.

This bill is important to ensure that the Women-Owned Small Business  Federal Contract Program works as intended, assists the companies as  intended, and, ultimately, levels the playing field for women-owned  firms competing for government contracts as intended.

The data shows that women are starting and running new small  businesses, generating revenue and jobs in their communities, and  growing in increasingly diverse industries, but fewer and fewer are  signing up to work with the government. Again, many more are leaving.

Women-owned small businesses continue to make up a strikingly small  share of Federal contracts, and the government continues to fail to  meet the 5 percent goal of contracting dollars that Congress set three  decades ago.

Better leveraging the Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract  Program to recruit and retain more small firms strengthens the entire  industrial base, promotes competition, and drives innovation.

Mr. Speaker, passing this bill today will do that.

Mr. McGARVEY.  Velazquez), the distinguished ranking member of the Small  Business Committee.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaLota) and the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) for their work on this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I close by thanking the ranking member from New York  (Ms. Velazquez) for her leadership on this bill and her many years of  work to create, strengthen, and enhance the Women-Owned Small Business  program. I am pleased to support this bill and encourage all of my  colleagues to do the same.
