Harris Calls For Judicial Nominations To Stop During Senate Consideration of Impeachment


U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday called for a pause to any judicial nominees while the Senate considers the impeachment articles against President Trump. From the time the Clinton impeachment articles were delivered to the Senate in 1999 to the date of the Senate's verdict, the Senate Judiciary Committee did not hold any nominations hearings or advance any nominations to a confirmation vote.

"Today, the United States Senate will receive articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump and begin to determine whether the president's actions warrant his removal from office," said Harris. "The president is charged with high crimes and misdemeanors, and the Senate must take seriously its constitutional role in this process. During the time when articles of impeachment are before the Senate, it would be wholly inappropriate to advance the president's nominees to the federal judiciary."
