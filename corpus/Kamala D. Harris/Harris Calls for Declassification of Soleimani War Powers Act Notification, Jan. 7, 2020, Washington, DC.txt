Harris Calls for Declassification of Soleimani War Powers Act Notification


U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Tuesday released a statement calling for the declassification of President Trump's notification to Congress regarding the military strike against Qasem Soleimani.

"I am deeply concerned by the potential consequences of the president's order and apparent lack of coherent strategy moving forward," said Harris. "Having reviewed the president's formal notification to Congress, it is clear that this information should not be classified and hidden from the American people. The public deserves transparency and has a right to understand the rationale for this action that has further enflamed tensions and further destabilized the region."
