Harris Statement on New Senate Intelligence Committee Report


U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris, member of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, issued the following statement after the release of the Intelligence Committee's fourth installment of its review of the Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) -- which focused on Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

"The facts are indisputable. Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee agree that Russia interfered in our 2016 presidential election and did so to help Donald Trump. Given that we are in another election year, we must do everything in our power to protect our election system and ensure it is free from foreign interference and domestic voter suppression. I thank the hardworking men and women of the intelligence community for their thorough and rigorous analysis."
