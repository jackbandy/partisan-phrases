Harris Votes Against USMCA in Committee


U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Tuesday released a statement on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) after voting against the deal in the Senate Budget Committee:

"It is the duty of the United States Congress to ensure that our nation's trade policies lift up workers, grow the economy, and protect public health and our environment. Trade agreements can open up new markets to American products and forge new alliances with foreign countries. They can also lead to job losses, depressed wages, and environmental degradation. Living in a state with the largest and most diverse economy in the nation, Californians have seen both the good and the bad up close. My responsibility as their senator is to listen to their concerns and learn from the mistakes of past trade deals.

"I recognize the hard work of negotiators in Congress and organized labor, especially Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the AFL-CIO, that dramatically improved the USMCA from the one negotiated by the Trump administration.

"However, after careful study and consultation with environmental and conservation leaders, I have concluded that the USMCA's environmental provisions are insufficient--and by not addressing climate change, the USMCA fails to meet the crises of this moment. Californians know that the climate crisis is already here. Communities across our state have experienced exacerbated fires, storms, floods, and drought, and the devastation will only get worse if we fail to take bold and immediate action to address it. This agreement will set the standards for decades, and I believe Californians and all Americans deserve better and more immediate action. For these reasons, I oppose this deal."
