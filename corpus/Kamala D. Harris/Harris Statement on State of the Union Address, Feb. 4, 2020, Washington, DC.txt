Harris Statement on State of the Union Address


U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Tuesday released a statement following President Trump's State of the Union Address.

"The State of the Union address is an opportunity for the president of the United States to speak candidly about the challenges our nation faces and the direction he or she intends to take in the year ahead. Unfortunately, President Trump chose tonight to deliver a divisive speech that ignored the real challenges that working people continue to face to make ends meet. His remarks also failed to acknowledge the ongoing threat that his own actions pose to the integrity of our system of justice.

"The president spoke this evening before members of the very institution he is currently on trial for obstructing--the United States Congress. As a member of the United States Senate, I have spent the past few weeks considering the consequences of the president's efforts to escape congressional oversight and block the testimony of firsthand witnesses in his impeachment trial. We heard a lot of words from the president tonight, but his actions demonstrate his complete disregard for the rule of law and for the principle that no one is above the law, including the president of the United States."
