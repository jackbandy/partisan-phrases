Harris Statement on Vote Opposing Consideration of GOP Coronavirus Package


U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Sunday released a statement after voting against cloture on Republican bill that aims to address the coronavirus outbreak in the United States by putting the interests of large corporations ahead of the needs of working people.

"The coronavirus pandemic is a public health emergency that is driving an economic disaster for millions of families across our country. People are in their homes scared and suffering right now--Congress must act immediately to strengthen our health care system, expand access to emergency assistance like we do in the midst of any other disaster, and lift up and support working people, families, and small businesses. We need to get this right.

"The Republican bill released today does not address the pain everyday Americans are feeling, nor does it provide support for our overloaded health care system. This bill fails our workers by bailing out big industries without requiring them to keep people employed or ensure workers are protected. I voted against this bill because it fails to meet the urgent demands of this moment."
