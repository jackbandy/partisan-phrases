Harris Introduces Legislation to Expand Access to Disaster Assistance During Pandemics


U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Thursday introduced the Pandemic  Disaster Assistance Act, legislation to expand the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide financial assistance directly to individuals during a pandemic, including the current coronavirus outbreak. Currently, FEMA can only provide individual assistance during natural disasters, such as wildfires, floods, and earthquakes.

"At a time when a global pandemic is threatening the financial stability of working families across our country, there is no reason for FEMA to treat those impacted by biological threats any differently than when a natural disaster strikes," said Harris. "FEMA is not currently allowed to assist individuals who have been impacted by a pandemic, and that needs to change. I'm introducing this legislation to ensure the federal government can use every tool available to help the American people recover from the impact of the coronavirus."

Specifically, at the discretion of a governor and the president, individuals impacted in any way will be eligible to apply directly to federal agencies for, among other forms of assistance:
