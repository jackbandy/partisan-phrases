In Response To Coronavirus Crisis, Harris Votes to Support Working Families and Small Businesses


U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday released the following statement after the U.S. Senate passed the third relief package in response to the coronavirus pandemic. This bill would provide direct payments up to $1,200 for working people, and give families $500 per child, supply $150 billion for a state, tribal, and local Coronavirus Relief Fund, dramatically expand unemployment insurance for laid off workers -- including those in the gig economy and entertainment industry, provide $377 billion in relief for small businesses, and invest over $100 billion in the nation's hospitals. Senator Harris will continue to fight for paid sick leave, paid family and medical leave, keeping immigrant communities safe, and additional consumer protections for working families.

"Our country is hurting right now. Parents are trying to figure out how to put food on the table after losing their jobs. Workers on the front lines of this outbreak don't have the proper equipment to protect themselves and others. Small businesses are struggling to keep the lights on. We are in a crisis, and the federal government must rise to the occasion to help all working people, not just corporations and Wall Street.  

"While this bill is far from perfect, I voted for it because workers, small businesses, and health care providers need help right now. It will help slow the spread of the coronavirus and support families on the brink of financial ruin.  

"Congress' job is not even close to finished -- things will get worse before they get better, and it's our job to help the people who need it most. There is much more work to be done to provide assistance to families and small businesses, expand paid leave, and protect homeowners and renters. I won't let up the fight for California families and the most vulnerable among us."
