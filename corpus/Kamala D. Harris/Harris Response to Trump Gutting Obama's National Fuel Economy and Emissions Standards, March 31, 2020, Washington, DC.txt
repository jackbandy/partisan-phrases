Harris Response to Trump Gutting Obama's National Fuel Economy and Emissions Standards


U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) released the following statement after the Trump administration announced its final rule to roll back Obama-era federal fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards. The Trump administration's own analysis through the Environmental Protection Agency's Science Advisory Board showed this isn't a good deal for Americans.

"Hospitals are in desperate need of ventilators for people with respiratory illnesses, millions have applied for unemployment, and families across the nation are struggling to make ends meet. This administration's own analysis has shown this is a bad deal for Americans. During this time of crisis, we should have every federal policy -- including bold clean car standards -- in place to make our air clean, create jobs, and save consumers money."
