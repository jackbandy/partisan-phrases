Harris Statement on Senate Passage of Coronavirus Emergency Funding


U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Thursday released a statement after the Senate passed emergency supplemental appropriations legislation to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation now heads to the president's desk. The legislation provides $8.3 billion in emergency funding to fight the spread of coronavirus, including support for state and local governments.

"Coronavirus poses a serious threat to the public health of Californians and people across our country and the federal government must lead a robust, science-based response to this crisis. I am grateful that Congress has taken the necessary first step of passing emergency funding, but this must not be the end to our response. We must continue to provide oversight to ensure that communities are getting the proper resources and information to adequately respond to this threat.

"As senator, protecting the health of Californians is one of my primary responsibilities. California communities in particular have stepped up to care for individuals affected by coronavirus. I am committed to ensuring that these communities have the federal funding and assistance they need to respond to this public health crisis, and my office and I will remain in contact with California's state and local officials to ensure health care workers and those affected get assistance."
