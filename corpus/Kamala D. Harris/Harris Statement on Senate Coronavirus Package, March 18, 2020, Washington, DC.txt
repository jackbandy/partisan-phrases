Harris Statement on Senate Coronavirus Package


U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday released a statement after the Senate passed a legislative package to address the coronavirus outbreak. The bill passed by the Senate will provide for coronavirus testing at no cost, make an initial investment towards paid sick leave and paid family and medical leave for workers, and expand unemployment benefits.

"The coronavirus pandemic has laid bare cracks in our society and our economy that too many families have long understood. Our health care system is stretched thin, and millions of Americans remain uninsured or underinsured. Two thirds of low-income workers do not have paid sick leave, forcing them to choose between staying home sick or putting food on the table. 40% of Americans cannot afford a $400 unexpected expense.

"The coronavirus package the Senate passed today will provide for coronavirus testing at no cost, deliver much-needed relief to unemployed individuals, and make an important first step towards providing paid sick leave and paid family and medical leave for our nation's workers. Now, it's time to get to work on further solutions for working families across our country, including providing direct support to workers whose wages have been cut or who have been laid off.
