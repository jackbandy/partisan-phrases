Letter to Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader - Harris to McConnell: Take Up Coronavirus Emergency Funding Without Delay


Dear Leader McConnell:

            I urge you to bring to the floor of the Senate a bill to provide emergency funding to fight the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as soon as possible. This funding is critical to communities in a growing number of states, including California, that have been responding to the virus for weeks.

           Unfortunately, the Trump Administration's emergency supplemental appropriations request is insufficient. The request totaled only approximately $2.5 billion and takes money away from ongoing efforts to combat the Ebola epidemic. As costs rise and the virus spreads, much more funding will be necessary to support those responding to the crisis, including states, localities, territories, tribes and native organizations, hospitals, and others.

            Therefore, the Senate must act without further delay. The Democratic Leader has already provided a thoughtful, detailed proposal for $8.5 billion in emergency funding, and I understand that negotiations with the House on a funding bill are underway. As soon as the House passes this measure, the Senate should begin its work immediately.

            I stand ready to work with you to secure this funding as soon as possible--the health of the nation depends on it. Thank you.

Sincerely,
