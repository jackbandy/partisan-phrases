Harris to McConnell: Cancel the Weekend & Call Senate Back to Vote on Emergency Coronavirus Bill


U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Friday released a statement ahead of the House of Representatives voting on a package in response to the coronavirus outbreak to provide paid sick leave and paid family and medical leave to workers, extend unemployment benefits, expand food assistance, and provide free coronavirus testing. On Thursday, Harris called on the Senate to include paid sick leave and paid family and medical leave as components of any legislative package to address the coronavirus.

"It's pretty basic: when our country faces a serious crisis, the federal government has a duty to act. Yet despite the growing outbreak of the coronavirus, which is threatening the lives of our people and testing the strength of our economy, Mitch McConnell gave the Senate a three-day weekend. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives will soon consider urgently-needed legislation to support working families without access to paid sick leave and paid family and medical leave. Leader McConnell must immediately cancel the weekend and call the Senate back into session to vote on the House legislation.

"Paid sick leave will save lives. Paid family and medical leave will save lives. This bill is not only the right thing to do to support our workers--including the two thirds of low-income workers who do not currently have paid sick leave--but also a smart strategy to keep sick people at home and slow the spread of the coronavirus. We must vote on it without delay."
