Letter to the Hon. Michael Carvajal, Dir. of the Federal Bureau of Prisons - Feinstein, Harris to Bureau of Prisons: Stop Spread of Coronavirus at Terminal Island


Dear Mr. Carvajal,

According to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), the number of positive COVID-19 cases among inmates and staff at the Terminal Island Federal Correctional Institution has increased exponentially over the last week. We write to express our concerns about the spread of the COVID-19 virus at Terminal Island, and to ask what steps BOP is taking to stop this dramatic rise.

As of the date of this letter, Terminal Island is outpacing every other BOP facility in terms of COVID-19 infections. At least 570 inmates--over half of the total inmate population at Terminal Island--have tested positive for the virus, along with ten staff members. Two inmates have died.

The dramatic increase in cases at Terminal Island is particularly concerning given the difficulty of containing the virus at this facility. Specifically, the medically vulnerable inmate population and the open dormitory-style housing make containment even more challenging. The 1,055 inmates currently housed in Terminal Island and Bureau staff at the facility are undoubtedly fearful for their health and safety during this outbreak.

Based on these concerns, please explain how BOP is taking steps to stop the continued spread of COVID-19 at Terminal Island. In particular, please explain how BOP is coordinating with local Los Angeles County Public Health officials to identify and contain further spread of the virus among Terminal Island inmates and staff. Please further describe any direct assistance that BOP is receiving from the U.S. Department of Justice to manage the COVID-19 outbreak.

Lastly, please identify any steps that Congress can take to help the Bureau manage this public health challenge.

Thank you for your consideration.
