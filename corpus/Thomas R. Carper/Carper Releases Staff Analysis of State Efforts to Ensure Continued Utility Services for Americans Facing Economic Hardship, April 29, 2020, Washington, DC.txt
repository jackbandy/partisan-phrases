Carper Releases Staff Analysis of State Efforts to Ensure Continued Utility Services for Americans Facing Economic Hardship


As members of Congress continue to examine the many ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting state economies and services, as well as Americans' personal finances, today, U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, released an analysis conducted by the committee's minority staff describing how state authorities are -- or, in some cases, are not -- protecting residents from utility disconnections during this time of extraordinary economic hardship.

"Americans' universal access to clean water is essential to our efforts to overcome this deadly pandemic. Every American needs access to clean water and soap to wash their hands, themselves and their home frequently. But as some Americans struggle with steepening utility bills due to illness or job loss, many risk utility shutoffs. Meanwhile, some utilities and state leaders are "keeping the lights on' during the pandemic despite bills that may have gone unpaid," Senator Carper said. "As Congress considers how we can keep households connected to critical utility service during the COVID-19 crisis, I hope this analysis will help to inform our efforts."

The COVID-19 health emergency has created an economic crisis across the United States. With many businesses closed, more than 26 million people have filed an initial jobless claim within the past 5 weeks, with little prospect for finding new employment while the emergency remains. In the wake of this crisis, states have adopted a variety of approaches to protect residential customers from being disconnected from electricity, gas and water services.

Residential utility services are essential for preserving public health during the ongoing emergency. This analysis tracks state government actions that ensure the continued provision of gas, electric and water service, which are particularly necessary for sustaining residential habitability. For each state, searches were conducted for executive orders and announcements from governors' offices regarding these services, as well as orders and announcement from state utility regulators, typically known as public utility commissions.

Particular emphasis has been placed in this analysis on efforts to maintain residential water service. Safe reliable drinking water and the ability to wash one's hands or other surfaces that could be contaminated by SARS-COV-2 are vital to public health. Even under relatively favorable economic conditions, water service disconnections are common. In 2016, Food and Water Watch conducted a nationwide assessment of service disconnections to residential water customers. The organization found that "among responding utilities, more than half a million households lost water service for nonpayment, affecting an estimated 1.4 million people in 2016."[1] Recent reporting conducted by the Guardian found that many of the communities identified in the 2016 survey with highest rates of disconnections are the very same communities with the highest rates of COVID-19 infections.[2]

This analysis identifies many instances where orders to suspend service disconnections issued by state utility commissions do not apply to municipal utilities, because municipal utilities often fall outside the jurisdiction of state regulators. This is particularly relevant with respect to water service, since an estimated 82 percent of Americans receive their water from municipal water utilities.[3] For each state, information provided by the Environmental Finance Center at the University of North Carolina was used to estimate the proportion of the state's residents that receive water from a municipal utility.[4] In instances where state orders do not apply to municipal utilities, municipal authorities can adopt their own policies to suspend services disconnections, as some have done.[5]

As part of providing assistance to respond to the COVID-19 crisis, Congress is considering providing financial assistance to utility customers struggling with bills due to illness or job loss. Congress is also trying to decide whether, as a condition of receiving federal funding, to confer upon state and local governments and utilities the responsibility of ensuring that households remain connected, or are reconnected, to utility service during the COVID-19 crisis.

The following list categorizes how state authorities are or are not protecting their residents from utility disconnections as of April 27, 2020. As this analysis indicates, many of orders restricting disconnections for nonpayment are set to expire by the end of this week.
