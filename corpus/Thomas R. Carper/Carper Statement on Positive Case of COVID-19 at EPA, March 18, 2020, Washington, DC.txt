Carper Statement on Positive Case of COVID-19 at EPA


Today, U.S. Senator Tom Carper, top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, released the following statements after reports revealed that at least one employee at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has tested positive for COVID-19, and that multiple EPA employees across the country are awaiting test results or self-isolating and monitoring their symptoms, per the recommendations of public health experts.

"First and foremost, I wish the EPA employee who tested positive for coronavirus a speedy recovery. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your loved ones. As more EPA employees await the results of their tests, and while some follow the guidance of public health experts to self-isolate and monitor symptoms, know that my thoughts and prayers are with you, too.

"Americans from every corner of the country rely on the Environmental Protection Agency to have clean air to breathe, safe water to drink and a healthy environment. We all rely on EPA's dedicated staff to protect our communities from hazardous waste, toxic chemicals, and harmful air and water pollutants. We need to make sure this important work continues. To support EPA's critical mission, we need to support EPA's hard-working staff. I stand ready to work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that the agency and its workforce have the resources they need during this public health crisis."
