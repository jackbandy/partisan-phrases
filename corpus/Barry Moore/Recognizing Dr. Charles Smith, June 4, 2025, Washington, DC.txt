Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the  inauguration of the Sixth President of the University of Mobile, Dr.  Charles Smith, who was unanimously elected to be inaugurated on May 1st  and has taken charge of leading the university.

Dr. Smith was born and raised in Montgomery before he pursued his PhD  at the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in North Carolina. He  served for eleven years as Senior Vice President for Institutional  Relations and an Assistant Professor of Christian Leadership at  Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and Spurgeon College in Kansas  City, Missouri.

Dr. Smith also co-founded the ``For the Church'' resource platform,  offering free online resources for churches across the Nation.

I would like to congratulate Dr. Smith on his inauguration and thank  him for spreading the Word of God and serving students at the  University of Mobile.
