Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the  remarkable accomplishments of Mayor William S. ``Sandy'' Stimpson,  108th Mayor of the City of Mobile, Alabama. Since his election in 2013,  Mayor Stimpson has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to public  service, fiscal responsibility, and the shared vision of building  Mobile into a city that is safer, more business-friendly, and more  family-friendly for all.

Under his leadership, Mobile has achieved major financial reform,  including reducing their bonded debt by nearly $210 million and their  unfunded liabilities by more than $200 million. These reforms led to  multiple credit rating upgrades and allowed for significant investments  to improve public safety, infrastructure, and city personnel.

Mayor Stimpson has also championed long-term improvements, including  modernizing the city's zoning code and launching a nationally  recognized urban blight reduction program. As a founding member and  chairman of the Alabama Big 10 Mayor Association, his influence extends  beyond Mobile, strengthening the voice of Alabama's cities across the  state.

On behalf of the people of Alabama, I want to thank Mayor Stimpson  for his leadership and deep commitment to public service. Through his  work, every Mobilian has been empowered to have a voice and a seat at  the table in shaping a better future for their city.
