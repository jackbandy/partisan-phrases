Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the  remarkable accomplishments of His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew. His All-Holiness is not only a recipient of the  Congressional Gold Medal, but he is also soon to be the recipient of  the Templeton Award, the world's foremost award in Religion and  Science.

His All-Holiness is the spiritual leader and Primus inter Pares of  Orthodox Christianity, providing leadership to a Church of 300 million  people. He has throughout his ministry been a foremost advocate of  religious freedom and has regularly traveled to countries hostile to  Christians in order to advocate for peace.

Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is a leading figure in the dialogues  of the Abrahamic Faiths--Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and his  presence in Washington, D.C. is an extraordinary opportunity to  highlight the positive role that religious leaders of his stature bring  to the cause of religious liberty.

On behalf of the people of Alabama, especially the Orthodox community  of my district, I want to thank His All-Holiness for his continued  efforts towards peace for Christians everywhere.
