Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the  outstanding contributions, hard work, and legacy of Mr. Frank Caskey.  His dedicated service to the Alabama Legislative over several decades  has made a lasting impact on the lives of many Alabamians.

Mr. Caskey has dedicated many years of his life to serving the  Alabama Legislature and its citizens. Beginning his career in 1970 as a  clerk for Senator James B. Allen, Frank's commitment to public service  continued through his education at Auburn University and his work as a  legislative aide. He joined the Alabama Legislative Reference Service  in 1974 and served there until 1979 before pursuing a successful legal  career. In 1992, he returned to the Legislative Reference Service,  bringing with him a wealth of legal knowledge and expertise, making  significant contributions to the legislative process.

Throughout his career, Frank's work in areas like local laws,  taxation, and environmental law had a lasting impact, and his advice  was highly valued by legislators, lobbyists, and fellow attorneys. His  exceptional memory and institutional knowledge of the legislature were  unmatched, and his dedication to public service earned him great  respect. Now retired, Frank's legacy continues, and we wish him  happiness and fulfillment as he enjoys his retirement, exploring the  Great Smoky Mountains. His contributions to the state will never be  forgotten.

I would like to congratulate Mr. Frank Caskey on his well-deserved  retirement and thank him for his public service.
