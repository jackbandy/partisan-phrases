Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to outline my concerns  with a provision contained within the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense  Authorization Act, which I will vote against. This provision, though  well intentioned, is poorly drafted and shows the deficit of proper  process.

Referred to as the BIOSECURE Act, Section 851 of the NDAA will only  apply to contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations  System--that is the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans  Affairs. This means that while Medicare and commercial-plan  beneficiaries will be able to access  the drugs captured by the BIOSECURE Act, veterans and service members  could be alienated from treatments and cures that are available to  other Americans. This bifurcation is not only unfair, it renders the  disincentive to biotechs ineffective.

In its form, this bill is not fit to function and makes no attempt to  support a domestic CDMO or CRO industry. It simply limits care and  cures for service members and veterans.
