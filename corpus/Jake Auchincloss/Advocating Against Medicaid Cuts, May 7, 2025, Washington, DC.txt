Advocating Against Medicaid Cuts


Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate against the  funding cuts to the Medicaid program that have been proposed for  consideration during the budget reconciliation process.

Specifically, the Energy and Commerce Committee, of which I am a  member, has been tasked with cutting $880 billion of Federal spending  across the healthcare programs it oversees, a vast majority of which  supports Medicaid.

Cutting this program will be used in service of tax cuts for people  who don't need tax cuts and will be devastating to children and  families who do need the healthcare.

Mr. Speaker, as we discuss cuts to this program, we must not forget  the people behind these budgetary numbers. As such, I will highlight  one Massachusetts family today. I will be reading a poem entitled,  ``The Mathematics of Mercy.'' It was written by Betsy Johnson. Betsy is  an autism educator with the ARC of Massachusetts and a mother of two  young adult children with autism and other intellectual disabilities.  They rely on Medicaid.

She shared this poem with me to highlight the importance of Medicaid  with her family and all families who care for their loved ones with  disabilities. It speaks more powerfully than any amount of budgetary  debate.       ``The Mathematics of Mercy'':      A direct care worker holds      Someone's universe for $16 an hour,      Lifts world, bathes dignity back into being      Her hands trembling now      As she reads the letter      Saying her client's hours are cut,      Knowing some bodies can't survive      On spreadsheet logic.      They speak of cuts in marble rooms,      Voices that have never whispered,      ``Your therapy is never medically necessary''      To a nonverbal child      Who just learned to make sounds      Like morning birds.      In living rooms turned sacred spaces,      Therapists pack up their tools of possibility--      Weighted vests, sensory brushes,      Piece of someone's future      Now deemed too expensive      By men who've never seen      How a body learns to trust itself      One careful touch at a time.      Listen to power chairs going still,      To screens falling dark in throats      That borrow them for voice,      To support workers saying goodbye      To people who stopped being clients      Somewhere between the first smile      And the last hug,      While offshore accounts grow fat      On the mathematics of suffering.      This is how a nation bleeds:      Not on battlefields but in group homes,      Not from enemy fire but from funding gaps,      Where independence becomes too expensive,      Where institution beds cost less      Than community care.      In the halls of power,      They call this fiscal responsibility      As if responsibility means      Telling a mother her daughter      Can no longer see the therapist      Who taught her how to speak,      As if America means      Pricing dignity like a luxury good.      Every denial letter bears      A signature of someone      Who has never watched a child      Take their first steps at 12,      Never seen the light in eyes      When words finally come,      Never felt the weight      Of a family's hopes      Balanced against      The coldness of cost.      Yet in these rooms where care persists,      Where love defies their calculations,      We piece together what they tear apart      Like a quilt of borrowed time,      With midnight shifts and morning prayers,      Hands that hold when budgets say let go.      Here, in this web of grace we weave,      Because what flows through us is stronger      Than their ledgers and our stubborn refusal      To let spreadsheets tell us what a life is worth.

Again, this comes from Betsy Johnson, an autism educator with the ARC  of Massachusetts.
