Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I am excited to congratulate the  University of Tennessee at Chattanooga men's basketball team on winning  the National Invitation Tournament in an exciting overtime victory to  bring the championship trophy home to Chattanooga and East Tennessee.

This nail-biting head-to-head had Chattanoogans on the edge of their  seat. As Chattanooga Mocs senior Garrison Keeslar drained a jumper with  11 seconds left in overtime, the Mocs' opponent, UC Irvine, launched a  Hail Mary pass to their player on the opposite baseline, who missed his  shot at the buzzer. This error delivered a well-deserved National  Championship to the UTC men's basketball team--the first ever in the  program's history.

The UTC Mocs have made Chattanooga and all of Tennessee so proud. I  join their families and friends with my immense respect for their  talents and new title--National Champions.

Go Mocs.
