Providing for Consideration of H.R. Law-Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act; Providing for Consideration of H.R. Undersea Cable Protection Act of Providing for Consideration of H.R. Securing America's Critical Minerals Supply Act; and for Other Purposes


Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Neguse for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues are trying to use today's  procedural rule vote to sneak in a provision that would block a vote on  Trump's tariffs for the next 6 months.

I have a bill to end Trump's tariffs on Mexico, the United States'  number one trading partner, that Republicans have been stalling for  months.

They have also blocked our bills to end the tariffs on Canada and the  so-called liberation day tariffs.

These tariffs have been a disaster for American families and  businesses. Domestic manufacturing is in a downturn. Farmers are  suffering, and the tariffs cost the average American household over  $1,000 per household in the last year alone, according to the  nonpartisan Tax Foundation.

Too many of our Republican colleagues would rather surrender their  congressional authority than stand up to Trump. They would rather cross  their fingers or pray that the Supreme Court settles this.

Let's be clear. A vote for this rule is a vote in favor of Trump's  illegal tariffs. It is a vote for higher costs for the American people,  and it is an abdication of our duty as Members of Congress.

I urge my colleagues, Republican and Democratic alike, to vote  ``no.''
