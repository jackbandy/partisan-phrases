Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 72.

I thank Ranking Member Meeks for his great leadership on this  critical issue.

It is time to end Trump's illegal tariffs on Canada, his tariffs on  United States' biggest trading partner, Mexico, and the so-called  liberation day tariffs. Congress has the power of the purse, not the  President. It is time that we take our power back from an executive who  is out of control.

Trump's tariffs have been a massive tax on the American people,  costing an average household $1,000 per household just in the last  year. These tariffs have led to slower job growth, a declining  manufacturing industry, and less investment. They have hurt our farmers  and increased food costs.

These tariffs have inflicted real damage on our relationship with  Canada. Canada isn't just our neighbor. It has historically been one of  our strongest military allies and biggest trading partners. Trump's  constant insults, threats, and these punishing tariffs have turned one  of our best friends away from us and toward the People's Republic of  China.

Enough is enough. It is time that we end this. I urge my colleagues,  Republicans and Democrats alike, send Trump a clear message that he  can't unilaterally wage a trade war against one of our strongest allies  and biggest trading partners.
