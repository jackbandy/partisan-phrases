Addressing the Housing Crisis


Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with deep concerns about the  Trump administration's policies that will increase homelessness in  America.

Last week, in the middle of the funding cycle, HUD changed their  Continuum of Care grant criteria, cutting funding for permanent support  of housing by over 50 percent.

Local housing organizations will owe landlords rent checks on January  1 with no guarantee they will have the funds. Mr. Speaker, 170,000 of  our fellow Americans will risk falling back into homelessness.

Before I served as mayor of Phoenix, I chaired Maricopa County's  Continuum of Care. We put our funding  where it made the biggest impact with proven and effective solutions  like permanent supportive housing.

That model provides stability and access to support services while  people get back on their feet. It helps some of our most vulnerable  Americans, those with debilitating disabilities, keep a roof over their  heads.

Mr. Speaker, behind every grant line item is a human being who has  overcome great adversity to achieve stability. Trump's cuts will undo  years of hard-won progress. These Americans deserve better from our  government.
