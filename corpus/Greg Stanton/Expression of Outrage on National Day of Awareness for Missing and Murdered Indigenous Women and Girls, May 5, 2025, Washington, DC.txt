Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise on the National Day of Awareness for  Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls to express my outrage  over more broken promises.

In my home State of Arizona, we are mourning the death of 14-year-old  Emily Pike, a member of the San Carlos Apache Tribe. Emily disappeared  from Mesa earlier this year and was  found brutally murdered 2 weeks later off of U.S. Highway 60.

Months later, her case remains unsolved. Emily Pike, like Hanna  Harris 30 years ago and hundreds and hundreds of native women and  girls, should be alive today.

It is far too common that their cases go cold and that loved ones are  left without answers and without justice.

To this day, the MMIP crisis remains the most underreported, under- discussed, and under-resourced tragedy in America, and Congress and  Presidents have promised for decades to do much more to address it.

Despite some progress towards justice for victims and their families,  Trump's budget announced Friday strips millions of dollars from public  safety and criminal justice programs across Indian Country. We have the  unique trust responsibility to our Tribal Nations and rarely, if ever,  has our Federal Government delivered.
