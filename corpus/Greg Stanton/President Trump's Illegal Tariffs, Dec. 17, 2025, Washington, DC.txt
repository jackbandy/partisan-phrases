President Trump's Illegal Tariffs


Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, no matter who you are shopping for this  holiday season, you will be paying a lot more due to Trump's illegal  tariffs.

Prices for toys and games are up 17 percent. Clothing and shoes are  up 20 percent. Electronics are up 34 percent.  Home and kitchen gifts are up a whopping 38 percent.

Too many Arizona families are getting squeezed, and their paychecks  are buying less and less. Joy and happiness are being replaced with  stress and fear, fear that they can't provide for their families, and  fear that things aren't getting any better.

Until Congress stands up to Trump and his illegal, reckless tariffs,  things won't get better. Arizona families will continue to face  uncertainty, but the Speaker of this House is about to send Congress  home for the holidays without a single vote to rein in the President's  abuse of tariff power, not one vote.

Enough is enough. House Republicans need to stand up for their  constituents, stand up to Trump, and put an end to this tax on American  families.
