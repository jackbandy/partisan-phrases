Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the tragic loss of  Officer Gabriel Facio of the Apache Junction Police Department.

This past Sunday, 6 days after being shot while responding to a road- rage incident, Officer Facio passed away from his injuries at just 47  years old.

Officer Facio lived the American Dream. Born in Mexico, Officer Facio  earned his U.S. citizenship and dedicated his life to serving the  community that welcomed him with open arms.

He began his law enforcement career with the Phoenix Police  Department, and nearly 4 years ago joined the Apache Junction Police  Department.

A devoted father and grandfather, a respected colleague, an  upstanding American, he served Apache Junction with honor, bravery, and  compassion. Tragically, he is the fourth Arizona officer to fall in the  line of duty in just the past 12 months.

My thoughts are with his wife, family, his many good friends, and  colleagues. I hope his memory brings comfort and strength in the  difficult days ahead.

Officer Facio's ultimate sacrifice, his courage, and his selflessness  will never be forgotten.
