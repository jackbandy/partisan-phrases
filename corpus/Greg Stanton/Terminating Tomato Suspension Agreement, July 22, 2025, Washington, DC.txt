Terminating Tomato Suspension Agreement


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694013/terminating-tomato-suspension-agreement


Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  Department of Commerce's decision to terminate the Tomato Suspension  Agreement and slap a 20 percent tariff on tomatoes imported from  Mexico.

This is a political choice that directly raises prices on American  families and hurts American workers and businesses. It hits Arizona's  economy especially hard. Nearly half of all tomatoes imported from  Mexico come through our State.

This industry supports more than 22,000 jobs in Arizona, 50,000  nationally, and Trump's tomato tax puts $8.3 billion in economic  activity at risk. In fact, 136 Arizona businesses have formally urged  the Department of Commerce to preserve the Tomato Suspension Agreement:  restaurants, retailers, trucking companies, and chambers of commerce.

This is all to overturn an effective and enforceable agreement that  has been in place for almost 30 years, and it drives us away from  Mexico at a time when we should be expanding our relationship with  Arizona's and America's largest trading partner.

Ending the Tomato Suspension Agreement will lead to higher tomato  prices and shortages around the country. I urge the Commerce Department  to reverse course.
