Enough of Trump's Chaos

Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, after Trump's so-called Liberation Day, the  stock market cratered. American businesses halted investments because  of the economic uncertainty. Families in Arizona saw their retirement  accounts and 401(k)'s nosedive. The biggest financial firms in the  country predicted a recession.

Now, of course, President Trump caved today, and that was actually  the right thing to do. While this constant whiplash may make for a good  episode of ``The Apprentice,'' it is no way to run the most powerful  Nation and the largest economy in the world.

The Framers of the Constitution wisely gave Congress, not the  President, power over trade and international commerce. My colleagues  and I introduced a resolution to this body  yesterday reasserting that critical authority.

Even a few brave Republicans are willing to stand up to President  Trump and their own party on this critical issue. Sadly, Speaker  Johnson decided to go a different direction. He tucked language into a  procedural vote that bans these Republican and Democratic resolutions  from coming to the floor for a vote--not even a vote. He is trying to  avoid Republicans going on record against supporting Trump's chaos  because he knows the American people are sick and tired of this.

Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker.
