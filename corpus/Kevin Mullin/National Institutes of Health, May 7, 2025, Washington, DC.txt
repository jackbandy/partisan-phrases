National Institutes of Health

Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Trump  administration's proposal to gut the National Institutes of Health.

Put simply, NIH's work is the difference between life and death for  millions of Americans. Almost everyone knows someone who has lost a  loved one to cancer or Alzheimer's, and cutting NIH funding will halt  progress on developing cures for these diseases, just as we are on the  cusp of once-in-a-generation advancements.

Mr. Speaker, 99 percent of all FDA-approved therapies between 2010  and 2019 were tied to NIH-funded science. Thanks to its research, heart  disease deaths dropped 75 percent over the past 40 years.

If the majority wants to have a debate about whether it is worth  curing diseases, then let's have it. I invite my colleagues to explain  to their constituents why they are fighting cancer or Alzheimer's.

Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to reject those devastating cuts and  stand up for the well-being of the American people.
