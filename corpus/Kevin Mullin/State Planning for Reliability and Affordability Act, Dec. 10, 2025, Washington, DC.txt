State Planning for Reliability and Affordability Act


Mr. MULLIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the so- called State Planning for Reliability and Affordability Act. This  measure will encourage State regulators to push our grid toward more  expensive and polluting sources of energy at the very moment families  are struggling with rising energy bills.

Across this country, households and small businesses are seeing  electricity costs rise by hundreds of dollars. Demand for power is  rising quickly, and this year, utilities have already proposed major  rate hikes to the tune of $34 billion. Instead of helping lower bills  with forward-looking technology, this legislation takes us backward,  effectively promoting energy sources that take longer to build and  deploy and cost more to operate.

These are costs that will be passed on directly to everyday  Americans.

This comes 1 year after President Trump promised to cut energy prices  in half. Instead, on his watch, prices are rising. According to  multiple press reports, he privately urged oil executives to spend $1  billion in support of his campaign last year in exchange for promoting  their interests as President.

Perhaps it is no surprise we are seeing policies that benefit the  most expensive energy sources instead of the cheapest options available  to consumers.

Utility-scale solar and wind are the lowest-cost sources of new power  today. Together with battery storage, they can be built quickly,  strengthen reliability, and keep bills down. This bill undermines State  planning processes that would promote reliable and cheap sources of  energy, which also happen to be the cleanest. It limits choice and will  slow energy innovation, keeping prices higher than they need to be.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and work  together on real solutions that lower energy bills for the American  people.
