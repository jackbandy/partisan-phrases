Stopping Unregulated Biological Laboratories

Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a serious  and growing public safety and public health concern that I think  requires congressional action. It is the operation of illegal and  unregulated biological laboratories that we see in communities  throughout our country.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting legislation that I have  introduced from the House committee recommendations. They are the  Preventing Illegal Laboratories and Protecting Public Health Act and  the STOP Health Threats Act.

Many of us became aware of this issue in the San Joaquin Valley in  2023 when an illegal biolab was discovered operating in my district in  Reedley, California. Local officials uncovered a clandestine operation  storing biological materials, laboratory equipment, medical waste, and  dangerous, dangerous pathogens like malaria, like COVID, like HIV.  There were thousands of laboratory mice in unsafe conditions.

All of this was inside a warehouse located near residential areas. It  was not a licensed facility. It was operating in the shadows without  proper licensing or permits. Why? Ostensibly, the reason was to develop  medical kits for COVID testing and for pregnancy testing. Clearly, that  was not the case.

Local authorities initially lacked the clear tools and resources to  determine what hazards they were dealing with or how to safely respond.  The situation placed local law enforcement officers, code enforcement  staff, and nearby residents at serious risk.

It required coordination of local, State, and Federal agencies to  fully assess the threat and dismantle this operation. It was slow in  coming.

Now, over the weekend, some of my colleagues have probably noted a  national story in Las Vegas, where there was the report of a discovery  of a new lab and that materials were under investigation related to the  illegal biolab that was created in 2023 in Reedley, California. This  does not surprise me.

We cannot assume that communities across the country are immune from  similar risks. Many jurisdictions simply do not have the expertise or  Federal support needed to quickly identify and respond to unauthorized  biological operations. That is why I have introduced legislation based  upon committee recommendations.

This is bipartisan legislation aimed at strengthening Federal  coordination, improving oversight, and helping close regulatory blind  spots that have allowed unauthorized facilities to operate undetected.  We hope this will ensure local communities have the access and the  resources necessary when a biological threat emerges.

Too often, local officials are asking: Who do we call? Who has the  authority? Who has the expertise? Our legislation helps answer those  questions before another emergency unfolds.

Mr. Speaker, first responders should not have to walk into an unknown  biological environment without clear Federal support. Parents should  not have to worry about hazardous material being stored in facilities  next door to schools and residential areas. Communities deserve  transparency and safeguards, whether the incident occurs in California,  Nevada, or anywhere else in the country.

It is important that we protect our constituents from a larger  crisis. The legislation would strengthen oversight, coordination, and  response mechanisms that can prevent confusion and reduce the risks.

I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to review these two pieces  of legislation and to become cosponsors. Together, we can ensure that  Federal agencies, State authorities, and local communities are better  equipped to address these unauthorized biological operations that would  prevent threats in their areas. The public demands that we provide  preparedness, and preparedness demands action.

Let me also thank local officials that acted responsibly when it was  first determined they had a problem. They include Code Officer Jesalyn  Harper from the city of Reedley, City Manager Nicole Zieba; mayor of  the city, Mayor Tuttle, of the city council; and Supervisor Nathan  Magsig. All of these individuals worked together with our office to, in  fact, act on the situation in Reedley, California.

Mr. Speaker, I urge that we act on this legislation so that people  around the country can feel safe from any kind of illegal biological  labs that may crop up in their communities. Together, we can close  these gaps, support the communities, and keep our constituents safe.
