Applauding Stabilizing Crime Victims Fund

Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, as the Representative of California's 21st  Congressional District, I am here to share some good news for the  people of not only the Central Valley but across the country. The House  has just passed the Crime Victims Fund Stabilization Act, with strong  bipartisan support.

As one of the original founders of the bipartisan Congressional  Victims' Rights Caucus, this is good news. I am proud to co-lead the  bill alongside a bipartisan group of colleagues.

Right now, too many victim service organizations are forced to  operate with uncertainty, not knowing if funding will be there from  year to year. That uncertainty affects real people who have been  victims of crime, survivors seeking counseling, families needing  emergency shelter, and victims looking for legal support in some of the  hardest moments in their lives.

This bill stabilizes the Crime Victims Fund, which is funded by  criminal fines, not taxpayer dollars, and supports critical services  through VOCA programs across the country.

By bringing stability to the funding, States and local organizations  will have the ability to plan ahead, keep staff in place, and continue  showing up for survivors when it matters most.

This bill heads to the Senate, and I am urging my colleagues there to  act quickly on its passage for victims of crime and their families.
