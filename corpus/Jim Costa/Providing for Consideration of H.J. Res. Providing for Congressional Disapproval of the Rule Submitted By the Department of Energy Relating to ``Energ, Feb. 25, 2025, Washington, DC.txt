Providing for Consideration of H.J. Res. Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Department of Energy Relating to ``Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer Gas-Fired Instantaneous Water Heaters''; Providing for Consideration of H.J. Res. Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Environmental Protection Agency Relating to ``Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems: Procedures for Facilitating Compliance, Including Netting and Exemptions''; and Providing for Consideration of H. Con. Res. Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this rule that enables a  reckless Republican budget resolution to go forward. Let me tell you  why.

Republicans claim to be lowering costs, but their plan, in my view,  does just the opposite.

Let me bring it all home. In California's 21st Congressional District  which I have the honor and privilege to represent, the wonderful people  in the San Joaquin Valley, 456,532 people could lose their Medicaid  under this rule and budget resolution.

Under this rule and resolution, 131,000 people could lose their SNAP  benefits.

Over 25,000 people could lose coverage through the Affordable Health  Care Act. We have made remarkable progress as a result of the  Affordable Health Care Act, reducing the number of people without  insurance in our constituency to less than 10 percent. That would be  changed.

There would be $3 million in energy and conservation funds that would  be withheld from farmers in my district.

If you want to put the American people first, we must reject this  debacle and begin on a real bipartisan basis to pass a budget that fits  the American people.
