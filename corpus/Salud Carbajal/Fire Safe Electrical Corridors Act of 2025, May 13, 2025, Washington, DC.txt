Fire Safe Electrical Corridors Act of 2025


Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I extend my thanks to Chairman Westerman  and Ranking Member Huffman for their support in advancing my bipartisan  legislation, Fire Safe Electrical Corridors Act, which I introduced  with Representatives Valadao, Costa, and Fitzpatrick.

My Fire Safe Electrical Corridors Act is a commonsense solution to  help us reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires. It simply allows the  United States Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management to  approve the removal of hazardous trees or vegetation near power lines  on Federal land without the need for a timber sale.

Unfortunately, catastrophic wildfires continue to ravage the Western  United States, and we need commonsense solutions that balance  sustainable forest management practices with reducing wildfire risks.  My legislation strives to find that solution and that balance.

Currently, the United States Forest Service allows utility companies  to cut down trees and branches in existing utility corridors. However,  the dead vegetation cannot be removed from Federal land without a  timber sale. This has created unnecessary red tape and led to the  buildup of dry fuels around utility lines.

We cannot continue with the status quo. Inaction can be deadly. I  know because we have seen it. The 2017 Thomas fire, which created the  conditions for the deadly Montecito debris flow that killed 23 people  in my district. The 2018 Camp fire and the 2021 Dixie fire were all  started by electrical equipment. These fires were some of the largest  and most destructive fires in California's history.

If we can take action to help save lives and protect property, we  should. While there is more work ahead of us to continue to reduce the  risk of wildfires, this is an important step. I am glad to be able to  work with my colleagues across the aisle to get this done.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important piece  of legislation.
