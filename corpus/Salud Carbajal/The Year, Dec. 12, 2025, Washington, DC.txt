The Year


Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, each year, I have the privilege of  honoring women on the Central Coast who have made a meaningful impact  in our community through the Women of the Year Award. This year, it is  my pleasure to recognize JoAnne Meade Young of Santa Barbara,  California, for her outstanding contributions to education and  community leadership.

JoAnne's lifelong commitment to educational equity was shaped early  in life. Born on February 11, 1946, she attended a segregated two-room  Catholic school--an experience that profoundly influenced her  dedication to ensuring that low-income children, children of color, and  students with learning disabilities received equitable access to  learning and support.

JoAnne began her career in Ohio, where she served in Title 1 schools  as a Primary Language Development Specialist and later as a Library  Media Specialist. Her talent for instructional leadership led her to  Middletown, Connecticut, where she became an Instructional Consultant  responsible for diagnostic testing and monitoring literacy and math  programs. In 1987, JoAnne made history as the first Black principal in  the Hamden Connecticut School District.

After relocating to Santa Barbara in 1990, JoAnne once again broke  barriers, becoming the first Black principal in Santa Barbara County  when she was appointed principal of Mountain View School in Goleta.  Over the next 17 years, she served as principal of Brandon, El Rancho,  and Ellwood Schools and directed the Goleta State Preschool. Throughout  her career, JoAnne centered the well-being and success of all students.  She introduced innovative enrichment opportunities--including drumming  circles, swing dancing, and visiting artist programs--and organized a  Spring Sing performance at UCSB's Campbell Hall that brought together  hundreds of students and families.

Following her retirement in 2007, JoAnne continued her public service  by directing the Santa Barbara County Spelling Bee, co-founding the  Santa Barbara Martin Luther King, Jr. Committee, and serving on the  board of the Family Service Agency. She remains a dedicated community  leader through her work with Democratic Women of Santa Barbara County  where she is Treasurer and Tri-Chair of Membership & Community  Engagement, and she represents District 2 as a Commissioner for Women.

In 2024, she was elected to the Democratic Central Committee for  District 2 and was honored as Women of the Year by California State  Senator Monique Limon.

It is with great pride that I honor JoAnne Meade Young as a 2025  Woman of the Year for her exceptional leadership, her steadfast  advocacy for educational equity, and her lasting impact on the Santa  Barbara community. Her work has enriched generations of students and  continues to strengthen the Central Coast.
