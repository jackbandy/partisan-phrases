Controlled Substance Onboard Vessels

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2351, a bill requiring the  Coast Guard to have a substantive policy on treating drug overdoses  onboard vessels and also ensuring that the Coast Guard has the legal  authority to prosecute certain drug smuggling cases.

I would also like to express my thanks for the bipartisan leadership  of Chair Sam Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Subcommittee Chair  Ezell.

This bill will strengthen the Coast Guard's ability to meet a core  mission, saving lives. As we all know, the Coast Guard is involved in  high-risk drug interdiction missions, as well as recreational boating  oversight where drugs may also be present.

This bill requires the Coast Guard to update its policy on carrying  and utilizing medications to treat drug overdoses such as naloxone.

Further, the bill ensures access to these medications at every  installation and operational unit. As we all understand, handling drugs  like cocaine and fentanyl is an exceptionally risky endeavor, and  ensuring the Coast Guard has the necessary medication to prevent  someone from losing a life is critical.

In addition, this bill also provides the Coast Guard with the ability  to prosecute drug smuggling cases when the vessel operator is not  physically onboard.

As technology continues to evolve and transnational criminal  organizations get savvier and more sophisticated with their operations,  this levels the playing field and helps the United States hold these  unmanned vessel operators accountable.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support my colleagues who have worked on  this important bipartisan legislation, and I look forward to seeing it  passed into law.

Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 2351, I encourage my  colleagues to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.
