Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, I thank Representative Scott for yielding.

Mr. Chair, in the spirit of bipartisanship, I rise to speak in  support of my colleague from Georgia's amendment to authorize the  Baltic Security Initiative.

This amendment comes up at a crucial time. Just last week, the  administration announced the U.S. would be pulling out of all security  assistance programs for Europe, including the BSI.

I have had the privilege of traveling to the Baltic. When we speak  with the people there, it is not a question of if Russia will invade.  It is a matter of when. Now is the time to stand firm in our support of  these allied nations to deter Russian aggression.

What type of signal does cutting support send to the Kremlin? Cutting  off the BSI is a massive gift to Putin.

Deterring a war between Russia and NATO is in our best national  security interests.

Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote.

Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner).
