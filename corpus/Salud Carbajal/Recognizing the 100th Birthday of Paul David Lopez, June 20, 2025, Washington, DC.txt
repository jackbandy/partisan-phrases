Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an  extraordinary American and beloved member of the Santa Barbara  community, Paul David Lopez, as he celebrates his 100th birthday on  June 22, 2025.

Born in Santa Barbara, California, in 1925 in a home his father built  by hand, Mr. Lopez's life has been a shining example of courage,  service, and commitment to country and community. A proud son of the  Eastside, Paul attended Franklin Elementary, Santa Barbara Junior High,  and Santa Barbara High School. In 1943, during what would have been his  senior year, Paul made the brave and selfless decision to leave school  and enlist in the United States Navy during World War II.

Assigned as a 20-millimeter antiaircraft gunner aboard the USS  Maryland, Paul served with distinction in some of the most  consequential battles in the Pacific theater, including Kwajalein,  Saipan, Tinian, Leyte Gulf, and Okinawa. He survived torpedo attacks,  kamikaze strikes, and the historic Typhoon Louise while stationed in  Okinawa. His dedication and bravery reflect the very best of our  Greatest Generation.

After returning home in 1946, Paul built a new life while continuing  to serve. He was later recalled to Active Duty during the Korean war,  where he was stationed in the Marshall Islands as part of a Seabee unit  maintaining critical airfields. Upon his second honorable discharge,  Paul began a long and respected career at the University of California,  Santa Barbara, where he worked for over four decades, retiring in 1990  as the longest-serving employee in the campus' history.

Paul married Gladys Cota in 1958, becoming a devoted husband and  loving father to Marcia, Ronald, and Paula. Known fondly as ``Uncle  Paulie'' and ``The Mayor of Chino Street,'' he and Gladys became  cherished pillars of Santa Barbara's Westside, mentoring and caring for  generations of local children with wisdom and heart.

In a touching full-circle moment, Paul walked down the hill at  Peabody Stadium in 2013 to receive his long-overdue Santa Barbara High  School diploma, graduating alongside his grandson, Diego, nearly 70  years after he left school to serve his country.

Mr. Speaker, on this occasion of his 100th birthday, we recognize  Paul David Lopez not just for the longevity of his years, but for the  richness of his legacy. He is a war hero, a public servant, a family  man, and a treasured friend to so many. It is an honor to celebrate his  century of life, sacrifice, and service.

Happy 100th birthday to Paul. I thank him for everything he has  given--to his Nation, to his community, and to all of us.
