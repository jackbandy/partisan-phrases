Secure Our Ports Act of 2025


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692208/secure-our-ports-act-of-2025


Mr. Speaker, if the port congestion and vessel backlogs associated  with the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it is the importance of  a resilient supply chain.

H.R. 252, the Secure Our Ports Act, works to minimize interference in  U.S. ports from foreign adversaries. In order to ensure the free flow  of cargo into and out of our country, we must ensure full control over  and investment in our ports.

I am proud to have voted in support of the bipartisan infrastructure  law, which provided $2.5 billion of investment in port infrastructure.

We all now understand the importance of a strong resilient supply  chain, and this bill is a step in the right direction.

I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure robust funding  for the maritime industry. For this reason, I will vote ``yes'' on H.R.  252.

Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, to close, I support H.R. 252 and urge my  colleagues to do the same.
