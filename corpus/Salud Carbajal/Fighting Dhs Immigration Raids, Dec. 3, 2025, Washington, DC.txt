Fighting Dhs Immigration Raids

Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I represent California's Central Coast  where close to half of our residents are Latino and where farmworkers  are essential pillars of our community.

Since Trump's return to the White House, our community has  experienced an unprecedented level of chaos, fear from ICE raids, and  family separations. I witnessed one of these raids myself in  Carpinteria, California, where ICE agents unleashed a disproportionate  show of force.

What I saw was completely unacceptable, masked ICE agents in military  gear firing tear gas and other projectiles into a crowd of peaceful  civilians and reporters. Even a child was injured by shrapnel.

Upon seeing these violent tactics, I demanded to speak to the person  in charge, but I was denied.

As the elected Representative of the Central Coast, I have a duty to  respond to my constituents and demand accountability for ICE's actions  that day.

Sadly, this has not been an isolated incident. Throughout the year,  ICE has carried out aggressive, indiscriminate, and often unjustified  operations across our country, actions that erode our freedom and  undermine our civil rights and public trust in government.

ICE claims they need to be aggressive to keep us safe, but how does  harassing law-abiding farmworkers, families, and children make anyone  safer?

While I agree our immigration system is broken, cruelty is not the  solution. Harassment is not reform.

We must continue to shine a light on the Trump administration's  abuses. We must enact legislation that holds ICE accountable and builds  a fair immigration system.

At the end of the day, this is about who we are as a Nation. True  reform is possible, and I will keep fighting to make it happen.
