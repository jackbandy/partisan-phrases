Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sergeant Kevin  Kallinen, who retired on August 13, for his remarkable 45\1/2\ years of  service to the Grand Forks Police Department.

Sergeant Kallinen holds the record as the longest serving sworn  officer in the department's history, a distinction earned through  dedication, remaining calm under pressure, and an unwavering commitment  to public safety.

He began his law enforcement career at just 20 years old and joined  the Grand Forks Police Department in 1980. Promoted to sergeant in  1997, he chose to remain on patrol where each day brought the  opportunity to meet people, solve problems, and make a difference in  his community.

On behalf of North Dakota, I congratulate Sergeant Kallinen on this  incredible milestone and thank him for his decades of faithful service.  His story will live on for years to come as a truly remarkable  achievement.
