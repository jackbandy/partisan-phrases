Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2026


Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, first I want to commend Chairman   Tom  Cole for leading the appropriations process as intended by our  Founders.

Fiscal year `26 will mark the first time in decades that Congress has  funded the Federal Government through all 12 appropriations bills  without reverting to a yearlong continuing resolution. As a freshman, I  committed to working this process to this end during my time in  Congress. I never dreamed I would see it my first year. I thank Mr.  Cole for his leadership.

Now, I rise today on behalf of North Dakota farmers and rural  communities to support the step included in this measure to move  forward on year-round E15.

Farmers are hurting. Across the country, input costs and interest  costs are up. Our producers are also dealing with tariff pressures and  shifting markets, and at the same time, commodity prices are down. That  is a difficult combination for anyone.

The future of many farm families hangs in the balance both in my  State and many others throughout the heartland.

Year-round E15 offers immediate relief without costing the Federal  Government anything. This is a top priority for farmers in my State and  across our Nation. E15 provides an immediate, strong, domestic market  for their bountiful harvest.

E15 is homegrown energy. Year-round E15 eliminates regulatory  uncertainty that prevents the industry from flourishing. It will add  $25.3 billion to the U.S. GDP and support more than 128,000 full-time  jobs. President Trump and Secretary Rollins support this effort. Rural  America is counting on us to deliver.

Mr. Speaker, please join me, and let's get this done.
