Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight 10 provisions  in the House-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, 10 commonsense reforms  that too often get overlooked.

One, the bill modernizes our air traffic control system;

Two, it reforms student loans to reduce student loan debt and debt  burdens;

Three, it helps farmers by increasing reference prices and  strengthening crop insurance;

Four, it ensures EV drivers pay their fair share for the roads  because everyone who uses roads should help pay for them;

Five, it reopens Federal lands for energy and mineral development,  restoring American energy leadership;

Six, it unlocks spectrum for auction so we can roll out faster 5G;

Seven, it restocks our military, delivering peace through strength;

Eight, it invests $10 billion in border security or more;

Nine, it eliminates the $200 Federal tax on suppressors; and,

Ten, last but not least, it ends Federal subsidies for wind and  solar.
