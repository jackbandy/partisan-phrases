Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a significant  milestone in America's push for critical mineral independence.

Last week, I joined Talon Metals to celebrate the new Beulah Minerals  Processing Facility, which will process high-grade nickel and copper,  just like this, from Talon's high-tech, environmentally friendly mine  in Minnesota.

They will turn it into materials for our defense, aerospace, and  energy industries, all while reducing our reliance on adversaries like  China and Russia.

North Dakota has been abundantly blessed with natural resources, but  our greatest resource is our mentality. We build, innovate, and solve  problems. This project is another great example of that.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Talon Metals and the Beulah community for  this amazing project.
