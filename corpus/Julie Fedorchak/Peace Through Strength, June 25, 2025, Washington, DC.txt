Peace Through Strength

Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the national  security investments in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, investments  that reaffirm President Trump's commitment to peace through strength.

This bill delivers $25 billion for the Golden Dome missile defense  system, our answer to hypersonic and NextGen threats from adversaries  like China and Iran.

It expands our naval fleet, restocks our munitions, modernizes our  nuclear deterrent, and accelerates the delivery of Next Generation  aircraft and autonomous systems.

Just as important, it puts our troops first, with $8.5 billion to  improve barracks, housing, healthcare, childcare, and career support  for military families.

At a time when global threats are growing, this bill ensures America  leads from a position of strength, not weakness. It is a generational  investment in the safety of our country, the security of our allies,  and the brave men and women who defend our freedom.

Let's get this bill to President Trump's desk.
