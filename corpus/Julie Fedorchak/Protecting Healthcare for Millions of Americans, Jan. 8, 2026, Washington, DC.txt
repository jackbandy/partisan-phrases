Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be here today as a  freshman Member. I didn't know Doug long, but I met him on one of our  first days in the orientation sessions and the planning sessions for  Congress. He was warm. He was friendly. He was helpful to a new  freshman who didn't know much.

From there, I learned how fun he was. He loved to play with my last  name, ``Fedorchak.'' He used to say: ``How much wood could a Fedorchak  chuck if a Fedorchak could chuck wood?''

It always made me laugh. I also learned quickly that not only was he  fun but he was thoughtful, he was pragmatic, and he was a really,  really good thinker. I turned to him on issues that I found to be  difficult. I wanted to get his thoughts on them.

He was a strong conservative. He was warm, kind, and principled. In  my mind, he was exactly the kind of leader that Americans want. He is  going to be dearly missed. I feel robbed that I didn't get to work with  him more, and I will keep him and his family in my prayers.
