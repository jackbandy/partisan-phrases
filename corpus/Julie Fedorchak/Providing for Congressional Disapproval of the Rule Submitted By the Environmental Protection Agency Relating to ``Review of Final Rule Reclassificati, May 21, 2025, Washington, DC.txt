Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my  resolution to repeal the Biden administration's eleventh hour  reinstatement of the ``once in, always in'' rule and to counter some of  the misinformation being shared on this rule by my colleagues on the  other side.

I am a mom of three. When my kids were growing up, they woke up every  Saturday morning to a job list, and they couldn't get their allowance  until they completed the jobs on the list. They were motivated to get  their jobs done by that allowance, and I would have had very little  luck incentivizing them to do their jobs if they never received their  promised reward.

This is a law of human nature. People respond to incentives and  rewards, which underscores the main problem with the ``once in, always  in'' rule. There is no incentive to invest.

This misguided regulation permanently classifies certain industrial  facilities as major sources, major sources of hazardous air pollutants  even after they have made significant investments to reduce the  emissions below the Federal threshold.

Mr. Speaker, think about that for a minute. They invest millions of  dollars to modernize their operations, improve efficiency, and reduce  emissions only for the Federal Government to permanently classify their  business as a major source, stuck with the same costly regulations.

That is not smart policy. That is counterproductive. By refusing to  let businesses reclassify after making progress, after meeting the  standards, this rule removes any real incentive to invest in cleaner  technologies.

Our energy producers in North Dakota have invested $2 billion in  emissions control technology. They have done this because they care  about our communities and environment. In fact, North Dakota exports  thousands of megawatts of electricity every year.

We are the third largest oil- and gas-producing State in the Nation,  and we are one of only four States in the Nation that has never  violated Federal air quality standards. That is not an accident. That  is the result of smart investments, cutting-edge technology, and a  commitment to responsible energy production.

North Dakota is proof that we can grow the economy, power the  country, and protect the environment at the same time.

This bureaucratic rule ignores these successful efforts. It removes  the incentive to innovate and locks facilities into restrictive  regulations, even when they are trying to reduce emissions and operate  more efficiently.

It is not just a problem for North Dakota. This rule affects  manufacturers, energy producers, and small businesses all over the  country. This approach raises costs, discourages innovation, and forces  companies to think twice before making long-term investments in cleaner  technologies.

This is not how to build a stronger economy or a cleaner future, and  it is not how to make things more affordable for Americans.

Our Nation's energy future should be driven by innovation. American  technological innovation have allowed us to reduce emissions more than  any other Nation since 2005, all while achieving record energy  production.

We need a regulatory framework that incentivizes innovation and  rewards it when it happens. That means eliminating one-size-fits-all  regulations like the ``once in, always in'' rule.

Supporting this resolution means supporting American energy jobs,  lower prices, and fostering a regulatory environment where businesses  can thrive while safeguarding the environment.

I want to underscore that this resolution is not about allowing  facilities to maintain high pollutant levels. It is about incentivizing  them to reduce emissions and rewarding them when they do. That is how  we both expand energy production and protect our environment.

I thank Senator  John Curtis of Utah for his leadership on this  resolution in the Senate, and I urge my colleagues in the House to  support this resolution.
