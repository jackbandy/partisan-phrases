Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize WDAY Chief  Meteorologist John Wheeler.

On May 16, tomorrow, John will deliver his final forecast, sunsetting  a memorable 40-year broadcasting career.

John joined WDAY in 1985 as the station's first on-air meteorologist.  Since then, he has weathered it all, guiding North Dakotans through  blizzards, floods, and drought, always with steady insight, clear  instructions, and a partly sunny optimism, even on the coldest North  Dakota days.

Let's be honest: Being a weatherman in North Dakota, in my State, is  no easy task. While our weather is reliably unpredictable, John was  always a high-pressure system of calm and confidence, helping farmers,  families, and everyone in between plan for a smooth day ahead.

As John enters retirement, the forecast looks great. I see clear  skies ahead, wind at his back, and hopefully an extended period of  sunshine.

I thank John for helping us weather so many storms, and I wish him  the very best in this new season of life.
