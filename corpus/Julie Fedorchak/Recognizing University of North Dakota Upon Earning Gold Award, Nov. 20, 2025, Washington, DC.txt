Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the University  of North Dakota for earning the Gold Award as a 2025-2026 Military  Friendly School.

UND was named among the nation's top 10 military-spouse friendly  schools nationwide. This honor places UND in the top 10 percent of  universities across the U.S. for its commitment to serving our  servicemembers, veterans, and their families.

UND's leadership reflects a long tradition of service that dates back  to its founding. This gold recognition marks a proud milestone,  especially with more than 2,000 military-affiliated students enrolled  this year.

From peer-to-peer mentoring to faculty training and veteran advocacy,  UND continues to raise the standard for how universities can support  members of our military.

I congratulate President Armacost, Director Angie Carpenter, and the  entire UND community for their dedication to those who defend our  freedoms.
