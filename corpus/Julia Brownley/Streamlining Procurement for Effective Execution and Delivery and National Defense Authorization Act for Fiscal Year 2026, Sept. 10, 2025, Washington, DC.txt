Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.

Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to amendment No. 20,  which would place a blanket statutory ban on any DOD research,  development, procurement, or promotion when it comes to cultivated  cell-based meat.

Let's be clear. This isn't about whether the Pentagon is going to  serve cultivated meat tomorrow. It is about whether we let our military  continue doing what it has always done best, and that is preparing for  the future.

Readiness has always been America's edge. Our military leads the  world because we don't close doors. We open them. We evaluate every  tool, every technology, and every option that might keep our  servicemembers better supplied and better prepared for future missions.  This amendment does just the opposite. It ties our hands. It says:  Don't even consider it.

Meanwhile, China has already made cultivated meat a national priority  in its 5-year plan. They are scaling up production, while countries  like Singapore, Israel, Australia, and the U.K. are moving forward, as  well.

If cultivated meat helps deliver cheaper, scaleable protein solutions  worldwide, do we really want China setting the standards, dominating  the intellectual property, and reaping the jobs this burgeoning  industry creates?

Mr. Chair, I have spoken directly with senior DOD officials who have  shared with me the potential benefits cultivated meat could bring to  readiness. This includes from operating in harsh bases to sustaining  missions where supply lines are contested or disrupted.

Keeping the option open for DOD research and evaluation ensures we  remain competitive and ensures U.S. leadership in the broader protein  biotech space that underpins global supply chains.

Voting ``no'' on this amendment preserves the military's discretion-- let me say that again--preserves the military's discretion to explore  technology that could strengthen readiness, create U.S. jobs, and help  maintain our competitive edge.

This ban doesn't save money, and it doesn't improve readiness. All it  does is close off technology others are racing to develop while handing  China a free lane in a strategic biotech domain.

Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment to  ensure DOD can test, validate, or reject technology on the merits, not  because of shortsighted, anti-science ideology.

Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Chair, I would just say that, yes, I want to be  competitive with China's military and their readiness first and  foremost.

Second, our DOD officials are talking about the future. They are not  talking about today. They are talking about preparedness for the  future.

Mr. Chair, if you want a ribeye steak, cultivated meats can create  that, and I assure you it will be delicious. They will love it, and  they will not know the difference. Our military will not know the  difference.

Mr. Chair, if we take this even out of the military, this is about  investing in a new industry in our country that both Democrats and  Republicans support because it is an opportunity for us to move and  lead this, as opposed to China, Singapore, Israel, or Australia, which  are already leading in this.

We want to be competitive in the global marketplace. We want our  military to be ready.

This is about the future. This is about research. This is about  science saying it is either good or bad, but to move forward with the  research so that we know what our options are for the future for our  military, which might be deployed to an offshore island somewhere,  where there is no access to food whatsoever except for what they can  develop.

Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
