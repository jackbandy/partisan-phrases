Capital Jewish Museum Shooting

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last night, just a few blocks from here,  at the Capital Jewish Museum, a scourge of anti-Semitism reared its  ugly head yet again in America. The sickening, cold-blooded murder of  two Jewish staffers of the Israeli Embassy seems to be another horrific  incident of anti-Semitism, which we all know is much too rampant in our  society.

Yaron Lischinsky, Sarah Milgrim--may their memories be a blessing.

Such a blatant and targeted act of anti-Semitism, right here in the  Nation's Capital, should outrage everybody--a beautiful young couple  about to be married just starting their lives, gunned down seemingly  because they were Jewish.

Let this be a call to all of us: We must never allow the malicious  poison of anti-Semitism to fester and flourish. While we still must  learn more about this tragic incident, we do know that when anti- Semitism is rife in the air, all kinds of individuals cling to it and,  sometimes, unfortunately, act on it.

This morning, I am praying for those who were killed in this  senseless act of violence, all those affected, and their families.
