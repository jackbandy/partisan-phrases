Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on Newark Airport, for months and now  especially this week, Americans flying in and out of Newark Airport  have experienced increasing delays and disruptions. Airlines are  canceling flights. There is a shortage of air traffic controllers. They  are relying on 1990s technology in 2025. One Newark air traffic  controller even said that flying into Newark is ``not safe.''

Keeping the flying public safe and our national air space efficient  is the responsibility of Donald Trump's FAA. They are failing  spectacularly. So today, I am demanding a full Inspector General Office  investigation into what happened at Newark so these problems do not get  worse or spread to other airports around the Nation. I am demanding  that the OIG, the Office of Inspector General, investigate answers to  these questions:

One, why were Potomac TRACON, Philadelphia TRACON, and New York  TRACON--the control towers in Washington, Philadelphia, and New York-- excluded from the FAA's list of hard-  to-staff facilities, even when there was a clear shortage?

They gave 13 other facilities bonus pay so they could attract more  people. Why not New York, Washington, and Philadelphia, where it is  worse?

Second, what is the plan to reduce decades-old technology, equipment,  and infrastructure at our airports?

One of the reasons Newark had a problem was a copper wire burnt. Did  they ever hear of fiber optics over there at the FAA?

Three, what is the plan to quickly fill critical leadership  vacancies?

Members have been fired at the FAA, and others have quit out of just  disgust. Well, there are a lot of vacancies, especially in the higher  positions. We need to fill them. What is the plan?

Other airports across the Nation could see similar problems like  Newark if the FAA does not take this investigation seriously.
