Epstein Files


Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, finally, on Epstein, the only real  conclusion we can make about the latest release of the Epstein files is  this: The DOJ cares more about protecting Donald Trump than it cares  about protecting Epstein's victims.

These new releases expose the identity of nearly 100 victims in over  1,000 instances. This is not mere sloppiness. This is wanton negligence  that puts the safety of these victims at risk. It is one thing for DOJ  to miss a couple of redactions here or there--and that is still bad-- but to fail thousands of times to protect people's identities begs the  question of whether this was intentional.

And, look, the DOJ's failure to protect the identities of the victims  is bad enough, but what makes it even more heinous is how far the DOJ  went to protect Donald Trump during these releases. The DOJ took down  pages and pages of documents that were full of vulgar accusations  against the President. And when they got caught, they put the documents  back up without redacting the information of the victims.

If DOJ cared half as much about protecting Epstein's victims as they  cared about shielding Donald Trump, then maybe the public would trust  them more. But right now, there is zero trust that the DOJ is being on  the level.
