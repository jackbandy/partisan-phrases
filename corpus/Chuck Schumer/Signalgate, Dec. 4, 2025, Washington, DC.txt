Signalgate

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on Signalgate, today, a Pentagon watchdog  will release a new report on Signalgate finding that Secretary Hegseth  put the lives of American troops at risk by sharing sensitive  operational information on a group chat in flagrant disregard of  security proposals. Secretary Hegseth has put the lives of American  troops at risk. The conclusion that this report points to is damning.  The Secretary of Defense's lack of judgment put the lives of our troops  in danger.

Instead of accepting responsibility for his mistakes as any real  leader would do, the Secretary has remained defiant, has mocked this  incident, and has tried to label this as a witch hunt--as a witch hunt.

Pete Hegseth has a clear MO: He puts himself first at the expense of  our men and women in uniform, and when he screws up, he tries to hide  the truth. That is his MO--putting himself first and then hiding the  truth.

This new report, just like the boat strikes in the Caribbean, points  to a growing pattern: When Hegseth has the chance to make himself look  good, look tough, he will talk a big game--try to seem tough. He will  go on TV and make big speeches. But when he makes mistakes or faces any  adversity, he throws others under the bus without a second thought.

This guy does not belong as Secretary of Defense. In the 10 months on  the job, Pete Hegseth has demonstrated clear defects of character that  we cannot afford in a Secretary of Defense.

I ask my Republican colleagues: How can we trust this man to keep our  troops safe when it is clear that he isn't able to even keep sensitive  information safe? How can we trust the  word of a man who will change his story or shift blame or hide the  truth at the drop of a hat? The answer is, we cannot trust him.

Pete Hegseth is not qualified to serve as Secretary of Defense. Our  brave troops need much better than Pete Hegseth.
