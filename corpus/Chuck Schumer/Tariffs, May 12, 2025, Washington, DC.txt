Tariffs

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on tariffs, early this morning, it was  reported that Donald Trump caved to Xi Jinping and the Chinese  Communist Party, with virtually nothing to show for American workers.  Donald Trump has changed his mind, once again, on his tariffs, with a  new ``deal'' with China to pause most tariffs for 90 days.

Sadly, it looks like China has, once again, gotten the better of  Donald Trump. They hardly had to give up a thing.

It is another example of Donald Trump's chaos. Trump has one policy  for his tariffs on one day and a different policy the next day. One  day, he is pretending to be a tough guy with China. The next day he is  caving to China and getting little, if anything, in return. Who knows  what Trump's tariff policy will be in 90 days?

If I were a businessperson, I wouldn't count on what he is doing or  what he says today that probably won't be in effect in the next week or  the next 3 weeks.

Even under this ``deal,'' tariffs are still significantly higher than  they were before Trump's ``Liberation Day.'' Businesses will continue  to struggle. Supply chains will continue to experience chaos, strain,  and unpredictability.

Again, this is only a 90-day pause. As I said before, it is  impossible to predict what will happen next, even within the 90-day  period, because Trump changes his mind so quickly. Whatever seems good  in front of him at the moment, he goes for.

First, he is mad at China and puts in the tariffs. Then he gets lots  of blowback and backs off.

Where will he be tomorrow? Who the heck knows. But businesses can't  count on reliability, only on chaos.

Donald Trump's trade war is a lose-lose-lose for American families  and businesses, leaving them with increased costs and more chaos.
