Social Security

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on Social Security, a few days ago, Vice  President JD Vance claimed that 40 percent of people calling to get  their Social Security ``are committing fraud''--40 percent. First, it  was Elon Musk calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme. Then Donald Trump  spent 10 minutes in his congressional address talking about checks to  150-year-olds, which we all know is a lie. And now the Vice President  has picked up the ax and is coming for Social Security too.

We need to be very clear: What the Vice President said was malicious  disinformation. His statement is factually incorrect. In the words of  the Washington Post, it is ``absurdity on its face--the kind of twisted  logic that turns up at the end of a long game of telephone tag.''

Well, we all know what game they are playing. Donald Trump and his  inner circle are howling about fraud with the hopes of discrediting  Social Security entirely. Never mind there is no rampant fraud within  Social Security; they just want to cut people's benefits. Never mind  that it is popular--overwhelmingly popular--with Democrats,  Republicans, liberals, conservatives, rural people, suburban people,  urban people.

Why are they doing this, then? Why are they going after something  that has been as sacred as Social Security since Franklin Roosevelt put  the program together? Why? It is simple: So they can cut taxes for the  rich.

This is a heist. If JD Vance had any intellectual honesty, he would  acknowledge he was wrong when he said ``40 percent of the people who  are calling are actually committing fraud,'' but I am not holding my  breath.
