Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, finally, on the nomination of Bedford to  the FAA, later this evening, Senate Republicans will vote to advance  Donald Trump's nominee to lead the FAA, Bryan Bedford.

To say that Mr. Bedford is a deeply flawed nominee would be putting  it mildly. Throughout his career as an airline executive and during his  hearing, Mr. Bedford has shown a callous disregard for the 1,500-hour  rule and even refused to commit to protecting the rule if confirmed.

I worked long and hard with the families of Flight 3407, years ago,  to establish the 1,500-hour rule after they lost all their loved ones  on a tragic plane crash that occurred on a winter's night in Western  New York. They have worked so hard, and they are so proud of their  accomplishments. In the face of unspeakable loss, they worked  relentlessly to change America's aviation laws to prevent a tragedy  like that that happened to their families.

Today, the 1,500-hour rule is the gold standard for pilot training.  So affirming the 1,500-hour rule should be the easiest thing in the  world for someone nominated to oversee the FAA, but Mr. Bedford failed  again and again to do so.

Weakening the 1,500-hour rule is dangerous and could cost lives. With  aviation safety top of mind, Americans don't want pilots with less  training, which would happen if the 1,500-hour rule were not extended,  were repealed or not enforced.

Americans don't want the FAA weakening safety standards, but I fear  that is precisely what Mr. Bedford will do: weaken the 1,500-hour rule,  weaken safety standards, and prioritize profits over passenger safety.

The American people deserve far better than an FAA Administrator who  isn't fully committed to their safety. The Senate should reject Mr.  Bedford's nomination.
