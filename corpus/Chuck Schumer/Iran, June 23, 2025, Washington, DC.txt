Iran


Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, earlier today, we received reports that  Iran has targeted U.S. military bases and U.S. servicemembers in the  Middle East, putting the lives of thousands of Americans at immediate  risk. I join Americans in praying for their safety.

This afternoon, I asked the Trump administration to immediately  provide a classified briefing, laying out the full threat picture, the  intelligence behind Iran's retaliation, and the detailed scope and  timeline of any U.S. response. More importantly, I demanded they lay  out exactly what measures they are taking right now to keep our  servicemembers safe.

As I said Saturday night, Congress and the American people are owed  answers. No President should be allowed  to unilaterally march this Nation into war with erratic threats, no  strategy, and no explanation. That is why I have called on Leader Thune  to hold a vote immediately to enforce the War Powers Resolution. The  law requires the Trump administration to consult with Congress; the  Constitution demands it; and the American people, especially the  families of those in harm's way, deserve nothing less. Confronting the  Iranian regime's nuclear ambitions--and stopping their campaign of  terror--demands strength, resolve, and strategic clarity.
