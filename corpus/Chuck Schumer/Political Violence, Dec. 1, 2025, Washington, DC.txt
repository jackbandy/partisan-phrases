Political Violence

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this morning, I was informed by New York  law enforcement of multiple bomb threats made against my offices in  Rochester, Binghamton, and Long Island. The bomb threats against my  offices came with the email subject line ``MAGA'' and from an email  address alleging the ``2020 election was rigged.''

Local and Federal law enforcement responded immediately and are  conducting full security sweeps, and investigations are ongoing.  Everyone, thank God, is safe, and I am grateful for the quick and  professional response of Federal and local law enforcement to ensure  that these offices remain safe and secure for all New Yorkers.

As I have said many times, these kinds of violent threats have  absolutely no place--no place--in our political system.

No one--no public servant, no staff member, no constituent, no  citizen--should ever be targeted for simply doing their job.
