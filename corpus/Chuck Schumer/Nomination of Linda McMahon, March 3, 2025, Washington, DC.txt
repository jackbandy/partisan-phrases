Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before my colleagues vote on the next  vote, Linda McMahon's nomination for Secretary of Education, they  should remember that a vote for Mrs. McMahon is a vote for draconian  cuts to education and rising property taxes for middle-class and  suburban American families. That is why I am so proud that every  Democrat will vote no to stand up for our schools, for our kids, for  our teachers, for public education, and to prevent property taxes from  going up further.

Donald Trump is clear. He wants to eliminate the Department and push  never-before-seen cuts to public schools. Mrs. McMahon will make that  happen. Her whole background is anti-public schools.

When you slash Federal funding for education, it leads to higher  taxes back home. So many of our school districts--they could be urban,  suburban, or rural--depend on Federal funding, and when you cut that,  it leads to higher property taxes to make up for the loss of money.  Communities will also be forced to slash other programs, including  helping disabled kids, for funding for the schools. This is not what  the American people want. This is not what they bargained for.

The Senate should reject Mrs. McMahon because funding cuts for  schools, students, parents, and teachers all for the sake of  billionaire tax breaks--whose kids probably don't go to public  schools--is an awful idea. I am proud every Democrat will vote no.
