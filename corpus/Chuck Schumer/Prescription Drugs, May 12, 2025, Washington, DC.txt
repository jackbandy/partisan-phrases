Prescription Drugs

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on drug pricing, a few hours ago,  Donald Trump signed a new Executive order he claims will ``almost  immediately'' bring down the costs of prescription drugs. Americans  should hold their applause because Donald Trump's announcement is  little more than a photo op masquerading at reform, just as he said he  would bring down costs on day one, and it didn't happen--the same thing  here. ``Almost immediately''? Give me a break.

In case Donald Trump has forgotten, this announcement is like what he  already tried to do in 2020, with little success. So Americans are  right to be skeptical until they actually see their prescription drug  costs go down more.

Donald Trump can say he is doing an Executive order, but we all know  the odds are overwhelming that that Executive order will fail.

The real way to make drug price reform happen is to do what Democrats  do and what Donald Trump is loath to do: Roll up your sleeves and do  the hard work of passing legislation. That is what we did. That is why  insulin is $35 for senior citizens. That is why 20 of the most widely  used drugs' prices have plummeted, because we negotiated with Medicare.  That is why no family pays more than $2,000 total for all their  prescription drugs. We worked hard, we legislated, and we got prices  down.

Donald Trump does a photo op, says it is going to come down  immediately, but, obviously, this is a half-baked political stunt that  is unlikely to bring any meaningful change.

Today's announcement is so typical of Donald Trump's Presidency: He  promises a golden age, but, in reality, Americans get fool's gold.
