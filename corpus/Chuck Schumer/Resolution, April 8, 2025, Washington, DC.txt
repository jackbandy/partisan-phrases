Resolution


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689739/resolution


Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in an additional matter, this morning, I  am proud to be joining Senators Wyden, Kaine, as well as Senators  Shaheen, Welch, and Senator Paul to introduce another resolution that  would put a halt on all of Donald Trump's global policies. The  resolution we passed dealt with Canada. This deals with all of the  global tariffs. I am very proud to cosponsor this legislation.

The Senate has the power and authority to stop this madness, and we  have a duty to act in a bipartisan way to repeal these tariffs.

As you know, the previous resolution by Senator Kaine got four  Republican votes here in the Senate. Our resolution, this resolution,  would terminate the emergency that Donald Trump has declared in order  to slap tariffs on 49 percent of products Americans buy from other  countries. It would terminate that.

Again, instead of picking a fight with the entire world, Donald Trump  should be focused on going after America's actual adversaries.

The Senate has the power and authority to stop Donald Trump's tariff  madness. We Senate Democrats intend on making sure the Senate gets the  chance to exercise that power.

Senator Wyden's resolution is privileged and will be able to go to  the floor of the Senate.
