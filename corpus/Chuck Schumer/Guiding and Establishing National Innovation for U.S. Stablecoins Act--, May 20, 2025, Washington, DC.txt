Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act--


Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, is it true that the Parliamentarian  advised leadership offices that the joint resolutions of disapproval  regarding the California waivers at issue does not qualify  for expedited consideration under the Congressional Review Act?

Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.

Before I yield, I want everyone to understand what the essence of my  question was. This week, the Republicans want to use a legislative tool  known as the CRA in an unprecedented way: to repeal emissions waivers  that the fossil fuel industry has long detested.

The CRA has never been used to go after emission waivers like the  ones in question today. The waiver is so important to the health of our  country, and particularly to our children, to go nuclear on something  as significant as this and to do the bidding of the fossil fuel  industry is outrageous.

And we just heard in response to my inquiry just now that the  Parliamentarian affirmed this, that these California waivers are not-- not--eligible for the expedited procedures that the CRA affords.

That means that legislation to repeal these waivers should be subject  to a 60-vote threshold in the Senate. To use the CRA in the way that  Republicans propose is going nuclear--no ands, ifs, or buts.
