Taxes

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, that is the third thing I want to talk  about, the Republican billionaire tax breaks.

In less than 3 months, Donald Trump has unleashed more chaos upon the  American people than any previous President. His tariffs have hit  families with the largest tax hike in half a century.

Elon Musk and DOGE are sabotaging Social Security and Medicaid and  Medicare from within with massive layoffs, funding cuts, and crashing  websites. The market is having its worst day since the COVID crisis,  sending 401(k)s reeling.

And what are Republicans in Congress doing? They are cutting taxes  for billionaires and paying for it by cutting Medicaid.

Now the billionaire tax breaks will add $37 trillion to the debt.  Adding $37 trillion to the debt was bad enough without having to take  into account President Trump's tariffs. But now that these tariffs are  making a recession more likely, it would be malpractice--malpractice-- for Republicans to move forward.

The ball is in the House Republicans' court. They can see for  themselves just how fiscally reckless and ill-conceived the Senate bill  is. They should reject it. Republicans' obeisance to Donald Trump's  increasingly unpopular agenda will cost them dearly in the future.
