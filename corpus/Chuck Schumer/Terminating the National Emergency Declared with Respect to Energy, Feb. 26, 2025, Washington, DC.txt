Terminating the National Emergency Declared with Respect to Energy

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Kaine and  Heinrich for introducing this resolution and for taking the floor to  highlight Donald Trump's energy emergency gimmick.

We Democrats are using every tool available to expose Republican  hypocrisy, revealing the so-called energy emergency for what it is. It  is a shameless power grab by Republicans to pay obeisance to Big Oil,  plain and simple--nothing more, but nothing less.

Republicans are raising prices by excluding clean energy from their  emergency, meaning families could see electricity bills go up by $500 a  year. Republicans are killing jobs by gutting domestic energy  investments that we made, that have created so many new good-paying  jobs. Republicans are rewarding China by weakening our economic  competitiveness and ceding American energy leadership to our  adversaries.

The hypocrisy is simple. On the one hand, they say we need more  energy for AI and for everything else, but then, on the other hand,  they greatly curtail the cheapest form of electricity we could make,  which is solar and then wind, because, really, what they are doing is  just hugging Big Oil because Big Oil hates clean energy because they  know clean energy eventually means the great reduction of polluting oil  and gas and what they put into our atmosphere.

Senators Kaine, Heinrich, and all Democrats will continue to shine a  spotlight on Republican attacks on domestic energy in the weeks and  months ahead.
