Mr. MESSMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4, the  Rescissions Act of 2025.

For decades, Americans have been waiting for their leadership to  deliver on the promise that fiscal responsibility was on its way.

Wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars has been overlooked for far too  long. For far too many years, leaders have kicked the can down the  road, hoping a future Congress would make the hard decisions required  to stop the financial bleeding.

As a proud Hoosier, I know that if we are doing our best to live  within our means as a family, the government should do no less.

Congress must deliver on the promise of safeguarding American  taxpayer dollars. I am proud to vote today to make this first initial  step to eliminate wasteful government spending.

The Department of Government Efficiency did our country a great  service in lifting the veil on how much fraud, abuse, and terrible  waste of taxpayer dollars is truly happening in our government  agencies.

By passing the Rescissions Act today, I join my colleagues in showing  Americans that we hear them and we know that this change must be made.  It is high time we work toward getting our fiscal house in order, and  this is the first step.
