Mr. MESSMER. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the DETERRENT Act.

This important legislation will bring vital transparency and  accountability to gift reporting requirements for colleges and  universities.

For decades, the Chinese Communist Party, Iran, and Russia have  targeted America's college systems by pushing dangerous propaganda  aimed at influencing impressionable students.

As my colleagues have pointed out, many American universities have  been far too cozy with our international adversaries. They accept  generous investments masked as research projects and infrastructure  opportunities, which turn out to be funded by regimes that wish to do  us harm.

Not only did those corrupt arrangements create dangerous environments  for our students and faculty, they also put America's national security  at risk.

I am pleased that my bill, the INSTRUCT Act, is included as one of  the DETERRENT Act's main provisions. My legislation requires that  colleges and universities disclose to American intelligence agencies  any and all financial investment data so we can ensure they remain free  of the exploitation of hostile foreign influences.

I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, not just because it makes  sense, but because it will put our adversaries on notice that we are  watching them. Most importantly, it will protect our Nation's students  from foreign manipulation and provide them with the transparent and  safe learning environment that they deserve.

Again, I wish to thank Chairman Walberg for his leadership on this  issue.
