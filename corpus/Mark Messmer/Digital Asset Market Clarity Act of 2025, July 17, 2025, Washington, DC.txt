Mr. MESSMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the CLARITY Act.

America's innovative ecosystem has made our Nation an investment  magnet and development hub, but thus far, our regulatory system has  failed the digital assets industry. Under the current framework,  fraudsters go unpunished, consumers remain unprotected, and the best  and brightest minds in the industry have picked up and left for other  countries.

The CLARITY Act finally establishes distinct jurisdictional  boundaries between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while also creating guardrails to  incentivize and safeguard investment.

The bill not only expands opportunities for Wall Street and Silicon  Valley, but it also provides great opportunities for Hoosier farmers by  opening a new frontier for rural innovators and expanding access to  capital in agricultural communities.

The digital asset markets are in dire need of regulation, and the  CLARITY Act is the solution. I look forward to witnessing a new era of  economic prosperity and technological advancement that this bill will  bring to America.
