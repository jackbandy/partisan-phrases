Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, the Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization  Act provides critical funding for rural communities.

This measure is of particular importance for my home state of Idaho,  as 62 percent of our land is owned by the federal government.

Every year, Idaho loses revenue in timber sales due to wildfires  fueled by federal land mismanagement. In fact, in 2024 alone, a  staggering one million acres of the Gem State went up in flames.

Rural counties in Idaho are impacted even more so by extensive  federal ownership, as they are unable to tax large portions of land in  their jurisdiction.

With this funding reauthorization, rural communities across Idaho  will be able to keep classrooms open, roads maintained, and emergency  services operating. However, a long-term solution is necessary, and I  will continue to advocate for one in Congress that ensures Idahoans  dictate Idaho affairs--not the federal government.
