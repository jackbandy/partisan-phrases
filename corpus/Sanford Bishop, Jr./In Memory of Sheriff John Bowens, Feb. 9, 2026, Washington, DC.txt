Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with profound sorrow but also  with deep gratitude to pay tribute to a man whose life was a testament  to faith, service, and love--Sheriff John Bowens of Terrell County,  Georgia. A funeral service to celebrate his remarkable and purposeful  life was held on Saturday, February 7, 2026, in Dawson, Georgia. Born  August 17, 1946, in Dawson, Georgia, John Bowens grew from humble  beginnings into a leader whose steady hands and steady heart guided a  community for more than three decades.

I have had the honor of representing many remarkable public servants,  but few have combined humility, resolve, and compassion the way Sheriff  Bowens did. His story is the American story--a son of Terrell County  who worked hard, raised a devoted family, held fast to faith, and  answered the call to protect his neighbors. After graduating from  Carver High School in 1965, Sheriff Bowens rolled up his sleeves and  worked wherever his community needed him: as a bus driver, ensuring  children arrived at school safe and ready to learn; as a mechanic at  Dawson Motor Company, tending to the machines that helped his neighbors  make a living; and later in the ranks of public safety--with the Dawson  Fire Department, the Dawson and Dougherty County police departments,  and ultimately the Terrell County Sheriffs Department. Each step in his  career was a step closer to a life of service, each job a small promise  kept to his fellow citizens.

In 1992, the people of Terrell County placed their trust in John  Bowens and elected him, Sheriff. That trust was repaid every day, for  32 years. He served longer than any sheriff in the county's history and  became the longest-serving African American sheriff elected in the  State of Georgia. But these distinctions tell only part of the story.  What mattered most to those who knew him was not the record on a  plaque, but the quiet, constant ways he showed up: walking  neighborhoods, listening to concerns with patience, mentoring young  people who might otherwise have lost their way, and standing at the  bedside of a grieving family or the side of a frightened child until  calm returned.

Sheriff Bowens' leadership flowed from a bedrock of faith. Introduced  to Christ early, he first joined Pleasant Hill Missionary Church in  Herod and later made Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Dawson his  spiritual home. For more than thirty years, he served as a Deacon and  as Chairman of the Deacon Board--roles he carried not as honors but as  responsibilities. In the church he found purpose; in the Lord he found  the guiding light that shaped his decisions, his care for others, and  the moral courage that marked his long career.

His life was also defined by a love that endured: in 1966 he married  Janice Williams Bowens, his partner, confidante, and anchor. Together  they raised four children--Darrell, Brenda, Marcus, and Pamela--and  built a family that mirrored the values they lived: faith,  perseverance, and tenderness. John took pride in his grandchildren and  great-grandchildren; he celebrated their milestones as if they were his  own, and they drew strength from his example. Family, for Sheriff  Bowens, was not a private matter--it was the wellspring of his public  service, the place where he learned to care for others before caring  for self.

Sheriff Bowens was a man of convictions. He was outspoken when  injustice threatened the vulnerable, and he was steady when storms-- literal and figurative--tested Terrell County. People could depend upon  him. When difficult choices had to be made, neighbors sought his  counsel because they knew his word was his bond. He earned the respect  of fellow law enforcement officers across counties, and he carried  himself with a dignity that reflected both his personal faith and his  commitment to the rule of law.

Those who served beside him remember a leader who mentored rather  than commanded, who cultivated loyalty not by fear but by example. He  was a Mason at St. Mark Lodge 59 and a friend to many. He celebrated  community life and helped weave the social fabric of Dawson and Terrell  County so that when tragedy came, people had one another to lean on.

On a personal note, Sheriff Bowens was my friend. We established a  bond as we were both elected in 1992. He never told me what I wanted to  hear, but he always told me what he felt I needed to hear. I will be  forever grateful for his fidelity and his friendship.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian and me along  with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's 2nd Congressional  District in honoring the life and legacy of Sheriff John Bowens.  Moreover, we extend our deepest sympathies to Sheriff Bowens' family,  friends, loved ones and all those who grieve during this difficult time  of bereavement. We pray that they will all be consoled and comforted by  an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months  ahead.

May the life of Sheriff John Bowens be a beacon to those who follow:  a call to serve without expectation of fame, to lead with humility, and  to love without reservation. May he rest in peace, and may his memory  be a blessing to us all.
