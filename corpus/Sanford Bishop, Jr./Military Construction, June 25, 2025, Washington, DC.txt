Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Chair, I rise today to express my continued and  resolute opposition to the fiscal year 2026 Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act in its  current form.

I represent a district that is home to Robins Air Force Base, Fort  Benning, and Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany. These installations  are more than just military sites. They are the backbone of communities  where servicemembers live, raise families, and eventually retire to  continue serving in civilian life.

Because of this, I have a deep and personal understanding of the  needs of our servicemembers, veterans, and their families. I can say  unequivocally that this bill fails them.

Our veterans deserve better. Our military families deserve better.  Frankly, all of us deserve a bill that reflects our shared commitment  to the men and women who wear and have worn the uniform.

National defense is not just about weapons and strategy. It is about  people, and this bill, as currently written, does not prioritize the  needs of our people. Instead, it is laced with ideological provisions  drawn from Project 2025, prioritizing political ambition over the well- being of those who have dedicated their lives to serving this country.

Let me be clear. Healthcare for veterans should not be an ideological  battlefield. Yet, this bill accelerates the shift to privatized care at  a time when we should be investing in the VA system itself.

Veterans overwhelmingly want to be treated in VA hospitals and  clinics, facilities tailored to their unique needs and staffed by  professionals who understand the physical, emotional, and psychological  cost of service. Instead of fortifying these institutions, the bill  undermines them.

Community care is an important tool, but it must remain just that, a  supplement, not a substitute. Veterans should be referred to community  care only when the VA cannot meet their needs, not as part of a  systematic effort to privatize the entire system.

Occam's razor reminds us that the simplest explanation is often the  correct one. Here, the simplest explanation for this unprecedented  increase in outsourced care is a broader goal to dismantle the VA  system itself, aligning with Project 2025's dangerous objective to  privatize veterans' healthcare. The consequences of this cannot be  overstated.

Equally troubling is the underfunding of military construction,  particularly housing and childcare. These are not luxuries. They are  necessities. A stable home and quality childcare are foundational to  military readiness. When we fail to provide for the families of our  servicemembers, we degrade morale, retention, and focus.

We cannot expect excellence from our Armed Forces if we do not  support the very people who make excellence possible.

This bill does not build trust. It erodes it. Trust in our  government, our institutions, and our promises is what holds the fabric  of this Nation together.

This legislation should be a reflection of our values. It should  speak to our priorities. It should say to every servicemember, veteran,  and military family: We see you. We value you. We will not let you  down.

Instead, it cuts where we should invest. It deregulates where we need  oversight. Perhaps most egregiously, it sows division where we  desperately need unity.

This is not a partisan issue. It is an American issue. We must rise  above ideology to meet this moment with courage and clarity.

I urge every one of my colleagues, especially those who may view this  bill as just another line item, to pause and consider the real impact  these decisions have on the people we are sworn to serve. Let their  needs, not political blueprints, be our North Star today. We must do  better.
