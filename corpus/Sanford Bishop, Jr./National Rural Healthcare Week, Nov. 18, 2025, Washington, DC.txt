National Rural Healthcare Week

Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Speaker, rural Georgians and rural Americans are  older, sicker, and less likely to have health insurance than those in  our cities. In fact, compared to urban areas, rural Georgians are  nearly five times more likely to die early from cancer.

However, access to care is collapsing. Over 20 percent of rural  counties in Georgia have no doctor or only one doctor, and 200 counties  across America have no doctor at all.

When rural hospitals close, the community loses not only healthcare  but jobs, restaurants, banks, and hope. When Southwest Georgia Regional  Hospital closed, the nearest ER became 40 miles away, a life or death  distance.

Rural healthcare is not just about hospitals and doctors. Clean  drinking water, wastewater upgrades, and broadband are necessary for  health and survival. Rural areas simply don't have the tax base to  modernize these systems alone, so Congress must invest funding in rural  development, energy, and healthcare to ensure they can thrive.

Mr. Speaker, rural health is not partisan. We must work together to  make access to care a reality for rural Americans everywhere.
