Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  achievements of the Albany Young Marines of Albany, Georgia, who have  been named the National Young Marine Unit of the Year. The group  received this well-earned honor at the Young Marines 2025 Adult  Leader's Conference in Dallas, Texas on April 26, 2025.

The Young Marines is a nationally renowned nonprofit organization  focused on youth leadership and character development. Since its  founding in 1959, it has expanded to over 200 units, with 5,000 youth  participants and 1,950 adult volunteers across 40 states, the District  of Columbia, Japan, and beyond. Through this program, young men and  women cultivate essential values such as leadership, teamwork, and  self-discipline.

The Albany, Georgia chapter exemplifies excellence in service,  community engagement, and leadership. Under the guidance of Unit  Commander Eric Crump and his wife, Adriana, this distinguished unit of  30 youth members and six adult volunteers has devoted thousands of  hours to serving their community and supporting local veterans'  organizations. Their commitment and dedication earned them recognition  as Unit of the Year in the tri-state (Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee)  Southeast Regiment of the Year of Division 2, and most recently,  National Young Marines of the Year for 2025.

The impact of this remarkable group extends far beyond their unit,  bringing together a wide network of supporters. The Albany Area Chamber  of Commerce Military Affairs Committee, American Legion Post 30 and  Post 512, VFW 2785, Albany State University, Albany Area YMCA, and  numerous businesses and individuals have all rallied behind the Albany  Young Marines. Moreover, off-duty United States Marines in the  community have generously stepped up to mentor these young leaders,  further enriching their experience and inspiring them to be the best  they can be in service to others.

Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm once said that ``service is the  rent we pay for the space we occupy on this earth.'' The Albany Young  Marines truly embody this spirit, and their community is better for it.  Their successes have been made possible by the unwavering support of  their commanders, family members, dedicated volunteers, and neighbors.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the Albany  Young Marines and their remarkable contributions to themselves and the  Southwest Georgia community. Their dedication, leadership, and service  are invaluable, and I am confident that this organization will continue  to shape future generations of outstanding young leaders.
