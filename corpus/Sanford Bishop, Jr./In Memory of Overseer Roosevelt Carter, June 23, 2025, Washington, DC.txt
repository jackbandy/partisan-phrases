Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the  memory of a loving husband, dedicated father, outstanding Man of God,  devoted spiritual leader, gifted musician, astute entrepreneur, and  dear friend of longstanding, Overseer Roosevelt Carter, I, who passed  from labor to reward on June 15, 2025. A funeral service to celebrate  his remarkable and committed life was held on Sunday, June 22, 2025, at  First Monumental Faith Ministries in Albany, Georgia.

The journey of the resilient life of Overseer Roosevelt Carter began  with his birth on June 16, 1944, to the union of Deacon Enoch and  Deaconess Mary Magdalene Carter in Leesburg, Georgia. Always spurred by  a love of learning, he attended Lee County Training School in Leesburg,  Georgia, before pursuing Announcing and Broadcasting at the Broadcast  Schools of New York. Overseer Carter pursued theological studies at  Bethany Bible School and Theological Seminary, earning both a  Bachelor's in Ministry and a Master's in Theology.

Overseer Carter began his ministry through the power of music. He  launched his career as a DJ in Brooklyn, New York, gaining recognition  as one of the best in the United States. His musical journey included  working at WJIZ, where he earned the title ``No. 1 Soul Wax Man,''  famously known as ``The Love Man--6 Foot 2.'' He also collaborated with  prominent organizations such as Atlantic Recording Company in New York,  WDAS Radio Broadcasting Station in Pittsburgh, PA, and WOAK in Atlanta,  Georgia.

As an astute entrepreneur, he founded and served as President of  Flint River Construction, a respected general contracting firm known  for projects of regional and national significance, including the  construction of Concourse E at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International  Airport. He worked alongside influential figures such as former Atlanta  Mayors Maynard Jackson and Bill Campbell, and specialized in building  church structures.

Additionally, Overseer Carter was a trailblazer in agriculture,  producing livestock and various crops, and he created Carter's Farm  Peanut Butter, which proudly sold in Walmart and Kroger stores--a  historic accomplishment for an African-American-owned agribusiness.

Patriotically committed to public service, he became the first  African-American man to run for County Commissioner in Lee County,  Georgia. Although he won the district of Chokee, changes in the rules  requiring county-wide wins prevented him from taking his seat. No  stranger to adversity, during his campaign, his car was shot at in a  crude attempt to derail his progress, yet Overseer Carter stood firm in  his commitment to bring about positive change.

Overseer Carter answered the most important call of his life--the  call to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This journey began at Mount  Zion Baptist Church in Camilla, Georgia, and expanded to include  service at Ephesians Baptist Church in Albany and New Mt. Pleasant  Church in Waycross, Georgia.

In 1984, he co-founded First Monumental Faith Ministries alongside  his loving wife, First Lady and Co-Overseer, LaVerne Shinault Carter.  For 35 remarkable years, he shepherded his congregation through  blessings, baptisms, weddings, and offered comfort to grieving  families. Under their dynamic leadership, First Monumental became a  beacon of hope and salvation.

As the great Agriculture Chemist George Washington Carver once said,  ``How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young,  compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and  tolerant of the weak and the strong because someday in life you will  have been all of these.'' Overseer Carter's legacy extended beyond  church walls, serving people from all walks of life. He founded First  Monumental Community Outreach, Inc. (FMCO), providing critical support  services. Notably, he spearheaded initiatives like Job's Place, the  first assistance program for individuals diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in  Dougherty County, and collaborated with the City of Albany to combat  homelessness, successfully transitioning over 15 families to  sustainable living.

Overseer Carter also enhanced economic empowerment through projects  like the Monumental Development Center and Fluff-n-Fold  Laundromat, fostering job creation for local residents. Even amidst  significant health challenges, he remained dedicated to sharing God's  goodness, writing, preaching, and singing about His grace. He authored  two impactful books, ``Freedom in Worship'' and ``Stuck in A Rut,'' and  expanded his ministry globally through TBN and various national and  local media outlets.

As we remember Overseer Carter, we acknowledge that all his  achievements were made possible through God's grace and the unwavering  support of his devoted wife, LaVerne, and their children--Pastor  RoDerald Carter, Pastor Lorenzo Heard, daughter-in-love Attorney  Marilyn Moss Carter, and a vast circle of family, friends, and loved  ones.

On a personal note, I am profoundly grateful for Overseer Carter's  wise counsel and enduring friendship throughout the years. He has been  a source of encouragement during my time in Congress, and I am proud to  have called him my friend.

Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me,  along with the 765,000 residents of Georgia's Second Congressional  District, in extending our heartfelt condolences to Overseer Roosevelt  Carter's family and the members of First Monumental Faith Ministries.  We celebrate his leadership, his lasting impact on the community, the  church, and all mankind. His legacy of love and service will continue  to inspire us all.
