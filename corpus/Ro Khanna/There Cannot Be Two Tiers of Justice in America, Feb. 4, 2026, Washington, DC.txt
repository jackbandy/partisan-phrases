Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker,   Thomas Massie and my Epstein Files  Transparency Act led to millions of files being released that have  shocked the conscience of the Nation.

Today, I call for Congress to hold in front of the Oversight  Committee every single person who emailed about going to Epstein's  island. They need to answer some basic questions. Who raped these  underage girls from working-class families? What did they see? What did  they know? What did they participate in?

The American people are frustrated with the rich and powerful getting  a different set of justice. There cannot be two tiers of justice in  America, and I will not rest until the people who committed these  heinous crimes and this heinous behavior are held accountable.
