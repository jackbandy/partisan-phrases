Modernizing Our Economic Theories

Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, the stock market is decimated, almost 20  percent down, entering bear territory. At the same time, bond yields  are skyrocketing, meaning ordinary Americans are going to have higher  interest rates on their credit cards and their mortgages. It means we  are going to have to pay more on our debt.

At the same time, the dollar is declining and prices are going up,  meaning it is going to be harder to afford groceries.

Mr. Speaker, these are the most self-destructive, wealth-destroying  policies any administration has undertaken in modern American history.  They have tariffs at 1909 levels at 22.5 percent, making a global trade  war. Businesses have lost confidence.

There is only one way out. We need a reset of this President's  economic team. Howard Lutnick was talking about building more screws in  America, as if we were living in the 19th century. He needs to go.

We need new economic thinkers with this President who actually  understand how the economy works and can turn things around.
