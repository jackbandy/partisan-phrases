No More Middle East Wars


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1700215/no-more-middle-east-wars


Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, another war in the Middle East is not  America First. That is why Congressman Massie and I will introduce a  bipartisan Iran war powers resolution.

America First means Congress first on matters of war and peace. Every  Member in this body must go on the record about whether we should have  another endless war in the Middle East.

The American people are sick of billions of dollars going for  overseas wars. They want that money for manufacturing jobs here, for  healthcare here, for childcare here, and for education here.

There is no doubt the Iranian regime is brutal in killing protestors  and murdering their own people, but an American war will only inflame  nationalism and will not prevent them from getting the bomb.

We need a better approach. We need to focus on our country's economic  development.
