Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm on the  military buildup in the Caribbean, edging us closer to a regime-change  war in Venezuela.

The Trump administration has sent the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft  carrier, our largest aircraft carrier. Mr. Speaker, 10 percent of our  Navy is in the Caribbean, including destroyers and submarines.

We have got 15,000 troops in Florida and Puerto Rico, including  marines who are ready for amphibious landings, and we have F-35s and B- 52s flying across the Caribbean and Venezuelan airspace.

After Iraq, after Libya, after 20 years in Afghanistan, after Yemen,  we do not need another regime-change war. It is time for the American  people to oppose a regime-change war in Venezuela.
