Ban on Acceptance of Gifts From Lobbyists


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688124/ban-on-acceptance-of-gifts-from-lobbyists


Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, President Trump campaigned around the  country to drain the swamp. Yet, one of the first things he did was to  reverse President Biden's executive order that banned White House  officials from accepting gifts from lobbyists.

Today, I am introducing the Drain the Swamp Act. It is pretty simple.  It will ban any White House official from accepting gifts from  lobbyists, and it will ban White House officials from becoming  lobbyists during the Trump term.

I believe that this bill will have support not just from  progressives, not just from Independents, but from the MAGA movement.  That is why I am calling on my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats,  to pass the Drain the Swamp Act and send it to President Trump's desk  so that he can fulfill his promise.                 Deprivation of Medicare Telehealth Services

Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration is stripping  millions of American seniors of their coverage of telehealth on March  31. That is right. Starting March 31, doctors' visits via  videoconference or Zoom or phone will no longer be covered for seniors  on Medicare.

This is going to impact over 12 million Americans, and the crazy  thing is that the inspectors general have found that there is only 0.2  percent of fraud in telehealth. Why are we taking telehealth away from  millions of seniors who are homebound or who have difficulty leaving  their homes? It is most devastating for rural Americans.

That is why I am introducing today the Telehealth Coverage Act. It  will require Medicare to pay for telehealth services. Let us pass this  act in a bipartisan way so that millions of American seniors aren't  deprived of telehealth services because of the actions of the Trump  administration.
