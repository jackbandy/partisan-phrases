Defending Black History


Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the nine Black worshippers  murdered at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.  June 17 marks the 10-year anniversary of that horrific act by a white  supremacist.

Representative Wendell Gilliard has introduced a hate crime bill. It  still hasn't been passed. We must pass it.

Today isn't just about remembering the Emanuel Nine. It is also about  confronting the attacks on Black history. President Trump called the  African-American history museum oppressive and gave Vice President  Vance the power to erase Black history.

Mr. Speaker, 44 States now are debating laws to limit the teaching of  Black history. One Pennsylvania district even banned children's books  about Rosa Parks and Dr. King.

As we honor the Emanuel Nine, we must stand up for teaching honest  Black history. I think of my friend, Representative JA Moore, who lost  his sister, Myra Thompson, today. His call is not just to remove  symbols of hate but to dismantle the systems of hate that Dr. King  talked about.

Let the Emanuel Nine inspire us today to teach honestly about Black  history and confront the systems of hate.
