Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, our country is at a moral crossroads. Just  today, it comes out that billionaires are worth $8 trillion. That is  more than 50 percent of Americans combined.

What does the President do? He decides he doesn't have the money for  the American people. He is going to starve the American people to give  $40 billion to the corrupt Libertarian leader in Argentina. Mr.  Speaker, $9 million would have fed the American people. How is that  America first?

Then he says he doesn't care about the cab driver who is now paying  $2,600 per month in healthcare as opposed to $44. He doesn't want to  save the 20 million Americans who are going to face high premium  increases. How is that America first?

Mr. Speaker, we need national health insurance in this country. We  need to tax billionaires in this country. We need to fund SNAP in this  country. We need to stop funding Argentina and corrupt foreign leaders.
