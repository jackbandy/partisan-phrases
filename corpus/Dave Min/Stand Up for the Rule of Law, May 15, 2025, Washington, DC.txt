Stand Up for the Rule of Law


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691297/stand-up-for-the-rule-of-law


Mr. MIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind my colleagues that  Congress and only Congress has the power of the purse. Yet, Donald  Trump and Elon Musk have unlawfully impounded billions of dollars of  congressionally approved funds. They have illegally slashed funding for  veterans, food for hungry babies, and purported to terminate entire  agencies created by Congress. This is not consistent with the  Constitution or with democracy.

Trump and Musk are asserting the powers of dictatorship.  Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues have refused to enforce the  law or the Constitution when it comes to this administration.

That is why I, along with Representatives Liccardo and Vindman,  introduced the Protect Our Constitution and Communities Act, or POCCA.

POCCA affirms the separation of budgetary powers and creates a  private right action for individuals, States, and local jurisdictions  that have been harmed by the administration's repeated violations of  the ICA.

POCCA would also hold accountable any public official with  decisionmaking authority who knowingly and intentionally violates the  ICA, such as Elon Musk.

It is time to stand up for the rule of law and to put the power of  the purse back where it belongs, in the hands of Congress.

This National Police Week, I urge my colleagues to consider  supporting this important law enforcement priority.
