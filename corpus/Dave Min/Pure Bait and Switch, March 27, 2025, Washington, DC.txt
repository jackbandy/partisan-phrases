Pure Bait and Switch

Mr. MIN. Mr. Speaker, Elon Musk spent $277 million supporting Donald  Trump's campaign last year. In return, Trump has done all he can to  support Musk's business ventures, awarding billions in potential  contracts to Tesla and SpaceX. Trump even turned the White House lawn  into a Tesla showroom to try to boost Tesla sales.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose investment firm owns  hundreds of millions in Tesla stock, went on national TV to try to  increase Tesla's sagging stock price.

Our own colleague, Ms. Marjorie Taylor Greene, spent thousands of  dollars buying Tesla stock this year and then tried to weaponize the  DOJ to help increase Tesla sales. This is all blatantly unethical, and  much of it is illegal.

At the same time, Ms. Greene's DOGE subcommittee, following the  example of Elon Musk in February, is calling for the defunding of NPR  and PBS. Yes, Elon and Marjorie Taylor Greene are trying to kill Elmo.  However, here is the thing: Public broadcasting receives just a tiny  fraction of funding compared to the government contracts Elon stands to  gain. In fact, if you take away the new military contract for  cybertrucks alone, you will pay for all of PBS and NPR. Unlike  cybertrucks, PBS and NPR won't get recalled because they are falling  apart.

What is happening right now is pure bait and switch. Republicans are  trying to slash Medicaid, public schools, and programs like PBS so they  can give billions to Elon Musk and his fellow oligarchs. The corruption  we are seeing right now is outrageous, unprecedented, and cannot stand.
