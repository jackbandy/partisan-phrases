Defending Education Transparency and Ending Rogue Regimes Engaging in Nefarious Transactions Act


Mr. ONDER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1048,  the DETERRENT Act.

Mr. Chair, this bill will end the influence and downright espionage  of the Chinese Communist Party on our American College campuses.

Last Congress, the Select Committee on the CCP issued a remarkable  report highlighting how UC Berkeley partnered with Tsinghua University  and the city of Shenzen to create the Tsinghua-Berkeley-Shenzen  Institute, which actively partnered with a Chinese research lab in  April 2023 to improve advanced chip technology.

Why in the world should the Chinese Communist Party, which controls  the city of Shenzen and Tsinghua University, have access to American  research on sensitive technology with military applications?

Likewise, Alfred University recently received a grant from the  Department of Defense to research hypersonic weapons. Unbelievably, the  China University of Geosciences in Wuhan then partnered with Alfred  University with this research.

China University of Geosciences also happened to be doing very  similar weapons research for the CCP. How do we know that our research  and development in our hypersonic weapons isn't going straight to the  CCP? The answer is: It probably is.

Additionally, according to the FBI, the CCP is the world's principal  infringer of intellectual property. We need to stop the Chinese  Communist Party, the number one threat to our security and the security  of the world, from taking advantage of American innovation and the  openness of our university campuses.

Mr. Chair, I proudly support the DETERRENT Act.
