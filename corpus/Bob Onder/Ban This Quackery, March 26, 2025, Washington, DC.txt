Ban This Quackery

Mr. ONDER. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Do No Harm Act.

As a physician, I took an oath to do no harm, but over the past  several years, doctors working at pediatric transgender clinics have  prescribed medications or done procedures that they know will  permanently sterilize children or leave them with irreversible medical  and psychological damage.

This bill is the most comprehensive legislation introduced to date to  protect children from experimental and unethical practices of so-called  gender-affirming care. This practice has been banned or severely  limited in European countries, including the U.K., Norway, Denmark, and  Sweden, and it is time for the U.S. to wake up and ban this quackery  once and for all.

The Do No Harm Act builds on President Trump's day one executive  order ending the chemical castration and mutilation of children. I look  forward to working with the Trump administration to solidify this  policy as Federal law.
