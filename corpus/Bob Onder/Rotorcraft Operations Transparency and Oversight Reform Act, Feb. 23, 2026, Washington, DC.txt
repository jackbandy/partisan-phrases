Rotorcraft Operations Transparency and Oversight Reform Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1700104/rotorcraft-operations-transparency-and-oversight-reform-act


Mr. ONDER. Mr. Speaker, the ROTOR Act is an urgent piece of  legislation that implements proven technology to help pilots see the  real-time location of other aircraft. Had it been law, it would have  prevented the needless loss of 67 lives in last January's DCA crash.

In the past 15 years, there have been an average of at least one near  miss per month at DCA. Since 2008, the National Transportation Safety  Board has recommended 18 times that all aircraft install ADS-B  equipment that allows pilots to see and be seen when flying in busy  airspace.

NTSB Chair Hormendy testified if the ROTOR Act had been the law last  January, the jet and the helicopter would have had nearly a minute of  advanced warning and the crash would have been prevented.

The ROTOR Act's ADS-B requirement is neither expensive nor  burdensome. General aviation can meet the requirement with a receiver  like this one that costs about $400, roughly the cost of a routine oil  change for most planes.

American Airlines has installed ADS-B for about $50,000 per plane  with only 1 to 2 days of downtime.

ROTOR's ADS-B requirement applies only to our Nation's busiest  airspace, not to pilots flying in rural America. The families of flight  5342 are here today to support the ROTOR Act so that what they  needlessly suffered will never happen again.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the ROTOR Act.
