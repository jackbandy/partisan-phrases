Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699327/consolidated-appropriations-act-2026


Mr. ELLZEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this bill and I  join Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum in saluting the hard  work of the Defense Subcommittee staff, and of course, Chairman Cole. I  thank my colleagues on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  for working with this body.

As of today, the Biden-era CRs, numbers, and policies will come to an  end, and we will pass a bill that addresses the needs of now and the  future for our adversaries around the world.

This fiscal year `26 bill invests in the Navy's sixth-generation  fighter, an essential high-tech platform designed to succeed across the  globe, projecting power from highly mobile airfields--the United States  Navy's aircraft carriers.

It also accelerates the Army's investment in the Future Long-Range  Assault Aircraft, a platform essential for the Army to meet the fight  in the long distances between islands in the Pacific.

The Navy Reserve will finally get four more KC-130Js to provide  aerial refueling, spare engines, and contested logistics in the Pacific  Ocean.

Some of the most important provisions in this bill help the Pentagon  fix many of its broken and antiquated processes. It gives Secretary  Feinberg the ability to accelerate and find, test, and buy the tools  that warfighters want and need, both hardware and software.

Remember, it was industrial innovations that won World War II, not a  fledgling Pentagon.

Today, patriotic companies across the country are putting their own  skin in the game to help our country deter, if possible, and defeat, if  necessary, our 21st century adversaries, and we must help them succeed.

Vote for this bill.
