Recognizing the First Anniversary of T1 Energy's Operations in Wilmer, Texas


Mr. ELLZEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the  one-year anniversary of T1 Energy's operations in Wilmer, Texas. On  November 1, 2024, production began at its state-of-the-art facility. In  just twelve short months, the company has already created more than  1,200 good-paying Texas jobs, including 200 held by proud residents of  Texas' 6th Congressional District.

By all accounts, the Wilmer facility is exceeding expectations,  surpassing production goals and selling out its entire 2025 inventory.  This success story is more than numbers; it is an American story. T1 is  reshoring the solar supply chain, reducing dependence on Southeast  Asia, and making the United States stronger.

Recently, T1 signed a partnership with Corning, a historic American  company, to supply solar wafers, linking the innovation of Michigan and  Texas in a powerful new supply chain that will support upwards of 6,000  jobs. T1 delivers domestic energy and energy dominance.

This investment in American energy will strengthen our national  security, bolster our economic competitiveness, and power the future,  including the technologies of tomorrow like artificial intelligence and  data centers. I congratulate T1 Energy on this milestone and look  forward to their continued growth and contribution to our Nation's  energy security.
