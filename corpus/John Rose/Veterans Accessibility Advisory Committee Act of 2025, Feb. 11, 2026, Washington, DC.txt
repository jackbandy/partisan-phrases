Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the SAVE America  Act because nothing matters more than securing our elections. Our  Republic depends on it.

Free, fair, and honest elections unmoored by fraud or suspicion are  fundamental to our constitutional Republic. The right of citizens to  have their votes properly counted without illegal dilution is vital to  determining the rightful winner.

This legislation is straightforward. It requires proof of citizenship  for voter registration and voter ID for Federal elections. It ensures  only American citizens participate in American elections and provides  States with tools to determine and verify the citizenship and maintain  accurate voter rolls.

There is only one reason not to pass this, and we all know what that  is. Some in this Chamber oppose anything that interferes with their  effort to control elections and consolidate power.

Congressional Democrats sat silent as the Biden administration  allowed millions of illegal immigrants into the United States. I fear  the intention was to garner votes. However, my colleagues across the  aisle now have an opportunity to prove me wrong by supporting this  widely popular legislation.

The SAVE America Act reinforces that voting is a right only of  citizens, not just anyone within our borders. Opposition to this act  makes sense in that context, but that is precisely why we must pass it.

We have a duty to the American people to preserve their voice,  protect their vote, and secure their sovereignty, and we must save the  Republic from forces that would undermine our most sacred democratic  institution. I urge my colleagues to pass the SAVE America Act.
