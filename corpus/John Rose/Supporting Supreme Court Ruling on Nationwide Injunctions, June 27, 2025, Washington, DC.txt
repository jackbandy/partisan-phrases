Supporting Supreme Court Ruling on Nationwide Injunctions

Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of this morning's  ruling from the Supreme Court that will greatly reform the ability of  rogue district court judges to issue nationwide injunctions.

According to a Politico article this morning, with this ruling, the  Supreme Court said that in most cases, judges can only grant relief to  the parties who brought a particular lawsuit and may not extend those  decisions to protect other individuals without going through the  process of converting a suit into a class action.

I have been fighting for this day for years, including introducing  legislation in multiple sessions of Congress that would curtail the  ability of rogue district court judges to issue nationwide injunctions,  often at the behest of special interest groups that shop around for a  friendly district court judge.

This is a good day for democracy. Please join me in congratulating  the Supreme Court for this outstanding ruling.
