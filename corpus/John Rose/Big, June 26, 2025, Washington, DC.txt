Big, Beautiful Bill Impact on Border Security

Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the Tennesseans I  represent who overwhelmingly support President Trump's One Big  Beautiful Bill Act. The bill delivers for the American people in many  ways, not the least of which is border security.

Under the last administration, 1,504 Iranians were caught crossing  the border illegally. Nearly half of them were released into the  country. We still don't know how many of them were on the terrorist  watch list. Let's think about that.

Last month, zero illegal immigrants were released into the U.S.,  compared to 62,000 a year ago in May.

Indeed, President Trump secured the border in record time, a master  class in leadership, without a blank check from Congress.

Now, it is on the Senate to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and  give the President the resources he needs to keep the border secure.  The bill will  fund more boots on the ground, more deportations, and the critical  border wall.
