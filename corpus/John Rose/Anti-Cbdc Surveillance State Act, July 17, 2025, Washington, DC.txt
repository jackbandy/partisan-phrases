Anti-Cbdc Surveillance State Act


Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1919, the Anti-CBDC  Surveillance State Act.

Among the many rights that we enjoy as Americans, privacy is among  the most fundamental. Establishing a central bank digital currency  would not only usurp consumers' privacy and individual freedoms, but it  would also hinder free market innovation.

Digital assets are here to stay. I agree strongly with President  Trump that the United States should be a leader in this space. However,  the last administration held a very different view. They wasted no time  exploring ways to set up a surveillance state digital currency managed  and micromanaged by the Federal Government.

President Trump understands the dangers of more government and more  surveillance. It is why he issued an executive order prohibiting a  CBDC. The vote before the House would make that ban permanent, and I  urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. Speaker, today the House will vote on the GENIUS Act, short for  the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins  Act. The bill, which was introduced in the Senate by my friend and  fellow Tennessean, Senator Bill Hagerty, provides a clear regulatory  framework for the issuance of payment stablecoins.

Today, this payment product is offered with little, if any, Federal  oversight. By establishing this regulatory clarity, this bill will  drive significant demand for stablecoins. This bill will ensure issuers  back stablecoins with high-quality liquid assets, a major win for the  American consumer.

The GENIUS Act includes consumer protections and enables innovators  to do what they do best. It also happens to strengthen the U.S.  dollar's reserve currency status. This will result in the ability to  make near-instant payments anywhere in the world, which is good for  consumers, companies, and Americans.
