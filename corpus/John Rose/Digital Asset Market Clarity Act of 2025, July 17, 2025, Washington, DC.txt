Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025

Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the CLARITY Act, which  provides long-overdue updates aimed at protecting the future of digital  assets, encouraging growth, and protecting American consumers.

The days of stifling this emerging industry through litigation and  rogue rulemaking must end. The Securities and Exchange Commission under  former Chair Gary Gensler went far outside the agency's statutory  mandate in many ways, especially with cryptocurrencies.

The CLARITY Act will strengthen transparency and accountability for  consumers. It will require developers to provide accurate disclosures  with details about the asset project's operation, ownership, and  structure. It requires brokers and dealers to disclose important  information to investors, to hold their own funds separate from their  customers' funds, and to report any conflicts of interest.

This bill ensures Americans know where they are putting their money,  and it gets government out of the way of growth and innovation.

Let's pass the CLARITY Act for the good of this country.
