Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the many families still  grieving from the heinous assault that claimed 1,200 innocent lives on  October 7, 2023.

Last Monday marked 500 days since Hamas terrorists perpetrated the  unprovoked and truly evil attack. It was the deadliest assault on  Israel and the Jewish community since the Holocaust.

I commend President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu for  their efforts to secure the recent cease-fire agreement. Because of  their collaboration, we are seeing some of the 240 hostages being  released, including Americans.

I urge my colleagues to keep the events of that horrific day top of  mind. It is imperative that the United States show unwavering support  for Israel and the Jewish community so that Hamas terrorists or any  other bad actors never attempt another attack on our closest ally in  the Middle East, Israel.
