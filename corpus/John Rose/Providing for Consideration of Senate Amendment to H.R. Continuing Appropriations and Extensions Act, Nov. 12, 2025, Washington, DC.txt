Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the Senate's provision  that allows Senators to make financial gain off illegal government  surveillance.

Three things can be true at once, Mr. Speaker. The first truth is  this: The shutdown has to end. The American people and countless  Tennesseans I represent are suffering and experiencing real pain. This  record-breaking Schumer Democratic shutdown was completely avoidable,  and it was completely carried out for political purposes.

The second truth is that the last administration, led by Joe Biden  and his autopen, unfairly surveilled conservatives and conservative  Members of Congress. That included sitting United States Senators.

Yet, Mr. Speaker, the third thing I would note is that the American  taxpayer has suffered enough because of the last administration. No one  in this body should support allowing Senators to sue and collect from  taxpayers because the FBI went rogue under President Biden.

Don't get me wrong. The overreach is more than troubling. It is  unfathomable that the Department of Justice was weaponized in this way.  I fully support holding those radical agents accountable and the  ongoing investigations into their misdeeds, yet no elected officials  should profit from  the political calculation of leftwing bureaucrats and judges.

Mr. Speaker, the folks I represent are still reeling from historic  Bidenflation, the effects of the border crisis, and the regulatory  agenda of the last administration. It is shameful to ask them to  shoulder the burden of paying U.S. Senators a half million dollars or  more for those misdeeds.
