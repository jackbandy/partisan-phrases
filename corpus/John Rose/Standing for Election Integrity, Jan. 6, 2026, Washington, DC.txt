Standing for Election Integrity

Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, do we rubberstamp fraudulent election results  or stand for election integrity? That was the question before Congress  5 years ago today.

It was a sunny day in Washington. A largely peaceful protest was  growing outside and, unfortunately, made its way into the Capitol. As a  result, a joint session of Congress, originally set to be conducted in  the afternoon, wasn't finished until midnight or after.

Yet, the events of that day didn't change the serious concerns raised  about the ways six States conducted their elections. Members of  Congress still had a constitutional duty to defend our Nation's  election laws.

I was proud to object to the results in six States and vote not to  certify the results of the two States that came to a vote in this room  on that day. I was proud to stand for our election laws and to stand  with President Trump.

The American people remember that election well, and they remember  those Members of Congress who turned their backs on election integrity  and principle.
