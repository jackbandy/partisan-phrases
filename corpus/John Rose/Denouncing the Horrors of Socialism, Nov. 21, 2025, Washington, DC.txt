Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism

Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 58,  titled: ``Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism.'' It is a shame that I  have to defend the obvious, but it is necessary because, unfortunately,  across the Nation, progressive Democrats are increasingly cozy with the  failed, discredited ideology.

Socialism has time and again led to economic ruin, human deprivation,  and mass suffering. From the breadlines of Eastern Europe to the failed  Communist regimes of Cuba and Venezuela, socialism promises equality  but delivers it selectively. It promises security but delivers  surveillance. It promises fairness but delivers oppression and  democide.

Yet, shockingly, socialism is making a comeback here in America, even  in the world's greatest city. The newly elected, self-proclaimed  democratic socialist mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, offers  socialism. He is a mayor who champions radical economic overreach, a  progressive ideology that can easily turn once-prosperous countries  into wastelands.

Americans built New York City as a gateway for immigrants seeking a  better life. We built it on freedom, self-reliance, and open markets,  not on forced redistribution or centralized planning.

The situation now extends to Seattle, where the mayor-elect has  chosen to boycott Starbucks, a company founded in her own city.

Is this what we want, a country where those who run our cities turn  their backs on the very entrepreneurial spirit that made them thrive?

Meanwhile, I believe that we are still that shining city on the hill.  We welcome more legal immigrants than any nation on Earth, more than  the next four countries combined. They don't come because they crave  government control, but because they flee it. They come for liberty.  They come for freedom.
