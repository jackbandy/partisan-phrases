Disapproving the Action of the District of Columbia Council in Approving the D.C. Income and Franchise Tax Conformity and Revision Temporary Amendment Act of 2025


Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Gill for yielding time  today.

Mr. Speaker, I was proud to vote in favor of the Working Families Tax  Cut Act to deliver tax relief to millions of Americans that included no  tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and support for small businesses, so  what does the D.C. Council do?

They voted to deny their own residents these benefits. This means a  waitress working in a Washington, D.C., restaurant gets taxed on her  tips on her D.C. tax return while her counterpart in Virginia doesn't  get taxed on their Virginia tax return. For a construction worker  putting in overtime, D.C. takes a cut.

This is the kind of move that makes people furious. Congress  delivered tax relief for Americans and Washington, D.C., said: Not for  our residents. The District claims they need the revenue.

By their own estimate, this revenue is .6 of 1 percent of their  annual budget. They are squeezing every penny out of working families  over less than 1 percent of their budget because they can't spend  responsibly.

Let's think about what that means. D.C. would rather tax a single  mother's tips and take money from overtime checks from hardworking  residents than make responsible spending decisions. That is not  governance. That is a shakedown.

This is D.C. politicians protecting their spending habits on the  backs of waitresses and construction workers. This is the same broken  government mentality we see time and time again.

Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution disapproving of D.C.'s tax  grab.
