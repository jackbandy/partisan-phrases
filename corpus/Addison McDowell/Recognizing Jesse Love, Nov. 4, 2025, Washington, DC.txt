Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, over the past weekend, on November 1,  2025, Jesse Love, Jr. brought home the 2025 NASCAR Xfinity title from  Phoenix, Arizona. Love held the lead for the final 24 laps, displaying  his dominance as he secured his third career victory on his first-ever  non-superspeedway track.

At just 20 years old, Love is no stranger to winning and bringing  back hardware to the stock car racing capital of the world. At age 15,  he set a record as the youngest winner of the ARCA Menards Series West  and the youngest winner in any NASCAR-sanctioned race.

North Carolina is proud of its long heritage in racing. Love drives  for Richard Childress Racing out of Welcome, North Carolina, a team  known for its historic caliber of elite racers, from Dale Earnhardt  claiming six NASCAR Cup Series championships and two Daytona 500s, to  Austin Dillon bringing home a third Daytona 500 victory in 2018. RCR  racing continues to represent the pride of North Carolina in the stock  car racing community around the world.

I congratulate Love and the entire RCR racing team. The future of  NASCAR is with the drivers who represent the sport with honor and  spirit.
