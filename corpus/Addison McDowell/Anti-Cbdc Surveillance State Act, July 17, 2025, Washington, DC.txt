Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, America is not a surveillance state, and under  Republican leadership, it never will be. Today, this Congress has the  opportunity to lay the foundation for a digital future that protects  freedom and financial privacy.

At the center of that effort is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.  This bill ensures that no central bank digital currency will be created  under the Federal Reserve. We have seen what that looks like in  Communist China where the CCP uses it to track, monitor, and control  their people, but not here, Mr. Speaker. Not in the land of the free  because together with the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act, we will  protect Americans' financial liberty and make the United States the  crypto capital of the world.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
