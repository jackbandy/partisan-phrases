Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Chair, my home State of North Carolina has  recognized the Lumbee Tribe since 1885, yet for more than 135 years,  their fight for full Federal recognition has been blocked by red tape  and indifference.

In 1956, Congress acknowledged the Lumbee Tribe but cruelly denied  them the services and the benefits afforded to other federally  recognized Tribes. That mistake has never been corrected, but finally  Congress has the opportunity to right its wrong.

The Lumbees are more than 55,000 strong, making them the largest  Tribe east of the Mississippi. They have defended this Nation in  uniform. They have contributed to our economy and preserved a proud  heritage that strengthens our State and our country.

Today, this House has an opportunity to finally deliver justice for  the ``People of the Dark Water'' of North Carolina. I strongly urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''
