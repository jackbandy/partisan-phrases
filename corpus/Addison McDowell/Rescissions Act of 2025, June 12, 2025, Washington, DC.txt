Rescissions Act of 2025

Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, today we do what lifelong bureaucrats in  this town fear most: We cut their funding.

For far too long, Washington bureaucrats have taken advantage of the  American taxpayer, sending their hard-earned money to fund the corrupt  foreign aid complex, and pushing government funding for educational  programs that groom our children. That stops today.

The Rescissions Act of 2025 is not just a bill. It is a part of a  much larger course correction. This bill rips back over $9 billion from  the clutches of globalist NGOs, projects that fund radical gender  ideology, and the green new scam.

The great people of North Carolina didn't send me here to manage  decline. They sent me here to help President Trump usher in the new  golden age. Let the left scream. Let the media moan and grown, but  today we are putting Americans first and looking out for their hard- earned tax dollars. I urge a ``yes'' vote.
