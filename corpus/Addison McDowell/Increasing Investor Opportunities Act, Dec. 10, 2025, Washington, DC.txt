Increasing Investor Opportunities Act

Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Chairman, the INVEST Act calls us to review a  simple truth: A nation that unleashes the talent of its people will  never be left behind.

For too long, outdated regulations have stood in the way of our  brightest entrepreneurs gaining the capital that they need to build,  grow, and compete.

The INVEST Act changes that and opens the door for new investment. It  gives small businesses from rural America, in districts like mine, more  opportunity at raising capital without drowning in red tape. It expands  opportunities for the everyday investor, not just those who already  have an accounting department that is big enough to actually navigate  through the Federal bureaucracy.

The INVEST Act makes it easier for companies to tap into American  capital markets so we can continue strengthening our financial system  here at home rather than abroad.

Mr. Chair, small businesses and innovators are the backbone of our  domestic economy, and access to capital is vital to their success. The  INVEST Act clears a path for just that.

Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
