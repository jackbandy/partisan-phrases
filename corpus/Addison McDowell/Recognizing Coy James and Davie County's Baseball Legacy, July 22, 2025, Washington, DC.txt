Mr. McDOWELL. Madam Speaker, today, I recognize one of North  Carolina's brightest young athletes, Coy James of Davie County, who now  joins the ranks of great ballplayers from the Tar Heel State.

Coy was selected by the Washington Nationals in the fifth round of  the 2025 MLB Draft. Known across North Carolina for his power at the  plate and his elite play at shortstop, Coy is a force.

He follows in the footsteps of other Davie County stars, including  Carson Whisenhunt, drafted a few years ago out of East Carolina by the  San Francisco Giants and three-time MLB All-Star Whit Merrifield, who  just retired after nine seasons in the majors.

These men are a testament to the deep love Davie County has for the  game of baseball. We are proud to have them representing our community  on diamonds across the country, and we wish them all the best as they  take on their next chapter.
