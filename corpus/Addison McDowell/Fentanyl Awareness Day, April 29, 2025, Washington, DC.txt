Fentanyl Awareness Day

Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, today is Fentanyl Awareness Day, a day  meant to spread awareness of a ruthless poison that has stolen the  lives of too many of our sons, daughters, sisters, and brothers.

My family and I know this pain personally. My brother Luke was taken  from us by a single pill laced with illegal fentanyl.

Mr. Speaker, so many families across our country have experienced  this same pain. It is a tragedy, but we cannot let heartache keep us  down. Our family and this country, we do not weep in the wake. We rise,  we fight, and we prevail.

When America enforces her laws, we win. Fentanyl trafficking is down  54 percent. Border encounters are down 93 percent. Thousands of MS-13  thugs have been thrown out.

This is no accident. It is the result of strong leadership, of  resolve, and of putting America first.

I will continue to do my part and fight for families against this  poison.
