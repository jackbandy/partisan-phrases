Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, today we take another big step toward  delivering a course correction for our country. The American people  sent us here with a mandate, to fight back and deliver on a promise.  That is what the One Big Beautiful Bill Act does.

Americans should first know what my colleagues in opposition to this  legislation are voting for and what they are voting against.

Not passing this bill means a $1,700 increase in taxes for the  average American family of four. Mr. Speaker, that might not be a big  deal to the elites in Manhattan or San Francisco, but it does mean a  lot to the people of my district in North Carolina.

Not passing this bill means our Border Patrol officers and our Coast  Guard won't have what they need to secure the border and stop the flow  of deadly fentanyl.

It doesn't stop there, Mr. Speaker. Opposing this bill also means  protecting waste over purpose, fraud over fairness, and foreign  interests over American strength.

Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure voters in my district know what  passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will mean for them. It means  they get to keep more of their hard-earned money. It means that small  businesses can spend more money on their employees instead of sending  it to Washington. This bill will make our communities safer by making a  historic investment in our border security. No more dangerous, illegal  aliens parading around with no consequences.

Mr. Speaker, this legislation is one of the most consequential items  we will vote on. It is President Trump's agenda, and it is what we all  told the people back home we would do.

Now the House must get it done. I urge all of my colleagues to vote  in favor of this rule. Let's choose our country over comfort and get  the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to the President's desk.
