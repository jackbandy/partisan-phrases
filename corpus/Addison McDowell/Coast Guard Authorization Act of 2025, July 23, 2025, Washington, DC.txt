Mr. McDOWELL. Madam Speaker, today and every day the brave men and  women of the United States Coast Guard carry out a critical mission:  securing our borders, patrolling our waters, and saving American lives.

As vice chair of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation  Subcommittee, I have seen firsthand how vital their service is to our  national security and to our prosperity.

The Coast Guard Authorization Act gives our guardsmen the tools, the  resources, and the support that they need to meet today's threats,  whether it is stopping fentanyl at sea, stopping illegal migrants, or  responding to natural disasters.

This bill is about backing the Coast Guard the same way that they  back us every single day.

I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.
