Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to send my greatest gratitude  to Representative Harry Warren as he retires after eight terms serving  the people of Rowan County in North Carolina's 76th District.

Representative Warren has been a steady, respected voice in Raleigh,  and folks back home knew that they could always count on him. He  listened, he worked hard, and he treated everyone with fairness and  respect.

As someone who represents Rowan County in Congress, I have seen the  impact of his work up close. He has been a strong advocate for the  community, a trusted partner, and a genuinely good man. We are grateful  for his service, and I wish him all the best in his next chapter.
