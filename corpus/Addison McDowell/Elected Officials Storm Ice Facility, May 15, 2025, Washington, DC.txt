Elected Officials Storm Ice Facility

Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle have repeated the phrase ``budgets are about priorities'' a  lot lately.

Mr. Speaker, do you know what really signals someone's priorities? It  is their actions.

Just last week, we witnessed a group of elected officials storm an  ICE facility, demanding sympathy for illegal aliens who are violent  gang members, rapists, and murderers.

Mr. Speaker, each of us is elected to represent our constituents and  put American citizens first. The idea that someone could take the oath  and then storm through law enforcement simply boggles the mind.

If my colleagues want to talk about priorities, Mr. Speaker, here is  one they should remember: The safety of law-abiding Americans is more  important than the demands of foreign criminals.
