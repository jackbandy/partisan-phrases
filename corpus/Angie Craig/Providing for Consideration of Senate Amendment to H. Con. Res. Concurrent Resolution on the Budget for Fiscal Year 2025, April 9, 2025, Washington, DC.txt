Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, President Trump changes his tariff policy  more than most people change their socks. One day he is picking fights  with Canada and Mexico, our friends, and the next day he is launching a  global trade war. Today, he is pausing tariffs on some countries while  also increasing them on China. What our farmers, ranchers, and  producers need is certainty.

I don't know how my Republican colleagues can say that any of this is  all according to plan with a straight face.

There is no plan. There is no art of the deal. Trump's reckless  tariffs are costing hardworking Americans $4,600 a year, hurting small  businesses, and absolutely tanking retirement savings.

Farmers are taking losses on days they go to market only to turn  around and see conditions improve a few hours later because of a tweet  from the President.

How is that strategic?

Trump alienated our trade partners and destroyed our credibility as a  country that foreign governments can do business with. House  Republicans are acting as his rubberstamp by banning the House from  taking action to stop it.

We need an adult in the room, and I cannot find a single one on the  other side of the aisle. This President's tantrums are causing economic  global panic. The House must be able to debate and vote on these  tariffs. You have the same farmers I do coming through your offices  right now to tell you it is not just the tariffs; it is the uncertainty  of the tariffs and the disappearing markets. Doing nothing allows  American families to be crushed by these reckless tariffs.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote to defeat the previous  question.
