Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Linda Larson on  fulfilling her lifelong dream of completing her college education.  Linda graduated with an Associate's Degree with an emphasis on  political science from Inver Hills Community College. She also  graduated as part of Phi Beta Kappa.

Linda grew up on a small farm near Ruthton, Minnesota. As the  daughter of a tenant farmer, Linda learned early on the challenges and  instability farmers face in trying to earn a living. This informed her  work at the Minnesota Farmers Union (MFU), where she has advocated for  affordable healthcare and the needs of family farmers. Additionally,  Linda has been a strong leader for women in farming. In 2013, she  helped reestablish the MFU Women's Conference and later received the  2013 MFU Leadership Excellence award along with her husband, Brian. She  is the current president of the Dakota County Farmers Union and  regularly attends Farmers Union events at the local, state and national  level.

I know Linda through her work on my Farmers Advisory Council, which  she has been a member of since I came to Congress in 2019. Linda has  provided invaluable feedback to my work on agriculture policy as I've  fought to ensure family farmers have a strong farm safety net. I look  forward to our continued collaboration to pass a bipartisan farm bill.

I congratulate Linda on her graduation and thank her for her service  to our community.
