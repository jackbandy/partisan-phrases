Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ann Bailey on  her retirement as President of DARTS. Ann began her Journey with DARTS  years before becoming President. When her father was diagnosed with  Alzheimer's Disease, Ann worked diligently to get him the care he  needed. Through her network, someone suggested that she call DARTS, a  community-based organization serving caregivers and older adults in  Minnesota. That call was a turning point for Ann and her father. She  went on to join the Board of Directors and ultimately became President  of the organization in 2015.

During her 10 years as President, Ann reimagined DARTS' vision to  best serve individuals in the southeast metro area. She invested in the  organization's volunteer program, revamped annual community and  fundraising events and led the effort to turn part of their West St.  Paul space into affordable senior apartments. When the pandemic hit in  2020, Ann ensured her team and volunteers were positioned to continue  engagement with seniors in a safe way. DARTS also provided support to  organizations that were struggling.

Over the last 10 years, Ann has made DARTS a well-known and reliable  community-based organization. Seniors and older adults in the community  have a support system and caregivers have services to rely on. I'm  proud to have worked with Ann since I first came to Congress in 2019.  She even helped to moderate and participate in one of my town halls.  Her passion for this work and drive to support our seniors is  inspirational. I know I will continue to seek her guidance, especially  when it comes to showing up for our most vulnerable community members.

I thank Ann for her vision and years of service.
