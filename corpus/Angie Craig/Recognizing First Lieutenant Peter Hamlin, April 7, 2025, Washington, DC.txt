Recognizing First Lieutenant Peter Hamlin, U.S. Army


Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Peter Hamlin, a  constituent and Vietnam War veteran living in Farmington, Minnesota.

Peter was born in Boston in 1941, attended college at the University  of Cincinnati and received a master's degree from George Washington  University before enlisting in the United States Army in 1966. After  enlisting, he completed Officer Cadet School, Army Airborne School, and  Army Ranger School before deploying to Vietnam in 1969, where he would  serve as a member of the 20th Infantry Regiment and platoon leader for  the 75th Ranger Regiment, acting as a go-between for teams in the field  and artillery and air support units in the sky. When he was later  transferred to the 173rd Airborne, he served as a liaison officer,  bringing aid and support to local villages.

He received several medals recognizing his courageous service over  four campaigns in Vietnam, including the Bronze Star, the Army Air  Medal, and the Army Valorous Unit Award. He is most proud, however, of  his Combat Infantry Badge, which he received for his bravery in ground  combat as an infantryman in Vietnam.

After his military career ended, Peter returned to Iowa, where he  worked for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources for more than three  decades, including many years as Director of Air Quality. Today, he  lives in Farmington with his wife Judy, his sons Brian, Jacob and  Kevin, and his seven grandchildren.

Peter dedicated both his military and civilian careers to serving and  protecting his fellow Americans. I am honored to have this opportunity  to recognize and thank him for his many years of distinguished service.
