Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026

Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I want to  start by thanking my colleagues in the Democratic Party who did  everything in their power to make these bills as best they could under  very difficult circumstances.

Over the past month, President Trump has made it his mission to  incite chaos and fear in Minnesota. He has taken his quest for  political retribution to our communities, and Minnesotans have paid the  price.

Through President Trump and Kristi Noem's reckless and lawless ICE  operations, the administration has targeted communities of color,  ripped families apart, detained U.S. citizens, and made it harder for  law enforcement to do their jobs. As a result, it has endangered every  single Minnesotan.

Earlier this month, the President's political stunt got a Minneapolis  mother, Renee Good, killed. That didn't prompt the President to  withdraw ICE or attempt to deescalate the unfolding situation in our  cities. Why? Because escalation isn't a symptom. It is the whole point.

I won't vote to give Kristi Noem's ICE one damn penny, but the truth  is, I refuse to play any part in this administration's cruel and  dangerous agenda. While there are certainly some important provisions  in these bills, and I commend my colleagues for working to get them to  the place that I know we are now, I can't in good faith support any  funding package that enables this administration in any way until ICE  de-escalates in Minnesota.

This is not how we operate in America. It is certainly not how we  operate in Minnesota. As Members of Congress, we must do everything in  our power to fight this administration at every turn, and that means  using the power of the purse to curb the President's executive  authority.

I urge my colleagues in this body to support me. Enough is enough.
