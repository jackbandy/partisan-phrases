Support for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025

Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Chair, overdose deaths are preventable, and we should  be using all the tools at our disposal to save American families from  the pain of losing a loved one to opioids. It is past time we treat the  opioid crisis like the public health crisis that it is.

My bipartisan RECONNECTIONS Act will do that by helping get overdose  education and prevention tools like naloxone into the hands of those  who need it. I am proud that my commonsense bill is included in the  SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025.

It is great to see my colleagues recognizing the urgency of the  crisis, but we have to be clear-eyed about the moment we are in.  Medicaid is the country's single-largest payer of both mental health  and substance use services, and it is on the chopping block if my  Republican colleagues' budget bill is signed into law.

We have to protect Medicaid at all costs. I will continue standing up  against any cuts to these lifesaving benefits.

Mr. Chair, I thank everyone who has been part of this fight. This  bill will save lives.
