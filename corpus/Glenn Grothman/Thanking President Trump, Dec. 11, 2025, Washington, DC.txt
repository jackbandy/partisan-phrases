Thanking President Trump

Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank President Trump and his Secretary  of Defense for acting resolutely when it became apparent a boat full of  illegal drugs, including fentanyl, was coming across the Caribbean Sea.

Every year in this country about 80,000 people have been dying. It  used to be over 100,000 people killed from illegal drugs. For far too  long, wimpy Presidents sat there, watched it happen, and didn't do  anything.

Finally, President Trump stepped up to the plate when he heard that  there was a boat coming with enough fentanyl to kill millions of  Americans. He acted resolutely. I am sure he had lawyers who told him  he could and lawyers who told him he couldn't. He said, I am going to  err on the side of saving tens of thousands of American lives.

Mr. Speaker, I recently found out that I knew somebody whose son died  of a fentanyl overdose and how horrible that must be. The rest of their  life must be devastated. I am glad President Trump feels their pain,  and he is acting strongly in this situation.

I thank President Trump.
