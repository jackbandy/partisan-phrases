Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, when Congress is in session, there are  always interesting articles in the paper that I think demand a little  bit more attention.

Over the weekend, or late last week, there was an article that said  that the United Kingdom, in a few years, is going to begin having 16- year-olds vote. Since frequently problems in America happen in Great  Britain first, I think it is something we should pay a great deal of  attention to.

About 6 years ago, in this body, an amendment was offered allowing  16-year-olds to vote in Federal elections. Well over half the Democrats  voted in favor of 16-year-olds. Why would one want to do that?

Mr. Speaker, 16-year-olds have nowhere near the wisdom and experience  to make decisions as to who to vote for in elections. The only way you  would want to do it is if you want to manipulate these young minds in  the schools across the country.

I, like I think many other people, would have voted entirely  differently when I was 16 than when I was 26.

We have to be on the alert, and our comatose press corps should be  asking the Democrats now where they stand on the 16-year-old voting  age.
