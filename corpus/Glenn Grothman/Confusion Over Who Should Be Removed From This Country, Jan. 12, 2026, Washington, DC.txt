Confusion Over Who Should Be Removed From This Country

Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, like many Americans, I caught a little of  the TV over the weekend, which was dominated by the tragic events in  Minneapolis.

However, there is one thing I felt had to be commented on because I  think there is a lot of confusion as to who we should be removing in  this country.

Right now in America, we have no shortage of people who are here from  other countries. We are at an all-time high, even greater than the  1890s or 2010s in the number of people in this country who were not  born here. That is over 15 percent. We are naturalizing about 850,000  people a year.

Nevertheless, there are Congressmen who keep getting confused and  think the only people that should be removed from this country after  Joe Biden left about 10 million people in the country illegally are  people who committed serious crimes. That is ridiculous. Of the 10  million people that Joe Biden let in or 8 million people, whatever,  obviously it is up to ICE to remove as many as possible and get back to  historical norms.
