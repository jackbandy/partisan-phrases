America Cannot Have Unlimited Immigration

Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, Congress is leaving and won't be back  until next week. If it is like every other weekend, a lot of what you  see on television is going to be incidents going on in Minnesota  affected by the immigration situation.

I remind my colleagues and the American people that we are a Nation  of immigrants, but every year we naturalize about 800,000 new folks.  That is about five times what it was when I was a child. Mr. Speaker,  16 percent of the people in our country were not born in America. That  is the highest it has been since before 1890.

We have nothing to apologize for that we are not letting enough  people in this country. However, sadly, there are too many elected  officials who, in essence, want to get rid of the immigration laws. We  saw this in the 2016 election in which way too many Democrats promised  free medical care for people who come here.

In any event, we are very generous to immigrants. We cannot have  unlimited immigration.
