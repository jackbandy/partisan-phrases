Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to be a cosponsor of the  Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act.

I remember when I was a child I think the average high school student  weighed, whatever, 20 or 30 pounds less than they do today, and we had  nothing but whole milk. Whole milk was distributed for lunch to all the  children. We were taught from first or second grade and onward that  calcium, vitamin A, potassium, magnesium, zinc, and all the nutrients  that are necessary are in whole milk. I think this is one of the  reasons God gave us a body in which whole milk clearly tastes better  than 2 percent milk and way better than skim milk.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to strike a blow for freedom and to  bring the healthiness of our children back to what it was 50 years ago  and pass the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act.
