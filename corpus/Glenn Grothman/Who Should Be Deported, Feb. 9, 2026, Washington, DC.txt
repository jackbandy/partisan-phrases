Who Should Be Deported

Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, if you were paying attention since we last  met, more and more politicos or officials are weighing in on who should  be deported to our southern border.

I want to emphasize that the American people have to stand up and say  that if you are coming here illegally, you should be deported. There  are some people I think are apparently for limited amnesty or no  immigration laws at all and say we should only be deporting people who  have broken the law. Obviously, that would mean that if the only law  you have broken is coming here in the first place, probably 98 or 99  percent of the 8 million people who entered under Joe Biden would be  able to stay.

I implore ICE to deport people who are here illegally. If they want  to single out somebody in addition to the worst of the worst on  criminal behavior, they can go after people getting public benefits,  which is also illegal, and they should be removed immediately.

Mr. Speaker, in any event, we should enforce our laws.
