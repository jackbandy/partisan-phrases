Charlie Kirk's Religious Message

Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, a lot has been said the last few days  about the horrible assassination of Charlie Kirk.

I was able to attend two ceremonies over the weekend in which people  gathered to memorialize him.

I hear a lot of people talking about Charlie Kirk exercising his  right to political free speech, and we have to respect people's ability  to engage in political speech.

I think if you look at some of his videos, and certainly if you  attended these ceremonies, Charlie Kirk was a much more religious  person than a political person. I think that is lost on a lot of  people, lost on a lot of political commentators.

I think particularly in this era of declining church attendance, a  time when so many young people are raised in families that don't even  go to church, I think his speaking about Christianity and his faith and  the importance to carry on his mission is more important than his  political statements.
