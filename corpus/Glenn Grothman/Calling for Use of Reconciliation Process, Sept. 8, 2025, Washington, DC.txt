Calling for Use of Reconciliation Process

Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, we are going to follow up with a theme  that has been talked about earlier within our Conference.

Frequently, Republicans have to go home and explain why they aren't  getting done what they want to get done. It is because the rules in the  Senate require 60 votes to break a filibuster, which means that you  need Chuck Schumer to sign off in order to get almost anything done in  the Senate.

However, three times in this 2-year period, through the process  called reconciliation, we are able to pass a bill out of the Senate  with 50 votes or 51 votes with the Vice President. There are  Republicans here who do not want to put us in that position.

Mr. Speaker, 8 years ago in Donald Trump's first term, some of these  same Republicans, when we also had three votes--we used one vote for  the tax cut, one vote to try and failed to do something on healthcare  reform, and a third vote that the Senators didn't want to use. They  wanted to restrict the floor votes to votes in which Chuck Schumer  signed off.

We are now at the same position this time, and I hope that our talk  radio and mouthpieces will wake up and demand that the Republicans use  all three reconciliation votes this biennium.
