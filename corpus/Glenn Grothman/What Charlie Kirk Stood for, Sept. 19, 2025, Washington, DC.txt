Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, it seems hard to believe that it is not  even 10 days since Charlie Kirk was assassinated.

We all know why he was assassinated. He was assassinated in part  because he stood by our Constitution and believed in the limited  government that our forefathers wanted. He was also killed for his  Christianity. I have come to realize he was far more of a religious  leader than he was a political leader.

We have to now follow what he would have wanted, had he survived. I  think that is two things. First of all, in America right now, church  attendance was down. We can all be wonderful Christians without going  to church, but it is a bad sign that church attendance was going down.

Let's all redouble our efforts to support our local churches. Look  for Bible-believing churches, as Charlie Kirk wanted, and hopefully  they will grow and thrive.

In Congress, let's try to get back one more time to the limited  government that our Constitution so clearly demanded and stop asking  the Federal Government to add another program after program after  program, but instead, have the type of government that encourages self- reliance and strong families.
