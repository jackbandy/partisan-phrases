Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I think I have to address some of the things  that I think are out of line or misspoke with regard to the other party  today.

First of all, I want to point out there are not a lot of details in  this budget. The budget has a lot of top-line numbers in which we try  to keep tax cuts that went into effect 8 years ago in effect because we  had a strong economy with high employment. There are no specific cuts  in here.

The frustrating thing I hear from the other side is that they are  talking about that any cut or any reduction in spending is a problem.  Let me remind people, 26 percent of the current level of spending for  the current year is borrowed. That should be of huge concern to  everybody. The average American has about $100,000 as their share of  debt. Think of that, a family of four has $400,000 in their share of  the debt. The average person or the average American in the budget  coming up this year will be spending about $20,000.

Mr. GROTHMAN. One more time, remember, America has to know that 26  percent of every Social Security dollar, 26 percent of every new tank,  20 percent of every new education dollar is borrowed, at a time where  interest costs are going up.
