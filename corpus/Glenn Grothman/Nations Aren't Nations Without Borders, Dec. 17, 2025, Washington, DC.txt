Nations Aren't Nations Without Borders

Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I would like to interject a little bit  of common sense in the deportation debate we have had going on here.

No one knows exactly how many people are in this country illegally. I  think it is safe to say that under President Biden that number went up  by about 8 million, which means almost certainly it is over 15 million.

There are some muddled up people here who claim that all we should do  is remove the illegal immigrants if they are breaking the law. That,  obviously, makes no sense.

I applaud President Trump and Kristi Noem for trying to remove all  people who are here illegally, otherwise we have no immigration law in  the first place. If someone comes here illegally and all they have to  do is avoid committing a serious crime, then we have no country.

Our next President will wind up getting another eight to ten million  people crossing here, together with the increased welfare costs,  housing costs, and government services it applies, together with the  change in culture in the United States away from the culture that we  have had that has allowed America to go so long.

I thank Donald Trump and Kristi Noem.
