Abandon Biden Administration Rule

Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I call upon the Trump  administration to abandon the drastic Biden-Harris 14(c) rule. The  14(c) rule is with regard to allowing certain people with handicaps to  work for under minimum wage.

I have toured many work centers or shelter workshops in my district  in which people who have different abilities are allowed to work--maybe  they have spina bifida, maybe Down's Syndrome. I know a guy who is an  outright quadriplegic. They are allowed to work for under minimum wage.

They usually get some other sort of Federal subsidy, SSI or  something, but by being allowed to work in these places, they are able  to supplement their income. They have the dignity of work. They have  the socialization of somebody outside of their families.

I strongly encourage the Trump administration to abandon the drastic  Biden-Harris 14(c) rule, and I encourage all of my colleagues in the  U.S. Congress to tour some of their own shelter workshops, where you  can see how valuable they are in the life of people who are given a  little bit less than some of us in some ways to live their lives.
