United States Naturalizes People Every Year

Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, immigration is in the news again, and I  don't feel the Republicans have done a good enough job of explaining  what is going on here.

During the Biden administration--people are going to argue--somewhere  between 8 million and 10 million people were allowed in this country  who were not coming here legally.

Obviously, if we are going to have immigration laws, in the future,  we have to make it clear that people who broke the laws in the past are  not allowed in the country.

What is going on is that we have riots in Minnesota, and important  Democratic officials who are saying something is wrong here.

Let us not forget: Every year in this country, 850,000 people are  naturalized. They are sworn in as new citizens. We are at an all-time  record of the number of foreign-born people in this country. The United  States has nothing to apologize for about the number of people being  allowed in this country, as we try to remove people.

Right now, in Minnesota, the Governor and mayor aren't even in favor  of ICE removing criminals, and we should be removing other people who  came here.

In any event, remember in America, we naturalize 850,000 people every  year.
