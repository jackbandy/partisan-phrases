Events in Milwaukee

Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is nice to be back in Congress after a  little break being home. We look at the news back home, and in  Milwaukee we had another tragedy. For the fourth time this year, a city  of Milwaukee police officer was shot. This time, sadly, it was fatal.  When Officer Kendall Corder was killed, we suffered another savage  murder in Milwaukee.

When I was a child, Milwaukee was the safest of the 25 biggest cities  in this country. We have gone a long way from that. I hope this House  addresses the root causes of why we have so much more crime in our  major cities than we did 25 years ago.

Also while I was at home, I ran into somebody who is in a low-income  housing unit that receives the low-income housing tax credits. This  person was being asked to confirm that they did not get any raise in  the last year.

This is a horrible program. It is an embarrassment. The Republicans  extended it in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and I hope we  immediately do something to stop this program, which discourages people  from working and improving their lives.
