Low-Income Housing Tax Credit

Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, today in a committee hearing, in which  there were probably very few people in the room, the Republican  majority voted to expand the low-income housing tax credit.

First of all, the low-income housing tax credit doesn't really  benefit a lot of low-income people, but in any event, the way it works,  we give 70 percent of the cost of a developer's project to him in tax  credits. That seems a strange way to solve the housing crisis in this  country for a Democrat. It is even stranger for a Republican.

In any event, I think people should look at this. We are spending  $13.5 billion every year on this credit and, like I said, you can get  it on all sorts of think tanks. The primary beneficiary is the  developer. Probably the number two beneficiary is the biggest banks in  the country. It is something that ought to be reviewed.
