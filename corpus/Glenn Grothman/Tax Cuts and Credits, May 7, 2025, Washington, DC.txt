Tax Cuts and Credits

Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, we are on the final couple of weeks, the  home stretch, with regard to our big, beautiful bill. There are going  to be a lot of debates as to what we should do. Some people actually  want to expand programs which, in our current crisis, is unbelievable  for a Republican to do.

However, I am going to address which tax cuts we have. Different tax  cuts do different things. We have tax credits to encourage  manufacturing. We have tax credits to encourage more work. We have tax  credits to encourage more research. We have tax cuts to encourage more  children.

However, there are some people who want tax cuts to encourage State  and local governments to spend more money and raise taxes.

When I was home over the weekend, I talked to one of my county  executives. He said: Glenn, don't let it happen.

He is a conservative county executive, and he is trying to hold down  the spending on the county level, and here the people in Washington are  talking about encouraging more State and local taxes.

Please, Mr. Speaker, stand up and fight. Do not encourage our State  and local governments to raise taxes.
