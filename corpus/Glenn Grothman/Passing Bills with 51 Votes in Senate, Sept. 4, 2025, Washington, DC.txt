Passing Bills with 51 Votes in Senate


Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that all  conservative opinion makers be aware of one of the controversies that  is going on here right now.

The United States is over $37 trillion in debt. You may hear from  your local Congressman that all sorts of things can't be done because  we have a 60-vote rule in the U.S. Senate, and we can't pass many bills  without the 60 votes, including the big appropriation bills that have  to pass every year.

However, once a year, and due to a quirk, three times in the 2 years  that this body is elected, we will have a chance to pass a bill with  only 51 votes in the Senate. That is what we just did with regard to  the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Obviously, there should be more changes to this government. There are  people right now in this building who would like to have us not take  advantage of the provision to pass any bill with 51 votes for the next  year and 4 months. That is horrible.

I hope conservative commentators are all over this. I hope they are  asking any Congressmen if they really think we should waste the  opportunities to pass bills with 51 percent or with 51 votes.
