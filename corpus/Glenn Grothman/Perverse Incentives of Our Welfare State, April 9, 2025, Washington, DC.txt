Perverse Incentives of Our Welfare State

Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will point out one more time the  perverse incentives of our welfare state.

I will just mention one type right now: Section 42, low-income  housing. Section 42 low-income housing is very generous to property  developers, who wind up only having to pay for 30 percent of the cost  of their housing.

Worse, because it is new housing, I had a staffer looking for a new  apartment building with her new husband, and they found out the best  apartments in town were the low-income housing.

In order to be eligible for low-income housing, you almost certainly  can't be married. In order to be eligible, you can't be working very  hard.

I think this body ought to get out of the business of encouraging  people not to work hard, and they especially ought to get out of the  business of discriminating against people who are married with  children. I sure hope that this body, when we finally deal with the  reconciliation bill, gets rid of these perverse antimarriage  incentives.
