Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to one more time congratulate  President Trump on a great speech last night. He is a great orator. I  think of the six speeches I have heard him give in this Chamber. That  was the best one yet.

He did a great job of recounting the successes he has had in  immigration, the successes he has had in healthcare, the successes he  has had using the tax code to help out parents with children, which is,  I think, the one area in life in which having a decent revenue stream  is most important.

However, he did lay out what is going to be a future conflict within  the Republican Party, and it is important that our conservatives are  aware of it.

President Trump is conscious of the fact that as revenue comes in  from the tariffs, there are people who are going to want to spend it  and people who are going to want to lower other taxes. It is important  that all true Republicans weigh in and double their efforts to make  sure that we do not use any of these increased tariffs to increase the  role of government in people's lives.
