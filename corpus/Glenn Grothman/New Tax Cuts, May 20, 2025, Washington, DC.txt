New Tax Cuts


Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I feel I must address one of the key  issues that we are going to be dealing with in the next 2 days, and  that is: What type of new tax cuts are we going to put into the  Internal Revenue Code?

Some people think that if I had my choice, I would bring back the  personal exemption and put $1,000, or $2,000, or $3,000 per child on  that return because there is no time in life in which you need money  more than when you are just starting out with children and have a big  mortgage. We should look out for the average guy at a time when they  are most desperate.

Some people would say my second pick would be to reduce the marginal  tax rate on the most technical manufactured goods because we want those  goods to be made here in America, and it would be great to have those  manufactured in America.

Some people, however, think the most important thing is to encourage  States to increase their taxes and have higher property taxes from the  local units of government and higher income taxes for the State  government. They want to increase the exemption for those to encourage  State governments and local governments to spend more money.

No, we should be helping out the young people with children just  starting out.
