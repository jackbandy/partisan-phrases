Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I spent the weekend back in Wisconsin,  and what does a weekend in Wisconsin in June mean? It means National  Dairy Month.

I was at breakfast on the farm in Manitowoc County. I will tell you  that June has been National Dairy Month since 1937. When I think of  June, I think of cream cheese. I think of cottage cheese. I think of  yogurt. I think of raw milk. I think of pasteurized milk. I think of  Colby cheese, cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese, and provolone cheese.

I think of the fact that, whenever you tour your factories in  Wisconsin, they say they don't have workers like they used to have  workers because they used to have workers who were raised on a dairy  farm, and there is nobody who knows the value of hard work more than  somebody on a dairy farm.

I will tell you that, more recently, other groups have weighed in  since 1937 and said June is their month. It is not their month. June is  the dairy industry's month, and I hope everybody spends next weekend  going home to buy themselves a brick of cheese.
