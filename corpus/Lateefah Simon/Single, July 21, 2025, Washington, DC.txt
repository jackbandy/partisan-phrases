Single, Unique Zip Codes for Certain Communities


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693901/single-unique-zip-codes-for-certain-communities


Ms. SIMON. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3095 would require the United States  Postal Service to designate unique ZIP Codes for a number of  communities across the country.

This bill aims to address specific community concerns about disrupted  mail delivery and undeliverable mail. While I commend Representative  Boebert for her tireless work on this issue, I am unable to support  this legislation at this time.

After numerous conversations between the chair and former ranking  member, the late Mr. Connolly, the committee agreed on a bipartisan  basis that ZIP Code designation bills would only be considered if they  met the following criteria: One, the designated locality must submit a  letter from local leadership stating the reasons for the ZIP Code  change; two, the community must also attest that they had petitioned  the Postal Service for the unique ZIP Code designation and was  unsuccessful; and, lastly, number three, that the legislation must be  cosponsored by all of the impacted Members.

Unfortunately, the bill has not satisfied the committee's requirement  for consideration. In fact, only one-quarter of the 68 designated  communities meet the Committee's requirements, and we have heard from  at least one affected Member who is, unfortunately, opposed.

Therefore, until the majority follows the procedures set forth by  this ZIP Code designation bill, the ranking member will oppose the bill  today in its current form.

Ms. SIMON. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Sykes) for such time as she may consume.

Ms. SIMON. Madam Speaker, the ranking member opposes this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.

Ms. SIMON. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
