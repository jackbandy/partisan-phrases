Ms. SIMON. Mr Speaker, I will vote for H.J. Res. 25, a joint  resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of  title  5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Internal Revenue  Service relating to ``Gross Proceeds Reporting by Brokers that  Regularly Provide Services Effectuating Digital Asset Sales.''

My constituents in the East Bay are among the many adopters of  digital assets and cryptocurrencies. And while I have consistently  opposed any Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolutions advanced  by the House Majority--and am concerned about the loss in critical tax  revenue as a result of this CRA--I believe the digital asset space  offers new pathways for economic opportunity, especially for  historically marginalized communities; and I strongly believe we must  craft an inclusive regulatory framework that protects consumers, holds  bad actors accountable, and supports financial inclusion for those who  utilize these services.

I welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues to thoughtfully  legislate oversight of and implement necessary guardrails around  digital assets so that we protect consumers--especially Black and Brown  entrepreneurs, small investors, and working people--and promote  innovation.
