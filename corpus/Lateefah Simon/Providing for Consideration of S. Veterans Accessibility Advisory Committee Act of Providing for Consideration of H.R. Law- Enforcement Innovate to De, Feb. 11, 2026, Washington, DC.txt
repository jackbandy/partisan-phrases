Ms. SIMON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, this bill doesn't secure elections. It shrinks the  electorate. I find it so interesting that in real time we are having  this conversation. When we talk about Black voters, we are going to  talk about Black voters.

This bill was written so poorly it doesn't even take into  consideration women of all races who changed their names when they got  married. It is ridiculous.

It has been a Federal crime, we know, for noncitizens to vote since  1996. Georgia audited 8.2 million voter registrations and found 20  noncitizens, Mr. Speaker, 20. That is the emergency. That is the  emergency that justifies blocking 21 million American citizens who  don't have the papers to fill what this bill demands. We all know the  history.

Darnella Cavaness, my grandmother from Malvern, Arkansas, had to face  the poll tax. After Reconstruction, nobody wrote the word ``race'' into  a single suppression statute. They wrote poll taxes. They wrote  literacy tests, good character clauses. It was all race neutral on  paper but devastating in practice.

The SAVE America Act sits in that tradition. I will say it again. The  SAVE America Act sits in that tradition.

I have a 14-year-old daughter. I won't stand here and make voting  harder for her when she decides to register to vote.

Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't get  to shrink the franchise. I urge a strong ``no'' from all of our  colleagues who believe in a democracy that we were all promised.
