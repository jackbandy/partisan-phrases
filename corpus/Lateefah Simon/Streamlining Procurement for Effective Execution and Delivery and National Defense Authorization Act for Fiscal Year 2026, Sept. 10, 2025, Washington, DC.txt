Ms. SIMON. Mr. Chair, for the folks who are watching, for the  transgender  community, you are loved and respected for your resilience and for your  breadth. Keep pushing.

Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to this amendment that would  prohibit the Department of Defense from collecting data on gender  identity.

Data is not just numbers. Data is a story and reflection of those  lived realities of real people, and this amendment is to stop data  collection. It is clear that it is an attempt to erase the existence of  transgender servicemembers at the Department of Defense.

Without data collection, the Department of Defense cannot adequately  address the challenges that lesbian, bisexual, and transgender  servicemembers may face.

Transgender employees will have a difficult time filing equal  employment opportunity complaints without accurate data. Employees will  also have inconsistent records and incorrect gender markers in  Department of Defense systems, making it harder to access health  services.
