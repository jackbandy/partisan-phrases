Dismantling Department of Education is Not Reform


Ms. SIMON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind us what this Nation  used to do to its children.

Before 1975, this country locked up 200,000 disabled children in  institutions. We shut the schoolhouse door on children who were deaf,  blind, or different in any way that we deemed inconvenient.

Then, parents, advocates, and attorneys fought, and they won. We  passed laws on this floor that said every child in this Nation belongs,  and we created the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of  Education to enforce those promises in real time and to investigate  complaints.

Earlier this year, employees in this office were fired. They were  dismissed. Now, over 25,000 families are waiting for justice on their  complaints.

The Trump administration just requested that some of these attorneys  temporarily come back to work this week to clean up the mess that the  administration caused, but students and their families have already  paid the price.

The dismantling of the Department of Education is not reform. This is  the resurrection of abandonment. Children deserve protection, not  pathology.
