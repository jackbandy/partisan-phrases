Ms. SIMON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a son of Oakland,  California, my constituent, Ryan Coogler, whose film ``Sinners'' has  earned 16 Academy Award nominations, the most of any film in Oscar  history.

Ryan Coogler was born in Oakland, California, raised in Richmond, and  educated at Saint Mary's in Berkeley.

He first came to national attention by putting a human face on the  murder of Oscar Grant. He is the youngest director to helm a billion- dollar film. Now, with ``Sinners,'' he has given the world the work of  prophetic cinema.

``Sinners'' deploys the imagery of Southern Gothic horror to excavate  the truths this Republic has long preferred to bury.

Vampirism became a metaphor in the film to uplift systems that fed on  Black life, body, and spirit since the founding of this country.

It is the full humanity that he lifts up in this movie, the humanity  of Black folks building community and clamoring and claiming joy under  apartheid conditions.

Alongside Ryan Coogler, our district celebrates Oaklanders Delroy  Lindo and Raphael Saadiq for their nominations. They are three Oakland  artists, and one extraordinary film.

Mr. Speaker, we are so very proud of Ryan Coogler.
