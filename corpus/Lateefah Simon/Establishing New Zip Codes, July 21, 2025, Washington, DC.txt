Establishing New Zip Codes


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693861/establishing-new-zip-codes


Ms. SIMON. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 672 would require the United States  Postal Service to designate unique ZIP Codes for a number of  communities across the country. This bill aims to address certain  issues related to economic development and public safety regulations  and mail delivery.

For example, Eastvale is a town in southern California that is home  to 69,000 residents. It currently shares two ZIP Codes with neighboring  jurisdictions.

Without a unique ZIP Code, Eastvale residents have reported mail  delivery issues for delivery of legal notices, code enforcement  activities, public outreach, and election mail.

Eastvale residents have also reported higher insurance rates because  of errors related to another jurisdiction, disrupting their ability to  obtain affordable wildfire insurance.

I appreciate the diligence of Congressman Diaz-Balart, the chair, and  the committee staff, and the other Members in ensuring that each town  being marked up in today's amendment version of this bill satisfies all  the committee's requirements for consideration.

Ms. SIMON. Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers. I reserve the balance of  my time.

Ms. SIMON. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
