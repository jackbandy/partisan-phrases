Supporting Gun Violence Prevention Programs

Ms. SIMON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the administration's  cuts to critical gun violence prevention programs, and I rise today in  deep solidarity with the innovators of CeaseFire, violence  interrupters, and community organizations around this country that  spend every day, hour after hour, working on the ground and in our  communities to stop gun violence.

I thank them for their work. It is so critical and needed at a time  when the Trump administration has announced cuts of $500 million to  community violence intervention organizations and funding opportunities  directly from the Department of Justice and over $1 billion in gun  violence prevention funding for schools from the Department of  Education. Make it make sense.

Now, organizations like Youth Alive in Oakland, California, will not  have the funding that they need that is so critical in this moment to  do the work of violence interruption on our streets in conjunction with  law enforcement and community members who have lost loved ones to  violence.

June is Gun Violence Prevention Month, Mr. Speaker, and we cannot  stop this work in decreasing gun violence on our streets and in our  communities.
