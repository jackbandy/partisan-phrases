Ms. SIMON. Madam Speaker, today I rise to address the House to  celebrate my constituent, W. Kamau Bell, who won ``Celebrity  Jeopardy!'' It is a pretty cool thing. Not only did he win ``Celebrity  Jeopardy!'' but as a constituent who has lived in my district in  Oakland, California, since the 1990s, he has consistently given back  philanthropically to young people and underserved communities, again  for almost 30 years.

After winning ``Celebrity Jeopardy!'' just recently, he gave a  million dollars--the full winnings--back to the community, specifically  to the school district in Oakland, California. His donation has  supported over 200 projects in Oakland schools, including Castlemont  High School.

Just recently, I visited Castlemont High School and met with these  amazing students, who are full of potential. These students are not  only the future,  they are the now. Many teachers across our school districts, in my  district and throughout the country, are going in their own pockets to  buy support services for students and their own supplies. Kamau's  philanthropic spirit will reduce that reality for our teachers.

I am so proud to call him not only my constituent but a leading voice  in the United States. I thank Kamau so much.
