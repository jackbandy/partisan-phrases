Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to salute the work of Barry  Hoffman, founder and artistic director of the Symphony of Westchester,  which began in 1984.

Barry has blended together 50 outstanding music professionals to  perform classical music works for adoring audiences. There are four  concerts held each year at Iona University in New Rochelle, each  drawing 350 attendees to experience the orchestral brilliance of the  works of Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Dvorak, and other great composers.

In addition, the symphony organization hosts an annual jazz  institute, a young artists concerto competition for students of all  ages, an apprenticeship with New Rochelle High School musicians, and so  much more.

Barry and his army of woodwinds, brass, percussion, and strings have  delighted and educated our area for over 40 years with many more years  ahead.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Barry Hoffman for his contribution to  Westchester and the Bronx, and for the quality of our lives made more  vibrant by music.
