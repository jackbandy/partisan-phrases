Fema Cuts and Hurricane Season

Mr. LATIMER. Madam Speaker, the harrowing videos and stories out of  Texas earlier this month are another reminder of how unpredictable and  dangerous weather has become. Climate change is fueling more frequent  and extreme weather events, and the Federal Government has a duty to be  ready to respond quickly.

What happened in Texas shows we need to strengthen FEMA, not weaken  it. That means making sure the agency is fully staffed and fully  funded. That means answering the phones.

Unfortunately, the administration is doing the opposite, gutting our  Nation's largest emergency management agency.

As a New Yorker, I saw the flooding in Texas and immediately thought  of hurricane season on the East Coast. It has been a few years since a  major storm hit our region. We are due. Local and State agencies are  preparing, but this year they are doing so without the help of FEMA's  predisaster mitigation grants because the administration canceled the  program.

Cutting emergency preparedness funding doesn't prevent disasters. It  just makes them harder to handle. Once again, it is Americans who will  pay the price.
