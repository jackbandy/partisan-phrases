Concerning State of Service At Social Security Administration

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great concern about the  current state of service in the Social Security Administration.

Last year, the so-called department of governmental elimination,  DOGE, diminished the agency's workforce, forcing thousands of employees  to quit or be fired. This has left inexperienced staff to handle rising  workloads and call volumes with minimal training.

The Social Security Administration has also created new roadblocks to  service in the name of efficiency and fraud prevention, requiring  seniors and people with disabilities to complete some transactions in  person or online, rather than by phone.

Yet, reduced staffing levels at field offices have made it more  difficult to schedule a timely appointment.

In my district, the Social Security Administration closed the White  Plains hearing office, forcing constituents in Westchester to travel  farther distances at a greater expense to receive in-person service.

I implore this body to hold the Social Security Administration  accountable and ensure that our constituents receive good, convenient,  quality service.

We must immediately provide more funding and reinstate positions that  were lost. We will be held accountable by the voters if we fail this  task.
