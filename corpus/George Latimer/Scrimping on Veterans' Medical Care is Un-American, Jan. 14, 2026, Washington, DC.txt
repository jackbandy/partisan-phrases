Scrimping on Veterans' Medical Care is Un-American

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, this past December, the Department of  Veterans Affairs released a proposal to cut 25,000 openings nationwide  for much-needed nurses and medical staff.

In the New York City area, this would mean a loss of approximately  380 positions. While the VA claims these are unneeded openings left  from the pandemic, its own inspector general reported last August that  94 percent of VA facilities reported severe staffing shortages for  medical officer occupations, and 79 percent of facilities reported  severe shortages for nurses.

It is baffling, but 250 years on, this Nation still struggles to  reconcile the way that it treats the men and women who fought for our  country after they have traded their swords for plowshares. The same  can be said for the caregivers who tend to their wounds, both physical  and psychological, in the years after their service.

Scrimping on veterans' medical care or diverting its availability is  un-American, and it sends the message to our citizens that this  government will not keep its part of the bargain.

I demand that this government invest in the VA system rather than  seek its demise. The brave men and women who sacrificed to defend our  country deserve better.
