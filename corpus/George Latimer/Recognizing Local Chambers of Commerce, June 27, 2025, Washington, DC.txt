Recognizing Local Chambers of Commerce


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, we often speak about how Congress can help  small businesses grow, but the true hard work is being done on Main  Streets across this Nation.

In the Sound Shore region of Westchester, businessowners are  advancing their own businesses and finding time to lead local Chambers  of Commerce, implementing programs and events that promote their  business districts. From Mistletoe Magic in Rye to the downtown farmers  market in Scarsdale, sidewalk sales in Larchmont and Mamaroneck, these  entrepreneurs are driving revenue and profits with creativity and  energy.

Let me recognize the work of these local leaders: Catherine White,  New Rochelle; Michael Murphy, Mamaroneck; Brian Jackson, Rye; Ralph  Karkout in Harrison; Cammie Morrissey and Fritz Falanka, Port Chester,  Rye Brook, Rye Town; Gina Proia and Nancy White, Larchmont; Marcy  Berman-Goldstein and Ken Giddon, Scarsdale Business Alliance; Anne Gold  and Marc Jerome, New Rochelle Business Improvement District.

Mr. Speaker, in future speeches, I will recognize leaders in the  Bronx and along the Hudson River communities of Westchester. We salute  them all.
