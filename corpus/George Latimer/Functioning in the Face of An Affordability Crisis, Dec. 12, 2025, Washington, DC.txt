Functioning in the Face of An Affordability Crisis

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because American utility  prices are going up and those currently in charge of this country are  doing nothing about it. My constituents are looking at monthly bills  that have increased by 19 percent, and that is not affordability-plus- plus-plus.

Rather than looking for bipartisan solutions to make energy more  affordable, this majority and the Trump administration continue to  fixate on putting young people back in coal mines and opening Alaska to  oil and gas drilling. There is no set correlation between more drilling  and lower consumer prices.

We must act now to fix our outdated electric grid to bring more  renewable energy sources online. This will make us less reliant on  natural gas prices that fluctuate.

This week, the majority brought bills before this House, claiming to  save Americans money on utility bills. These bills did nothing to  update our electric grid, interconnect clean energy projects, or combat  the Trump administration's attacks on clean energy permitting.

Mr. Speaker, while we waste our time on this legislation, I continue  to hear from constituents worried about being able to afford their next  utility bill. This is not how Congress should function in the face of  an affordability crisis, and this crisis is real.
