Calling for Quick Action

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to bring attention to the  Senate's despicable decision last week to sneak in a self-serving  provision into the bill that was used to reopen the government.

While 42 million Americans on SNAP were denied their benefits, Senate  leadership added a payout provision to eight Senate Republicans whose  phone records were subpoenaed in the January 6 Capitol riot  investigation by the Department of Justice.

While American air traffic controllers worked without pay, Senators  gave themselves the ability to sue for at least $500,000 if their  electronic records were seized.

American taxpayers should not be footing the bill for this Republican  windfall provision. I am proud of my House colleagues for acting  quickly to address this dishonest and embarrassing display.

I will be voting to repeal this provision when it comes in before the  House this week because these eight Senators should not be putting  themselves ahead of the American people.

I call on the Senate to take up this legislation as soon as it is  received from the House and to right this wrong immediately.
