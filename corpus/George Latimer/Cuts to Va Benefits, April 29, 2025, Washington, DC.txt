Cuts to Va Benefits


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I recently visited the Bronx VA Medical  Center in the Bronx, New York. This center serves many in my district,  and I am grateful for the quality care they provide and for the  groundbreaking research happening at this facility.

When a young person signs up to join the military, Americans make  them a promise that we will take care of them for the rest of their  lives because they have put on the uniform of this country and risked  their lives for all of us.

That is why it is perplexing and unconscionable that this  administration has proposed devastating cuts to VA healthcare and  benefits, eliminating 80,000 staff who provide healthcare and benefits  to veterans who have earned them.

More than a quarter of VA staff are veterans themselves. Cuts to the  programs that provide home loan assistance to veterans, even cutting  staff of the suicide crisis line that saves lives--for what? This  message does not say: Thank you for your service. This is a slap in the  face for those who have served.

My Democratic colleagues do not support these cuts, and this is an  ideal moment for bipartisanship, where our Republican colleagues can  join us in pushing back.
