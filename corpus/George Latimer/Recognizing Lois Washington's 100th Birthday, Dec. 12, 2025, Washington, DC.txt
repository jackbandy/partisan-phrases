Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Lois  Washington as she celebrates her 100th birthday. It is my pleasure to  join her family and friends in honoring the remarkable life she has  led.

Born on December 12, 1925, at Massachusetts General Hospital in  Boston, Ms. Washington moved with her family to New York City at the  age of five and she never looked back. Since then, she has proudly  called our great city home. She grew up here, married here, started her  family here, and has lived an extraordinary life in the greatest city  in the world. Lois also worked for the New York Telephone company and  retired after 25 years of hard work and service.

As a resident of Co-op City, she is an active member of her community  and a longtime member of the Co-op City Methodist Church. Although she  is retired, that has not slowed her down, she watches the news, keeps  up with current events, calls family and friends each day, and  sometimes doesn't go to sleep until midnight, almost reverting back to  her teenage self. She loves her shows and loves her family and the  Bronx more. After many incredible years, Lois's contagious positivity  and kindness is truly deserving of this body's recognition.

Mr. Speaker, once again, please join me in wishing Lois Washington  another year of good health and happiness as she celebrates the  milestone of her 100th Birthday.
