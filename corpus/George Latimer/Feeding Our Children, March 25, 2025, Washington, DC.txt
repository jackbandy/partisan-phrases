Feeding Our Children

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, at a time when food prices are rising and  it is harder for families to make ends meet, we should not be cutting  food assistance programs, but that is exactly what is happening.  Earlier this month the administration announced a billion-dollar cut to  local purchasing for schools and food banks.

Local farms who rely on these programs for consistent purchases of  their food no longer have an important market, and it means that  locally grown, more nutritious food is no longer available for food  banks and schools.

Just yesterday, USDA announced that it was ending part of the Farm to  School Program. This program for years incentivized local food  procurement for school meals. Dozens of schools in Westchester and the  Bronx rely on these programs as a way to provide healthy food to  students. Similarly, Feeding Westchester and City Harvest do yeoman's  work to provide food for families and kids in need at the best value.  If fresh food is no longer available, our community will suffer.

These cuts must be reversed and quickly. Time is of the essence when  it comes to our children having enough to eat.
