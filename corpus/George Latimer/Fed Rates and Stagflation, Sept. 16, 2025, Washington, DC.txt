Fed Rates and Stagflation

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Reserve Board meets this week  to consider easing interest rates, a move that the President has been  urging for months.

Inflation remains stubborn. Consumer prices rose by 2.9 percent in  August compared to last year. Job growth is slowing. Unemployment has  climbed to 4.3 percent, the highest in 4 years. We are now veering  toward stagflation: rising prices and a cooling job market.

No matter what you call it, the reality is clear: American families  and small businesses are struggling. The President came into office  promising to lower costs and make life more affordable. Instead, he has  delivered the opposite with a massive tax and spend bill and a reckless  tariff agenda that is driving prices even higher and creating  apprehension for employers.

Lower interest rates might offer some short-term relief. Yet, for  real, lasting stability, you need a change in course and a change in  policies coming from the top.
