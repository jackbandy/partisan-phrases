America's Standing in the World


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688170/americas-standing-in-the-world


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, America once liberated France from the Nazi  regime, freed Kuwait from the grip of Saddam Hussein, and defended  South Korea against North Korean aggression. However, this apparently  is a new MAGA America, siding with the evil aggressor and blaming the  victim.

Ronald Reagan called Russia the evil empire, but Donald Trump knows  better. George H.W. Bush called Russia part of the axis of evil, but  Donald Trump knows better. Our U.S. vote in the U.N. supports the  aggressor, Russia; not the victim, an independent Ukraine.

Under President Trump, we are losing our moral standing in world  affairs. Our enemies are watching. They are making alliances while we  toss aside allies like Canada and Europe to satisfy the inconceivable  love this President has for Vladimir Putin.

Putin poisons his critics. That is who our new best friend is.

I am new to this Chamber, but hear me, Mr. Speaker: Consequences will  be tragic for those who love freedom worldwide if we don't return to  true American foundational principles: freedom and democracy.
