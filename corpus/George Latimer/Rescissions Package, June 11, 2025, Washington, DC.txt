Rescissions Package

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, as prices rise and our economy stalls, this  week, House Republicans are pushing a cruel and a senseless plan to  cancel $9.8 billion in funding that Congress already passed into law.  The rescissions package enacts the extreme and out-of-touch agenda that  includes DOGE slashing support, reducing support for AIDS prevention,  reproductive health, and even public broadcasting.

As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am particularly  disturbed by the $8.3 billion in cuts to foreign assistance targeting  programs that help the most vulnerable people across the world. These  cuts include a $9 million cut to the President's Emergency Plan for  AIDS Relief, which has saved over 26 million lives. Additionally, cuts  at home include gutting $1.1 billion from PBS and NPR, silencing  trusted voices and educational content like Sesame Street.

These cuts are being celebrated as savings at the same time that the  majority is pushing their big, ugly bill that will add at least $3  trillion to our national debt.

It is clear this isn't about savings. It is about pushing a harmful  ideology on the U.S. and the rest of the world. I will not support it.
