Unfreeze Funds for Gateway Tunnel

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, during the government shutdown last fall,  OMB Director Russell Vought announced that the Trump administration  would be pausing billions of dollars in funding for the Hudson River  Gateway Tunnel project.

This critical project creates a much-needed passenger rail tunnel  under the Hudson River, supplementing existing tunnels that were built  over 100 years ago, and will deliver thousands of commuters in and out  of New York every day in the busiest Amtrak corridor in the United  States.

For several months, the White House has held these funds captive over  misleading claims that the project's contracting policies violate  administration policies on diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Last week, the Gateway Development Commission announced that  construction will have to cease if President Trump does not swiftly  restore the project's funding. If construction is delayed, thousands of  union construction workers will lose their jobs, and timely completion  of this project will be in jeopardy.

Mr. Speaker, I implore the President to end this vindictive quest to  hurt people in the Northeast and immediately unfreeze project funds to  allow for the construction to resume.
