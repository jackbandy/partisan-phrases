Congress Must Provide Checks and Balances

Mr. LATIMER. Madam Speaker, allow me to paint a picture of a country:  threats to the media to control the flow of information to the  citizenry; cutting funds to childhood education, higher education, and  the arts to limit free and independent thought; telling families it is  time to tighten their wallets for the greater good; a focus on  investing in prisons; members of the judiciary jailed for following the  law; military parades that celebrate the leader.

When Americans hear this, we associate them with the likes of  Lukashenko of Belarus or Kim Jong-Un of North Korea, but these are all  examples of our country, the United States of America, in the last 3  months and what is planned.

Fear is the ultimate goal of leaders like this. We need to stand up  for freedom and democracy or we may lose them forever. This Congress  must stop being a rubberstamp for this President and perform its  constitutional duty as a check and a balance.
