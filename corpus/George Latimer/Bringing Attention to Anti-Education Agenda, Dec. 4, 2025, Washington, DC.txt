Bringing Attention to Anti-Education Agenda


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697491/bringing-attention-to-anti-education-agenda


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  anti-education agenda of the Trump administration.

The Department of Education's RISE Committee is offering a proposal  to downgrade the professional status of various careers that they  think, after many years, don't deserve academic stature and access to  vital funding. These include nursing, physical therapy, audiology,  architecture, and social work.

This assessment comes from the leader of the Department of Education,  who has no advanced degree in education but does know a lot about pro  wrestling.

I was the chief executive officer of a government for over 1 million  people, with a budget of $2.5 billion and 4,200 employees. These  Secretaries and committees can theorize all they want. I needed  professional, well-trained, and certified nurses, social workers, and  the like to deliver real-world services to real people in the day-to- day management of a large county.

Let's stop the ideological foolishness. Place this proposal to  downgrade careers where it belongs: in the department of garbage and  sanitation. Let's get back to grownup, serious government that  understands the problems in America and addresses those problems.
