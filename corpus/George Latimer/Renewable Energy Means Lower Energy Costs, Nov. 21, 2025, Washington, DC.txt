Renewable Energy Means Lower Energy Costs

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment.  Last night, the House voted to task the oil and gas industry to report  on the state of fossil fuel refining in the United States.

They would like to see how the United States Government can do more  for their industry--drill, baby, drill--the claim being that our  government needs this report to increase fossil fuel production with an  implied promise, but no guarantee, of lower energy prices.

That would be like asking for a 1905 report from the Federation of  Blacksmiths on how to better change the horseshoes on a horse instead  of focusing on the rising future of transportation: the automobile.

So I wonder: When will Congress use its time to call for a report on  the state of the future for renewable energy?

When will we be asking clean energy producers how the government can  make it easier to bring renewables online and reduce greenhouse gases?

We know renewable energy can lower energy costs.

I will be waiting for Godot if I expect this majority to take that  up. We can look to the future, or we can continue to reject the future  and pander to the past.
