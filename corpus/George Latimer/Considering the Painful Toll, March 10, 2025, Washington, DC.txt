Considering the Painful Toll

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, this weekend in Yonkers, I met four  constituents who have recently been fired from Federal service. Their  human stories force us to consider the painful toll created by the cut- and-destroy method of management by this administration.

Departments are being slashed and eliminated and so are the lives of  professionals who have devoted their entire careers to public service.  Without  any objective assessment, years of work are being trashed with bogus  claims of fraud and corruption. The ax falls regardless of skill,  merit, or accomplishment. It falls without regard to the human element  of people, not merely statistics, who serve the public. It is heartless  and cruel.

Most corporations, even when downsizing, take into account the most  productive employees and offices. They are strategic to achieve  savings.

Every new administration is entitled to look at our Federal agencies  and see what efficiencies can be achieved. This execute-first style of  management is not that. It creates a stain on America, and it does  nothing to make government more efficient. We should be ashamed.
