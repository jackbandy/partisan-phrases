Fighting for Fairness and Opportunity for Every American


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, House Republicans just passed their budget  plan. Like many House Democrats, I am clear-eyed about this plan and  how it will affect families in Westchester and the Bronx. This budget  is a direct attack on the working and middle class, all while handing  more than $4.5 trillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest in our society.

The cuts needed for these tax breaks will mean over 196,000 residents  in my district are at risk of losing Medicaid coverage. This includes  73,000 children and 27,000 seniors. This budget plan also threatens  74,000 people who count on SNAP to put food on the table.

Republicans have promised to lower costs for everyday Americans, but  this budget won't do that at all. Instead, it will make life harder and  more expensive for constituents and Americans across the country.

As this process moves forward, I will join with Americans to fight  for fairness and opportunity for every American.
