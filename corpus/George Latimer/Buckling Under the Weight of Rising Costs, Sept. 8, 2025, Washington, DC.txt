Buckling Under the Weight of Rising Costs

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, today, a CBS News poll came out. It showed  65 percent of Americans think that the President's policies are making  us pay more for goods, such as groceries.

I have learned in my career that results mean more than rhetoric. I  invite my colleagues to join me in tracking what is actually happening  in the country, not the words that are being said.

I ask my colleagues to make a list this week when they shop and jot  down the prices they pay. List the date.

Specifically note the price of a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk, a  gallon of orange juice, a box of cereal, a dozen eggs, and a package of  butter. Stop in any store. Note the price of a package of gym socks and  a tube of toothpaste. When my colleagues gas up their cars, note the  price of regular gasoline and their most recent electric bill. Date it  today, this day in September. Keep the sheet handy.

In January, I want my colleagues to do that list again. We won't need  a cable news station, a podcast, or a talk show to tell us what is  going on. We will see it for ourselves.
