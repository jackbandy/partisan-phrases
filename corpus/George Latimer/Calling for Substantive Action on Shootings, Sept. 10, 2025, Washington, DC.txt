Calling for Substantive Action on Shootings

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I have some comments that were drafted  before today's events.

Last month, in Minnesota, a gunman opened fire on Catholic  schoolchildren praying. Again, thoughts and prayers are offered, but  what do we say and what do we do when the victims were already praying?

This cannot be our only response. We need substantive action.

As Westchester County executive, we acted early to ban gun shows from  county-owned buildings. It was a small but meaningful sign that we were  serious about keeping guns out of our communities.

Now, Congress must show that same seriousness. We need universal  background checks. We need weapons of war off our streets. We need  strong red flag laws to keep guns away from abusers.

State laws are not enough. Guns can easily be trafficked across State  lines.

Thoughts and prayers didn't save children at Sandy Hook, Uvalde, or  in that Minnesota church. They won't save the next victims unless we  act. We have to keep weapons of mass death out of the hands of those  who would use them to kill innocent people.

In the last few hours, we have one more example, the murder of  Charlie Kirk. Any person, regardless of their politics, should be able  to express their ideas without violence.

Commonsense gun laws save lives, Mr. Speaker, and we must pass them  now.
