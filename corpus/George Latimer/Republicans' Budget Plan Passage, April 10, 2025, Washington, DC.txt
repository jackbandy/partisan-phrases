Republicans' Budget Plan Passage

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, House Republicans just passed their budget  plan, President Trump's big, beautiful bill, again. The first version  didn't cut enough from critical programs like Medicaid and SNAP. This  budget is a direct attack on the working and middle classes, all while  handing more than $7 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires.

Over 196,000 residents in my district are at risk of losing Medicaid  coverage, including 73,000 children and 27,000 seniors in one district.

Approximately 74,000 people who count on SNAP may not be able to put  food on the table.

People who are covered through the Affordable Care Act will see  premiums rise by an average of almost $3,000 a year.

This is what President Trump called beautiful? It is anything but.  This budget won't lower costs. These cuts, coupled with the President's  thoughtless tariff policies, will make life more expensive for our  neighbors. We are making a beeline to a MAGA recession and perhaps a  MAGA depression.

This is reverse Robin Hood. Stealing from the lower and middle  classes to benefit the wealthiest is un-American.
