Environmental Protections

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, the House may be voting on  America's worst budget ever. It includes cuts to SNAP and Medicaid  funding that will hurt those who can least afford it and provide tax  breaks for those who don't need them.

Also among these tax changes are rollbacks to critical clean energy  taxes and credits that were part of the Inflation Reduction Act. These  include phasing out clean energy production and investment tax credits  and ending longstanding home energy efficiency tax credits.

If these aren't bad enough, they also add provisions to require the  accelerated sale of public lands for oil and gas drilling and to  rescind funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund that protects  America from pollution and lowers the cost of energy bills.

Climate change is real, and it is happening now. We must act. These  were commonsense initiatives to move us away from complete reliance on  fossil fuels and move toward a clean energy future.

Mr. Speaker, try to spin it any way you want. Americans will suffer.  Our world will continue to burn.
