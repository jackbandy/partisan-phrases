In Opposition to Ice Facility in Hudson Valley

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I want to go on record standing beside my  colleague, Congressman Pat Ryan, opposing plans by ICE to establish a  facility in New York's Hudson Valley in the town of Chester, Orange  County.

The proposed site, currently an empty warehouse formerly used by Pep  Boys, is opposed by Republicans and Democrats of that area, including  Republican County Executive Steve Neuhaus, a U.S. Naval Reserve  officer, and State and local officials on both sides of the aisle.

The mission to warehouse large numbers of humans is the exact  opposite of what the President and DHS Secretary  Kristi Noem constantly proclaim: to root out the most dangerous thugs  and criminals. In fact, ICE is targeting the least violent people in  the greatest numbers, who pose minimal pushback, with the real mission  to scare all immigrants, legal or otherwise.

America has existed for 250 years without mass detention centers, but  apparently, Noem and her cohorts plan for a different America to start  the next 250 years, one where masked, unmarked agents seize people  without judicial warrant, whisk them away to remote detention centers  en route to uncertain final destinations. When such things have been  done in other countries they are called pogroms and ethnic cleansing.  This is not America.
