Black History Month

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, February is Black History Month, when we  take special note of the historic achievements of African Americans who  have helped shape today's America. Black history is American history  and for decades has been ignored by racism. Now, as we identify and  remember both those famous and some unfamiliar names from decades past,  there is today a movement to whitewash history and to minimize those  names.

However, there are efforts to ensure we never forget the role played  by our Black sisters and brothers. Bronx Councilman Kevin Riley is  sponsoring one such effort, the fifth annual Black History Month Living  Legends Luncheon honoring our neighbors on Wednesday, February 25, from  11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at The Mall at Bay Plaza food court.

It will highlight Black leaders from Co-op City, Edenwald, Wakefield,  and other parts of the north Bronx who have helped the community and  thereby made history.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Councilman Riley for making Black history come  alive for today's generations in the Bronx.
