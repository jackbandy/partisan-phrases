Worldwide Tariffs


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689696/worldwide-tariffs


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, 2 months ago on this House floor, I spoke  against the foolishness of the President's proposed tariff schemes. I  spoke knowing a bit about corporate reaction from my own business  career.

Now, the top financial minds of this country have spoken, in  consecutive days of stock market tumbling, losing values for investors,  including pension funds and 401(k) holdings. When is enough enough?

When will the Republican majority stand up and tell him for once:  ``Mr. President, you are wrong. Your policy is misguided.''

He has imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico, Japan, and the EU, our  friends. He has not imposed tariffs on Russia, arguing they are  negotiating with Ukraine, but he imposes tariffs on Ukraine.

We are now looking at the self-inflicted likelihood of a crippling  recession, which could lead to a dramatic depression, all because of  these policies that create chaos in financial markets across the globe.

Mr. Speaker, $11 trillion has been lost in the stock market since  January 20.

This is a self-made problem based on the misguided impulses of one  man. Unfortunately, we will all pay the price.
