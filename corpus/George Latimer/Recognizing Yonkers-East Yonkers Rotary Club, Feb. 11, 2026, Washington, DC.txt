https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699979/recognizing-yonkers-east-yonkers-rotary-club


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I recognize the community service provided  by the men and women of the Yonkers-East Yonkers Rotary Club. Every  day, they live out their voluntary efforts of the Rotary Four-Plus-One  Test, ensuring truth, fairness, good will, benefit, and fun in their  activities under the banner of service above self.

Recently, the club raised needed funds for their community service  projects, completing a 25-hour-plus marathon filibuster, assisting  families in need.

The club is led by President Alan Gray, President-elect Anne Murphy,  Vice President Jeffrey Landsman, Immediate Past President George John,  and other key officers: Greg Arcaro, Christian Fassetta, Philippe  Charles, Matt Koppe, Alix Schnee, and many more.

From the floor of the House of Representatives, we salute the Rotary  Club of Yonkers-East Yonkers, and I wish them continued success in all  of their good works.
