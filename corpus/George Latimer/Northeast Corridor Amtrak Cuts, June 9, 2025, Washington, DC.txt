Northeast Corridor Amtrak Cuts

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, before I hopped on the Northeast Regional  train to D.C. this morning, I joined Westchester County Executive Ken  Jenkins to bring attention to the Trump administration's proposed 25  percent cut in funding the Amtrak Northeast Corridor service. This is a  bad business decision that speaks more to politics than any objective  analysis of what will grow the economy and jobs.

In the congested corridor between Boston and D.C., where major  businesses are headquartered and where we generate major revenue for  this Nation, we don't need more cars on the road and more planes  circling our airports.

We can attract more Amtrak riders with modernization and upgrades,  but this administration shows every day that if you don't support them  and their policies, you don't count. They will remove Federal services  from key cities, take away longtime tax deductions, impose their values  and policies, and now curtail transportation options.

Those of us who represent northeast and mid-Atlantic States get the  message loud and clear: We don't count.

Amtrak represents growth and expansion for America. When we treat it  as such, we will see more of these benefits in other corridors.
