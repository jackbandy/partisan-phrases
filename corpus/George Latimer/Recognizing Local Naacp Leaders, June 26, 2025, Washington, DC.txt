Recognizing Local Naacp Leaders


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693011/recognizing-local-naacp-leaders


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, the vibrant African-American community in  the Bronx and Westchester County have had a tireless advocate on their  side for decades, the NAACP, fighting for reform and social progress,  the rights of residents who want a fair shot in life and a better today  and tomorrow for their children.

We are all familiar with the effective advocacy of the NAACP,  including the lifetime achievement of Dr. Hazel Dukes, who recently  passed away, but there are local heroes, too, who do exceptional work  in our hometown neighborhoods.

Let me recognize some of these key branch leaders:

In Co-Op City, Leslie Peterson and Brenda Brown;

In New Rochelle, Aisha Cook and Jareca Lee;

In Yonkers, Kisha Skipper and Karen Edmonson;

In Williamsbridge, Laura Rhodan and Shirley Fearon;

In Mt. Vernon, Kathie Brewington and A.J. Woodson;

In White Plains-Greenburgh, Janice Griffiths;

In Port Chester-Rye, James Henderson III.

I also recognize other leaders such as Minister Mark McLean, Reverend  Frank Coleman, and Reverend Margaret Fountain-Coleman.

Their hard work and principled advocacy for equal rights, economic  justice, and education warrants recognition on the floor of the House  of Representatives.
