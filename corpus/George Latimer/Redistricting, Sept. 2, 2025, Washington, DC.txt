Redistricting

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, President Trump has called on several  Republican Governors to redistrict congressional districts no matter  what the cost to fairness, voter inclusion, or proper geographic  representation.

If his big, beautiful, ugly bill and its related policies were so  popular, then he wouldn't need to do this. Cutting Medicaid for rural  hospitals and food programs for the needy isn't so popular after all.  His irrational tariff policies are backfiring. If his backtracking on  environmental progress, threats to Social Security and VA benefits  weren't creating a grassroots pushback, then this wouldn't be  necessary. The unpopularity of his policies should lose him the  tightfisted control of this House.

Mr. Speaker, we cannot box following the Marquess of Queensberry  rules of fair and impartial districting while the World Wrestling  Federation rules allow you to hit your opponent over the head with a  chair.

This is a desperate power grab by a President whose agenda has failed  the American people. We cannot let gerrymandering silence voters.  Democracy demands fairness, and we must fight for it.
