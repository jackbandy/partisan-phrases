Calvary Baptist Church


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize an important faith  institution in the city of White Plains celebrating its 90th year of  worship and service: Calvary Baptist Church.

The leadership and congregants have been a bedrock for worship and  values since its founding in the 1930s.

Its involvement in the community has been impactful and significant.  The pastor for the last 13 years, Reverend Erwin Lee Trollinger, has  been a true leader for the people of faith both inside and outside the  church family.

Calvary Baptist sponsors weekly worship services, Bible study, Sunday  school, and external outreach to assist the needy of the community.  Pastor Trollinger and the team of ministers work tirelessly to bring a  message of love and service to all. He is the latest in a long line of  dynamic Calvary pastors who played a role in social justice efforts in  the city of White Plains and in Westchester County.

Ninety years young and still growing in membership and in love, we  salute Calvary Baptist Church for its important role in the life of our  community.
