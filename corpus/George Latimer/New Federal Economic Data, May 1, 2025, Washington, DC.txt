Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, new Federal economic data came out  yesterday, and it showed that in the last 3 months, the U.S. economy  shrank by 0.3 percent. This is a sharp reversal from the 2.4 percent  growth the economy experienced in the last quarter of 2024. This now is  the worst economy that a President has had in their first 100 days  since President Nixon.

Despite promises candidate Trump made that he would lower costs on  day one, prices remain high, and, in fact, it is expected that prices  could rise by 6.5 percent by year's end. Trump policies are why prices  remain high, even though he has tried to pin this on former President  Biden.

The red light, green light tariff policies have caused uncertainty in  all sectors of our economy as well as internationally. Wall Street and  Main Street alike have been sending signals for weeks that they do not  like or trust those economic plans. The stock market has dropped almost  9 percent and lost $4.5 trillion in wealth. This is hurting everyday  Americans, including people in Westchester and the Bronx.

President Trump is the President now. It is his economy to own and  fix.
