Social Security Cuts

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, Elon Musk's so-called department of  government elimination is closing the Social Security hearing office in  White Plains in May, just like that.

Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins offered the Federal  Government county space that would be more cost-effective. The offer  was turned down because this isn't about saving the government money.  This is about thoughtlessly cutting critical services in the name of  ideology.

This weekend, Commerce Secretary Lutnick said his 94-year-old mother- in-law wouldn't miss her Social Security check if it didn't show up.  Mr. Lutnick is a billionaire who can easily provide for her, while most  seniors rely on their monthly payments.

This weekend, more than 250 people in my district voiced their  concerns at a rally to save Social Security. I will take their words  over a billionaire's mother-in-law.

More than 10,000 of my fellow boomers become eligible every day for  Social Security. This is not the time to be closing offices, cutting  staff, and ending phone service.

There are ways to make Social Security more efficient. This ain't one  of them. Scaring seniors and threatening to end their economic  lifelines isn't about efficiency. It is a mockery of efficiency.

Remember, we told you so.
