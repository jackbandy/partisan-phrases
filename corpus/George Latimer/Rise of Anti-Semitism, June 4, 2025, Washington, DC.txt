Rise of Anti-Semitism

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, on May 21, Sarah and Yaron were leaving an  event at the Capital Jewish Museum. They worked at the Israeli Embassy  and were planning their engagement, but their future together was cut  short when a man yelling, ``Free Palestine,'' murdered them.

This past weekend, 12 people who gathered weekly to bring attention  to the hostages held captive by Hamas were firebombed by an anti- Semitic terrorist in Boulder, Colorado. Committing violent acts and  murder against Americans living their everyday lives is not justifiable  protest.

These two unconscionable tragedies in just the past 2 weeks are a  product of a terrifying rise in anti-Semitism in our country. Sadly,  this does not come as a surprise to the American Jewish community, who  regularly face hatred and threats.

According to AJC, roughly 7 in 10 Jewish adults have experienced  anti-Semitism online, and 77 percent feel less safe in America over the  past 18 months.

I will be clear that I do not stand for normalizing hate and anti- Semitism. I stand with the Jewish community in my district and around  the country against these increasingly brazen attacks.
