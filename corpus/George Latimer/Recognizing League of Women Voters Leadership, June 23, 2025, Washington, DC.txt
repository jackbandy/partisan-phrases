Recognizing League of Women Voters Leadership


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, Westchester County is fortunate to have an  active citizens group, the League of Women Voters, who are committed  volunteers that advance voter education, discussion of key local,  State, and national issues, holding seminars and programs on timely  topics, and moderating public candidate debates in a nonpartisan  manner.

In my home county, we have a number of local leagues, and their  leadership is indispensable to ensuring good civic participation at  every level of government.

Let me recognize: New Rochelle, Joan Alexander; Larchmont-Mamaroneck,  Louise Perez and Beth Radow; Scarsdale, Beth Cukier; Rivertowns, Susan  Maggiotto; White Plains, Alan Cass; Rye-Rye Brook-Port Chester, Liz  Rotfeld and Roz Carvin; and the Countywide League of Women Voters of  Westchester for the past 5 years under the leadership of Kathy Meany.

In upholding our Nation's values, we salute their voluntary service  and recognize them today on the floor of the House of Representatives.
