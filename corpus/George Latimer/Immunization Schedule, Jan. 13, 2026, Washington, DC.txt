Immunization Schedule

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn Secretary Kennedy's  recent assault on children's health.

Last week, against universally recommended guidelines, the Department  of Health and Human Services slashed the childhood immunization  schedule from 17 vaccines to 11. Among those removed are vaccines to  protect against RSV, COVID-19, and hepatitis B.

Americans deserve accurate information that is based on established  science to make decisions about our children's health. I am perplexed  by this latest ambush on the lives and future of our children. What is  the crisis  that requires us to challenge settled science?

The universally recommended vaccine schedule that families have  relied on and trusted for years to protect their children has saved  countless lives. I shudder to think about the children who could die  from preventable diseases at the hands of this administration's so- called guidance. We are simply pandering to skeptics who want to impose  ideology in place of intelligent research.

Since taking office, this administration has made every effort to  dismantle public health. These unacceptable and baseless challenges  only deepen the growing cracks in our health system.
