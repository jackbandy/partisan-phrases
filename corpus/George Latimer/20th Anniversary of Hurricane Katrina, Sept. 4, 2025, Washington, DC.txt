20th Anniversary of Hurricane Katrina

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, 20 years ago Hurricane Katrina devastated  New Orleans. The images of families stranded, neighborhoods submerged,  and a city brought to its knees are seared into our national memory.  That tragedy exposed serious failures in our disaster response, and we  promised never to let it happen again.

This administration has broken that promise. They have hollowed out  our national emergency response systems and are floating the idea of  eliminating FEMA altogether. That is not leadership. That is  negligence.

Disasters don't care about ideology. In the last year, we have seen  natural disasters in California, Texas, North Carolina, and Florida.  Whether it is a natural disaster or pandemic, Americans expect a  Federal Government that shows up and is ready to respond. Costs and  response capacity are too much for any one State to bear on their own.

Americans deserve competence and compassion, not political games and  threats to withhold funds when lives are on the table.

We must remember the lessons of Katrina. Disaster will strike whether  we are ready or not. It is the Federal Government's responsibility to  be ready.
