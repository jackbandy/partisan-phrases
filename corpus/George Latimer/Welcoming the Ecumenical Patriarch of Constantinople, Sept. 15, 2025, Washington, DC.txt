Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, it is a profound honor to recognize His  All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, known throughout the  world as the ``Bridge Builder'' and the ``Patriarch of Peace.'' As the  spiritual leader of over 250 million Orthodox Christians, he has  dedicated his life to the pursuit of reconciliation, understanding, and  human dignity. Despite enduring decades of persecution and restrictions  upon his Patriarchate in Istanbul, he has remained steadfast in his  mission, bearing witness not only to the strength of faith but also to  the power of compassion.

His All-Holiness Bartholomew, born Demetrios Arhondonis in 1940 on  the island of Imvros was elected in October 1991 as the 270th  Archbishop of the 2000-year-old Church founded by the Apostle Andrew.  He holds the historic title of Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome  and Ecumenical Patriarch, a position that dates back to the sixth  century. A citizen of Turkey, he studied in Imvros, Istanbul, Rome,  Switzerland, Munich, and Athens, where he earned his doctorate in Canon  Law and helped found the Society of Canon Law of the Oriental Churches.  Ordained in 1961 and 1969, he served as Assistant Dean of Halki,  Secretary to Patriarch Demetrios, Metropolitan of Philadelphia, and  later Metropolitan of Chalcedon before his election as Ecumenical  Patriarch.

Patriarch Bartholomew's leadership extends far beyond the walls of  the Church. He has become a global voice for peace, interfaith  communication, and environmental stewardship, reminding the world that  creation itself is a sacred trust. Through initiatives such as  establishing a worldwide day of prayer for the environment and  convening international gatherings of scientists, leaders, and  theologians, he has exemplified how faith can serve the common good.  His tireless journeys across continents and his engagements with  parliaments, heads of state, and religious leaders have earned him  honors from the United Nations, the European Union, and this very  Congress, which bestowed upon him the Congressional Gold Medal beneath  this Capitol dome.

Mr. Speaker, in honoring Patriarch Bartholomew, we recognize a man  whose life's work has been the building of bridges, between East and  West, faith and justice. His  enduring witness to peace and extraordinary work for humanity is an  inspiration to us all. May his example continue to inspire us to build  bridges of understanding, to care for all of God's creation, and  continuously seek justice and reconciliation.
