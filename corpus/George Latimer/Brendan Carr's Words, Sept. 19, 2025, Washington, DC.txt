Brendan Carr's Words


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I quote: ``Political satire is one of the  oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in  power while using humor to draw more people into the discussion. That's  why people in influential positions have always targeted it for  censorship.''

These are not my words. These are the words of Brendan Carr, the  current FCC Chairman.

This week, Chairman Carr called for Jimmy Kimmel's show to be  canceled for using that very same satire--Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen  Colbert, suppression of free speech.

I don't see this administration saying anything about limiting the  free speech on FOX, OAN, or Newsmax. Free speech is okay if you agree  with it, but if it disagrees with you, then out it goes.

That is the way it is in Putin's Russia and in Kim Jong-un's North  Korea. That is the way it is in China, Hungary, and Iran. That is not  America.

America believes in something good and greater: free speech, free  thought, free practice of religion.

When we silence American voices, we slide every day toward the very  regimes that we say we are fighting.
