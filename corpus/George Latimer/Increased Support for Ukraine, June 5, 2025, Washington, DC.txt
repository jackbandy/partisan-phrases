Increased Support for Ukraine


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks the 81st anniversary of D- day, a unique mission that took months of planning and turned the tide  of World War II.

America's military, working with Canada and our European Allies, made  the difference that day by beginning the liberation of France.

Now, 81 years later, another European country is fighting off an  invasion by an aggressor. The Ukrainians have fought valiantly, with  thousands giving their lives to protect freedom and democracy.

They have proven to be strong fighters, creative in the art of war.  The assault over the weekend on Russia's bombing fleet is a modern  marvel. They are capable of defeating Russian aggression and remaining  a free nation only if they have sufficient support from their allies.

It is all the more concerning that today President Trump said it may  be better to let Ukraine and Russia fight for a while before pulling  them apart like children in a schoolyard. Ukraine and its people don't  have that time. This war must end.

With D-day on our mind, Congress must commit more assistance to  Ukraine and defend democracy before it is too late.
