Mr. Speaker,  as a    ========================= END NOTE =========================     parent and a grandparent and as a former county executive who led the   COVID response in one of the first epicenters of that outbreak, I am   concerned by recent developments at the CDC and the future of public

health.Decades of sound science and public health progress are being  cast aside in favor of conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.

Last month, the CDC Director was dismissed after just weeks on the  job. This week, the agency's vaccine advisory committee is considering  changes that could weaken or even eliminate requirements for lifesaving  childhood vaccines.

It is easy to forget the fear and devastation of measles and polio,  not because these diseases are harmless but because vaccines have kept  them at bay.

Today, parents worry about vaccine side effects largely because they  have never seen the horrors these vaccines  prevent. That doesn't make vaccines any less necessary.

The science is clear. Vaccines are safe, effective, and essential.  Every major medical association agrees, yet fringe ideologies are  gaining influence inside the very agencies charged with protecting our  health.

Mr. Speaker, I fear our children and grandchildren will bear the cost  of these reckless decisions.
