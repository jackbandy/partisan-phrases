Meanwhile

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, the news is louder than a toddler with a  kazoo at a Metallic concert. While the headlines scream, the internet  screams even louder with a monologue known as meanwhile.

Meanwhile, Paramount settles a lawsuit with President Trump over a  dispute that could have been easily dismissed, which is defended as  freedom of the press, or not.

Meanwhile, Paramount CBS is seeking a multimillion-dollar merger with  Skydance Media that requires the approval of the very same Trump  administration. Coincidence? Surely not.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration calls for media fairness, the  kind perhaps shown by FOX, OAN, and Newsmax. Maybe.

Meanwhile, Stephen Colbert, host of the show ``Late Night,'' number  one amongst hosts in his slot and a Trump critic, has his show canceled  by CBS, a financial decision it is said. Oh, yeah.

Meanwhile, CBS' great news leader, Edward R. Murrow, rolls over in  his grave.
