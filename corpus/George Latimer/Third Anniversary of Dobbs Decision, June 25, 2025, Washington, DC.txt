Third Anniversary of Dobbs Decision

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago this week, the Supreme Court  stripped from millions of women the right to make their own healthcare  decisions. Since overturning Roe v. Wade, women across this country  have struggled, suffered, and even died. Doctors are forced to hesitate  even in emergencies, fearing prosecution, and State legislatures have  been emboldened to threaten medical practitioners in other States.

As Westchester County executive, I signed legislation to protect  women from harassment and intimidation when seeking an abortion because  this decision is deeply personal and belongs to a woman and her doctor,  not to politicians, not to protesters, not even to the Supreme Court.

That is why I am a sponsor of the Women's Health Protection Act.  Congress must codify the right to reproductive freedom as the law of  the land. If we do not, women across the country will continue to  suffer unnecessarily in the wake of the misguided decision in Dobbs.
