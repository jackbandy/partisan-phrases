Making Americans Less Healthy

Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the Trump  administration's Environmental Protection Agency is quietly denying us  protection from forever chemicals.

While Secretary Kennedy claims he will make America healthy again,  the EPA announced it would overturn historical reporting requirements  on toxic substances known as PFAS. Exposure to small amounts has been  linked to cancer, fertility issues, and immune system failure.

This year alone, the EPA has delayed enforcement on drinking water  limits for PFAS, fired EPA scientists researching new forever  chemicals, terminated grants for PFAS studies, and approved pesticides  known to have PFAS.

Across the political spectrum, legislators have come together to  protect our children from dangerous PFAS chemicals. Now this  administration is allowing them to be used on cereal grains, peas,  beans, tomatoes, oranges, almonds, and more.

Not only is this administration making our groceries more expensive,  but they are making our groceries less healthy. We must stand together  against these actions. Our children's health depends on it.
