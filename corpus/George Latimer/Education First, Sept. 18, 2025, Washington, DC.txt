Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, the 16th District of New York is lucky to  have an Education First facility located in Tarrytown.

During the August work period, I had the opportunity to tour their  international language campus and speak with young people from over 60  countries who are in Tarrytown to learn English.

This location in our district is one of several dozen Education First  campuses around the world. They have collaborated with the U.N. to  create a joint global summer school program. In addition to physical  schools, they also have the world's largest online language school.

These programs are designed to help English language learners pick up  the language quickly for attending school or starting a new job.

It can be hard to be in a new place, learning a new language. I  applaud the courage and openness of these students in coming to the  United States and meeting students from different countries. Our world  is stronger because of cultural exchanges like this one, and it does a  heck of a lot for the local economy in Tarrytown.
