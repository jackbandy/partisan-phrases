Americans' Access to Healthcare Under Attack


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  Trump administration's plan to raise healthcare prices for seniors.

That is right. You did not mishear me. The Trump administration  announced that they will be raising Medicare part B premiums, and  deductibles will surge around 10 percent in 2026, almost double the  increase from 2025.

Next year, the annual standard Medicare part B premium will be over  $2,400. Seniors and disabled enrollees rely on Medicare part B to cover  costs for outpatient hospital care, ambulance services, preventative  screenings, medical equipment, certain prescription drugs, and more.

If that is not enough, since Medicare premiums are typically deducted  from Social Security payments, the average anticipated cost-of-living  increase for Social Security will be reduced by almost a third.

Many seniors who could have seen an increase of about $56 in their  monthly Social Security payments will be lucky to see $38 after premium  increases.

This administration continues to attack Americans' access to  healthcare and undermine affordability.

This is simply a disgrace.
