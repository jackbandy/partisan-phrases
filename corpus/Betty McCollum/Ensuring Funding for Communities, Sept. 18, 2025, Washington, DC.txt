Ensuring Funding for Communities

Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, Republicans say they have a mandate.  President Trump has told his party, don't even bother working with  Democrats. Congressional Republicans wanted to go it alone when they  passed President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The American people are now finding out it is really a pretty big,  ugly mess, especially when it comes to their healthcare and their  everyday lives.

Republicans made devastating healthcare cuts to Medicaid and the  Children's Health Insurance Program. They made $990 billion worth of  cuts. We are now just 2 weeks away from a government shutdown.

Speaker Johnson is, once again, refusing to work across the aisle  with Democrats. Democrats want to prevent exploding health insurance  premiums. They have already started to show up in some people's mail.  That is because the Affordable Care Act subsidies are about to expire.  Oh, that was part of President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Mr. Speaker, I want to ensure that the funding Congress passes is  actually delivered to the people in our communities, and I don't want  it to be illegally cut or withheld by the Trump administration. We are  seeing cuts in CDC, NIH, and the Department of Education. We all know  what happened to the State Department and USAID. It was basically just  stamped out from existence.

If House Republican leadership wants to go it alone on Federal  funding to keep our government open, well, that is their prerogative.  They shouldn't expect my vote.
