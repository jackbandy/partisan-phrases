Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism

Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, the House already passed an identical  resolution to this last Congress. I voted against it then, as I will do  again today. I expressed my serious concerns with how this resolution  was written then, but nothing has changed.

Once again, the Republican majority has thrown together a poorly  written, ill-conceived resolution that is so sloppy that it condemns  socialism in all its forms, including democratically elected officials  and governments. That includes important allies and friends of the  United States that have mainstream socialist political parties like  Albania, Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Luxembourg,  Montenegro, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Portugal, Romania,  Slovakia, Spain, and Sweden.

With this resolution, House Republicans are sending a message to many  proud democracies, including multiple members of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO), that we condemn the domestic political  process within their nations. As Ranking Member of the House  Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, I know just how crucial it is  to maintain relationships with our NATO allies who have come to our  aid. This resolution is an insult to them.

Mr. Speaker, it is telling that on the first week back to regular  order after shutting down the House floor for seven weeks, House  Republicans are continuing to waste the American public's time with  political messaging stunts like this.

It should be rejected.
