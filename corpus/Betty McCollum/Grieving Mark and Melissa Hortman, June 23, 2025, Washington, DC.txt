Grieving Mark and Melissa Hortman

Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, 9 days ago, Minnesota suffered the  unbearable loss of one of our Nation's finest public servants.

The targeted assassination of Melissa and Mark Hortman casts a long  shadow of grief not only over Minnesota but our Nation.

Under her leadership, Speaker Hortman left the State of Minnesota  better than she found it. She exemplified our values of hard work,  respect, inclusion, and civil engagement.

As we mourn the loss of Melissa and Mark, I join Minnesotans to pray  for Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, as they recover.

As Minnesota's top leader in Human Services, Senator Hoffman  shepherded historic investments for the most vulnerable among us: the  elderly; those with disabilities, both seen and unseen; and those  recovering from addiction.

The grief that Minnesotans have endured in the days since this  tragedy has been agonizing. As we come together to heal, may we find  comfort in the words of Melissa and Mark's children: Hope and  resilience are the enemy of fear.
