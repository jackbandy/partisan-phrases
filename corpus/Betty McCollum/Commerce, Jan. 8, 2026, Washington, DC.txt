Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act, 2026


Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member DeLauro and  Chairman Cole for their work in bringing this bipartisan package to the  floor. I especially thank Ranking Member Pingree and Chair Simpson. I  serve on the subcommittee with them.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation that  secures funding for public safety, public infrastructure, public lands  and, yes, public health. This bill will help reassert Congress' Article  I power of the purse and provide clear funding direction to this  administration.

I want to highlight how this bill maintains funding to our trust and  treaty responsibilities to Indian Country. It continues to support  education, healthcare, public safety, and human services for our Native  American brothers and sisters.

This bill maintains Indian Health Service advanced appropriations,  which is targeted for elimination by President Trump's budget. I thank  the leaders for their work on making this part of the bill. The Tribal  leaders fought hard to establish this advanced appropriations security,  and I am glad it is included. I am so proud of our bipartisan ranking  members working hard to get this provision and this bill across the  line.

I am pleased this bill includes nearly $9 billion for the  Environmental Protection Agency, a significant increase over the House  position and twice that of what the White House had proposed for the  EPA.

This bill also fully funds the National Endowment for the Arts and  the Humanities at $207 million each. This bill, as has been pointed  out, rejects all the poison pill riders.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this appropriations  bill.
