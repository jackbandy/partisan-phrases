Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump and Republicans control the  entire government. For 42 days, Republicans shut it down. Why? It was  because they refuse to extend tax credits to help millions of Americans  afford their healthcare. If that wasn't bad enough, President Trump  even withheld food assistance during the shutdown. Hunger should never  be used as a weapon.

The CR continues the Republican healthcare crisis. The Speaker has  already said he won't hold a vote to extend the Affordable Care Act tax  credits to reduce healthcare costs for Americans.

Now my constituents are going to have to choose between heating their  homes, feeding their families, or taking their children to the doctor.  It is a terrible deal for the American people.

Americans deserve an open and transparent government that works for  them. They deserve access to affordable healthcare and nutritious food  for their families. That is what Democrats are fighting for. I wish the  President and Republicans would join us in this fight and share our  priorities.
