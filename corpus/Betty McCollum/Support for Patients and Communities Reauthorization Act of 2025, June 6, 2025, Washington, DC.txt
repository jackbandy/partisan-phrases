Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I will vote in support of H.R. 2483, the  Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and  Treatment (SUPPORT) Reauthorization Act of 2025. This bill, which was  first signed into law in 2018, aims to fight the opioid epidemic in our  country by improving access to treatment, increasing recovery  opportunities, and strengthening prevention initiatives. The opioid  epidemic has devastated communities and torn apart families across our  country, and H.R. 2483 is the latest in a long line of bipartisan  efforts to address this problem and ensure Americans get the help they  need without stigma or other barriers.

However, we must acknowledge that this legislation came to the House  Floor at a time when the Trump administration is systematically  dismantling our Nation's mental health and substance use treatment  programs. In the last several months, the administration has announced  plans to eliminate the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration (SAMHSA) as an independent division of the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), fired hundreds of SAMHSA employees,  rescinded over $1 billion in state funding to treat mental health and  substance use disorders, and proposed eliminating some of the very  programs that are authorized in the SUPPORT Act. House Republicans have  also just voted to make the largest health care cut in history in their  so-called ``Big Beautiful Bill'', taking away Medicaid from millions of  Americans.

While I will vote in favor of the SUPPORT Act, my concern is that  this Republican led Congress has authorized these programs with no one  left at the agencies to see them through.
