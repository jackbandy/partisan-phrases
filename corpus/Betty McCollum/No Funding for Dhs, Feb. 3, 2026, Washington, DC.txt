No Funding for Dhs

Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I voted today not to continue funding for  the Department of Homeland Security without real oversight and  constraints on ICE and Border Patrol.

Minnesotans are being racially profiled on a mass scale, assaulted on  their streets, and kidnapped from their homes. Peaceful demonstrators  are being threatened and detained for exercising their First Amendment  rights. Two American citizens were killed on our streets by Department  of Homeland Security agents.

This is not the America that we learned about in civics class. This  is the behavior of a dictatorship. We live in a democracy, where even  the President must follow the rule of law and the Constitution.

My vote against the funding today for DHS was to stand in solidarity  with Minnesotans to demand changes that will protect our democracy. We  are one Minnesota. We will continue to care for our neighbors and to  stand up for our rights because they are your rights, too.
