Recognizing Carroll High School


Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Carroll High  School for their accomplishments in teaching future generations of  leaders.

As President Trump has highlighted, Indiana does education right, and  Carroll High School is no exception. The U.S. News & World Report  ranked Carroll High School as the number one high school in Fort Wayne,  Indiana, and number 15 in the State.

Carroll has demonstrated their high standards through excellent  performance on State-required tests, a 95 percent graduation rate, and  exceeding expectations for college readiness.

In high school, students learn more than just math and chemistry  equations. Rather, students build their work ethic, establish critical  thinking skills, and learn what it means to be a citizen of our great  country. Teachers are endowed with educating our students, which is why  I am incredibly thankful to all the educators at Carroll High School  for carrying out this mission. Their dedication to teaching Fort  Wayne's next generation of leaders is incredible, and our community is  extremely appreciative.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Carroll High School on this  accomplishment, and I am excited to see the future achievements of  Carroll High School students.
