Disapproving the Rule Submitted By the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Relating to ``Overdraft Lending: Very Large Financial Institutions''


Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his hard work.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution disapproving  of the rule submitted by the CFPB relating to overdraft lending very  large financial institutions.

The CFPB's purpose is to implement and enforce consumer financial  protection laws and ensure that consumers have access to financial  services and products while ensuring fair, transparent, and competitive  markets.

The overdraft lending rule issued by the CFPB instead harms consumers  by setting government price caps on overdraft fees. Setting these caps  and requiring large banks to lower their overdraft fees will force  smaller and community banks to follow suit, resulting in less options  for our constituents.

Overdraft fees are provided by banks for people who are caught in a  bind. Hoosiers who need to make emergency payments should not be turned  away at the register because this rule forced their bank to stop  offering overdraft services. This government-created market established  by the CFPB's overdraft lending rule ignores competition of banks and  how they provide their services and pushes banks to restrict or exit  this service.

Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, the former CFPB Director Chopra was not  thinking about consumers when he implemented this midnight rule on his  way out the door. I am proud that House Republicans and President Trump  have the opportunity to right this egregious wrong implemented under  the Biden administration.

These shouldn't be called fees. They should be called insurance for  our constituents.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
