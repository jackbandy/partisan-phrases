Making Homes Affordable

Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, while I am happy to say that Indiana is  one of the most affordable States for homeownership in the country, I  know the dream of owning a home is still far off for many Hoosiers.

We have a serious housing shortage in this country. A key reason for  this is outdated and obstructive government regulations that prevent  and delay new construction. That is why I introduced the bipartisan  Streamlining Rural Housing Act.

This bill would require HUD and USDA to develop a joint environmental  review process for rural housing projects, cutting red tape and making  rural housing easier to build.

If we are to help more Americans achieve the dream of homeownership,  we must make it easier to build new homes. That means getting  government out of the way and allowing developers to build faster and  at a lower cost.

I look forward to continuing my work to make homes affordable for  Hoosiers and remain committed to addressing the housing shortage in  this country.
