Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, this week marks 6 months of the America  First leadership under President Trump Donald Trump.

He has had innumerable accomplishments over the first half of this  year and has kicked off a new golden age for our country. His strong  leadership has single-handedly added over half a million jobs to the  U.S. economy. Many of these jobs came back to my home State of Indiana,  like the announcement from General Motors about increasing its  production in the Fort Wayne truck plant.

He has brought gas prices to their lowest point since 2021 by  unleashing American energy independence.

Outside of the economic impacts that have saved money for everyday  Americans, President Trump has kept his commitment to protect American  children and families by halting so-called gender-affirming care for  children in this country.

As another testament to his impressive pace, President Trump has also  signed 27 bills into law, the greatest of which, the One Big Beautiful  Bill Act, delivers tax cuts to American families, solidifies funding  for America's Golden Dome, and defunded Planned Parenthood.

Over the past 6 months, President Trump has delivered on his promise  to restore America's strength and dominance, and I look forward to  continuing the fight with President Trump leading the way to ensure  America's golden age lasts for decades to come.
