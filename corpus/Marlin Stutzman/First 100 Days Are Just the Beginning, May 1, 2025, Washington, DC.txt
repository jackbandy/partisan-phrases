First 100 Days Are Just the Beginning

Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, President Trump, Indiana Governor Braun,  and House Republicans in our first 100 days have worked in unison to  make our communities safer, citizens healthier, and country wealthier.

It has started at the border. The Trump administration's swift and  strong actions have caused illegal aliens to simply give up on crossing  our borders illegally, proven by the 94 percent drop in apprehensions  since March 2024.

These efforts have only been strengthened by Governor Braun sending  the Indiana National Guard to the border and the House passage of the  SAVE Act.

Governor Braun has made Indiana healthier by signing nine health- related executive orders, one of which addresses the same harmful food  dyes and artificial ingredients that President Trump and the  administration banned just this past week. This was accomplished while  the House literally saved lives by securing medical protection for  babies who survived attempted abortions.

Finally, the three have worked in unison in making our country  wealthier by both executives implementing their own DOGE initiatives  and the House working overtime to codify those cuts.

There is so much more I could mention, but the best of all of this is  that it is just beginning.
