Less Government Red Tape


Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, the number of publicly  listed companies in this country has declined, particularly among small  and midsized businesses. A key reason for this is that traditional  public offerings have become too expensive.

Compliance costs and government red tape have made a traditional IPO  out of reach for many American businesses. That is why I have  introduced my Regulation A+ Improvement Act.

This bill will update our regulations so more small and midsized  companies can raise capital from a wider range of investors and with  less government red tape and compliance costs.

This is a commonsense step to make our public markets more  accessible, more dynamic, and more competitive. Our capital markets are  the envy of the world, but we must continue to modernize outdated  regulations that have not kept up with the times.

I am committed to ensuring businesses of all sizes--in northeast  Indiana and across the country--have the tools that they need to grow,  create jobs, and keep our economy strong.
