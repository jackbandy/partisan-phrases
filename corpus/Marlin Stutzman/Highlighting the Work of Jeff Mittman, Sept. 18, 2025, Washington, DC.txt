Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the work of Mr.  Jeff Mittman and congratulate him on his appointment by President Trump  to serve as a member of the U.S. AbilityOne Commission.

Mr. Mittman served 22 years in the U.S. Army until an IED ended his  service and caused him to lose his vision. Despite this sacrifice, Mr.  Mittman made it a mission to move forward and overcome the challenges  his life presented.

As one of many accomplishments, in 2019, Mr. Mittman became the first  legally blind president and CEO of Bosma Enterprises, the largest  employer for people who are blind in Indiana.

Beyond that, Mr. Mittman also serves as the president of the National  Association for the Employment of People Who Are Blind.

Even after losing so much, Mr. Mittman considers himself the luckiest  man alive. His responses to adversity serves as an inspiring lesson to  all of us.

Indiana is fortunate to have benefited from his unwavering sense of  hope and leadership in our community. No one is more deserving than Mr.  Mittman for this appointment, and I am truly excited to see such an  inspiring Hoosier serve on the AbilityOne Commission.
