Military Academy Nominations


Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize nine students  from Indiana's Third District that I have nominated to attend our  Nation's military academies: Christian Touzard from Spencerville;  Samantha Aselage from Huntertown; Oliver Werling from New Haven; Luke  Wonderham from Monroeville; and Allison Heine, Jacob Levitt, Jacob  Farrell, Jonah Haines, and Hayden Oberlin, all from Fort Wayne.

Our service academies breed the best of the best, where strong  leadership and impeccable fortitude are forged in service to our  Nation.

Throughout our Nation's history, America has been a shining example  to the world for our commitment to democracy, individual liberty, and  the rule of law.

As we celebrate America's 250th anniversary this year, I commend  these students for choosing to defend these values foundational to our  national identity.

I am truly grateful to see that such patriotism and dedication to  service thrives in the next generation.

These nine individuals have already demonstrated excellence, and I  know  they will continue to make our country and State proud.
