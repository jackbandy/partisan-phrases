Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Congressional App Challenge winners for Indiana's Third District: Ishan  Ramrakhiani and Rikhin Kavuru.

Together, these two students identified a gap in AI services and  decided to provide a solution. Using their technical knowledge, they  programmed an innovative app that offers AI assistance for professional  video editing called Auter.

This app allows users to employ editing tools specific to their needs  using plain language and AI. This app showcases both students'  outstanding knowledge and experience in computer coding.

Creating an app from scratch truly speaks to their initiative and  desire to make an impact. Throughout the process, both students  maintained determination despite technical hurdles.

Their creativity and determination for success are truly inspiring. I  know both Ishan and Rikhin have bright futures ahead. I wish them  continued success as they pursue their academic and professional goals.
