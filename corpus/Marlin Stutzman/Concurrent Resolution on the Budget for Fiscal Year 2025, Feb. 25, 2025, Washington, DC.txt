Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this  resolution because it delivers on the promise that we made to the  American people by extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and fulfilling  President Trump's agenda.

This is direly needed. For the past 4 years, the American people have  lived through the longest sustained period of debt and deficit in our  Nation's history. During that same time, Americans have also had to  grapple with hyperinflation and record-high energy costs and grocery  costs at the grocery store.

This budget will usher in a new golden era that the American people  are yearning for and where free enterprise can flourish, energy  production is unleashed, and our fiscal health is restored.

This budget does so by extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which  delivered wage increases of 4.9 percent and the lowest poverty and  unemployment rates in 50 years. This budget also achieves a deficit  reduction of $1 billion over 10 years and achieves massive savings in  our spending.

Washington doesn't have a revenue problem. Washington has a spending  problem.

Mr. Chair, the American people sent us here to fulfill a mission,  putting our Nation back on a trajectory toward success and prosperity.  Passing this resolution is the first step in that process. This budget  doesn't betray the middle class. It saves the middle class, and it  empowers the middle class for a prosperous future.

Mr. Chairman, I support this resolution, and I encourage my  colleagues to do the same. This is the first time that I remember where  we are actually being fiscally responsible.
