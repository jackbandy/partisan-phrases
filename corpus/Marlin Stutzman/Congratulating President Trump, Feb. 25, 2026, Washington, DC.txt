Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate President Trump for his  successful State of the Union Address last night.

With Republicans' help here in Congress, we have worked nonstop to  bring down costs and empower everyday Americans.

For instance, President Trump has negotiated countless trade deals to  bring manufacturing back to America. Tariffs have led to massive  investments, particularly in Indiana, including investments from John  Deere and General Motors and many small to midsized companies.

President Trump is also helping Americans by lowering prices on gas  and food. Along with Republicans, he has worked to implement Trump  accounts to ensure financial resources for future generations.

Above all, President Trump has built off the work of the late Charlie  Kirk to put God at the center of American exceptionalism.

Our country has rebounded with safer streets, peace through strength,  and tremendous tax cuts.

As America marks its 250th anniversary, I just thank him and support  the work that Republicans and President Trump are doing to make sure  that America wins in the future and that God may bless America to  continue to be the great Nation that we are blessed with.
