Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Mast for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this resolution which  would terminate the President's national emergency in response to the  flow of fentanyl across our northern border.

As an Arizonan, I am all too familiar with the destruction these  weaponized opioids have caused, and I fully support President Trump's  mission to rid our Nation of this poison.

Under the previous administration, fentanyl claimed the lives of  approximately 73,000 Americans per year and became the leading cause of  death among those aged 18 to 45. President Trump was elected in part to  confront this catastrophic crisis.

Fentanyl affects constituents of every Member of this body,  regardless of political affiliation. As someone who has met with  individuals devastated by this deadly substance, maintaining our  momentum to stop fentanyl must remain a top priority.

Over the past year, the Trump administration urged Canada to work in  coordination with our law enforcement partners to help stem the flow of  dangerous narcotics. Unfortunately, our neighbors to the north have  failed to adequately respond, prompting the administration to use  leverage to bring them to the table. Now Democrats are on the House  floor attempting to end the President's declaration, which would  undermine efforts to prevent fentanyl-related deaths. It would be very  unwise to tie the President's hands and remove this critical tool  during an ongoing public health and national security crisis.

Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the leadership of Chairman Mast, and I  applaud the administration's commitment to preventing addiction and  overdoses.
