Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to include in the Record the  following letter congratulating the Asian Pacific Islander American  Public Affairs Solano County Chapter ahead of their 10th Anniversary  and Celebration of Young Leaders banquet.

The Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs Solano County's  10th Anniversary and Celebration of Young Leaders banquet is a  wonderful tribute to our community, and I am proud to represent the  organization and the young leaders being honored at this event.                                                     John Garamendi,                                          United States Congress,                                                   August 8th, 2025.      Re 10th Annual Anniversary and Celebration of Young Leaders       APAPA Solano County Chapter      Vallejo, CA.

Dear APAPA-SOC and 2025 APAPA-SOC Interns, It is with great       pleasure that I congratulate the Asian Pacific Islander       American Public Affairs Solano County Chapter (APAPA-SOC) for       another year of exemplary service and join you in celebrating       your 10th Annual Anniversary and Celebration of Young Leaders       banquet. Reaching this important milestone is a true       testament to your organization's dedication, perseverance and       commitment to excellence. APAPA-SOC's continuous efforts to       empower Asian and Pacific Islander Americans by encouraging       civic participation through leadership and mentorship       programs, internships, and scholarships deserve the highest       commendation. Over the past decade APAPA-SOC has       made a lasting impact on our community and uplifted many       young leaders across the country and in California's Eighth       Congressional District. APAPA's work is making great strides       toward creating a more perfect Union.

Civic participation is critical to upholding our democratic       ideals, and I am thrilled to see APAPA-SOC working so       actively on this mission. Asian and Pacific Islander       Americans' representation at all levels of government is       necessary to ensure that the Asian and Pacific Islander       community is properly acknowledged and advocated for.       Throughout APAPA-SOC's ten years, its ability to empower       Asian and Pacific Islander Americans of all ages has left its       community a legacy that promotes civic engagement at the       local, state, and national levels of government. It is my       greatest hope that the APAPA-SOC Chapter continues to prosper       in the years ahead. I look forward to seeing APAPA-SOC       interns grow into tomorrow's leaders of California and       beyond.

The APAPA-SOC's 10th Anniversary and Celebration of Young       Leaders banquet is sure to be a wonderful celebration of all       the hard work and dedication APAPA-SOC interns have put into       strengthening our democracy. As you celebrate this       anniversary, I hope you take pride in how far your APAPA-SOC       has come and feel inspired by the continued journey ahead. On       behalf of California's Eighth Congressional District, please       accept my gratitude for the good you have done, and continue       to do, in our district and my best wishes for continued       success in all of APAPA-SOC's future endeavors.            Sincerely,                                                    John Garamendi,                                                Member of Congress.
