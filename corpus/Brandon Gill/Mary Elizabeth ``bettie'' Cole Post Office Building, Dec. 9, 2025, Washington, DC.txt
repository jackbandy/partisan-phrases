Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1461) to designate the facility of the United States  Postal Service located at 521 Thorn Street in Sewickley, Pennsylvania,  as the ``Mary Elizabeth `Bettie' Cole Post Office Building''.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1461

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. MARY ELIZABETH ``BETTIE'' COLE POST OFFICE                     BUILDING.

(a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 521 Thorn Street in Sewickley,       Pennsylvania, shall be known and designated as the ``Mary       Elizabeth `Bettie' Cole Post Office Building''.

(b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Mary Elizabeth `Bettie' Cole Post Office       Building''.

Mr. GILL of Texas.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would rename a  post office in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, for Mary Elizabeth ``Bettie''  Cole.

Mrs. Cole served as the associate director of office services,  director of the mailing department at Point Park College, local  historian, and beloved member of her community.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my House colleagues to  support this bill naming a post office for Mary Elizabeth ``Bettie''  Cole, a local historian and beloved community member.
