Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to present to you the Global  Medical Response (GMR) Stars of Life award recipients for 2025. A proud  member of the American Ambulance Association (AAA), GMR is a leader in  emergency medical services across the country--providing care to  communities and residents of all walks of life.

The AAA created the Stars of Life program to celebrate the  contributions of ambulance professionals who have gone above and beyond  the call of duty in service to their communities and the EMS  profession. By honoring the contributions of these heroes, the Stars of  Life program also highlights the critical role EMS plays in our  healthcare infrastructure.

The opportunities to save lives--whether it's someone who suffered a  cardiac arrest following a motor vehicle incident in Evansville,  Indiana, or a 12-day old infant who stopped breathing in Clackamas,  Oregon--are the situations for which EMS professionals train and  prepare. But we should also honor the everyday professionalism, skill,  and commitment to doing what is right for the patient that is at the  forefront of everything emergency medical responders do, both on duty  and off. By putting their own lives on the line every time they answer  the call for help, EMS professionals are heroes in their local  communities, even if some are too humble to see themselves that way.

I thank all first responders for answering the call and I thank the  2025 GMR Stars of Life award recipients for providing care to the world  at a moment's notice. I include in the Record the following Global  Medical Response's 2025 Stars of Life Award Recipients:
