Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, if FOX News or talk radio or any  other conservative media outlet came to me and asked us if we should  provide them with taxpayer-funded handouts, I would say no, and I  believe that most of my colleagues would as well.

I certainly think that far-left propaganda outlets like NPR should be  defunded. Remember, this is an outlet that believes writing articles  about fat phobia and queer animals constitutes serious journalism. They  have the right to say whatever they want to, but they do not have the  right to our tax dollars.

To my colleagues who say that this is only a small part of our  budget, I would ask them what, outside of border security and national  defense, would they like to cut from our budget? They have never seen a  foreign country they don't want to shower with our tax dollars or an  illegal alien that they don't want to give welfare to.

This is a logical first step to get our finances under control. I  urge my colleagues to vote for this rescissions bill.
