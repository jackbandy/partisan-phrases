Sharia Free America Caucus


Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the  Sharia Free America Caucus, which I am proud to have joined.

Across the world, ideologically driven Islamic movements have  destabilized entire regions; displaced tens of millions of people; and  fueled terrorism, repression, and violence.

Where civil law is subordinated to Islamic authority, freedom,  prosperity, and security collapse. Sharia law is not a personal creed.  It is a political and legal system and one that rejects equality before  the law, suppresses dissent, and fuses radical religious doctrine with  state power. History shows that where Sharia gains influence,  constitutional government gives way to coercion.

In Texas, my constituents are increasingly alarmed by the  consequences of mass migration and the importation of ideologies that  are fundamentally incompatible with our Western civilization.

The purpose of this caucus is clear: to ensure that Sharia never  gains a foothold in America--not now, and not ever.
