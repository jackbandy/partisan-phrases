Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1008) to designate the facility of the United States  Postal Service located at 298 Route 292 in Holmes, New York, as the  ``Sheriff Adrian `Butch' Anderson Post Office Building''.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1008

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHERIFF ADRIAN ``BUTCH'' ANDERSON POST OFFICE                     BUILDING.

(a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 298 Route 292 in Holmes, New York, shall       be known and designated as the ``Sheriff Adrian `Butch'       Anderson Post Office Building''.

(b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Sheriff Adrian `Butch' Anderson Post       Office Building''.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would rename a  post office in Holmes, New York, for Sheriff Adrian ``Butch'' Anderson.

Sheriff Anderson served Dutchess County for over 50 years, as mayor  of Pawling for 8 years and sheriff for 47 years.

His numerous philanthropic efforts include his role as a board member  of the Make-A-Wish Foundation of the Hudson Valley. He was also  chairman of numerous organizations, including the American Heart  Association, the March of Dimes, and Big Brothers and Big Sisters.

Sheriff Anderson is survived by his wife, Danielle, and children.

I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues in the  House to support this bill naming a post office for a local civil  servant, Sheriff Adrian ``Butch'' Anderson.
