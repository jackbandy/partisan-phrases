Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Arrington for his  leadership throughout this process.

Mr. Speaker, President Trump delivered historic results. He is  securing our border, restoring common sense, lowering costs, and  reestablishing America's strength in the world. He is stopping our tax  dollars from funding woke, perverted projects that the other side of  the aisle seeks to push.

Today, 60 percent of American taxpayers are facing rising taxes and  uncertainty. To address these challenges, this resolution provides for  the extension of the Trump tax cuts, funds the largest mass deportation  operation in U.S. history, and cuts at least $1.5 trillion in waste,  fraud, and abuse from our Federal budget.

This is something that should receive bipartisan support. Our  commitment to fiscal discipline is clear. Conservatives on the Budget  Committee added a provision that incentivizes a total of $2 trillion in  reductions.

Mr. Speaker, the American people are begging for Washington to unlock  the Trump agenda, which this bill does. They gave us a mandate to save  this country, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
