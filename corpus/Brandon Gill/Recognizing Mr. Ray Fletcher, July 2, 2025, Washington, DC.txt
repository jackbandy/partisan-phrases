Recognizing Mr. Ray Fletcher


Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend  Mr. Ray Fletcher of Cooke County, Texas, for a lifetime of devoted  service to our nation, The Great State of Texas, and his local  community.

Mr. Fletcher first answered the call to serve when he joined the  United States Air Force in 1981, where he trained and served as a  Nuclear Weapons Specialist. Over the course of an honorable 22-year  military career, he rose to the rank of Senior Master Sergeant,  exemplifying leadership, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to the  security of our country. He retired from active duty in 2003, but his  public service was far from over.

Immediately upon retirement, Mr. Fletcher began his second career in  direct service to the people of Cooke County as the Emergency Manager  and Fire Marshal. In this role, which he held for an additional 22  years, he became a cornerstone of public safety and emergency  preparedness in North Texas. Mr. Fletcher led Cooke County through  seven federally declared disasters, investigated over 400 fires, and  oversaw numerous other critical incidents that required his seasoned  judgment and calm leadership. Among his many accomplishments, Mr.  Fletcher was instrumental in coordinating the Individual Safe Room  Grant Program, a vital initiative that led to the installation of 425  storm shelters across Cooke County. His foresight and dedication  undoubtedly made Cooke County a safer place for all who call it home.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Ray Fletcher's contributions to his country and  community reflect the very best of American values. I am proud to  represent such a distinguished citizen in the 26th Congressional  District of Texas. On behalf of a grateful community, I thank him for  his selfless service and wish him continued happiness in his well- earned retirement.
