Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, China has state-sponsored media.  North Korea has state-sponsored media. The United States does not need  taxpayer-funded propaganda.

Mr. Speaker, we have the opportunity this week to rescind a billion  dollars that is in the pipeline right now for NPR and PBS, two outlets  that routinely spew anti-American and anti-Christian propaganda. They  sow racial division in this country, and they promote weird, woke  values that most Americans find disgusting.

Mr. Speaker, this is something that we have talked about for a long  time, and finally, we have a President who is serious about rooting out  waste, fraud, and abuse from the Federal Government. This is the  perfect place to start.

Let's pass this rescission bill. Let's end taxpayer-funded  propaganda. Let's take our country back.
