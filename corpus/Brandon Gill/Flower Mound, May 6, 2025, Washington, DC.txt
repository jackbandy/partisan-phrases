Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  tremendous honor for the heart of Texas' 26th Congressional District,  Flower Mound, Texas, named the best place to live in America. My family  and I are blessed to call it home.

The distinction didn't come from luck. It came from leadership,  vision, and a community where hometown charm meets national excellence.

In Flower Mound, top-tier schools set the standard, green spaces  stretch for miles, and small businesses like Flurry's Market +  Provisions bring neighbors together. It is a town where families plant  roots, where freedom is felt, and where opportunity isn't just a  promise; it is a way of life.

At the heart of Texas-26, Flower Mound shows what happens when faith,  family, and hard work form the foundation of a community.

I congratulate the local leaders whose dedication made this  recognition possible. Flower Mound isn't just the best place to live in  America, it is proof that the American Dream lives right here in north  Texas.
