Prohibiting Voting By Noncitizens in District of Columbia Elections

Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to Democrats  trying to give voting rights to illegal aliens.

Mr. Speaker, once again, Democrats are taking the 20 percent side on  another 80-20 issue. The American people do not want illegal aliens  voting. They shouldn't be here to begin with. They have no claim on our  resources. They certainly should not influence our political system in  any respect.

Mr. Speaker, every single one of them needs to be deported.  Thankfully, we have a President who is actually doing that.

For so long, Democrats have called conservatives conspiracy  theorists. They have slandered us for saying that the Democratic  playbook, which they themselves have articulated, is to open up our  borders to ultimately provide amnesty, a path to citizenship, and  voting rights to illegal aliens.

Mr. Speaker, they are doing that right now. That is exactly what they  are doing, and they are fighting for it. Allowing illegal aliens to  vote is not only grotesquely unjust, but it waters down the meaning of  citizenship for American citizens who are here.

Mr. Speaker, our government should represent our people, American  citizens. Illegal aliens have no right to vote. They shouldn't be  voting, and they need to be deported.
