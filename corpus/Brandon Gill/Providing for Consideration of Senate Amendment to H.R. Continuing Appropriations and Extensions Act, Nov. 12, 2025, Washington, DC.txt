Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is great to hear from Ms. Ocasio- Cortez, the new leader of the Democratic Party. Unfortunately, we  didn't get to hear from Mr. Zohran Mamdani, their other leader.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to vote this evening to reopen the Federal  Government. For 40 days the Democrats shut our government down to  pursue unrealistic policy proposals that they know the American people  do not want.

Mr. Speaker, the American people do not want healthcare for illegal  aliens. They do not want our tax dollars funding leftwing media  outlets. They do not want to drive up our debt $1.5 trillion as part of  a short-term continuing resolution.

Mr. Speaker, the last 40 days have been nothing but pure political  nihilism. I am glad this nightmare is over so we can get back to work  on behalf of the American people.
