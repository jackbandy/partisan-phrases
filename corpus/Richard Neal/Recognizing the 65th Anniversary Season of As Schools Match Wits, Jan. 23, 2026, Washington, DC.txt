Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate a  remarkable milestone in western Massachusetts broadcasting and  educational history: the 65th anniversary season of As Schools Match  Wits, an award-winning high school academic quiz show produced by New  England Public Media and Westfield State University. To the best of our  knowledge, As Schools Match Wits, known affectionately throughout the  region as ASMW, is the longest-running, continually broadcast  television program in Massachusetts, and quite possibly in all of New  England.

Founded in 1961 by Leonard J. Collamore and first aired on WWLP-TV,  ASMW quickly became a treasured institution in western Massachusetts.  For 46 seasons, it provided a platform for students to showcase their  academic talents and brought communities together around a shared  celebration of learning. When rising production costs threatened the  program's future in 2006, the people of western Massachusetts made  their voices heard. Their outpouring of support inspired Russell  Peotter of WGBY-TV and Dr. Elizabeth Preston of Westfield State  University to join forces and save the show, ensuring that this beloved  tradition would continue for future generations.

In an extraordinary collaborative effort, WGBY and the Westfield  State University Department of Communication assembled a dedicated team  of producers, faculty, and technical staff who worked tirelessly to  rebuild the set, reconnect with participating schools, develop new  production schedules, and train students. Their commitment ensured that  the program never missed a season. Since 2007, ASMW has aired every  Saturday evening from January through June on NEPM/WGBY-TV, welcoming  schools from across western Massachusetts and northwestern Connecticut  to compete in a spirited test of academic excellence.

What sets ASMW apart is its deep educational mission. The questions  are aligned with Massachusetts and Connecticut high school curriculum  standards and vetted by Westfield State University faculty.  Undergraduate students from the University's Department of  Communication serve as the production crew, gaining invaluable hands-on  experience in broadcast television under the guidance of seasoned  professionals. Many of these students have gone on to successful  careers in media, working at major outlets including the NFL Network,  NBC Boston, WBZ-TV, CBS News Texas, the Dan Patrick Show, and WGGB-TV.

At the heart of ASMW's longevity is a core group of dedicated  professionals who have shepherded the program for nearly two decades.  Executive Producers Mark St. Jean of Westfield State University and  Tony Dunne of NEPM/WGBY have been with the show since its transition in  2006, as has Director Eric Jones, who began working on the program as a  freshman at WSU and now returns each year despite his national-level  career. Host Beth Ward, an award-winning journalist, has brought her  talent and warmth to the program since 2009. Production Manager Alex  Simisky, a former student crew member himself, now oversees the  University's TV studios and ensures the smooth operation of each  season.

Despite the evolution of media and the challenges facing traditional  broadcast television, ASMW remains a beloved and enduring institution.  It is now a generational program, with parents and grandparents proudly  watching their children and grandchildren compete on the same stage  where they once stood. Each year, the championship match becomes a  regional event, covered by local media and celebrated in communities  across western Massachusetts.

Mr. Speaker, As Schools Match Wits is more than a television show. It  is a celebration of learning, a training ground for future media  professionals, and a cherished tradition that has strengthened the  fabric of western Massachusetts for more than six decades. I extend my  deepest congratulations to New England Public Media, Westfield State  University, and the countless educators, students, producers, and  supporters who have sustained this remarkable program. May ASMW  continue to inspire and uplift students for many years to come.
