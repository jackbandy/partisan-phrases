Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act

Mr. Speaker, the Republican bill was put together with bubble gum and  Elmer's glue last Friday night. This isn't a plan. It sounds like their  argument that 300-year-olds are receiving Social Security benefits.

Families are staring at massive premium hikes, and now, thanks to  four Republicans, we can force a vote. When you listen to the argument  earlier from the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), he said that  Republicans never had a chance to vote on the Affordable Care Act. This  morning, we want to give you a chance.

Speaker Johnson could end this crisis and bring the bill up. Instead,  they are wasting time on this dusty bill that will increase the number  of uninsured Americans, and that is a fact. People don't need  healthcare that costs more and covers less. To stave off this crisis,  this bipartisan discharge petition is a workable path forward, and over  the course of the next few minutes, we intend to tell you that you can  hear why.

Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.

Mr. Speaker, my constituent company, Merriam-Webster, declared this  week that the word of the year is ``slop,'' and it is appropriate  today.

This bill won't lower costs. Without the ACA tax credits, costs are  going to skyrocket for the American people. That is a bombshell report.  They are undermining protections and forcing people into junk plans.

The only path forward is Leader Jeffries' discharge petition. It is a  3-year extension, clear and clean, bipartisan.

Mr. Speaker, I urge Speaker Johnson to bring this legislation up, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
