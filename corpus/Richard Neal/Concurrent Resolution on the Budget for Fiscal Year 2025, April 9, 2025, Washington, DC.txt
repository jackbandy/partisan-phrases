Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, the proposal that we are hearing from the  other side is reckless and irresponsible.

What they are saying is what they usually say: Let's complain about  the size of the national debt and then borrow the money for tax cuts to  go to people at the very top.

I defy anybody on this side to say right now that that is not what  happened in 2017. They borrowed $2.3 trillion, gave a tax cut to the  wealthiest amongst us, and then complained about Biden running up the  national debt.

The arithmetic doesn't work on this. The messaging might remain  consistent, but what I have just said is entirely accurate. The money  was borrowed in 2017. Then, when you look at tax distribution tables,  just take a look at who got the money. The tax cut for the person at  the top was 288 times what it was for the person making less than  $50,000 a year.

These are the numbers. They don't lie. The messaging that comes from  the other side would have you believe that they are on top of defending  Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. They are threatening all three  with these proposals.

I have not seen anything in my time like this, making massive cuts to  Medicaid, closing Social Security offices, threatening Medicare, laying  off veterans at veteran services offices, and then providing a tax cut  to those in billionaire heaven down in the Cabinet.

Let's have an honest discussion between the two parties about fiscal  policy.
