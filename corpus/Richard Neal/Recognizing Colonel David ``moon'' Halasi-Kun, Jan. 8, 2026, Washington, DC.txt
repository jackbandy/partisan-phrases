Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the distinguished  service and extraordinary career of Colonel David L. ``Moon'' Halasi- Kun, who has honorably served our Nation for more than twenty-five  years and most recently as the Wing Commander of the 104th Fighter Wing  at Barnes Air National Guard Base in Westfield, Massachusetts.

Colonel Halasi-Kun's career is a testament to dedication, leadership,  and excellence in service. Commissioned from the United States Air  Force Academy in 1998, he went on to graduate from the Euro-NATO Joint  Jet Pilot Training program in 2000. Over the course of his career, he  has accumulated more than 3,150 flight hours in the F-15 Eagle and  other aircraft, and has participated in combat and support missions in  Operations SOUTHERN WATCH, ENDURING FREEDOM, and ATLANTIC RESOLVE.

After a decade of active duty, Colonel Halasi-Kun joined the  Massachusetts Air National Guard in 2008, where he has served with  distinction for the past fifteen years. Rising through the ranks, he  has held numerous leadership positions, including Vice Commander of the  104th Fighter Wing, before assuming command in 2022. In this role, he  was responsible for ensuring that more than 1,000 military and civilian  personnel were mission-ready to defend our homeland and support  expeditionary deployments around the globe. Most notably, Colonel  Halasi-Kun has upheld the stellar reputation that has become associated  with Barnes, positioning the base to be selected as the preferred  location to host a new fleet of F-35A aircraft. This decision  solidified Barnes' place in the western Massachusetts community for  decades to come.

Colonel Halasi-Kun's service has been recognized with some of the  military's highest honors, including the Legion of Merit, the  Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal, and the Aerial Achievement  Medal. His professional achievements are matched by his academic  accomplishments, having earned advanced degrees in Military Operational  Art and Science as well as National Resource Strategy.

On September 30, 2025, Colonel Halasi-Kun completed his final flight  in the F-15C Eagle, marking both the end of his own flying career and  the conclusion of the F-15 mission at Barnes Air National Guard Base.  In a fitting tribute, he led a four-ship formation on a two-hour  mission over the Atlantic, a ``Lunar Flight'' named in honor of his  call sign, ``Moon.'' Upon his return, he was greeted by family,  friends, and fellow airmen who celebrated his remarkable career and  enduring legacy.

Mr. Speaker, Colonel Halasi-Kun embodies the very best of our armed  forces: courage, professionalism, and an unwavering commitment to duty.  His leadership has left an indelible mark on the 104th Fighter Wing,  and his service has brought great pride to the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts and to our Nation.

I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Colonel David ``Moon''  Halasi-Kun for his decades of service and sacrifice. We extend our  deepest gratitude to him, his wife Gretchen, and his son Luke for their  steadfast support throughout his career. His legacy will continue to  inspire future generations of airmen as the 104th transitions to its  next chapter with the arrival of the F-35s.
