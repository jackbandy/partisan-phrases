Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes)  in paying tribute to Eric Tarpinian-Jachym of Granby, Massachusetts,  who tragically lost his life here in Washington.

Eric was a rising senior at the University of Massachusetts, a proud  graduate of Granby Public Schools, and a young man of great promise. He  came to Capitol Hill eager to learn, contribute, and serve the people  and this great institution, only motivated by idealism and a commitment  to public service. Through his determination and intellect, he  accomplished all of that.

Those who were close to Eric speak of his thoughtfulness, curiosity,  and noteworthy commitment to learning about his government. He loved  archery, fishing, and the great outdoors, but surely it will be his  character that is remembered most.

To his parents, Tamara and Robert; his siblings, Angela and Jeremy;  and all who loved him, including his best buddy Hunter, our deepest  condolences on behalf of the United States of America. May his memory  be a blessing for all of us.
