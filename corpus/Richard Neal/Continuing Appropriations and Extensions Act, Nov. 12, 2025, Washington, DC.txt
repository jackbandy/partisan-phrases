Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026

Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, the destruction that is taking place in  America's healthcare system during these 10 months is unbelievable.  They have eviscerated the National Institutes of Health. They have cut  back on the Centers for Disease Control and billions of dollars for  Medicaid for a tax cut for the wealthy. Wait till you see what is  coming to America's hospitals after the next election. It is so  contrived they waited until after the election to implement it.

Mr. Speaker, 24 million people are likely to lose health insurance if  we  don't implement these tax credits as suggested. The emergency room is  going to be back in full force now because this is where people will go  for their healthcare.

All of this is taking place to justify a tax cut for people at the  very top. Here is the real kicker: Our Republican colleagues of fiscal  probity borrowed the money for the tax cuts.

In 2017, it was $2.4 trillion. In the last tax bill, almost $4  trillion is borrowed for a tax cut for wealthy people. Whatever  happened to the fiscal soundness that the Republican Party used to  lecture everybody on.
