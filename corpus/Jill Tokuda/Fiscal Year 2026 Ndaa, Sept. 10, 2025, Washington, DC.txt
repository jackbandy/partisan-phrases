Fiscal Year 2026 Ndaa

Ms. TOKUDA. Madam Speaker, when the Armed Services Committee reported  out this year's NDAA, it was a bill I was proud to support after months  of bipartisan work, careful oversight, and real provisions to  strengthen our national defense. That is the kind of process this  committee is known for.

As we have sadly seen before, the amendments being considered are  largely partisan poison pills set to, once again, diminish the  bipartisan work of our committee. Through a closed, partisan process,  Rules Committee Republicans stripped away balance and accountability.  They denied Democrats and, by extension, our constituents the chance to  openly debate  issues that demand answers, like the National Guard in our streets, the  purges at the Pentagon, or the abuse of Trump's unilateral military  force abroad.

Not surprisingly, not one of the ten amendments I submitted were made  in order.

Let me tell you what Republicans apparently don't care about:  Accountability for predators.

I offered an amendment to disinter Dr. Robert McCormick Browne, a man  accused of sexually abusing dozens of students in Hawaii, from the  National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. A predator like that does  not deserve to rest amongst heroes. The Republicans said no. By  refusing to act, they are, once again, protecting a pedophile, allowing  him to lie in a place of honor instead of standing amongst survivors  and justice.

Taking care of veterans. I proposed suspending commissary debit card  fees that unfairly tax veterans and their caregivers. I also proposed  eliminating medical copays for Native Hawaiian veterans, the same  healthcare benefits that Native American and Alaska Native veterans  currently receive. Republicans said no. Apparently, they believe  veterans should keep getting nickeled-and-dimed for basic healthcare  and food.

Madam Speaker, with regard to safe housing for servicemembers, I  proposed an amendment to increase investment in barracks for  unaccompanied servicemembers and establish clear timeliness standards  for maintenance work orders.

No servicemembers should be forced to live with black mold, broken  plumbing, and unsafe conditions. I have walked through those barracks  myself.

Republicans said no, again. I guess they are fine sending troops off  to war and combat and then sending them home to live in squalor.

With regard to standing up to China, I introduced an amendment  requiring congressional approval before advanced AI chips, critical to  our most sophisticated weapons and intelligence systems, could be  exported to Beijing. It was blocked.

I also proposed raising the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative  cap to $8.5 billion, fully paid for with existing tariff revenue that  is coming in, to strengthen Indo-Pacific deterrence. Republicans still  said no. If this is their idea of strength, China will be the one that  wins.

It wasn't just me that didn't get amendments included in the NDAA.  Many of my colleagues put forward commonsense ideas like prohibiting  the deportation of veterans without due process, as in the case of my  constituent, Mr. Sae Joon Park, or clarifying that the National Guard  can't be turned into an immigration police force. Yet both of these  amendments were blocked.

Madam Speaker, here is the truth. It is an intentional choice that we  make to take an oath to be of the people and for the people.

In a democracy, we debate. We vote. We let the American people see  exactly where we stand. In an autocracy, that choice is stripped away.  Dissent is silenced, and decisions are made behind closed doors.

That is the difference. That is the danger. That is a choice.  Shutting down debate isn't just about dysfunction. It is a betrayal of  our oath and our disservice to every single servicemember, veteran, and  family who depends on us.

They fought for us. They have sacrificed for us. They have died for  us. They deserve leaders who fight for them and not politicians who  game the process.

I will always stand up for all of Hawaii's servicemembers, their  families, and the communities that support them. Their sacrifices  inspire me every single day.

Madam Speaker, there is another way. There is a better way. It is  called democracy, and it begins with a choice.
