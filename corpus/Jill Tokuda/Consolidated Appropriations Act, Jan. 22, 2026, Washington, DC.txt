Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026


Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 7148  because for rural communities like mine in Hawaii, this bill isn't  abstract policy. It is about whether people can get care and whether  caregivers can keep going.

I have met grandparents caring for grandchildren, parents caring for  children with disabilities, and adult children caring for aging loved  ones, often with no backup and no break.

That is why the 5-year reauthorization of the Lifespan Respite Care  Program in this bill, which I was proud to co-lead with Representative  Langworthy, matters so deeply. Respite care isn't a luxury. It is the  difference between a caregiver burning out and a family staying  together.

This bill also reauthorizes the Teaching Health Center GME program,  the National Health Services Corps, extends telehealth, and increases  funding for critical rural health programs. Taken together, these  investments will grow the workforce, expand access to care, and improve  health outcomes.

Providers and patients need certainty now. Rural health systems are  fragile, and delays have real consequences. Passing this bill will  change lives and save lives, and we cannot afford to wait.
