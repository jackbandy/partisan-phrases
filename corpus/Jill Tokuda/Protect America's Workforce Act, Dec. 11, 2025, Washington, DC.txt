Protect America's Workforce Act

Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today outraged at the ongoing assault  on the rights and protections of the Federal workers who serve our  Nation, over 48,000 of them in Hawaii alone.

Just yesterday, this House passed the NDAA, meant to strengthen our  national defense. However, the NDAA means nothing if we cut down, take  away rights, and fail to protect the very workforce that makes national  defense possible.

Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order  dismantling collective bargaining agreements for more than 1 million  Federal employees.

Let's be clear: The healthcare we fight to make affordable and  accessible, the services we promise our veterans, the readiness we  demand of our agencies, none of it is real if we undermine the  employees who deliver these services on the front lines. Without them,  these are just empty promises, just words.

Collective bargaining, grievance procedures, and whistleblower  protections are the foundation of the strong civilian workforce that  our national security, veterans, and communities across this country  rely on.

Ms. TOKUDA. Our Hawaii Government Employees Association calls the  President's action a direct attack on working Americans. That is why I  stand firmly with our union ``ohana'' ``family'' across the country in  rejecting these union-busting efforts and urging passage of the Protect  America's Workforce Act.
