Maui Dislocated Workers Program


Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the workers and  families of Maui, still recovering from the devastating wildfires of  2023. Displaced workers continue to drive Maui's recovery, rebuilding  homes, clearing debris, restoring infrastructure, and supporting their  communities.

The National Dislocated Worker Grant has been vital in funding such  disaster recovery work and providing job training, temporary  employment, and career services to wildfire survivors.

I am grateful to the Department of Labor for awarding Hawaii $2.5  million in dislocated worker grant funding. While this is a step in the  right direction, the livelihoods of displaced workers, the health of  our local economy, and the long-term trajectory of Maui's recovery  remain in the balance.

We must continue working to secure all remaining dislocated worker  funds available--$8 million--to ensure the program continues through  September 2025. We can and must give our local workers this certainty  during an uncertain time. Without these funds, we risk losing momentum  in the recovery and leaving workers without crucial support.

Maui's recovery is not just a priority. It is a promise to those who  have lost so much. I will keep fighting to ensure that promise is kept.
