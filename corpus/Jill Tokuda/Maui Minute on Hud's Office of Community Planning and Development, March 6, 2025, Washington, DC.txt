Maui Minute on Hud's Office of Community Planning and Development


Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike,  came together to pass the American Relief Act of 2025, securing $12  billion to rebuild communities devastated by disaster. We made a  promise to North Carolina, Florida, Texas, and Maui.

Mr. Speaker, that promise isn't just being broken. It is being ripped  apart. What a slap in the face for those constituents when that funding  to rebuild homes, businesses, and communities gets delayed or even  withheld because the Musk-Trump administration plans to gut HUD's  Office of Community Planning and Development, the very team responsible  for getting billions of relief dollars to where they belong. It will be  essentially eliminated. That isn't streamlining or efficiency. That is  sabotage.

This week, I am proud to have led a bipartisan letter, signed by 47  Members of Congress, calling on this administration to not cut these  critical positions.

We voted for this funding. Now, let's do our jobs and fight to make  sure it gets to the people who need it most.
