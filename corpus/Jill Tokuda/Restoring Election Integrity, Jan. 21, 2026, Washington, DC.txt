Restoring Election Integrity

Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, today marks the anniversary of Citizens  United. This decision did not rewrite campaign finance law; it sold our  democracy to the highest bidder.

Before Citizens United, elections were about persuading voters. After  it, they became about courting billionaires.

As of 2025, there are 2,502 super-PACs. For the 2024 election, they  have taken in over $5 billion, much of it dark money, much of it  undisclosed, and much of it designed to drown out the voices of  everyday Americans.

Let's be clear: This isn't free speech. This is legalized corruption.

Super-PACs were supposedly independent. In reality, they have become  shadow campaigns, circumventing coordination laws, allowing unlimited,  often anonymous, contributions, and turning elections into auctions.

What does that buy? For a bargain price of $300 million, Elon Musk  bought a gilded seat inside the Federal Government and walked away with  billions in contracts from the very agencies he later DOGE'd. It is a  parasitic, pay-to-play system disguised as innovation.

Meanwhile, teachers, nurses, construction workers, and police  officers pay higher effective tax rates than private equity executives.  Families struggle with housing costs, healthcare, and childcare while  Congress stalls, paralyzed by fear of angering the super-PACs that  bankroll campaigns.

That fear is the point. Dark money doesn't just influence policy. It  changes behavior. It makes Members of Congress think twice before doing  the right thing because they know one vote could trigger a massive  smear campaign.

The losers aren't Democrats or Republicans. The losers in all of this  are the American people, across parties  and across States, whose voices are being drowned out.

Fifteen years later, the verdict is in: Citizens United has sold out  our democracy and all Americans across the country. It is past time to  end the era when billionaires buy access, buy silence, and buy power.

Congress must act to close the coordination loopholes, rein in the  super-PACs, and restore the simple idea that in America, people, not  money, govern.
