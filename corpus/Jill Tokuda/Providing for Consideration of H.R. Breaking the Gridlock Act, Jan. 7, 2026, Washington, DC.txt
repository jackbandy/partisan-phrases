Providing for Consideration of H.R. Breaking the Gridlock Act

Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, imagine being a farmer choosing between  insurance and seed, a small business owner weighing a doctor's visit  against payroll, families hoping nothing goes wrong because they are  one ER visit away from being homeless. This is the reality for rural  America today.

The big, ugly bill took a sledgehammer to rural healthcare, and  letting the ACA enhanced premium tax credits expire will accelerate the  damage and hasten the harm.

In rural America, places like Hawaii, insurance coverage is the  business model that keeps hospitals, clinics, and emergency rooms open.  When premiums rise, coverage drops, revenue disappears, and hospital  doors close. Without those credits, rural Americans will see their  monthly healthcare costs rise by 107 percent. A single premium hike  will make the difference between whether a family eats, pays their  rent, or sees a doctor.

Mr. Speaker, 2.8 million rural Americans will lose coverage. For  them, this is not politics. This is life or death.

Healthcare should never depend on your ZIP Code. This clean extension  of the ACA tax credits will save lives.
