Recognizing Interns Angel and Sandra


Mr. MILLER of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize two  exceptional young leaders, Angel and Sandra, our outstanding interns  from Don Bosco Cristo Rey High School. These students have demonstrated  maturity and a sincere desire to serve.

Throughout their time in our office, they brought a strong work ethic  to everything that they did, from assisting with constituent outreach  to supporting our office operations. They showed us that the next  generation is not only ready to lead but also eager to contribute.

In a time when public service too often goes undervalued, these young  interns remind us that civic engagement is alive and well. Their  curiosity and commitment give me great hope for the future of our  Nation.

Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank Angel and Sandra for their hard work,  their integrity, and their service. They have left a mark here. I have  no doubt they will go on to do many great things.
