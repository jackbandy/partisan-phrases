Mr. MILLER of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, you do not need a traditional 4-year  degree to become a millionaire. In Ohio's Seventh District, we have  some of the best career centers in the Nation, placing students in  high-paying jobs right out of high school.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Medina  County Career Center in Medina, Ohio, right in our district. The center  opened in 1974 as the Medina County Joint Vocational School before  changing its name to what it is today. The career center is a  partnership with six public school districts in northeast Ohio and  offers advanced career and technical education for approximately 1,200  high school students and nearly 3,000 adult students.

Additionally, the center offers secondary career development  resources and student internship opportunities, preparing students to  enter or to reenter the workforce.

I commend the Medina County Career Center and express my gratitude  for the center's role in producing future leaders from Ohio's Seventh  Congressional District.
