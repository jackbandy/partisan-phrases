Mr. MILLER of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, Ohio families and small businesses  continue to face unprecedented healthcare costs, making it increasingly  difficult for my constituents to access affordable, high-quality care.

Since the enactment of the so-called Affordable Care Act in 2010,  healthcare costs have risen dramatically, with premiums increasing by  more than 25 percent over the last 5 years. This trend makes clear that  our Nation's healthcare system needs reform to lower costs for patients  and ensure stability for providers.

The Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act is a critical  step forward in curbing rising premiums, expanding choice, and  improving transparency. The legislation includes provisions to improve  affordability, particularly for small businesses, along with cost- sharing reduction funding and PBM reforms.

As we move toward these goals, I urge the adoption of the Lower  Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act and remain committed to  reforming a broken healthcare system, increasing choice and competition  to lower healthcare costs for our Nation.
