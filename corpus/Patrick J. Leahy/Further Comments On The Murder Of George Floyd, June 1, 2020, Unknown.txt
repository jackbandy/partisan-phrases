Further Comments On The Murder Of George Floyd


Marcelle and I were shocked, we were outraged, and we were saddened by the murder of George Floyd while in official custody.  Everyone involved must be held accountable.  Sadly this tragic death explicitly shows how far our society still has go to achieve racial, social, and economic equality.

These chronic, ongoing injustices make painfully clear why advancing criminal justice and law enforcement reforms has been a priority of mine for decades in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee.  And that is also why I and other senators will be pushing for further reforms and improvements in light of these continued injustices.

Justice for George Floyd is not simply about holding those who murdered him accountable, which is critical.  It is about making sure our anger today brings lasting change tomorrow.  We all must engage, and we must act.
