Reaction To The Death Of Mustafa Kassem In An Egyptian Prison


"Repeatedly over the past several years, I, Secretary of State Pompeo, Vice President Pence, and other U.S. officials urged President Sisi to release Mustafa Kassem, an innocent American citizen who was falsely arrested, unjustly convicted along with 700 others after a sham trial, and sentenced to 15 years in prison.  According to the Department of State, no credible evidence was presented to support the charges against him.

"This is a monumental, unforgiveable travesty, for which President Sisi is personally accountable.  It could easily have been prevented.  Yet he stubbornly refused to act despite the entreaties of the international community, including the United States, from which his government receives $1.5 billion in assistance annually.

"President Trump has called President Sisi "my favorite dictator.'  That aptly describes him.  Egypt today is a military dictatorship.  Corruption is rampant.  Dissent is met with arrest, torture, and prolonged imprisonment.  Yet the White House has refused to use its leverage to counter it.

"It is high time that the Congress, and the White House, recognize that we cannot continue to reward such reprehensible conduct."
