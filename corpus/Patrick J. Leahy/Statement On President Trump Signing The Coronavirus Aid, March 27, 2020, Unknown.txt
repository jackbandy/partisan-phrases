Statement On President Trump Signing The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act


Addressing a public health and economic crisis unprecedented in our time is only possible when there are no labels at the negotiating table.  That is what we accomplished today.  Republicans and Democrats came together to help the American people.  We dealt with reality and not rhetoric.  This legislation will provide significant resources to those on the front lines of this crisis, and to people in communities across the country who are making great sacrifices to protect themselves, their families, and their communities. 

I believe Congress will have to do more in the weeks and months ahead, and as Vice Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am prepared to do what our Committee does best --  work together to address the needs of the American people.
