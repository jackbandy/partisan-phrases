Comment On State Department Level 4 Global Health Advisory


COVID-19 has upended our normal way of life, and it is imperative that all Vermonters, and all Americans, do everything possible to protect themselves, their families, and their communities from this extremely contagious and dangerous virus.  The State Department has issued a warning against all travel overseas, and I urge Vermonters to heed that warning.  Vermonters who are currently in other countries and plan to return home, should do so immediately as borders are closing and air travel is being curtailed with little or no advance notice.   We are all in this together, and each of us must do whatever we can to prevent the virus from spreading.  In the past when faced with daunting challenges and hardship, Vermonters rallied together for the common good.  That is what we must do today.
