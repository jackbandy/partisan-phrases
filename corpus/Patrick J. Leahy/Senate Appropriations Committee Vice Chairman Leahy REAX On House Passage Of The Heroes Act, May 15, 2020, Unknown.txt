Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chairman Leahy REAX On House Passage Of The Heroes Act


The coronavirus pandemic has claimed more than 86,000 lives in our country.  More than 36 million people have filed for unemployment, and at 14.7 percent the unemployment rate is the highest it has been since the Great Depression.

And yet, Leader McConnell claims there is no urgency to act.  I strongly disagree.

House Democrats have put forward a strong proposal that provides assistance to struggling families, supports state and local governments, funds a responsible testing program, and recognizes the sacrifices being made by grocery store clerks, first responders, nurses, doctors, truckers and more. 

Leader McConnell should wake up and recognize the need is urgent and unprecedented.  Senate Republicans and President Trump must demonstrate leadership and begin negotiations on the next relief bill now.  Delay makes no one safer, does nothing to box in the virus, and does nothing to open the economy. 

Senate Appropriations Committee Democrats are ready to get to work.
