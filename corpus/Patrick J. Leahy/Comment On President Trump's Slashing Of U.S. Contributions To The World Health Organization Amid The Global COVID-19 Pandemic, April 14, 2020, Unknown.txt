Comment On President Trump's Slashing Of U.S. Contributions To The World Health Organization Amid The Global COVID-19 Pandemic


"Withholding funds for WHO in the midst of the worst pandemic in a century makes as much sense as cutting off ammunition to an ally as the enemy closes in.  The White House knows that it grossly mishandled this crisis from the beginning, ignoring multiple warnings and squandering valuable time, dismissing medical science, comparing COVID 19 to the common cold, and saying "everything will be fine'.  Even after restricting flights from China which the President likes to brag about after praising China's response, nearly half a million people entered the United States from China and the virus was also coming here from Europe and elsewhere.  Not wanting to take responsibility as the deaths continue to mount, he blames others.  WHO could have been more forceful with China and declared a global health emergency sooner, but it is performing an essential function and needs our strong support."
