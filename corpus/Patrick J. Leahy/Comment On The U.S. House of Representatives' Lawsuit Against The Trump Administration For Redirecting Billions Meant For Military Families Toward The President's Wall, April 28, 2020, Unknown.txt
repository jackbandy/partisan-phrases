Comment On The U.S. House of Representatives' Lawsuit Against The Trump Administration For Redirecting Billions Meant For Military Families Toward The President's Wall


Today the D.C. Court of Appeals is hearing arguments in the U.S. House of Representatives' lawsuit against the Trump administration for hijacking billions of congressionally appropriated dollars to benefit military families and redirecting them to build President Trump's wall.  The House's central argument -- that Congress, and Congress alone, possesses the power of the purse -- doesn't require any esoteric interpretation of the Constitution; it simply requires a reading of its plain text.  While President Trump may neither read nor respect the Constitution, our federal courts most certainly do.  I hope that the independent judiciary will ultimately uphold the clear decree of Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7 of the U.S. Constitution.  In our democracy, it is the American people's representatives in Congress -- not the President -- that decide how their hard-earned tax dollars are spent, and the President must respect those laws.
