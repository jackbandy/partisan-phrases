Comment On The President's Remarks About The World Health Organization


"The World Health Organization does need reform, just as it needs the strong support of the United States and other countries in order to do its job.  But such complaints also apply to President Trump, who ignored numerous warnings, downplayed the threat, discounted medical science and squandered valuable time that could have saved countless lives.  He continues to shamelessly and relentlessly try to shift responsibility for his disastrous response to the coronavirus to anyone and everyone except himself.  It's the American people who desperately need new leadership."
