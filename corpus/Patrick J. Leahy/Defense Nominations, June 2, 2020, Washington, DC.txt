Defense Nominations


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the President's threat of using military  force against protestors is a grossly inappropriate, unnecessary, and  dangerous escalation at a time when Americans are looking for  constructive and enlightened leadership. America's power and strength  derives, above all, not from our military might, but from the values  that are at the very foundation of this country, rooted in the First  Amendment of the Constitution. 

  Our country has a long tradition of civilian policing. It is one of  the many ways our government differs from regimes that routinely use  the military to intimidate and silence their critics. The Insurrection  Act was last invoked nearly three decades ago, to respond to the Rodney  King riots in Los Angeles at the request of and by working closely with  State authorities. 

  Its application is not a threat to be cavalierly bandied about, as if  our Armed Forces are puppets of the President to evict peaceful  protestors for purposes of a staged photo op. I am deeply disturbed  that civilian and military leaders joined the President in this misuse  of force. 

  Until the President and his senior military advisers make clear that  they understand and accept this, I cannot vote to confirm further  nominees to the Department of Defense.
