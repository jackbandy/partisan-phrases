Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule. The  appropriations bills need to be passed for fiscal year 2026 Defense;  Homeland Security; Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education; and  Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development.

For the first time in years, Congress is approaching the finish line  of passing all 12 appropriations bills in a transparent and timely  manner, reclaiming our constitutional power of the purse.

As we approach our Nation's 250th anniversary, this body can take  pride in governing as our Founders intended and building a future that  is more secure, resilient, and prosperous.

Last November, the American people sent us here with a clear mandate  to put America first. This package delivers through critical  investments in border security, national infrastructure, and stronger  support for our servicemembers and their families.

In North Carolina's 11th District, these funds support essential  water and public safety projects including a new EMS base in Swannanoa,  water and sewer upgrades at Swain Middle School, an emergency services  hub in Madison County, upgraded water lines in Robbinsville, and a new  taxiway on the west side at Asheville Regional Airport.

Following Hurricane Helene, these investments aid recovery, eliminate  the uncertainty of short-term extensions, and give local leaders the  confidence to plan ahead. This is a return to responsible governance,  and I am proud to support it. I ask Members to please support this  rule.
