Recognizing Phillip Barrier


Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Phillip Barrier  for his 27 years of dedicated public service to Avery County, North  Carolina, as County Manager.

Phillip's career reflects a lifetime commitment to serving his  community with integrity, professionalism, and an unwavering sense of  responsibility. He began his career as Avery County's Tax  Administrator, a role he held for 19 years, earning the respect of  colleagues and residents alike through his steady leadership and deep  knowledge of county operations. In March 2017, Phillip was appointed  Avery County Manager, where he continued to demonstrate exceptional  dedication to the people he served.

Most notably, Phillip's leadership during and after Hurricane Helene  stands as a defining chapter of his tenure. At a time of immense  pressure and uncertainty, he played a critical role in coordinating  local response efforts and guiding recovery planning. His ability to  bring people together, communicate clearly, and keep the public  informed helped Avery County navigate hardship with resilience and  unity.

Phillip's service has been widely recognized for his leadership and  impact. In 2017, he was named Mayland Community College's Distinguished  Citizen of the Year for Avery County, and in 2021, he was honored as  Businessperson of the Year by the Avery County Chamber of Commerce.

Beyond his professional career, Phillip has devoted countless hours  to his community through volunteer service. He has served as Treasurer  of the Avery County Education Foundation, Chairman of Avery County  Impact, a member of the First Baptist Church Crossnore Youth Team,  Chair of the Ingalls Precinct Republican Party, and an active member of  the Avery County Schools Improvement Team. These roles reflect his deep  commitment to education, civic engagement, faith, and the future of  Avery County's youth.

On behalf of the people of North Carolina's 11th Congressional  District, I extend my sincere gratitude to Phillip Barrier for his  decades of service and leadership. Avery County is stronger because of  his dedication, and his legacy will continue to be felt for years to  come. I wish Phillip and his family the very best in his well-earned  retirement.
