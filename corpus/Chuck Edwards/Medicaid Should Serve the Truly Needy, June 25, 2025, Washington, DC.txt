Medicaid Should Serve the Truly Needy

Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of noise coming from the  other side claiming that House Republicans are cutting Medicaid with  our commonsense work requirements.

Let me be clear: That is just not true.

You can't cut something from someone who was never or is no longer  eligible to receive it.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, of the 7.8  million people Democrats say would lose coverage, 4.8 million are able- bodied adults with no kids who could work, but don't. Another 1.4  million are in the country illegally and 2.2 million simply don't  qualify under the law already.

Medicaid should serve the truly needy, not those who refuse to help  themselves. House Republicans don't cut Medicaid. That is not what we  are doing in this bill. We restore its integrity because work  requirements are not a punishment. They are a path to dignity and  independence.
