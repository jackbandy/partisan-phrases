Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I acknowledge the great work  that our Budget Committee chairman has done to bring us to this point  today. It has taken him hundreds of hours and tested his blood pressure  quite seriously to get us to this point.

Mr. Chair, I rise today in firm support of this resolution.

In November last year, 77 million Americans demanded changes in how  our Federal Government is working for them, particularly changes in the  disastrous policies from the last 4 years. I plan to help deliver on  those demands by fixing how Washington works and implementing President  Trump's agenda to make America first.

This resolution gives us the framework that we need to meet the  demands of those 77 million Americans. Those demands include fixing our  border crisis once and for all. This resolution does that. Those  demands include unleashing American energy. This resolution does that.

Mr. Chair, I urge strong support for this resolution.
