Hurricane Helene

Mr. EDWARDS. 1 year ago, western North Carolina was slammed by the  worst storm to ever hit our region. To many across the country, we  thought that this might have been just another segment on nightly news  programs or an article in our local paper, but for those of us who call  western North Carolina home, it meant so much more.

In our mountain communities, waters crested above 30 feet; winds  peaked at over 100 miles an hour; and 1,500 landslides destroyed  hundreds of homes and many communities. Over 1,300 roads were blocked  by damage and debris. There were 1.2 million citizens left without  power. Mr. Speaker, 108 North Carolinians lost their lives.

Over the last year, our mountain communities have overcome  unimaginable obstacles with grit and determination. I couldn't be  prouder that, as a community, we have come back together, not as  individuals, but as neighbors, friends, and family.

Rebuilding hasn't been easy, but very few things that are worth doing  are easy.

Come Helene or high water, western North Carolina will rebuild. I am  so proud of the resiliency of the people of the mountains.
