Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend the  extraordinary service of the iHeartRadio Asheville team to the people  of Western North Carolina during and after Hurricane Helene.

Under the steady leadership of Brian Hall, and through the tireless  efforts of broadcasters such as Mark Starling, Tank Spencer, Eddie and  Amanda Foxx, and many others, iHeartRadio Asheville became a lifeline  for our mountain communities. Their around-the-clock coverage reunited  families, connected neighbors with life-saving resources, and delivered  accurate, timely updates when our region faced one of its darkest  hours.

Western North Carolina is stronger today because of the courage and  dedication of these broadcasters. Their work is a powerful reminder of  the vital role that local journalism and community-centered  broadcasting play in times of crisis.

On behalf of the people of North Carolina's 11th District, I extend  my deepest gratitude to iHeartRadio Asheville for being a steady voice  of truth, comfort, and resilience when our communities needed it most.
