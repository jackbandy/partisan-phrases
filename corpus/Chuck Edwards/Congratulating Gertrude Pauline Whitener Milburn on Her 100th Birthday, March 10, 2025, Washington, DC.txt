Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Gertrude  Pauline Whitener Milburn on turning 100 years old later this week on  March 14th.

Gertrude Pauline Whitener Milburn was born on March 14, 1925, and  grew up in a small textile community known as Brookford, located in  Hickory, North Carolina She had two brothers and a sister.

Gertrude met Bill Milburn while he was serving in the Navy during  World War II, and they married in December 1945 after his discharge.  They had two children, Patricia Milburn Link and Randolph Lee Milburn,  and lived in Lincolnton, North Carolina, until 1967, when they moved to  Lake Norman.

Gertrude spent her entire career in the textile industry. She is the  proud grandmother of four, with ten great-grandchildren and five great- great-grandchildren. She is not shy to be blunt and share her many  years of wisdom with the younger generations.

On behalf of all of Western North Carolina, I congratulate Gertrude.
