Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Sheriff's  Office and Emergency Medical Services of Clay County.

On September 27, 2024, Hurricane Helene slammed into Western North  Carolina, leaving a trail of devastation and destruction. While Clay  County was largely spared from the storm's most severe effects, its  first responders did not return to business as usual the following day.  Instead, the Clay County Sheriff's Office and Emergency Medical  Services immediately sprang into action to assist counties in desperate  need.

This spirit of service is what makes Western North Carolina truly  special. It is exemplified by neighbors showing up in times of crisis,  ready to lend a helping hand and stand together during the darkest of  days. The Clay County Sheriff's Office deployed officers and resources  to Haywood, Buncombe, Avery, and Mitchell counties, providing critical  manpower and support to these Helene-affected areas. At the same time,  Clay County Emergency Medical Services coordinated efforts to deliver  much-needed medical personnel and essential supplies to communities in  need.

The Clay County Sheriff's Office and Emergency Medical Services were  flooded with donated supplies from area churches, local businesses, and  citizens. Once transported to the affected areas, these supplies were  received by first responders with great relief and deep appreciation.  Let it be recognized and remembered that, in a time of great need, Clay  County stood tall--not only for its own residents, but for its  neighbors across the region.
