C-Span Goes Streaming

Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud YouTube TV and Hulu +  Live TV for expanding public access to Congress by carrying C-SPAN, C- SPAN2, and C-SPAN3 beginning next week.

For 46 years, C-SPAN's respected nonprofit service has offered  Americans unfiltered, gavel-to-gavel coverage of their government in  action. However, millions of streaming households were left without  this vital window into the debates and decisions which shape our  Nation.

By adding the C-SPAN networks, YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV are  making a strong and, I hope, enduring commitment to public service,  transparency, and civic engagement. They now join cable and satellite  providers like Comcast, Charter, Cox, DirecTV, and Dish in supporting a  treasured service that strengthens accountability and confidence in our  democratic systems.

This is a big win for the American people. Full access will help  inform the public, no matter how they choose to watch.

Mr. Speaker, I thank YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV for their  important decision.
