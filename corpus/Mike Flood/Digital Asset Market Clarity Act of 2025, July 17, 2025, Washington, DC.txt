Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. It has been a longer wait  than expected, but I am excited that the CLARITY Act has finally made  it to the House floor for debate.

The CLARITY Act is not just about digital assets like bitcoin. This  bill will usher in a new age of blockchain innovation that will go well  beyond the tokens that we know well today.

Chris Dixon's book titled: ``Read Write Own'' talks about a future  where blockchain technology enables a new generation of the internet  which he terms ``Web 3.0.''

Technologies like NFTs can be used as tickets to events, identity  verification tools, and serve other real-world uses that will change  our digital economy.

I urge my colleagues to see the bigger picture. The vote today is not  just about cryptocurrency as we know it. It is about enabling the next  generation of innovation enabled by blockchain.

This is a good, bipartisan product that builds on years of work from  Chairman Hill, Subcommittee Chairman Steil, the Financial Services  Committee, and the Agriculture Committee.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
