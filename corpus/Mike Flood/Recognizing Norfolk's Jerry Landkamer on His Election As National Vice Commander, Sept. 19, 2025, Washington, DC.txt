Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a true pillar of  the Norfolk community, Jerry Landkamer, on his recent election as one  of five National Vice Commanders of the American Legion.

A proud Legionnaire since 1975, Landkamer has been a cornerstone of  Post 16 in Norfolk. He has served at every level--post, county,  district, and area--with unmatched dedication to representing our  veteran community.

From legislative advocacy in Washington to youth programs like  Cornhusker Boys State, Landkamer's commitment to service has never  wavered.

His work on national committees including--Americanism, Homeland  Security, and Veterans Preference--demonstrates his steadfast  commitment to our veterans and Nation.

Jerry Landkamer embodies the very spirit and service of the American  Legion. I'm honored to recognize his election to National Vice  Commander and know his family and community share in the same pride of  this well-earned achievement.
