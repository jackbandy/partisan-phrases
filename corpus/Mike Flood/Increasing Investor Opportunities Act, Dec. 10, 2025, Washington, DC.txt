Increasing Investor Opportunities Act

Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Chair, I strongly support the INVEST Act, and I  commend Congresswoman Ann Wagner and Congressman  Greg Meeks for their  hard work on this bipartisan project. This is how Congress is supposed  to work.

The INVEST Act will expand access to capital for startups and small  businesses, create new pathways for retail investors, and provide  greater opportunity to more Americans. One bill in this package I will  highlight is the Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act, a bill I lead  with Congressman Cleo Fields, Congresswoman Sarah McBride, and  Congressman Mike Lawler.

The Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act would expand the  accredited investor definition to include individuals that are  certified through an exam written by the SEC and administered by FINRA.  Accredited investors are individuals that are allowed to participate in  investment opportunities that are not generally available to the  broader public, like private offerings.

Most current pathways to become an accredited investor are based upon  wealth and income. This bill opens up a new pathway, allowing for  investors' knowledge to be the determining factor in whether they are  able to become an accredited investor.

Mr. FLOOD. The examination created by this bill is meant to strike a  balance between rigorously testing for sophistication and not being set  to such a difficult standard that even an intelligent investor could  not pass it.

Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the INVEST Act.
