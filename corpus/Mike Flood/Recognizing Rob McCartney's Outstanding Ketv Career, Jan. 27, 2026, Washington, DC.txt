Recognizing Rob McCartney's Outstanding Ketv Career


Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize a key figure of  Nebraska journalism and cornerstone of KETV's newsroom, Rob McCartney.

Over 40 years covering the Nebraska-Iowa area, Rob became a trusted,  reliable voice for generations of Nebraskans. After 33 years at KETV,  Rob's impact on our state's media landscape is nothing short of  significant.

The breadth of Rob's career was reaffirmed when he recently accepted  the Nebraska Broadcasters Association's award for Best Election  Coverage on behalf of KETV.

Whether reporting on our Huskers, traveling with the Nebraska  National Guard overseas, or sharing the inspiring recovery of an Omaha  police officer, Rob's dedication to journalism built an incredible  legacy.

While his final broadcast was a bittersweet moment for Nebraska, the  broadcast journalist who guided us through triumphs and trials finally  now has more time with his family. I congratulate Rob on an  extraordinary career. Happy retirement.
