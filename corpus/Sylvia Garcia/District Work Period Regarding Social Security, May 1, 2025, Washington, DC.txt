District Work Period Regarding Social Security


Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, during this past district work  period, I met with seniors across my district who are worried about  losing the lifelines they depend on: Social Security, Medicaid, and  Medicare.

At one event with our seniors, a Social Security worker told us that  wait times are exploding. He said that staff are being watched and  pushed to quit every single day. In some cities, offices are even  closing.

These are the people who make sure the checks that our seniors depend  on go out. Trump and Elon Musk want them to quit.

The Social Security worker told us he felt that he had failed the  American people. Let's be clear: He didn't fail us. The Republicans  did.

That is why I have been out there raising the alarm. Seniors and  their families deserve what is coming. Seniors built this country. They  paid in, showed up, and earned these benefits.

If Republicans think they can slash these lifelines without a fight,  they are dead wrong. We put seniors over billionaires.
