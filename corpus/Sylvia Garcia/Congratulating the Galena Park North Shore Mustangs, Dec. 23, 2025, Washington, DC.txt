Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Galena Park North Shore Mustangs on winning the UIL Class 6A Division I  State Championship on December 20, 2025, an extraordinary achievement  for Texas's 29th Congressional District.

On the biggest stage in Texas high school football, the Mustangs  earned a state championship through discipline, preparation, and belief  in one another. This victory marks the program's sixth state title and  a return to the top, reaffirming North Shore's tradition of excellence.

This championship reflects months of hard work, and a season defined  by focus and resilience. It is a testament to the commitment of these  student-athletes and the pride they bring to their school and  community.

The Galena Park North Shore Mustangs have once again given Texas 29 a  moment to celebrate. Their achievement will be remembered not only for  the title itself, but for what it represents about teamwork,  perseverance, and community pride.
