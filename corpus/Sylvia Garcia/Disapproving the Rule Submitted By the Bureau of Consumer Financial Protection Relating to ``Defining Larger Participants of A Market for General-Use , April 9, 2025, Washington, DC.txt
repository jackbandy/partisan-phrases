Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding me time.

Mr. Speaker, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, known as CFPB,  was created for one reason: to protect everyday people from getting  ripped off, especially when tech companies start acting like banks.

If a tech company wants to be trusted with your money, it should play  by the same rules as any bank. That is what the CFPB was doing. It was  making sure the rules apply to everyone.

Yet, Elon Musk doesn't want to follow the rules. He wants to turn X,  formerly known as Twitter, into a payment platform without any  accountability and no rules. If you get scammed, that is too bad. No  refunds, nothing, nada.

The people who will get hurt are those people like in my district who  I represent: young people, working families, and folks just starting to  save for the future. We are fighting to protect them because the CFPB  isn't just a watchdog. It is a lifeline.

We are not going to stand by while Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and their  billionaire buddies try to kill it.
