Providing Security and Path to Citizenship for Dreamers

Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for Dreamers, young  people brought to this country as children through no fault of their  own.

Dreamers grew up in our schools, played with our children, pledged  allegiance to our flag, and made our country, every single day,  strengthened in every way. They are doctors, teachers, lawyers,  essential workers, and businessowners. They pay taxes.

They keep the American Dream alive, but they still live a life in  limbo.

Imagine building a life here only to be told to leave for a country  you don't even remember, much less sometimes even speak the language.  Even the President agrees that it is not fair.

Congress must act. More than 70 percent of Americans agree Dreamers  deserve citizenship.

That is why, yesterday, I reintroduced the bipartisan American Dream  and Promise Act to give Dreamers the security they deserve and a real  path to citizenship.

Over 200 Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle joined me  in doing that, along with over 100 organizations from across America  representing all sectors of our economy.

Our message is clear to Dreamers: Their home is here. We will fight  for them.

``Si, se puede''; ``Yes, we can.''
