Happy Pride Month

Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish everyone a  joyful and proud Pride Month.

In Houston, pride runs deep. We hosted one of the first nighttime  parades in the country, and today it is the fourth largest in the  Nation. It is not just a parade.

Groups like Fundacion Latinoamericana De Accion Social, Legacy  Community Health, and the Montrose Center are doing the work every day  making sure that our LGBTQIA+ neighbors have care, housing, community,  and support. That is what we should be focused on. There is so much  good that we can be doing.

Instead, my Republican colleagues are using their power to bully and  target trans kids, children who just want to be safe, make friends, and  be themselves. Those kids show more bravery than many of my colleagues  here in this Chamber. We should all learn from them.

Every young person watching should know I see them, I hear them, and  I will fight for them today and every day because in Texas when we say  ``all,'' that means all.
