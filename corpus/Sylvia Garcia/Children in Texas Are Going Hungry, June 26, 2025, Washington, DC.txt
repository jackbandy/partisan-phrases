Children in Texas Are Going Hungry

Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because there are  children in Texas going hungry, and Governor Greg Abbott just made it  worse.

This week, he vetoed $60 million in State spending for a summer food  program that would have helped feed children while school was out. With  that one decision, he turned his back on our most vulnerable kids and  walked away from $450 million in Federal funding that could have helped  struggling families across Texas.

Texas has the second-highest rate of food insecurity in the Nation.  One in four children in our State face hunger. That is 25 percent of  our children.

Let's be clear: How can you claim to be pro-life and then just let  children starve?

To paraphrase Matthew: For I was hungry and you gave me something to  eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink.

Our job is simple: Take care of our kids, feed the hungry, and lift  up the families who need us most. I will never stop fighting for them,  and I will always put people over politics.
