Fighting to Guarantee Equal Rights for All Women Under the Constitution

Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, yes, that is me in 1977. I was a  young law student representing Texas at the historic International  Women's Year conference in Houston.

Ann Richards was right behind me. She was getting ready to make a  speech on the ERA. She would go on to be Governor, and I went on to  serve in the city, county, State, and now here in Federal Government.

That day, we were doing what I am doing right now: fighting for the  equal rights amendment, fighting to guarantee equal rights for all  women under the Constitution.

I still have the ERA pin I wore that day. I have kept it for nearly  50 years because the fight isn't over.

This week, I stood with powerful women in Congress to introduce a  resolution that removes our final barrier: the arbitrary deadline set  decades ago. If it passes, the ERA becomes the 28th Amendment.

We must pass this resolution. We must remove all barriers to women  because our rights don't have deadlines. Our rights are human rights.
