Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the  following proclamation recognizing Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I,  Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome.

Whereas, on September 15, we will welcome His All-Holiness       Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, Archbishop of       Constantinople-New Rome to Washington, D.C., to receive the       Templeton Prize, the world's most prestigious award in       Religion and Science;

Whereas, His All-Holiness is the spiritual leader and       Primus inter pares (``Fast among Equals'') of Orthodox       Christianity worldwide--a Church of 30 million individuals--      and is the longest-serving Archbishop of Constantinople;

Whereas, in 1997, His All-Holiness was awarded the       Congressional Gold Medal and declared that pollution,       deforestation, and climate change, among other acts harmful       to the environment, should be considered ``ecological sin''       and moral failings, as opposed to merely practical missteps;

Whereas, he has worked to guide the Orthodox Christian       Church in an environmentally conscious and Godly way, helping       to develop a strong community of faith, and has presided over       events including the 150th anniversary of the Theological       School of Halki and the 500th anniversary of the Greek       Orthodox Community in Venice, among others;

Whereas, he has visited the United States during the       Clinton (1997), Bush (2004), Obama (2009) and Biden (2021)       administrations;

Whereas, His All-Holiness was elected in October 1991 as       the 270th Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome and       Ecumenical Patriarch, and has served for nearly 34 years;

Whereas, His All-Holiness has authored four books in       English and has been invited to speak before the United       Nations, the European Union, UNESCO, and the World Economic       Forum; and

Now, therefore be it resolved, that I Robin L. Kelly,       serving as a member of the House of Representatives,       recognize and honor the remarkable work and accomplishments       of His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I,       Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome.
