American Families Will Pay for Republican Tax Cut


Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, just 2 days  ago, my Republican colleagues jammed through a budget plan that puts  the 0.1 percent above hardworking Americans.

The Republican budget would give $4.5 trillion to CEOs and big  corporations.

Who pays for the tax cuts? American families just trying to make ends  meet.

The Republican budget cuts at least $880 billion from Medicaid. It  doesn't matter whether someone is a Democrat, a Republican, an  Independent, or a nonvoter. Americans across the country will either  lose healthcare or see their premiums increase.

All the Federal workers that Elon Musk and DOGE decided to fire for  no justifiable reason will also lose their healthcare.

Republicans represent millions and millions of Americans who rely on  Medicaid and CHIP, and none of them, not a single one, voted with these  constituents in mind.
