Medical Bills Are Too High


Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust to urge my colleagues  across the aisle to extend the ACA tax credits.

As you know, they are set to expire at the end of the year and will  cause monthly health bills to skyrocket for millions of Americans. The  rising cost of healthcare goes beyond the individual. It affects Black  small business owners.

A small business owner in my district owns several coffee shops and  worries about her employees being able to afford healthcare. She feels  responsible for her employees, but healthcare is a large expense for a  small business. The ACA premium tax credits provide affordable care to  her employees, allowing her coffee shop and her employees to thrive.

Another small business owner in my district runs a wine production  business that sells nationwide. Despite her success, she has to rely on  her husband's job for healthcare. These are two small business owners  who have created their own success, and through their businesses  created jobs for other people.

Republicans love to say they support our economy. It is time to  actually support the healthcare of small business owners, who are the  backbone of our economy. Republicans also love to say the best option  for healthcare is a job.

My constituents have a job. They also provide jobs for more people,  but they all receive affordable healthcare through the ACA. Without the  ACA tax credits, their employees may have no other option but to go  uninsured or find another job. If they decide to leave, my  constituents' businesses won't be able to run.

It is simple: We all do better when we all do better. We are all  healthier when we are all healthier. Let's extend the ACA premium tax  credits. Let's make healthcare more affordable and accessible.
