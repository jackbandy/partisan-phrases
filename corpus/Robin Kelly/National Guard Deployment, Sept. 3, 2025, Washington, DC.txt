National Guard Deployment


Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defiance of  President Trump's threats to deploy the National Guard to Chicago.

He wasted $1 million every day to house the National Guard in D.C.,  and now he wants to further misuse taxpayer dollars instead of  investing in real, permanent solutions to gun violence. Like D.C., I am  sure Chicago can use money for more police, mental health counselors,  social workers, and community violence intervention programs.

President Trump is actively making gun violence worse. He froze  funding allocated to community violence intervention organizations,  shut down the Office of Violence Prevention, and made it easier to buy  guns.

Gun violence is a public health issue, but the CDC has been stripped  of medical experts and leaders.

Let's be truthful about the real reason why President Trump wants to  deploy the National Guard to Chicago. It is not to reduce crime. It is  to instill fear and abuse his power.
