Mr. BRESNAHAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Chair, today I rise on my amendment to H.R. 2483, the SUPPORT for  Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025. Opioids, like  fentanyl, are incredibly dangerous. Last year, our Nation lost just  over 80,000 people to drug overdoses. That is 220 per day. In my home  State of Pennsylvania, someone dies of a drug overdose every 2 hours.

As we work to stop these dangerous drugs from entering the country,  it is important we make available the necessary resources to reverse  opioid overdoses as they happen. Emergency opioid overdose reversal  drugs are a lifeline, having the ability to save so many lives.  Currently, HHS regulations refer to certain name brand drugs, such as  Narcan, which can limit usage of other versions that may be more  readily available.

My amendment would require HHS regulations or guidance documents to  include any opioid overdose reversal drug approved by the FDA when  referring to these emergency drugs. This will expand and ensure better  access to these lifesaving drugs.

I lost my 16-year-old cousin to a drug overdose. It is incredibly  important to me that we are not limiting access to these resources.

By adjusting current regulations and language, we are protecting our  children, our families, and our communities. I encourage my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to save lives and support this amendment.

Mr. BRESNAHAN. Mr. Chair, in closing, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
