Protect America's Workforce Act

Mr. BRESNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not just in support of H.R.  2550, but in support of the right to collectively bargain. This is not  a policy idea. It is a lifeline that ensures fair wages, safe  workplaces, and the basic dignity that every worker deserves.

Unions like AFGE, Laborers, and IBEW stand on the front lines  defending the American Federal workforce.

AFGE represents Federal workers and, in my district, there are 10,000  of them. These men and women care for veterans, help seniors receive  timely Social Security payments, and serve as correctional officers at  Canaan prison, just to name a few.

When their collective bargaining rights are stripped, they are left  without the stability, fairness, and respect they deserve.

Likewise, the Laborers Union, who built and maintained the  infrastructure this country runs on; and the IBEW, who work in  dangerous conditions at military bases and power plants, depend on  these rights to ensure proper training and enforce a safety protocol  that prevents accidents and saves lives.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to help bring the Protect America's Workforce  Act to the floor today, and I look forward to its passage.
