Recognizing Lehigh Valley Hospital-Dickson City


Mr. BRESNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible  response to the fire at Lehigh Hospital-Dickson City last Wednesday  night.

Thanks to the quick action of hospital staff and first responders,  every patient and staff member was safely evacuated and relocated, many  to nearby hospitals, including Regional Hospital of Scranton, Wilkes- Barre General, Geisinger CMC, and Geisinger Wyoming Valley.

What could have been a devastating crisis instead showed the best of  northeastern Pennsylvania. First responders and hospital teams from  across the region stayed calm, worked together, and made sure every  patient was safe.

Our team monitored the situation from the district and our  congressional office throughout the night, staying in constant contact  with the White House, CMS, hospital leadership, State officials, and  local responders to make sure that everyone had the support they  needed.

As Lehigh Valley-Dickson City begins to recover, my office will  continue working alongside hospital leadership and local partners,  providing any help needed to get the facility back on its feet.

This is what NEPA does. We look out for our neighbors, and we take  care of one another.
