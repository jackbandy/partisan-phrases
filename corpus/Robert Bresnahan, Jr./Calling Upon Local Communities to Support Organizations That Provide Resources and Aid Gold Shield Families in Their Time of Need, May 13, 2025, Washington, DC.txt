Calling Upon Local Communities to Support Organizations That Provide Resources and Aid Gold Shield Families in Their Time of Need


Mr. BRESNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud support of H. Res.  364, recognizing the Gold Shield families resolution. I thank my  colleague, Congressman Meuser, for his leadership in reintroducing this  important measure.

Mr. Speaker, this resolution honors the families of fallen first  responders, those who paid the ultimate price while protecting and  serving our communities.

These families, often referred to as the Gold Shield families, carry  an unthinkable burden of loss. It is our duty not just as lawmakers but  as fellow citizens to ensure that their sacrifice is never forgotten  and see that their families are taken care of after they are gone.

An astounding example of this mission and inspiration for the  resolution is right in my congressional district. Camp Freedom in  Carbondale, Pennsylvania, provides meaningful outdoor adventures that  promote healing for disabled veterans, first responders, and their  families, including the families of the fallen.

By passing H. Res. 364, we send a clear message that the sacrifices  of these families do not go unnoticed. We acknowledge that behind every  fallen officer, firefighter, or EMT is a family--spouse, children, and  parents--who bear the weight of that loss every day, yet continue to  honor their loved one's legacy through quiet strength and enduring  service to their communities.

This resolution sends a clear message: We recognize them. We honor  their sacrifice, and we stand with them.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing H. Res. 364,  making it the first step in broader efforts to support Gold Shield  families through both our words and our actions.
