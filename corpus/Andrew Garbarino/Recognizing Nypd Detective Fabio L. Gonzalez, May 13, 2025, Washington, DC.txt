Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent,  NYPD Detective Fabio L. Gonzalez of Babylon, New York on the occasion  of his recognition with an Honorable Mention in the 2025 TOP COPS  Awards from the National Association of Police Organizations. Detective  Gonzalez has distinguished himself as an exemplary member of the New  York City Police Department, having been recognized for meritorious and  excellent service to the City of New York 16 times since joining the  department in July 2011.

On July 4, 2024, in Jamaica, Queens, Detective Gonzalez and Officer  Patrick E. Lynch responded to a call for assistance after a woman had  been stabbed. Upon entering the apartment, they encountered the suspect  holding a knife to his father's neck. After repeated commands in both  English and Spanish were ignored and the suspect began to cut his  father's throat, Officer Lynch fired at the suspect, striking him once,  saving the father's life. Detective Gonzalez and Officer Lynch then  discovered the near-lifeless body of an eight-year-old child and,  recognizing the urgency of the moment, rushed the child to Jamaica  Hospital in their patrol vehicle. Tragically, despite their heroic  efforts, the child did not survive.

Mr. Speaker, Detective Gonzalez demonstrated extraordinary courage,  composure, and selflessness in the face of life-threatening danger. It  is my great honor to recognize him for his bravery and to commend him  on receiving this well-deserved award. I wish Detective Gonzalez  continued success and safety in his distinguished service to the people  of New York, and I extend my deepest gratitude for his unwavering  dedication.
