https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696768/department-of-homeland-security-vehicular-terrorism-prevention-and-mitigation-act-of-2025


Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1608) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to  produce a report on emerging threats and countermeasures related to  vehicular terrorism, and for other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1608

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland       Security Vehicular Terrorism Prevention and Mitigation Act of       2025''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) On January 1, 2025, a devastating vehicular terrorist       attack occurred on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana,       when an assailant inspired by the Islamic State drove a       vehicle into a crowd and engaged in a shootout with law       enforcement. This tragic incident resulted in the loss of 14       lives and injuries to at least thirty-five others, including       two police officers.

(2) Vehicle-ramming attacks and other vehicular terrorist       incidents represent an enduring and evolving threat to public       safety in the United States and around the world, targeting       innocent civilians and first responders.

(3) These attacks, carried out by both organized terrorist       groups and individual actors, often aim to exploit high-      density public gatherings, critical infrastructure, and key       transportation hubs, causing mass casualties and widespread       disruption.

(4) Emerging automotive technologies, such as autonomous       vehicles, Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)       capabilities, and ride-sharing platforms, create new       vulnerabilities that could be leveraged by malicious actors       to conduct sophisticated vehicle-based attacks.

(5) The Department of Homeland Security, through agencies       like the Transportation Security Administration and the       Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, plays a       vital role in detecting, assessing, and mitigating the risks       associated with vehicle-based threats.

(6) Strengthened coordination between Federal, State,       local, Tribal, territorial, and private sector stakeholders       is essential to enhance prevention, preparedness, and       response efforts, ensuring the safety of communities across       the nation.

Mr. GARBARINO.  1608.

Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1608, the Department  of Homeland Security Vehicular Terrorism Prevention and Mitigation Act  of 2025.

Following the vehicular terrorism incident in New Orleans on New  Year's Day and as the U.S. prepares to host several major sporting  events starting next year, it is more important than ever that the  Department of Homeland Security take a leading role in addressing the  threat of vehicular terrorism.

This legislation will require DHS to conduct a comprehensive  assessment of emerging threats and potential countermeasures.

Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gimenez).

Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. In closing,  I, again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1608, and I yield back the  balance of my time.

Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
