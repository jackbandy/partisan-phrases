Mr. GARBARINO.  5078.

Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5078, the Protecting  Information by Local Leaders for Agency Resilience Act, also known as  the PILLAR Act.

Madam Speaker, I first thank Congressman Ogles for his leadership in  bringing forward this bipartisan bill.

Cybersecurity is often discussed in the context of national systems,  but the truth is that many of the most disruptive incidents occur in  our own communities.

In recent years, local governments across the country have  experienced attacks that shut down city services, delayed school  operations, locked police and court records, and forced jurisdictions  of all sizes to spend significant funds on recovery. These events may  not always make national headlines, but they have real consequences for  families, businesses, and public safety.

Some of these attacks come from criminal ransomware groups, while  others originate from foreign adversaries that seek to test the  resilience of American communities. The Committee on Homeland Security  has monitored these trends closely.

A recent cyber-threat snapshot shows that the majority of States have  experienced significant cyber incidents at the local level this year,  and many of those incidents targeted smaller jurisdictions that have  limited staff, outdated systems, and fewer resources to defend  themselves.

Finally, this bill is the product of bipartisan work. It passed  through the Committee on Homeland Security with support from Members  across the political spectrum. I especially thank Representatives  Swalwell and Evans for their work alongside myself and Congressman  Ogles to advance this important legislation. That cooperation reflects  a shared recognition that cybersecurity cannot be approached through a  partisan lens.

By passing the PILLAR Act, the House can reaffirm its commitment to  our State, local, Tribal, and territorial partners. When our  communities are more secure, our entire Nation is more secure.

I thank Congressman Ogles, again, for his leadership in bringing  forward this bipartisan bill.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5078, and I  reserve the balance of my time

Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles).

Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I, again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5078, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
