Protecting Our Nation's Capital Emergency Act


Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R.  2096, the Protecting Our Nation's Capital Emergency Act.

Washington, D.C., is facing a public safety crisis. Last month alone,  20 people were shot and killed in the District of Columbia. In recent  years, D.C. was rated the fifth deadliest city in America.

At the core of the problem is a dangerously understaffed police force  brought about by reckless policies. Law enforcement in D.C. has been  left without basic bargaining rights or procedural protections,  something my colleagues on the other side usually support, but for some  reason here they are against it.

This guts MPD's ability to recruit, retain, and respond. The result  is consistently high crime rates and a staffing shortfall of about 800  officers that puts both police and residents at risk. I mean, I don't  know if people forget, just under 2 years ago, one of our own  colleagues was mugged at gunpoint several blocks from the Capitol. That  might not have happened if we weren't understaffed by about 800  officers in Washington, D.C.

When we undermine law enforcement, we embolden the criminals.  Congress has a constitutional duty to ensure the MPD can effectively  combat crime and keep Washingtonians safe. This legislation restores  fairness and support for the men and women who risk their lives to keep  our capital secure. If Washington, D.C., won't fix this problem, it is  our job to.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill and send a clear message:  We stand with law enforcement and will not allow D.C. to spiral further  into lawlessness.
