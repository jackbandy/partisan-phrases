Mrs. HOUCHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of National  Small Business Week, a time to recognize the hardworking men and women  who are the engines of our economy.

As a former small business owner myself, I know the long hours,  risks, and deep sense of responsibility that come with signing both  sides of a paycheck. Small businesses are more than storefronts. They  are job creators, community anchors, and the heart of America.

In Indiana's Ninth District, small businesses like Lincks Clothing  and Shoes, Brownstown Electric, and Lischkge Motors are strengthening  our communities one investment, one hire, and one customer at a time.

That is why I am committed to cutting government red tape, lowering  taxes, and fighting for progrowth policies that empower our  entrepreneurs to thrive, not just survive.

Madam Speaker, I thank every small business owner out there for all  they do. This week and every week, I am here for them.
