https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698931/recognizing-indiana-university-football-team


Mrs. HOUCHIN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in recognition of the 15-0  Indiana University football team for their historic season, winning the  Rose Bowl, then the Peach Bowl, and now advancing to the College  Football Playoff National Championship.

This team rose to the occasion when few expected it. Without a roster  full of five-star recruits, they were often underestimated, but they  responded again and again with discipline and toughness. Week after  week, they proved that hard work and preparation still matter.

Under the leadership of Coach Curt Cignetti, this team has put  Indiana football on the map. A perfect regular season, a Big Ten  Championship victory over Ohio State for the program's first conference  title since 1967, and Indiana's first Heisman Trophy reflect what can  be accomplished when a team fully commits to the standard set before  them.

On behalf of Indiana's Ninth District, the home of our Indiana  University Hoosiers, I commend Coach Cignetti, quarterback Fernando  Mendoza, and players on the team like Charlie Becker, D'Angelo Ponds,  Pat Coogan, Elijah  Sarratt, and the entire Indiana football program for the achievement  that has made our State so proud.

I am rooting for the Indiana Hoosiers in the national championship  this weekend. I hope they bring it home from Miami, and I have no doubt  they will.

As Coach Cignetti has said himself: This would make one heck of a  movie.

Good luck to the Hoosiers on Monday.           Congratulating Indiana State Fair Queen Presley Hampton

Mrs. HOUCHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Presley  Hampton of Jackson County on being named the Indiana State Fair Queen.

Presley represents the very best of Indiana. She has shown dedication  to agriculture, leadership in her community, and a strong work ethic  that reflects the values so many young people across our State are  raised with.

The Indiana State Fair is more than a tradition. It is a celebration  of farming, youth leadership, and the families who work every day to  feed our country. Presley's achievements highlight the importance of  programs like 4-H and FFA that prepare young leaders for the future.

I know Presley will represent Indiana with integrity and pride. I  congratulate her family, mentors, and everyone who helped support her  along the way.

Southern Indiana is immensely proud of Presley, and we wish her all  the best as she takes on this role.                       Recognizing Starlight Distillery

Mrs. HOUCHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Starlight  Distillery, an outstanding family-owned business in southern Indiana.

Operated by the seventh generation of the Huber family, Starlight  earned global recognition when its Japanese Mizunara Reserve finished  bourbon was named the best overall bourbon at the San Francisco World  Spirits Competition.

That is right, Kentucky, Indiana's bourbon is the world's best.

This prestigious award reflects the family's dedication to hard work  and a commitment to quality that has guided their business for  generations.

Starlight is more than just a distillery. It has put southern Indiana  on the map. The Huber family has built a business that supports local  agriculture, creates jobs, and showcases what family-run enterprises in  rural Indiana can achieve on the world stage.

I am proud to represent the Huber family and the many hardworking  people behind Starlight Distillery. Their success is a testament to the  strength of family businesses and the communities that support them.
