Ms. GILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Nassau County  Police Department on 100 years of brave and honorable service to the  communities across New York's Fourth Congressional District.

As the proud Representative of this district, I am honored to  represent the more than 2,000 dedicated officers who put their lives on  the line every day for the 1.3 million residents of Nassau County.

In 1925, the NCPD was established with just 55 patrolmen. In the  century since, the department has grown into one of the most respected  and well-trained law enforcement agencies in America.

Today, Nassau County law enforcement officers stand as a symbol of  strength, courage, and service to Long Island.

I also recognize the brave NCPD officers who have given all in the  line of duty. They will not be forgotten.

As we look ahead to the next 100 years of the NCPD, I will continue  to work with Commissioner Ryder and our local partners to ensure that  officers have the resources they need and the training they need to  keep Long Islanders safe.

I am proud to stand alongside Nassau County Police Department and  congratulate them on 100 years of serving our community.
