Eliminate the Salt Cap


Ms. GILLEN. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to address the unfair double  taxation that my constituents are facing due to the State and local tax  deduction cap.

Hardworking families across Long Island and across our State and many  other States already face some of the highest tax burdens in the  Nation. For 8 years, they have been unfairly penalized and subject to  double taxation.

I have heard from countless hardworking families in my district over  the past few years who have had to pay tens of thousands of dollars  more in taxes, making their lives even more expensive and adding to the  cost-of-living crisis on Long Island.

Last year, the President came to my district and vowed to get SALT  back. My constituents deserve this real relief; so let's go.

I will continue to push for a full repeal of this cap, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. Anything less  than eliminating the SALT cap and restoring the full deduction fails  Long Island and fails our State.
