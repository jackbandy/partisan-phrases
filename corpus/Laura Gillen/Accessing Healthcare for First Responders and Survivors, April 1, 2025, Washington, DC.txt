Accessing Healthcare for First Responders and Survivors

Ms. GILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of representing  thousands of 9/11 first responders and survivors who live in New York's  Fourth Congressional District.

For years, they have fought to get access to the healthcare that they  desperately need and unquestionably deserve. They have traveled to  Washington countless times, even those that are sick and dying, to urge  Congress to pass a permanent funding fix for the World Trade Center  Health Program.

These heroes who saw us through one of the darkest days in our  Nation's history have spent two decades begging Congress to act. No one  in the 9/11 community should ever have to worry about accessing the  healthcare that they require.

I was outraged to see this funding excluded from the yearlong  spending bill that was just passed earlier this month. Our first  responders and survivors can't wait for action.

I am proud to help lead the 9/11 Responder and Survivor Health  Funding Correction Act, alongside a bipartisan group of my colleagues,  to right this wrong.

Mr. Speaker, our Nation promised to never forget, but every delay in  funding tells the 9/11 community something different. It is time to  act.
