Ms. GILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride to  congratulate South Side High School's girls' volleyball team on winning  the New York State Class A girls' volleyball championship.

On behalf of Nassau County and New York's Fourth Congressional  District, I want to take this opportunity to commend and celebrate  these young athletes for their dedication, their teamwork, and their  perseverance.

This year's championship marks South Side's second State title in  program history and its first since 1993, a testament to the strong  foundation built by players and coaches over many, many years.

I congratulate the Cyclones on their remarkable victory. They have  made Rockville Centre and New York's Fourth Congressional District very  proud.
