Ms. GILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride to  congratulate the Baldwin High School girls' basketball team on winning  the New York State AA State Championship.

On behalf of New York's Fourth Congressional District, I take this  opportunity to commend and celebrate these young athletes for their  dedication, for their teamwork, for their perseverance, and, quite  frankly, their dominance on the basketball court.

This year's championship marks Baldwin's third State title in school  history, a testament to the strong foundation built by the players, the  coaches, and the administrators, both past and present.

We congratulate the Lady Bruins on their remarkable victory. I know  they will continue to make Nassau County proud.
