Rescission Package

Ms. GILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the cruel rescission  package that passed the House strictly on partisan lines.

Let me be clear: This legislation is a shameful, backwards attempt to  cancel $9.8 billion in funding that had already been passed into law.  It cuts critical investments in lifesaving programs that support  reproductive health and education.

It also slashes funding for the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for  AIDS Relief, also known as PEPFAR. This bipartisan initiative has been  supported by both parties for 20 years.

As a volunteer who stood on the front lines of the AIDS epidemic, I  witnessed firsthand and remember when an HIV diagnosis was tantamount  to a death sentence. However, because of programs like PEPFAR, this is  no longer so.

In fact, since its launch in 2003, PEPFAR has saved 26 million lives  and enabled 8 million babies to be born without HIV infection.

This package also threatens funding to public broadcasting like NPR  and PBS which educate, inform, and enrich the lives of Americans.

The American people have been clear that they want Congress to lower  costs and make life easier for working families. Instead, we are  spending our time threatening health programs and trying to take  ``Sesame Street'' off the air.
