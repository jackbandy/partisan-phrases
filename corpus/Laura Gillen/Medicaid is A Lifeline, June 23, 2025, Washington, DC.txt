Medicaid is A Lifeline


Ms. GILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise the alarm on Senate  Republicans' plan to rip Medicaid from 1.5 million New Yorkers,  including children, seniors, and veterans on Long Island.

Mr. Speaker, Medicaid is not a luxury. It is a lifeline. In Nassau  County, one in four children depend on Medicaid for their healthcare,  and two in three seniors in nursing homes are covered by Medicaid.

Slashing Medicaid means ripping healthcare from the youngest, the  oldest, and the special needs communities, the most vulnerable members  of our community.

Nonpartisan health policy experts, economists, and medical groups,  including Healthcare Association of New York State, have already warned  that the impact of gutting this program will be felt by all, including  those with private insurance.

Every American can expect higher costs and reduced access to care.

Once again, we have been clearly warned: The Medicaid cuts in the  budget bill will have devastating impacts on our healthcare system and  on millions of Americans who depend on it.

I am committed to fighting against these dangerous attempts to attack  Long Islanders' healthcare.
