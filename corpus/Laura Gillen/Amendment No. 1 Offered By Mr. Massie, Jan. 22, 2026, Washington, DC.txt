Ms. GILLEN. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.

Every day, 34 families lose a loved one to a drunk driving crash.  Drunk driving remains the leading cause of death on our highways.  Unfortunately, the problem is getting worse every year, despite  interlock devices.

Far too many Long Island families know the pain of a life cut short.  I know several families who have lost their children to drunk drivers.

Mr. Chair, these tragedies are absolutely preventable, and we know  what a solution is. The bipartisan HALT Drunk Driving Act, which was  passed more than 4 years ago, would require new vehicles to be equipped  with this new technology, and the change will help save more than  10,000 lives each year.

When Transportation Secretary Duffy testified before the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee earlier this year, I asked  him to work with Congress to fully implement this lifesaving law. I am  proud to say that thanks to my questioning, Secretary Duffy publicly  committed to implement this law and help save lives.

Mr. Chair, I am happy to work with the gentlemen on the other side  who are concerned about privacy. Together, we can implement technology  that addresses their privacy concerns.
