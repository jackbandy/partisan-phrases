Ms. GILLEN. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise,  together with my colleagues from the New York delegation, to honor the  memory of former Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy from New York's Fourth  Congressional District.

She was a trailblazer in Congress and a visionary leader who turned  an unimaginable tragedy into a lifelong mission to protect others.

Carolyn was a tireless advocate for the South Shore of Nassau County  on Long Island and a fearless champion in the fight against gun  violence. After the heartbreaking loss of her husband and the injuring  of her son in a horrific shooting, Carolyn could have retreated into  grief, but instead she chose action.

She ran for Congress as a mother, a nurse, and a voice for families  devastated by the senseless scourge of gun violence. Her courage helped  shape the national conversation and inspired a generation of advocates  whose work is saving lives in communities across our country every day.

She also advocated for America's children as a member of the  Education and Workforce Committee, working to fund school lunch  programs. She was also key in drafting the watershed No Child Left  Behind Act in 2001, which aimed to make our schools more accessible for  students with disabilities.

My family, all of us on Long Island, the New York delegation, New  York State, and our Nation mourn her passing. We are praying for her  loved ones and for all the lives who were touched by her decades of  service.

Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join us now in a moment of  silence in memory of the Honorable Carolyn McCarthy.
