Devastating Maternal Healthcare Inequities


Ms. GILLEN. Mr. Speaker, across our country, women of color continue  to experience devastating maternal healthcare inequities. As a proud  mother of four children, I know firsthand how critical access to  quality healthcare is for expectant mothers. However, far too many  women in this country still do not have access to the vital maternal  resources they need to survive and lead to good outcomes for them and  for their babies.

Today, Black women are three times more likely to die from a  pregnancy-related cause than other women. They are also twice as likely  to lose an infant to premature death. These disparities have not  improved for more than 30 years, and that is unacceptable.

That is why I am proud to join the Black Maternal Health Caucus to  work toward reducing maternal mortality and building healthier  communities for Black women and their infants.
