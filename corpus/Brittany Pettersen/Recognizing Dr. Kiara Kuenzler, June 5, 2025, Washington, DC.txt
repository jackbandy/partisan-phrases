Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Kiara  Kuenzler of Denver, Colorado for being named the Nexstar 2025  Remarkable Woman of Denver.

During her 7-year tenure as President and CEO, Dr. Kuenzler  positioned the Jefferson Center for Mental Health as a leading  community provider by expanding access to services and growing the  Center's workforce across the region. Dr. Kuenzler recognized the need  to bring mental health services to people where they were at, so she  created partnerships with schools, medical practices, law enforcement,  and others to facilitate more than 150 outposts for substance use  disorder care. She grew the Center's workforce by over 300 employees  and improved access to treatment for over 25,000 Coloradans in the  Front Range to ensure those in rural communities could access care.

Dr. Kuenzler earned this honor because of her dedication to expanding  mental health care services and her passion for helping people overcome  obstacles in their lives. She'll be remembered as an important part of  the Jefferson Center's legacy.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to congratulate Dr. Kiara Kuenzler for being recognized  as the ``2025 Remarkable Woman of Denver.''
