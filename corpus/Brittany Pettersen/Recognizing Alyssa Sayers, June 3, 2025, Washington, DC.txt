Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alyssa Sayers  for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

Alyssa has overcome many challenges along her journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Alyssa, develop crucial skills and a  work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award  is a testament to Alyssa's hard work, determination, and perseverance  at Three Creeks K-8 and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and  promising future.

It is my honor to congratulate Alyssa Sayers on achieving the Arvada  Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
