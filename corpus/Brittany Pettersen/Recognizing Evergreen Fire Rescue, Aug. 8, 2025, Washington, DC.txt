Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Evergreen Fire/ Rescue for receiving the Mission Lifeline Emergency Medical Service  Gold Award from the American Heart Association for a third consecutive  year.

This prestigious award recognizes agencies with an outstanding  ability to quickly recognize a heart attack or stroke and provide high- quality care. In these high-pressure cardiac situations, timely care  from an EMS team can be the difference between life and death.

Since 2014, Evergreen Fire/Rescue (EFR) has been honored with this  award four times. EFR Chief Dave Montesi attributes the team's success  to their experienced paramedics, most of whom have more than 20 years  of experience in the field. Evergreen's rural geography presents unique  challenges in emergency situations, as the local hospital is located  miles away from most residents. EFR's quick responses consistently make  a real difference when other help isn't always readily available, and  we are grateful for their lifesaving service to our community.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to congratulate Evergreen Fire/Rescue on their 3rd  consecutive Mission Lifeline EMS Gold Award. We thank them for the  exceptional care they provide to the people of Evergreen and the  countless lives they have saved.
