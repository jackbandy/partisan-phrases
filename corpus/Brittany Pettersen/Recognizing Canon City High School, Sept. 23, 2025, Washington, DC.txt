Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Canon City High  School in Canon City, Colorado, for their well-deserved recognition by  the Carnegie Foundation as an innovative school and member of the  Future of High School Network.

Canon City High School has established a model of education that  prioritizes meaningful learning over seat time in the classroom. During  the 2024-2025 school year, 698 students participated in concurrent  enrollment, earning over 10,218 college credit hours, and 243 students  earned industry-recognized credentials in construction management,  welding, engineering, automotive technology, healthcare, food service,  and business software. As an additional requirement of the graduation  process, students must complete an internship with local community  partners to gain practical experience in a career pathway of their  choice. It is these types of programs that set the school apart and  help prepare students to thrive, no matter what they choose to do after  graduation.

As one of only twenty-four schools across the Nation to receive this  recognition, Canon City High School has become a national model of  public education through its commitment to offer concurrent enrollment,  industry-recognized credentials, and work-based learning.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it  is my honor to congratulate this school, staff, administration, and  board members for this accomplishment and thank them for their  commitment to our kids and our community.
