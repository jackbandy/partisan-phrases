Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Foothills  Regional Housing (FRH), who is celebrating their 50th anniversary of  serving as the public housing authority for Jefferson County, Colorado.

First created in the fall of 1975, Foothills Regional Housing has  worked to meet the growing housing needs of Jefferson County by  preserving existing affordable housing units and developing new ones.  In addition to supporting low-income renters by administering over  1,800 vouchers through the Department of Housing and Urban Development,  FRH also supports low-income homeowners through their Emergency Home  Repair Program.

Under the leadership of Executive Director Lori Rosendahl, FRH has  built award-winning new developments like the Ives in Wheat Ridge and  the AVi at Olde Town in Arvada, which have been recognized for their  thoughtful design and emphasis on supporting residents. I look forward  to seeing what the next 50 years will bring for FRH as they continue to  provide critical housing resources for our community.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it  is my honor to congratulate Foothills Regional Housing on their 50th  anniversary and thank them for all they do for our community.
