Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jordan Reil for  earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

Jordan has overcome many challenges along her journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Jordan, develop crucial skills and a  work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award  is a testament to Jordan's hard work, determination, and perseverance  at Jefferson Jr./Sr. High School and is clearly just the beginning of a  bright and promising future.

It is my honor to congratulate Jordan Reil on achieving the Arvada  Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
