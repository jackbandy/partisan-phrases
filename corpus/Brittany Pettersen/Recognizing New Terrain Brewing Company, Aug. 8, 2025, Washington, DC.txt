Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize New Terrain  Brewing Company of Golden, Colorado, for winning a Gold Medal from the  World Beer Cup, designating their Suntrip brew as a world-class beer.

The World Beer Cup, otherwise known as the ``Olympics of Beer,''  evaluates beers from around the world and recognizes the top brewers  and their beers. Founded in 2016, the New Terrain Brewing Company has  strived to be a socially responsible company, contributing to a variety  of volunteering and community fundraising efforts.

Small businesses like New Terrain Brewing Company help drive Golden's  local economy and the economy of our state. For both natives and  members of Golden's thriving tourism industry, New Terrain Brewing  Company provides excellent service and beers, contributing to  Colorado's leadership in producing outstanding craft brews.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to congratulate New Terrain Brewing Company for this  award.
