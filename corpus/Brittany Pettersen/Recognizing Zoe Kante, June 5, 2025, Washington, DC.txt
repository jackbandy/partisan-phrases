Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Zoe Kante for  earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

Zoe has overcome many challenges along her journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Zoe, develop crucial skills and a  work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award  is a testament to Zoe's hard work, determination, and perseverance at  Three Creeks K-8 and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and  promising future.

It is my honor to congratulate Zoe Kante on achieving the Arvada  Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
