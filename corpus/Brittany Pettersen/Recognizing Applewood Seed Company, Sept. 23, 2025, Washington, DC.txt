Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Applewood  Seed Company on their 60th year in business in Colorado.

Since their founding by Gene and Dee Milstein in 1965, the Applewood  Seed Company has served countless local and international customers  including professional growers, landscapers, retailers, and more. Over  the past 60 years, Applewood Seed has emerged as a top flower seed  supplier in the Nation, all while staying true to its roots as an  employee-owned company.

In addition, Applewood Seed has evolved into a company dedicated to  innovation within its field with research and development gardens, an  extensive network of seed growers, and a state-of-the-art seed testing  laboratory. They use new methods and human ingenuity to continue to  create custom seed blends that fit the needs of any customer. As we  continue to build a thriving and sustainable future, we look forward to  having businesses like Applewood Seed at the forefront of our state's  economic success.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it  is my honor to congratulate the Applewood Seed Company on their 60th  anniversary and for their hard work and lasting impact in our  community.
