Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Abel Harris for  earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

Abel has overcome many challenges along his journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Abel, develop crucial skills and a  work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award  is a testament to Abel's hard work, determination, and perseverance at  Drake Middle School and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and  promising future.

It is my honor to congratulate Abel Harris on achieving the Arvada  Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
