Recognizing Fire Chief David Ramos


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Fire Chief  David Ramos of Broomfield, Colorado, on his retirement after 41 years  of service with the North Metro Fire Rescue District.

Chief Ramos joined the North Metro Fire Rescue District in 1984, and  his many years of exemplary service earned him the position of Fire  Chief. While in this position of leadership, he did a commendable job  modernizing and expanding North Metro Fire, and he improved  collaboration for emergency services in surrounding communities.

Chief Ramos honorably served this community for decades through  numerous challenges, and he has been widely regarded as a mentor and a  friend to many. Throughout his career, he was a visionary leader who  always put people first, and his lifesaving leadership across Colorado  will not be forgotten.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it  is my honor to congratulate Fire Chief David Ramos for his more than  four decades of service with the North Metro Fire Rescue District and  sincerely thank him for his contributions to the Colorado community.
