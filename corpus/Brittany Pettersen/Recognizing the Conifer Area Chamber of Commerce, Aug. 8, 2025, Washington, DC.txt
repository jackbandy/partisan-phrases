Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the Conifer Area Chamber of Commerce.

The Conifer Area Chamber of Commerce is a crucial support system for  businesses and the community of Conifer, offering workshops on  marketing, managing finances, and other economic opportunities for  residents. In addition, the Chamber connects local small businesses and  non-profits with the resources to grow their organizations, support  staff development, and connect with new customers and members.

Under President Beth Schneider and the board's leadership, the  Chamber has hosted a variety of events, which bring the community  closer together and has paved the way for the town to foster a thriving  economy.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to congratulate the Conifer Area of Commerce for 50  years of service and thank them for their contribution to our  community.
