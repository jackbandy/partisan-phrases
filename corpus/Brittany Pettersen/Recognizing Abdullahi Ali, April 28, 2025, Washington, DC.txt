Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Abdullahi Ali  for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

Abdullahi has overcome many challenges along his journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Abdullahi, develop crucial skills and  a work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This  award is a testament to Abdullahi's hard work, determination, and  perseverance at Jefferson Jr./Sr. High School and is clearly just the  beginning of a bright and promising future.

It is my honor to congratulate Abdullahi Ali on achieving the Arvada  Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
