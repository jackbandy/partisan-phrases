Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alex Willis of  Leadville, Colorado for winning the USA Triathlon Winter National  Championships in Breckenridge, Colorado.

Alex is a third-generation ultra-triathlete and a coach who competes  in snowshoeing, trail running, cycling, Nordic skiing, and more. His  hard work paid off recently when he broke the tape with a time of  1:28:31 at the USA Triathlon Winter National Championships earning him  a spot in the World Championships to be held in Pontevedra, Spain next  year. We are incredibly proud that he'll represent the United States at  this global event.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to congratulate Alex Willis for his win at the 2025  Winter Triathlon National Championships, and join his friends and  family in rooting for his success at the World Championships.
