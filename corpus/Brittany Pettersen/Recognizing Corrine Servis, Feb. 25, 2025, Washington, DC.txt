Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Corrine Servis  of Salida, Colorado for being named the Colorado Parks and Wildlife  Department's 2024 Park Ranger of the Year. She was chosen from over 115  rangers statewide.

As Operations Manager for the Arkansas Headwaters Recreation Area  (AHRA), Corrine helps oversee the day-to-day operations and upkeep of  the park. She has gone above and beyond to educate and engage young  Coloradans. She spearheaded programming for school groups and  established internships and apprenticeships at the park. The AHRA and  the Salida community are lucky to have Corrine's passion and dedication  as she helps to inspire an appreciation for public lands in the next  generation of Coloradans.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to thank Corrine Servis for her service and congratulate  her on earning this award.
