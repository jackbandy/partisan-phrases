Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tasia Howard  for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

Tasia has overcome many challenges along her journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Tasia, develop crucial skills and a  work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives.
