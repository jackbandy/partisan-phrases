Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Annette Stolba  of Buena Vista, Colorado for her 42 years of service with the Chaffee  County Communications Center.

Annette began her career as a public safety dispatcher in 1983 before  911 emergency services were available. Over the next 40 years, Annette  helped countless Chaffee County residents in their time of need. The  Chaffee County community will remember Annette's role in keeping them  and their loved ones safe.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to thank Annette Stolba for her four decades of service  to the citizens of Chaffee County.
