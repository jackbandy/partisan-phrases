Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lilith Roberts- Ruiz for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth  Award.

Lilith has overcome many challenges along her journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Lilith, develop crucial skills and a  work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award  is a testament to Lilith's hard work, determination, and perseverance  at Jefferson Jr./Sr. High School and is clearly just the beginning of a  bright and promising future.

It is my honor to congratulate Lilith Roberts-Ruiz on achieving the  Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
