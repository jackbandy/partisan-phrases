Recognizing Arvada High School


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 125th  anniversary of Arvada High School.

For more than a century, Arvada High School has been a central part  of the community, empowering students with the tools they need to  succeed in their future education. When the school first opened in  1899, only seven students were enrolled. Today, Arvada High has over  700 students enrolled and is now a leading institution for families in  Jefferson County. Through its 125-year history, the school has adapted  to meet the changing needs of its students through initiatives like the  Empowerment Academy, which provides specialized support to students who  require additional resources and increases equitable access to  education.

The school's dedicated teachers and staff have guided generations of  students and made Arvada High a cornerstone for community development  in Jefferson County.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it  is my honor to congratulate Arvada High School on its 125th anniversary  and for its dedication to students in our community.
