Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jackson Rogers  for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

Jackson has overcome many challenges along his journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Jackson, develop crucial skills and a  work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award  is a testament to Jackson's hard work, determination, and perseverance  at Drake Middle School and is clearly just the beginning of a bright  and promising future.

It is my honor to congratulate Jackson Rogers on achieving the Arvada  Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
