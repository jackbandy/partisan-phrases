Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize John Curtis for  his promotion to Chief of the South Metro Fire Department.

Deputy Chief John Curtis has served the South Metro Fire Department  for over twenty years. In his previous position, John oversaw Emergency  Medical Services, dispatch, fleet services, and special operations. His  educational background in organizational leadership, along with his  extensive on the job experience, has separated him from the other 76  applicants. Our community is fortunate to have an incoming Chief with  the years of experience and education that John brings to this role.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to congratulate John Curtis on his promotion to Chief of  South Metro Fire Rescue. We thank him for his continued commitment to  our community.
