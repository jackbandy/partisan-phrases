Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Elevation Beer  Company of Poncha Springs, Colorado, for winning a Bronze Medal from  the World Beer Cup for their Coconut Oil Man brew.

The World Beer Cup, otherwise known as the ``Olympics of Beer,''  evaluates beers from around the world and recognizes the top brewers  and their beers. Founded in 2012 and nestled in the Heart of the  Rockies, Elevation Beer Company produces seasonal Belgian ales,  specialty brews, and barrel-aged beers that put a twist on traditional  styles of brewing.

Small businesses like Elevation Beer Company help drive the local  economy of Chaffee County and the state's economy. For both natives and  visitors to Poncha Springs, Elevation Beer Company provides excellent  service and beers, contributing to Colorado's leadership in producing  outstanding craft brew.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to congratulate Elevation Beer Company for this  accomplishment.
