Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Golden Police  Department of Golden, Colorado, for serving and protecting our  community.

We are all grateful to the Department and Chief of Police Joe Harvey,  as they strive to maintain a culture of positive public engagement,  equity, and compassion for all. Founded in 1874, the department has a  long history of dedicated officers working to build public trust  through accountability and equitable policing.

National Police Week offers an opportunity to honor law enforcement  and pay tribute to those who gave their lives serving their  communities. This week, we honor Officer Evan Dunn, who was a member of  the Golden Police Department, who tragically passed away in the line of  duty in November 2024. Officer Dunn joined the Department after serving  as an Army Aviator and Black Hawk pilot in the Missouri and Colorado  Army National Guard. As a soldier, an officer, and a devoted husband,  Officer Dunn was a servant in every aspect of his life. His legacy of  kindness, dedication, and service to our community and our country will  not be forgotten.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to thank the Golden Police Department for their devotion  to public service in the line of duty.
