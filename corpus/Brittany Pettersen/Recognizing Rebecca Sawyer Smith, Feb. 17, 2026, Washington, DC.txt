Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Rebecca Sawyer  Smith of Lakewood, Colorado for her 38 years of service within the  Department of Veterans Affairs and congratulate her on her retirement.

Rebecca began her federal government career as a graduate student at  The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., when she joined  the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Over the course of nearly four  decades, she served in a variety of roles within the VA, including  Public Affairs Officer, Coach, and member of the Public Contact Team.  Her career took her to communities on both coasts and throughout the  central United States before concluding in Lakewood, Colorado, where  she retired at the end of 2025.

Throughout her distinguished career, Rebecca dedicated herself to  serving those who have served our country. She worked tirelessly to  ensure veterans received the benefits and services they earned,  providing both in-person and virtual benefits counseling. She also  partnered closely with veteran service organizations and nonprofit  groups to help veterans navigate and access the support available to  them.

Even in retirement, Rebecca continues her commitment to veterans in  her community by volunteering with arts organizations that offer  programs for veterans, further demonstrating her lifelong devotion to  public service.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it  is my honor to thank Rebecca Sawyer Smith for her 38 years of service  with the VA and to congratulate her on her retirement.
