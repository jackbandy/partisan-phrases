Recognizing Amy Zhang


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud Amy  Zhang of Morrison, Colorado, for winning Best in Show in the 2025  Congressional App Challenge.

Amy built EnAct: AI Guides, Vision-Impaired Act, an assistive  technology app for seeing impaired individuals that describes the  user's environment, helping them avoid pathway collisions. Her  application uses multiple AI platforms, and was inspired in part by  Amy's experience with a friend who is seeing impaired.

This accomplishment is an impressive example of Amy's determination,  hard work, and advanced STEM knowledge base.

I congratulate Amy Zhang for her success in the Congressional App  Challenge. I am certain she will continue to show the same dedication  and strength of character in all her future endeavors. I am excited to  see all she will accomplish.
