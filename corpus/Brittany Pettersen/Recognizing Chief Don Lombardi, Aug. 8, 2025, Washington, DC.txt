Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Chief Don  Lombardi of Golden,  Colorado, on his retirement following 33 years of service to the West  Metro Fire Protection District.

Throughout his career, Chief Lombardi went above and beyond the line  of duty, and focused on growing programs that saved Coloradans money  and protected the health of our first responders. He started the  Advanced Resource Medic across West Metro, which helps patients reduce  cost in their healthcare expenses by treating patients in their own  homes and cutting back on unnecessary trips to the emergency room. He  also established the Colorado Firefighters Benefits Trust Program,  which helps firefighters and fire agencies manage illnesses that affect  first responders. Chief Lombardi led the West Metro through many fires  on the Front Range, but his leadership extended to the wellbeing of his  team and the people who live in our communities.

In recognition of Chief Lombardi's accomplishments, the Metropolitan  Chiefs presented him with the prestigious Russell E. Sanders Lifetime  Achievement Award, and the Federation of European Fire Officers honored  him with the Cross of Merit award. In 2022, he was named Colorado State  Fire Chief of the Year for his outstanding service. Chief Lombardi's  career has an incredible legacy in our state.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to congratulate Don on his well-earned retirement and to  thank him for his service.
