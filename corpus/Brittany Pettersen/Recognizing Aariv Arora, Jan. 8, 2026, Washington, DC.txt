Recognizing Aariv Arora


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud  Aariv Arora of Broomfield, Colorado, for earning the Rookie of the Year  Award in the 2025 Congressional App Challenge.

Aariv built an interactive app called WayBuddy, a community safety  app that allows students to report roadway hazards for fellow  pedestrians and bicyclists on a shared map. This accomplishment is an  example of Aariv's determination, hard work, and impressive knowledge  base in the STEM field.

I congratulate Aariv Arora for his success in the Congressional App  Challenge. I am certain he will continue to show the same dedication  and strength of character in all his future endeavors. I am excited to  see all he will accomplish.
