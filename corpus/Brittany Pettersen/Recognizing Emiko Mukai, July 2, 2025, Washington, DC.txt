Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Emiko Mukai of  Golden, Colorado. Emiko was selected as one of 250 high school students  across the country to participate in the Department of State's  prestigious Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange (CBYX) Program.

Launched in 1983, CBYX selects high achieving youth from both Germany  and the United States to live in each other's country for one academic  year. During their year abroad, students will foster meaningful  relationships between America and Germany, while giving participants  new perspectives on peoples and cultures beyond their own. Many CBYX  alumni go on to distinguished careers in foreign affairs and public  service using the language skills gained through this scholarship  program.

This year, Emiko will travel to Germany to attend school, live with a  host family, and collaborate with the Department of State to promote  cultural exchange between Americans and the German people.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to congratulate Emiko Mukai for this impressive  accomplishment and wish Emiko all the best in this upcoming year in  Germany.
