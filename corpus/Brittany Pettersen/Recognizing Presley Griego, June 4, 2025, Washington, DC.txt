Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Presley Griego  for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

Presley has overcome many challenges along her journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Presley, develop crucial skills and a  work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award  is a testament to Presley's hard work, determination, and perseverance  at Mandalay Middle School and is clearly just the beginning of a bright  and promising future.

It is my honor to congratulate Presley Griego on achieving the Arvada  Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
