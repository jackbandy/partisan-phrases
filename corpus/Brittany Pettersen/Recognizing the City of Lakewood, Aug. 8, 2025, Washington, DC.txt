Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the City of  Lakewood, Colorado, for its induction into the All-America City Hall of  Fame for its Sustainable Neighborhoods Program.

Lakewood's Sustainable Neighborhoods program has brought residents  together to promote water conservation, address food access issues, and  reduce waste and neighborhood emissions. This program has served as a  model for neighborhoods nationwide, empowering residents and their  communities to adopt more sustainable lifestyles and reduce their  ecological footprint.

The All-America City award from the National Civic League recognizes  outstanding communities that leverage civic engagement, collaboration,  inclusiveness, and innovation to address local issues. It is because of  the collective efforts of communities like the City of Lakewood that we  can hope for a greener future.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to thank the City of Lakewood for its hard work and  dedication to sustainability in our community.
