Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tom Downey of  Ireland Stapleton, PC for being named Lawyer of the Year. Additionally,  Tom has been named one of The Best Lawyers in America for  Administrative and Regulatory Law and Government Relations by The Best  Lawyers in America publication.

As a regulatory attorney, Tom has provided legal assistance to a wide  range of clients, helping them navigate regulatory agencies. Tom has  been particularly impactful within the City of Denver, having rewritten  Denver's liquor licensing rules, helped create regulations for  recreational marijuana, and designed the licensing structure for pedal  cabs in the city. His work with the American Arbitration Association  has helped further its mission for more equitable and accessible  conflict resolution.

Tom also gives back to the legal community by serving as a guest  lecturer at law schools such as the University of Denver and helps  clients in his private practice.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it  is my honor to congratulate Tom Downey for his awards and thank him for  his contributions to our community.
