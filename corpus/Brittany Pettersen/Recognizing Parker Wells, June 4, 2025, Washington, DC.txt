Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Parker Wells  for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

Parker has overcome many challenges along his journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Parker, develop crucial skills and a  work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award  is a testament to Parker's hard work, determination, and perseverance  at Three Creeks K-8 and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and  promising future.

It is my honor to congratulate Parker Wells on achieving the Arvada  Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
