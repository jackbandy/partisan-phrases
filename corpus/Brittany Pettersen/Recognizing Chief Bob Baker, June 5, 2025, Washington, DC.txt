Recognizing Chief Bob Baker


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize South Metro  Fire Department Chief Bob Baker for his leadership and service over the  past 40 years.

Bob Baker has served with South Metro Fire Rescue as the Chief for  the last ten years. Last summer, when the Quarry fire broke across the  Front Range, Chief Baker helped coordinate the emergency response to  keep our community safe. Under his leadership, the South Metro Fire  Department was awarded Class 1 status by the Insurance Service Office  for its outstanding protection of residents, and was one of only  thirteen Class 1 departments that serve over 500,000 constituents.  Throughout his service, Chief Baker has championed the physical and  mental well-being of his team through workplace wellness programs, and  we are incredibly grateful for his hard work.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  I am honored to congratulate Chief Bob Baker on his retirement.
