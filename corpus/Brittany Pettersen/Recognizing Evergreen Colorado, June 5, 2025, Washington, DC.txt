Recognizing Evergreen Colorado

Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Evergreen,  Colorado, on its 150th anniversary as a town.

One hundred and fifty years ago, Dwight Wilmot petitioned the United  States Postal Service to establish a post office named Evergreen in the  foothills of western Denver. Since then, Evergreen has grown from a  small ranching and logging village only accessible by wagon roads to  the vibrant mountain community that it is today. Originally inhabited  by the Native Ute, Cheyenne, and Arapaho people, the town has grown  alongside the state of  Colorado, boasting a slower lifestyle ``up the hill'' away from the  City of Denver. Evergreen's charm can be seen in the community's  appreciation for the arts, outdoor recreation opportunities, and small  community feel, along with the work of the more than 70 nonprofit  organizations that embody the town's attitude of ``taking care of  ourselves and our neighbors.''

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to celebrate Evergreen, Colorado, on its 150-year- history and join the town in looking forward to the future.
