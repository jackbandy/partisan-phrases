Letter to Alex Azar, Secretary for the Dept. of Health and Human Services, and Robert Kadlec, Assistant Sec for Preparedness and Response of the Dept. of Health and Human Services - NM delegation calls for federal government to provide medical protective equipment to NM from the Strategic National Stockpile


Dear Secretary Azar and Assistant Secretary Kadlec:

We write with an urgent request from the State of New Mexico to fulfill Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham's request for our state's full allotment of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers.

We understand that New Mexico received 25% of its allotment from the strategic national stockpile yesterday, but it is critical to ensure that New Mexico continues to have sufficient PPE supplies.

We strongly urge you to release New Mexico's full allotment of PPE and work with the state to find other sources to help replenish their supplies. We believe this request is consistent with the treatment received by other states and any action you take now will help our state as confirmed coronavirus cases continue to mount.

We appreciate your agency's efforts to date to assist New Mexico during the novel coronavirus pandemic and we look forward to your prompt action on this request. If you have any questions about this request please do not hesitate to contact us or the New Mexico Department of Health.

Sincerely,
