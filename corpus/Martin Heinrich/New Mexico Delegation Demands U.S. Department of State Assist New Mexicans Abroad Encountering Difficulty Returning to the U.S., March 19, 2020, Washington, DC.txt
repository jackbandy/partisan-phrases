New Mexico Delegation Demands U.S. Department of State Assist New Mexicans Abroad Encountering Difficulty Returning to the U.S.


The New Mexico congressional delegation -- U.S. Senator Tom Udall, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich, and U.S. Representatives Ben Ray Luj√°n, Deb Haaland, and Xochitl Torres Small-- issued the following statement on reports their offices are receiving that New Mexicans are stranded abroad and not receiving assistance from the U.S. Department of State in returning to the United States. 

"Our offices have heard directly from New Mexicans who are stranded abroad or have loved ones who are unable to return to the United States during this time of global crisis. We have received reports that these individuals are not receiving adequate support from the U.S. Department of State in arranging their return to the United States -- which is absolutely unacceptable and must be immediately rectified.

"We are calling on the Trump administration to immediately assist and communicate with Americans who are stranded abroad -- away from their families, communities, and trusted health care providers. While our offices are doing everything in our power to assist our constituents who are in this deeply distressing situation, it is one of the most fundamental responsibilities of the State Department to ensure that U.S. Citizens abroad are supported by their country, especially at a time of widespread uncertainty, public health risk, and fear."
