Heinrich Statement On Passing Of Mayor Esther Garcia


U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) issued the following statement on the passing of former Village of Questa Mayor Esther Garcia:

"I'm deeply saddened by the passing of Esther Garcia. She spoke from the heart about what conservation of our public lands meant to her and her community. As Mayor of Questa, Esther was instrumental in the establishment of the RÃ­o Grande del Norte National Monument. Future generations who visit the monument's spectacular landscapes, from the tops of Cerro de la Olla and Ute Mountain to the depths of the Rio Grande Gorge, will be forever grateful for all she did to protect northern New Mexico's unique natural heritage."
