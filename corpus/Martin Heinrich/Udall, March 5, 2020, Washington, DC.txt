Udall, Heinrich Vote for $8.3 Billion Emergency Coronavirus Response Package


Today, U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-N.M.), senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) voted in favor of a $8.3 billion bipartisan, bicameral, coronavirus emergency supplemental Appropriations bill to respond to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. The funds include a major boost of $950 million in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) grants to state and local governments and $40 million in funds to Tribes, Tribal organizations and Urban Indian Health Organizations. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 96-1, after passing the U.S. House of Representatives 415 to 2, and the president is expected to sign it into law soon.

Under the package, New Mexico will receive a minimum CDC assistance award of $5,974,000 to fund the state's public health response through an emergency supplement to the state's Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) grant.

"The funding package we passed today to address the global coronavirus outbreak is vital to the health and safety of New Mexico communities," Udall said. "As the Trump White House has struggled to confront this global health emergency, Congress is stepping up to get important resources into the hands of medical professionals and states and Tribes as quickly as possible. I am working closely with the state of New Mexico and New Mexico's 23 Tribes to ensure we have the necessary resources to protect all of our state's communities. I appreciate the hard work of medical and public health experts at the New Mexico Department of Health, New Mexico's Tribal health departments, and the CDC, and I encourage New Mexicans to rely on these agencies for accurate, reliable and up to date information."

"This emergency funding package provides our federal public health agencies with the resources they need to lead an all-hands-on-deck, science-based response to the coronavirus outbreak. Now that Congress has come together to pass this important, bipartisan package, I will do everything in my power to hold the Trump administration accountable for putting public health ahead of politics and treating this global health emergency with the utmost seriousness," said Heinrich. "I will also continue to work with the state and our tribes to ensure our public health infrastructure in New Mexico is ready for the road ahead and have the resources to prepare and respond to potential outbreaks. I encourage every New Mexican to stay informed about the virus and how to keep yourself and your family healthy."
