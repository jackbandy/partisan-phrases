Heinrich Statement On North American Trade Deal


U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) issued the following statement after the Senate-passage of H.R. 5430, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Implementation Act:

"I am not enthusiastic about this deal, but it is far better than NAFTA. That is why I am supporting it.

"I have not previously voted to support trade deals because they did not look out for the interests of working people. A year ago, the initial USMCA deal put forward by the White House looked like more of the same, just a simple re-branding of NAFTA geared toward helping Wall Street and major corporations move jobs overseas and exploit workers.

"However, after a year of engagement by labor unions and Democrats in the Senate and House, the new agreement we voted on today clearly raises labor standards. When corporations are required to pay their workers in Mexico better wages and treat them with the dignity they deserve, it helps American workers, too. The enforceable labor provisions secured by Democrats that empower and protect workers set an important precedent that we need in every American trade agreement from here forward.

"I am disappointed that this deal missed an opportunity to secure binding environmental and climate commitments from all three countries. Despite this, I remain committed to fighting for concrete actions from the United States and our international partners to curb carbon pollution and address the climate crisis.

"Increased bilateral trade with Mexico has benefitted New Mexico's economy tremendously, particularly in our border communities. After three years of chaos caused by President Trump's erratic tariffs and trade wars, I hope that this new trade agreement will provide a level of stability and certainty to New Mexico's agricultural producers, businesses, and workers who all benefit greatly from our strong trading partnerships with Mexico and Canada."
