Heinrich Votes To Pass Interim COVID-19 Emergency Relief Package


U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) issued the following statement after voting for the interim COVID-19 emergency relief package, which passed the Senate today. A summary of the legislation is available here.

"This stopgap legislation is designed to quickly shore up the economic relief programs targeted for small businesses, provide more funding to our health care providers, and set the foundation for a much larger, national testing infrastructure that is absolutely critical to restoring confidence and reopening our economy. Resuming normal life relies on making COVID-19 testing readily available in every single community in every corner of the country, and ensuring that data is accessible and transparent.

"It was clearly urgent to get more funds into programs like the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans that can serve as critical lifelines for small businesses and nonprofits. I am disappointed and deeply frustrated with the shortcomings in the delivery of these programs by the Trump administration. I hope the additional funding and key fixes to these programs in this legislation will allow the small businesses who need help--not just those who are well-connected--to finally receive it.

"We still need to do so much more to invest in a broader public health response that's rooted in science, and a strong long-term economic recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic. I am not done fighting for New Mexico's priorities as the negotiations continue between the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the White House on the next major bill to protect our health and rebuild our country."
