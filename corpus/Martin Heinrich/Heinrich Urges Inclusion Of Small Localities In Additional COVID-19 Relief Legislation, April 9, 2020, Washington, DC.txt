Heinrich Urges Inclusion Of Small Localities In Additional COVID-19 Relief Legislation


U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) issued the following statement calling for bipartisan support for future COVID-19 relief legislation to include stabilization funding geared towards localities with populations under 500,000.

"Small and rural communities in New Mexico either will face, or have already faced, enormous economic burdens and costs in an effort to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is crucial that we provide the same direct emergency assurances to smaller towns, counties, and cities and grant them the same stability that we are providing our larger metropolitan areas. I am urging my congressional colleagues to expand upon the Coronavirus Relief Fund that we secured in the CARES Act and open up this critical funding so that no community is left behind, especially in New Mexico."
