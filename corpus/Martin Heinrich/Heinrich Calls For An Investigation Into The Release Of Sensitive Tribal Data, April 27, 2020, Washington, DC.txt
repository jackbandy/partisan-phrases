Heinrich Calls For An Investigation Into The Release Of Sensitive Tribal Data


U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) issued the following statement calling for an investigation into the release of sensitive information that tribal governments and other entities submitted to the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of the Interior related to CARES Act Coronavirus Relief Funds:

"I am disappointed and concerned by the release of sensitive data that Native American communities provided the Department of Treasury and Department of Interior. Tribal nations in New Mexico are facing a disproportionate impact to their populations due to the coronavirus pandemic and access to the $8 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund is vital to their response and recovery efforts. I am calling for an immediate and thorough investigation by both departments' Inspectors General to identify the source and motivation for the release of this private tribal information."
