Heinrich Statement On U.S. Strike On Iranian General


U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) issued the following statement in response to U.S. air strikes that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani:

"The use of American military force should never be made lightly. While there is no doubt that Iran plays a hostile role in the region that warrants our constant vigilance, President Trump's reckless approach to foreign policy is completely lacking in forethought and too often puts Americans at risk.

"Since pulling out of the JCPOA, the Trump administration has continued to escalate an incoherent "maximum pressure' campaign on Iran with no real offramps and without thinking through any of the logical consequences of those actions. President Trump has now dangerously raised the likelihood of entangling the U.S. in another war in the Middle East.

"If the President and his advisors believe military conflict with Iran is necessary, they need to have a clear strategy and justification, and bring it to Congress for the authorization the Constitution mandates."
