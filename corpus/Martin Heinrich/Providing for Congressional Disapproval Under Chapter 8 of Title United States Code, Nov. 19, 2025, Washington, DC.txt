Mr. HEINRICH.  I rise  today to object on behalf of my colleague from California Senator  Padilla and my colleague from Colorado Senator Bennet.

The Energy and Natural Resources Committee does have a long tradition  of bipartisanship and cooperation when it comes to passing very local  and oftentimes very parochial land bills. Typically, this is negotiated  in a package rather than the piecemeal approach that we are seeing  today--for many reasons but in part because we have literally hundreds  of bills within our committee's jurisdiction that need action,  including the ones that my colleague is talking about today, with most  representing very important local priorities in our States.

Unfortunately, attempting to pass individual bills through unanimous  consent in this manner tends to favor one party or one Chamber's  priorities and is often ineffective at actually getting legislation  signed into law.

Senator Padilla, Senator Bennet, and I are happy to sit down with my  colleague from Alaska and with the chairman to make sure that both our  Chambers--both our parties' priorities can be put together in a way  that we see them reach the finish line. Therefore, in support of my  colleague from California and my colleague from Colorado, I must object  at this time.
