Unanimous Consent Requests--The Calendar

Just last week, we saw the House pass a Senate Republican bill  without the Senate Democratic bill that it had been paired with. Both  bills are bipartisan; both even have a budget score, and yet the  Democratic bill sits with no plan to get it signed into law.

We need to pass bills over here in a way that ensures that both  Republican and Democratic priorities and bills become law.

In addition, I do have substantive concerns with S. 1084. I was not  the ranking member of the previous Congress, but it would give away  public land without an equal value exchange or payment for conservation  of other public land.

The public is simply left out of the equation. That is not something  I can support, and I am certainly willing to work with the bill's  sponsor on finding a path forward. But in its current form, I must  object.
