Heinrich Statement On Opening Of Impeachment Trial


U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) issued the following statement as the Senate formally opened the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump:

"I took an oath today to solemnly do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. Every single senator needs to grapple with the gravity of this moment and take our constitutional duty as jurors seriously. A fair and impartial trial requires witnesses and documentary evidence. Anything short of that would be a trial in name only."
