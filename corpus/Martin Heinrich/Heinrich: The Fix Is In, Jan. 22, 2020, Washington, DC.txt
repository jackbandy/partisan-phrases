Heinrich: The Fix Is In


U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) issued the following statement as the Senate passed the rules resolution for the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, with Republicans voting down all 11 amendments introduced by Democrats to subpoena documents and call witnesses:

"The fix is in... Majority Leader McConnell is spending the entire opening day of this trial preventing the Senate and the American people from viewing documentary evidence or hearing from witnesses."
