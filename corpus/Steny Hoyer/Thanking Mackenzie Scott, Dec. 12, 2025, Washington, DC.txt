Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to note the extraordinary act of  patriotism of one of our fellow citizens. I rise today to thank  MacKenzie Scott, formerly the wife of Jeff Bezos, for donating $50  million to Bowie State University, the largest single contribution in  the school's history.

Bowie State University is not only Maryland's oldest HBCU; it is one  of our State's finest higher education institutions, period.

MacKenzie Scott's generous gift will help make Bowie State University  even more affordable and support the  groundbreaking research its students produce every day.

With her historic donations to Bowie State University, Morgan State  University, and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, MacKenzie has  proven herself to be an honorary Marylander, an American who cares  about investing in our future, an American who understands the critical  importance of education in our State, in our Nation, and for our kids  and for our future. I thank MacKenzie Scott.
