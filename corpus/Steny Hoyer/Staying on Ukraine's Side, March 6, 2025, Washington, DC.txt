Staying on Ukraine's Side

Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I applaud and support the remarks of the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Ross). We must be on Ukraine's  side and against dictators, despots, and war criminals.                            HONORING BEVERLY BYRON

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great Marylander, a dedicated  champion of our men and women in uniform, and a former Member of this  body, Beverly Byron, a dear friend of mine for over 60 years.

Beverly passed away at the age of 92 on February 9.

When Beverly succeeded her husband, Representative Goodloe Byron, in  Congress after his sudden passing in 1978, many people underestimated  her. Throughout her 14 years in Congress, however, she proved to be a  gifted leader in her own right.

Beverly became the first woman to chair a House Armed Services  subcommittee. Her commitment to her constituents and to her principles  earned her respect on both sides of the aisle.

Mr. Speaker, this Congress needs more leaders like Beverly Byron  today. Her passing is a great loss to Maryland, to America, and to this  institution.

I ask my colleagues to join me in praying for Beverly and her family.
