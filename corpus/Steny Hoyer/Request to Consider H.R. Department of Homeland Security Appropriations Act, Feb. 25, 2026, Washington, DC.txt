Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.

Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, am I to take from the definition that you  gave as to why you could not accept the gentlewoman's unanimous-consent  request that the majority has not agreed to funding the balance of the  DHS bill other than CBP and ICE?

Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman, and we are not objecting.
