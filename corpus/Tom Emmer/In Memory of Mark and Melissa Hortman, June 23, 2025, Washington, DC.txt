In Memory of Mark and Melissa Hortman


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692785/in-memory-of-mark-and-melissa-hortman


Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of all Minnesotans to  honor the lives and legacies of former Minnesota Speaker of the House  Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were viciously murdered in  their home on June 14.

We also continue to pray for Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman and  his wife, Yvette, as they recover from this heinous attack, as well.

There is no place in our country for politically motivated violence.  None. The fact that the Hortman and Hoffman families are being forced  to endure the consequences of inexplicable evil is heartbreaking,  devastating, and infuriating for us all, but it is through tragedies  like this that we are reminded that we are stronger together. There is  more that unites us than divides us, and when we turn to our faith in  God, we can maintain hope in the midst of absolute turmoil.

We are grateful to local, State, and Federal law enforcement for  their swift action in apprehending this evil coward who attacked these  dedicated public servants and we look forward to justice being served.
