Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the tireless  efforts of my constituent, Tammy Myers, whose commitment to ensuring  fairness in Michigan's surrogacy laws has brought about meaningful  change for families across our community and state.

Tammy Myers was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, which resulted  in procedures that left her unable to have children. In 2021, she and  her husband worked with a gestational carrier to have their twin son  and daughter. They quickly found themselves facing an unimaginable  challenge. Tammy was forced to adopt her own biological twins due to  deeply unfair Michigan laws that failed to recognize her as the  rightful parent of her children.

Fueled by her personal experience, Tammy became an outspoken advocate  for reforming Michigan's antiquated surrogacy laws. Through her  persistence and unwavering determination, Tammy helped bring attention  to a loophole in state law that left parents like her in legal limbo,  forcing many individuals to jump through hoops to be recognized as  their biological children's parents.

Tammy's efforts were instrumental in the passage of the Michigan  Family Protection Act, which provides legal support and protection for  families who have children through surrogacy. Her advocacy shed light  on the real-world implications of our outdated legal system and the  need for reform as we continue to fight for reproductive freedom across  our Nation.

On behalf of Michigan's Third Congressional District, I am proud to  honor Tammy Myers for her advocacy and leadership. We thank her for her  tireless work in fighting for her children--Eames, Ellison, and  Corryn--and the hard-working Michiganders who now have access to the  essential resources they need to start a family.
