Highlighting Notable Black Leaders From Michigan's Third Congressional District


Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I welcome my friends, family, and  constituents back home in west Michigan to my Special Order hour  honoring notable Black west Michiganders and the impact they have made  on our wonderful community.

Black History Month is not just about reflecting on the past. It is  also about acknowledging the incredible individuals who have shaped our  communities and continue to inspire future generations.

Black history is woven into the very fabric of America, and it is our  duty to honor it, not just in February but every single day of the  year.

As the Representative of Michigan's Third Congressional District, I  am privileged to highlight some of the remarkable Black leaders,  educators, athletes, activists, and artists who have left their mark on  west Michigan. Their stories are ones of perseverance, excellence, and  resilience in the face of adversity. They remind us that history is not  just something written in textbooks, but it is alive in the people who  have worked tirelessly to break barriers and uplift their communities.  I want to first tell you about Lyman Parks first.

Lyman Parks, Grand Rapids Mayor: After moving to Grand Rapids to  serve as a pastor of the First Community AME Church in 1968, he was  elected as the first Black commissioner in the city's history.

Lyman Parks holds a special place in our history as the first and  only Black mayor of Grand Rapids. His leadership throughout the 1970s  marked a turning point for the city, proving that Black leaders could  and should have a seat at the table in shaping the future of our  communities.

In 2003, Parks was awarded the GIANT Among Giants Award, an annual  award presented by the city of Grand Rapids since 1983 to recognize  exceptional contributions by African Americans to the greater Grand  Rapids community.

Rillastine Wilkins, City Council: At age 18 and with $3 in her  pocket, Wilkins made her way to Muskegon, where she had an aunt. She  became active in the civil rights movement and attended school board  meetings and Muskegon Heights City Council meetings.

Rillastine Wilkins shattered glass ceilings, becoming the first  female city  councilmember in 1974. Her husband, who went by the nickname Peaches,  accompanied her to every single council meeting to prevent the male  councilmembers from harassing or intimidating her.

In 1999, she was elected as the city's first Black female mayor. Her  leadership spanned decades, influencing local government and paving the  way for future Black women in politics throughout west Michigan.

Hattie Beverly, Teacher Extraordinaire: In 1899, Hattie became the  first African-American woman to teach in Grand Rapids Public Schools, a  feat that did not come without struggle.

Despite her remarkable academic achievements, she faced resistance  from those who believed a Black woman should not teach White children.  Yet, she persevered, and we are so much better because she did.

Though her teaching career was tragically cut short when she passed  away at the tender age of 30, Beverly's impact resonated beyond her  lifetime. Her legacy of determination and excellence paved the way for  future Black educators, ensuring the doors she opened would remain open  for others to walk through.

Jimmy Carter, Basketball: No, not that Jimmy Carter, but still, he  looms large in west Michigan as a basketball phenom and a name truly  synonymous with basketball excellence in Grand Rapids.

Jimmy Carter dedicated his life to shaping young athletes. From his  high school days at South High School to coaching and mentoring  multiple children and young athletes at various schools, Carter's  influence in the sports world has been profound.

Carter's contributions extend far beyond the court, as well, proving  that mentorship and investing in young athletes can transform lives. He  was recently inducted into the Grand Rapids Sports Hall of Fame, and  that solidifies his place in history.

Helen Claytor, Activist: Helen Claytor's work with the Young Women's  Christian Association extends far beyond Grand Rapids. She was the  first Black woman to serve as president of the national YWCA board of  directors. Under her leadership, the organization embraced the fight  against racism, making racial justice a core tenet of its mission.

Her work reminds us that institutions have a responsibility to be  antiracist and that leadership must reflect the values of equity and  justice.

Today, her legacy stands tall in Grand Rapids, both figuratively and  literally, with her statue near GRCC's campus.

Dr. Patricia Pulliam, Publisher: As an educator, Dr. Pulliam worked  tirelessly to uplift students in Grand Rapids, serving as an adviser,  mentor, and leader in higher education.

Beyond the classroom, she became a publisher and, later, owner of The  Grand Rapids Times, ensuring that the stories of Black residents were  not just heard but celebrated. She also cofounded the GIANT Awards, an  annual ceremony recognizing Black excellence in our community.

Her contributions continue to inspire. While the media has often  ignored or misrepresented Black voices, thanks to leaders like Dr.  Pulliam, those voices are amplified and preserved.

Dr. John Butler, Boxing Champion: In 1953, Dr. Butler became the  first Grand Rapids boxer to win a National Golden Gloves title, an  accomplishment that cemented his legacy in the sport.

Dr. Butler was not just a fighter in the ring. He was also a fighter  for education and equality.

Growing up in Mississippi, he faced the harsh realities of poverty  and racism. His mother, determined to give her family a better future,  moved them to Grand Rapids, where Dr. Butler found his passion for  boxing.

Through the mentorship of his trainer, he not only honed his athletic  abilities but also understood the importance of education. That  discipline led him to earn a Ph.D. from Michigan State University.

Dr. Butler dedicated his career to the Grand Rapids school system,  serving as a teacher and assistant principal and eventually training  city employees in public service. He provided guidance to young Black  students who faced adversity, making an impact far beyond the  classroom.

Today, his legacy is forever etched in the Grand Rapids Sports Hall  of Fame, a testament to his dedication to both sports and education.

Paul Collins, Artist: Paul Collins has spent his life using his  artistic talents to tell the stories of those often overlooked.

Born in Muskegon and raised in Grand Rapids, Collins was drawn to art  from a young age. Despite initial discouragement, he pursued his  passion, eventually traveling to West Africa to immerse himself in his  cultural roots.

Collins' work has been displayed worldwide, from exhibitions in  Africa to murals honoring historical figures in the United States.

He was the first Black artist to paint a sitting President when he  painted President Gerald R. Ford.

His contributions to the art world also include designing the Martin  Luther King Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize Medal and the Challenger 7 space  shuttle logo.

As we celebrate Black History Month, let us remember that these  stories are not just relics of the past, but they are living legacies  that continue to shape our community.

It is our duty to ensure that these trailblazers live on, that we  continue the fight for equality, and that we uplift and support Black  voices in our community.

It is our duty to ensure that we continue to tell these stories.

Black history is American history, and it is a history that deserves  to be honored not just in February but every single day. These  achievements are proof that progress is possible, but only if we remain  committed to justice, inclusion, the power of education, and advocacy.  I am proud to continue to carry on their legacy through this Special  Order hour today.
