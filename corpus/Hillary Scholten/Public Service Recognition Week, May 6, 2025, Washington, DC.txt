Public Service Recognition Week


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690734/public-service-recognition-week


Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the tireless  dedication of our public servants.

Michigan is seeing the real-time impact of President Trump's and Elon  Musk's mass firings. I have heard and seen people's fears firsthand at  my townhalls because civil servants are the quiet force behind the  services that hold our communities together.

When a farmer in west Michigan loses a season's worth of crops, it is  the USDA employee who helps them adjudicate a crop insurance claim,  making sure they can recover and keep food on our tables.

Public servants are the problem-solvers, neighbors, and first  responders in times of crisis. They protect our food supply, ensure  veterans receive their benefits, and respond when disaster strikes.  These are the people who have devoted their careers to making our  country better.

We must continue to honor and support our public servants, not only  during Public Service Recognition Week,  but every week. Let us do right by them and the American people they  serve.
