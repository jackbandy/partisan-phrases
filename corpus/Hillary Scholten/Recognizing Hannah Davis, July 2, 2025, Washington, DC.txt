Recognizing Hannah Davis


Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join  me in congratulating Hannah Davis. Hannah is a member of Girl Scouts of  Michigan Shore to Shore, Girl Scout Juliette. She has exemplified  extraordinary leadership, innovative problem-solving, and a  demonstrated commitment to making a lasting, positive impact by earning  the most prestigious award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award.

Gold Award Girl Scouts are recognized as trailblazers who are willing  to tackle the most pressing challenges facing their communities and the  world with measurable, sustainable, and far-reaching results. To earn  the Girl Scout Gold Award, high school-age Girl Scouts must identify  and investigate an issue they care about, devise a plan, and then lead  a team of experts and community members to implement a project that  produces lasting change. Over the course of 1 to 2 years, Gold Award  Girl Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and  leadership, distinguishing them from their peers. Through their  resourcefulness and perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to  truly make the world a better place.

Hannah's project, ``Community Sensory Room'', in partnership with  Faith Community Church of Coopersville, has greatly improved  accessibility resources for individuals with autism, Sensory Processing  Disorder (SPD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and  Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Hannah took action by creating a  sensory room at her local church, allowing families and children space  to stimulate, engage, or relax senses, which will have a positive  impact on our community for years to come.

On behalf of Michigan's 3rd Congressional District, I congratulate  Hannah Davis for achieving the highest distinction in Girl Scouts, the  Gold Award. I thank Hannah for her leadership and for making such a  positive, enduring change in our community.
