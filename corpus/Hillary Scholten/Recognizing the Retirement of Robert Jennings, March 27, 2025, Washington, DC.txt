Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my  constituent, Robert Jennings, on his retirement from SpartanNash in  Byron Center, Michigan. Mr. Jennings was an outstanding associate of  SpartanNash, with  his retirement marking 25 years of incredible professionalism and  service to his coworkers and community. His commitment to excellence in  his role is to be commended, and it is my honor and privilege to  recognize Mr. Jennings here today.

Through considerable effort, innovation, and persistence, Mr.  Jennings has helped foster an efficient and effective warehouse  environment for associates at SpartanNash. He worked with cross- functional departments to coordinate distribution center operations  while supervising the daily warehouse department in shipping,  selection, loading, and storage. Mr. Jennings was also crucial in  assisting with the training of SpartanNash teams during changes in  procedure, and worked with warehouse leads to coordinate the day-to-day  scheduling of associates. Our West Michigan Community is fortunate to  have lived and worked alongside Mr. Jennings, who has made outstanding  contributions during his time at SpartanNash.

Mr. Speaker, I once again ask my colleagues to join me in  congratulating Robert Jennings on his retirement from SpartanNash. We  commend him for his decades of service. I wish Mr. Jennings, a much- deserved, restful retirement surrounded by family, friends, and  neighbors.
