Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Huntington's  Disease Awareness Month and to honor the courage and strength of  families across the Nation who face lifelong hardships due to  Huntington's disease, including one of my own constituents, Rachel  Reising, and her family.

Rachel has reached out to me and asked that I join her in raising  awareness for this disease. Huntington's disease is a rare genetic  disorder that slowly damages the brain over time. There is currently no  cure. However, there is hope, thanks to Medicaid research advancements  and investments.

Rachel recently reached out to me and shared her brave story as she  grieves the loss of her father, whom she tragically lost to  Huntington's. She has made it her life's mission to advocate for proper  care of those affected and to eventually find a cure.

In honor of Rachel's family and the tens of thousands of others who  face Huntington's disease, I urge my colleagues to protect research and  funding to help those living with this rare disease.
