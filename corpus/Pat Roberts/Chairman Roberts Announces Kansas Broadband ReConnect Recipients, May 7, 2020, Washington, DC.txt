Chairman Roberts Announces Kansas Broadband ReConnect Recipients


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts, R-Kan., Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, today announced the Kansas recipients of the first round of funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ReConnect Broadband program.

"As a rural state, Kansas communities need access to high speed internet, a necessary tool to grow and thrive in the 21st century," said Roberts. "The ReConnect program complements our Farm Bill broadband programs and will help bridge the urban-rural divide in broadband service."

The ReConnect program provides loans and grants to establish broadband infrastructure in rural communities with insufficient internet service.

Totah Communications Inc. is receiving an $18.9 million loan and an $18.9 million grant to construct 621 miles of fiber-to-the-premises broadband infrastructure, which will provide broadband availability to Montgomery and Chautauqua counties.
