Senator Roberts Participates in Signing Ceremony for USMCA


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) joined Senate Finance Committee Chairman and President Pro Tempore Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and a group of colleagues for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) signing ceremony. Following the ceremony, the USMCA was sent to the president's desk for final implementation.

"This signing today is a prime example of the good this chamber can do when we work together and across the aisle on matters of importance to our constituents," said Sen. Roberts. "The implementation of USMCA will provide greater certainty and expanded growth potential for America's farmers, ranchers and growers, as well as all broad industries within the U.S. economy."
