Sen. Roberts & Rep. Ron Estes Statement on Spirit Aerosystems Furloughs


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), and Representative Ron Estes (R-Kan.) today released the following statement after Spirit Aerosystems announced furloughs in Wichita.

"While these furloughs will affect a large part of the aerospace workforce in Wichita, I know the community is prepared to assist in every way possible," said Sen. Roberts. "Wichita is the Air Capital of the World, and I am committed to making sure that does not change."

"I have had numerous discussions with the Trump administration, the FAA, the governor, Boeing and other stakeholders about the impact these furloughs will have on employees at Spirit and various other industry suppliers throughout our region. I will continue to work with the FAA to ensure grounded aircraft causing these furloughs can safely return to the skies without any unnecessary delays," said Rep. Estes. "In the meantime, my office in Wichita is available to help connect furloughed employees with the Department of Labor and other resources. I am fully confident that thanks to our skilled workforce and industry partners, our region will remain the Air Capital of the World."

Sen. Roberts and Rep. Estes encourage workers impacted by these furloughs to contact their Wichita offices for any assistance they may need.
