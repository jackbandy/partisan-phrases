Senator Pat Roberts Announces Office Changes Due to Coronavirus Concern


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) today voted in support of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which passed the Senate with a vote of 90-8.

"As a society, we are faced with a crisis that we have never seen before," said Senator Roberts. "The novel coronavirus is impacting not just Kansas or the United States, but the entire world. I am proud to have voted in favor of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to provide much needed relief in light of the coronavirus. If ever there was a time when we needed bipartisanship in the Congress, it is now, and I'm pleased we have been able to work across the aisle for the greater good."

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act aims to provide aid to the nation in this critical time of need. The legislation works to expand testing for the novel coronavirus, deliver financial assistance, offer paid sick leave to workers impacted and increase access to telehealth services.
