Roberts Applauds Reduced Barriers to Feeding Kansas Schoolchildren


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, today applauded an announcement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to ease requirements for summer meals for schoolchildren.

On March 29, FNS granted the Kansas State Department of Education's request to waive the area eligibility requirement in the Summer Food Service Program during school closures related to COVID-19.

To feed as many schoolchildren as possible, this waiver allows summer feeding programs to operate in expanded areas of economic hardship.

"This is welcome news for Kansas families facing a great deal of uncertainty right now," Roberts said. "I thank the Kansas Department of Education for identifying a need and solution and the USDA Food and Nutrition Service for reducing barriers to feed more hungry schoolchildren."

The waiver will last through June 30 or upon the end of the federally declared public health emergency, whichever is earlier.
