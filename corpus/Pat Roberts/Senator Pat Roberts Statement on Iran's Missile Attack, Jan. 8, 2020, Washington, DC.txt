Senator Pat Roberts Statement on Iran's Missile Attack


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) released the following statement regarding Iran's missile attack on U.S. military bases in Iraq.

"I am glad President Trump is sending a very strong message to Iranian leaders," said Sen. Roberts. "I believe it's equally as important that President Trump very clearly left the door open for further negotiations that could lead to more peaceful relations. I am relieved no American or Iraqi lives were lost in last night's attacks. As always, my prayers are with our servicemen and women. Semper Fi."
