Senator Roberts Applauds President Trump Signing $310 Billion in Additional PPP Funding Into Law


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) released the following statement today applauding President Donald Trump signing $310 billion in additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program into law:

"The Paycheck Protection Program is keeping small businesses across Kansas and the nation operational during this unprecedented time," said Sen. Roberts. "When the money ran dry after only two weeks, Congress needed to act fast to provide additional funding to keep these small businesses functioning. I am glad President Trump has approved $310 billion in additional funding so that these businesses and their employees can receive crucial assistance."

After the original $350 billion of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program ran out, the Senate passed additional funding for small business loans and hospitals on April 21st, the House of Representatives passed more funding on Thursday.
