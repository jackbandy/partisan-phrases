Roberts' Statement on Executive Order for Meat-Processing Plants During COVID-19


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts, R-Kan., Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, today released the following statement after President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order to keep meat-processing plants operational as critical infrastructure.

"Farmers, as well as the entire food system, are suffering from the rippling effects of plant closures due to COVID-19," said Roberts. "I thank President Trump for declaring the importance of keeping America's meat and poultry processing system functional and providing more protective gear and support for employees."

President Trump issued the Executive Order, which evokes the Defense Production Act to allow meat-processing plants to remain open during the COVID-19 emergency.
