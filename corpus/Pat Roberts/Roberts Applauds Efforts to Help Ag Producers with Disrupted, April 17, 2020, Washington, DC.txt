Roberts Applauds Efforts to Help Ag Producers with Disrupted, Lost Markets


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts, R-Kan., Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, today applauded an announcement from President Donald Trump and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue to alleviate agriculture sector hardships caused by the COVID-19 emergency.

The Coronavirus Food Assistance Program will distribute $19 billion to support farmers, ranchers, and consumers. Direct payments totaling $16 billion will assist producers of beef, pork, dairy, row crops, produce, and others whose markets have been disrupted or lost due to the COVID-19 emergency. USDA will use $3 billion to purchase and distribute excess produce, dairy, and meat to local and regional foodbanks and non-profit organizations.

"America's farmers and ranchers are resilient, and these are incredibly tough times," Roberts said. "Delivering this much needed relief expediently and efficiently will help producers manage their operations, as well as put food on the tables of folks who need it most."

"I thank President Trump and Secretary Perdue for listening to our input and delivering resources during this trying time. I will continue to engage with the Administration to make sure the needs of rural America are heard and addressed."

On March 27, the President signed the 'Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which included $9.5 billion in funds to assist agricultural producers, as well as additional resources to partially replenish the Commodity Credit Corporation. Additionally, Congress provided flexibility for the Secretary of Agriculture to purchase commodities for emergency distribution in the "Families First Coronavirus Response Act.''
