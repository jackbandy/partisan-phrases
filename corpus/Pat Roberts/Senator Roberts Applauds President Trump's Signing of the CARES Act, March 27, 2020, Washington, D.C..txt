Senator Roberts Applauds President Trump's Signing of the CARES Act


Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) released the following statement applauding President Donald Trump signing the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act into law today:

"Now that President Trump has signed the CARES Act into law, the American people can start to receive much needed relief during this time of crisis," said Senator Roberts. "Providing aid to Kansans and Americans across the country is crucial. The coronavirus continues to take its toll on the nation and the world and I am proud we finally came together for the good of the country with this bill that delivers necessary assistance to our workers, businesses and families."

The CARES Act is the third piece of legislation Congress has passed in response to the novel coronavirus. It passed the Senate on March 25th and the House of Representatives on March 27th.
