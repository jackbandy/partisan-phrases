Sen. Roberts Announces Information on the Paycheck Protection Program for Small Businesses and Lenders


Today, U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) announced details for small businesses who are interested in applying to the Paycheck Protection Program. The Paycheck Protection Program was signed into law on March 27, as part of a number of measures designed to support small businesses impacted by the economic disruption caused by COVID-19. It provides $350 billion in forgivable loans through the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Under the program, eligible business owners can receive forgivable loans to cover eight weeks of payroll and other expenses.

"The Paycheck Protection Program delivers much needed relief to Kansas small businesses by providing forgivable loans for businesses that keep employees on their payroll," said Sen. Roberts. "I encourage small businesses in need to contact their bank or credit union to apply to this program."
