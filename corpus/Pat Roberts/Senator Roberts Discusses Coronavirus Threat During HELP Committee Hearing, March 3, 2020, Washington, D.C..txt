Senator Roberts Discusses Coronavirus Threat During HELP Committee Hearing


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) today discussed the severity of the novel coronavirus during a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing titled, "An Emerging Disease Threat: How the U.S. Is Responding to COVID-19, the Novel Coronavirus."

"During the HELP Committee hearing we gained crucial insight into what it means when the CDC states the novel coronavirus is spreading," said Sen. Roberts. "The terminology "community spread' has caused panic to ensue across the country and it is critical we recognize the clarification made today that this term is meant to categorize the source of a case and not indicate a continued mass spread throughout communities in the United States. We need to take this situation seriously while avoiding overly alarmist rhetoric that does more harm than good."

The Senate HELP Committee's hearing today was aimed at learning more about the outbreak of the novel coronavirus and the threat it presents to the country. Dr. Anne Schuchat, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Robert Kadlec and Dr. Stephen Hahn were the four witnesses brought before the full committee for questioning.
