Senator Roberts' Statement on President Trump's State of the Union Address


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) today released the following statement on President Donald Trump's State of the Union Address:

"As Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I know firsthand how crucial a strong economy is to the livelihood of our farmers, ranchers, producers and manufacturers. Passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is a key example of what this congress has been able to accomplish when we put partisanship aside and work across the aisle for the good of the American people," said Senator Roberts.

"As Chairman, economic growth in agriculture exports and international trade is a top priority of mine, and it is a top priority for the president as well. I was pleased to hear President Trump tout the important role free and open trade plays in the United States economy, however, I will continue to express concern about the impacts of tariffs.

"As a Kansan, I work every day to ensure the success of my state. The current unemployment rate in Kansas is at 3.2 percent while real household income is up 8 percent. As the president stated, tax cuts and opportunity zones continue to create new jobs and investments across our nation.

"I am glad this president understands and shares Kansans' goal of economic prosperity and a safe, strong and proud America."

From day one of the Trump presidency, Senator Roberts has called for a strong trade agenda that supports U.S. agriculture. Senator Roberts is Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. He is also a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade and taxes.
