Roberts Announces $325 Million to Kansas in Relief Funding to Healthcare Providers Through CARES Act


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) today announced $325,135,950 in grants through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This funding is going to 3,320 healthcare providers in Kansas.

"I'm pleased to announce healthcare providers in Kansas will be receiving more than $325 million in relief funding from the Department of Health and Human Services," said Sen. Roberts. "This first distribution from HHS is crucial to the providers throughout our state who are on the frontlines fighting the coronavirus pandemic."

The CARES Act provides a total of $100 billion in funding for health care. HHS is delivering the initial $30 billion of CARES Act public health and social services emergency funding to states in response to COVID-19. This funding is being distributed to providers' share of Medicare fee-for-service reimbursements in 2019. This funding will assist providers who are struggling financially as they respond to the coronavirus.

Sen. Roberts encourages HHS to include non-Medicare providers in subsequent awards.
