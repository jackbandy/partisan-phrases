Senator Roberts Attends White House Signing Ceremony for USMCA


Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, released the following statement today after attending the White House signing ceremony for the United States-Mexico-Canada-Trade Agreement (USMCA).

"I am proud to have stood with President Trump as he signed the USMCA implementing legislation at the White House today. It has been over a year since President Trump initially signed this crucial trade agreement, and its implementation is long past due," said Sen. Roberts. "Today is a great day for farmers, ranchers, producers and manufacturers -- not only in Kansas but across the entire country. As Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I have heard firsthand about the urgent need for this trade agreement, and I am pleased it has finally been brought to fruition. I hope that Canada moves quickly to approve the agreement so that all three countries can realize its benefits."

Senator Roberts started a web series called "Trade Tuesday" that gave a platform to the many Kansans who voiced their support for the USMCA. Over the course of several months, Roberts compiled a total of 14 interviews consistently urging the USMCA's final passage.
