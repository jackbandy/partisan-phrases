Senate Passes United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) released the following statement after the Senate's passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) today. Senator Roberts voted in favor of the trade agreement, which passed the Senate 89-10.

"It has been over a year since President Trump signed the USMCA, and I am proud that today the Senate has finally passed this critical trade agreement," said Sen. Roberts. "Today marks a crucial moment for our nation's trading relationships with Mexico and Canada. As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, I know firsthand what this passage means for the success of our farmers, ranchers, producers and manufacturers who fiercely rely on trade. Now with the USMCA on its way to the President's desk, I urge President Trump to act quickly in implementing this agreement so hardworking Americans can start reaping the benefits from the certainty it ensures."

Senator Roberts started a web series called "Trade Tuesday" that gave a platform to the many Kansans who voiced their support for the USMCA. Over the course of several months, Roberts compiled a total of 14 interviews consistently urging the USMCA's final passage.
