Senator Pat Roberts Applauds HELP Committee Passage of USMCA


U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), voted in favor of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement today. The USMCA was voted out of committee with a 22-1 vote.

"I am pleased to see the USMCA pass out of the HELP Committee and move one step closer to the Senate floor," said Sen. Roberts. "We must now act swiftly to pass this crucial trade agreement for farmers, ranchers, producers and manufacturers - not only in Kansas, but across the United States, Mexico and Canada."
