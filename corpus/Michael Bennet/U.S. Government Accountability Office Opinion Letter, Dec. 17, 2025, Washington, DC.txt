Department of Commerce, National           Telecommunications and Information Administration--          Applicability of the Congressional Review Act to           Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program           Restructuring Policy Notice      File: B-337604      Date: December 16, 2025                                    DIGEST

On June 6, 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce, National       Telecommunications and Information Administration published a       notice entitled, Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment       (BEAD) Program: BEAD Restructuring Policy Notice (Policy       Notice). The Policy Notice modifies and replaces certain       requirements outlined in the May 12, 2022, Notice of Funding       Opportunity for the BEAD Program--a grant program to provide       high-speed broadband access throughout the United States and       several territories.

The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires that before a       rule can take effect, an agency must submit the rule to both       the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as the       Comptroller General. CRA adopts the definition of ``rule''       under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) but excludes       certain categories of rules from coverage. We conclude that       the Policy Notice meets the APA definition of a rule, and no       CRA exception applies. Therefore, the Policy Notice is a rule       subject to CRA's submission requirements.                                   DECISION

On June 6, 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce       (Commerce), National Telecommunications and Information       Administration (NTIA) published a notice entitled, Broadband       Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program: BEAD       Restructuring Policy Notice (Policy Notice). The Policy       Notice modifies and replaces certain requirements outlined in       the May 12, 2022, Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for       the BEAD Program--a grant program to provide high-speed       broadband access throughout the United States and several       territories. We received a request for a decision as to       whether the Policy Notice is a rule for purposes of the       Congressional Review Act (CRA). As discussed below, we       conclude that the Policy Notice is a rule subject to CRA's       submission requirements.

Our practice when rendering decisions is to contact the       relevant agencies to obtain factual information and their       legal views on the subject of the request. Accordingly, we       reached out to Commerce on June 30, 2025. Although Commerce       did not provide a substantive response with its legal views,       we determined we have sufficient information to issue a       decision on this matter.                                  BACKGROUND       Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program

The Infrastructure, Investment, and Jobs Act (IIJA)       established the BEAD Program, and appropriated $42.45 billion       for it. The BEAD Program is a grant program administered by       NTIA that funds high-speed broadband access initiatives, with       particular focus on unserved and underserved locations. Funds       for the BEAD Program are allocated by formulas in IIJA to       Eligible Entities, which include all 50 states, the District       of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S.       Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. In advance       of funds being distributed to Eligible Entities, the       Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and       Information (Assistant Secretary) must approve each Eligible       Entity's letter of intent, initial proposal, or final       proposal.

IIJA required the Assistant Secretary to issue a NOFO for       the BEAD Program within 180 days of IIJA's enactment. NTIA       published the BEAD NOFO on May 12, 2022. The BEAD NOFO       explains the BEAD Program structure; provides information on       amounts made available to Eligible Entities under the       program; describes the grant application and review process;       and outlines the eligibility requirements for the program.       The BEAD NOFO also imposes several obligations on Eligible       Entities and subgrantees, such as coordinating with political       subdivisions and Tribal governments; targeting engagement       efforts at underrepresented communities; giving priority to       projects based in part on a demonstrated record of and plans       to be in compliance with federal labor and employment laws;       and demonstrating that the Eligible Entities have       sufficiently accounted for current and future weather- and       climate-related risks to new infrastructure projects.       Finally, the BEAD NOFO clarifies some technical aspects of       the BEAD Program. For example, IIJA instructs that when       awarding subgrants using BEAD Program funds, Eligible       Entities shall prioritize funding for deployment of       infrastructure for ``priority broadband projects,'' which the       BEAD NOFO subsequently defines as ``those that use end-to-end       fiber-optic architecture,'' rather than other technologies.      BEAD Restructuring Policy Notice

On June 6, 2025, NTIA published a Policy Notice that       ``modifies and replaces certain requirements outlined in the       BEAD [NOFO].'' The Policy Notice states that it ``eliminates       burdensome and non-statutory requirements contained in the       NOFO published on May 12, 2022'' and prohibits Eligible       Entities ``from imposing any of the obligations removed by       this Policy Notice on subgrantees as part of the BEAD       Program.'' According to the Policy Notice, ``Each Eligible       Entity must comply with this Policy Notice to gain approval       of its Final Proposal from the Assistant Secretary.'' The       Policy Notice also rescinded two previously issued Policy       Notices for the BEAD Program.

The Policy Notice removed several requirements imposed on       Eligible Entities and subgrantees in the BEAD NOFO, such as       requirements related to labor, employment, and workforce       development; climate change; open access and net neutrality;       local coordination and stakeholder engagement; and low-cost       service options. The Policy Notice also amended some of the       technological requirements of the BEAD Program. For example,       the Policy Notice ``eliminates the `Fiber Preference' section       of the BEAD NOFO and permits Eligible Entities to select from       all qualifying technologies,'' rather than limiting priority       broadband projects to those using end-to-end fiber.

Furthermore, the Policy Notice requires Eligible Entities       to conduct an additional subgrantee selection round, which       requires Eligible Entities to rescind all provisional       subaward selections. The Policy Notice also revises the       scoring rubric that Eligible Entities are to use to evaluate       subgrantee applications, placing particular emphasis ``on       minimizing the cost of deployment under the BEAD Program.''       Finally, the Policy Notice identifies other changes to the       administration of the BEAD Program, including changes related       to optimizing program locations, funding for allowable non-      deployment purposes, and expedited permitting under the       National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 4321-      4347.      The Congressional Review Act

CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires federal agencies to submit a       report on each new rule to both houses of Congress and to the       Comptroller General for review before a rule can take effect.       The report must contain a copy of the rule, ``a concise       general statement relating to the rule,'' and the rule's       proposed effective date. CRA allows Congress to review and       disapprove of federal agency rules for a period of 60 days       using special procedures. If a resolution of disapproval is       enacted, then the new rule has no force or effect.

CRA adopts the definition of rule under the Administrative       Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 551(4), which states that       a rule is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of       general or particular applicability and future effect       designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy       or describing the organization, procedure, or practice       requirements of an agency.'' However, CRA excludes three       categories of rules from coverage: (1) rules of particular       applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or       personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or       obligations of non-agency parties.

NTIA did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the       Comptroller General on the BEAD Policy Notice.                                  DISCUSSION

At issue here is whether the Policy Notice meets CRA's       definition of a rule, which adopts APA's definition of a       rule, with three exceptions. As explained below, we conclude       that it does. In addition, we conclude that the Policy Notice       does not fall within any CRA exceptions. Therefore, the       Policy Notice is a rule subject to CRA's submission       requirements.      The Policy Notice is a Rule Under APA

Applying APA's definition of ``rule,'' the Policy Notice       meets all of the required elements. First, the Policy Notice       is an agency statement because it was issued by NTIA, a       federal agency.

Second, the Policy Notice is of future effect. An agency       action of future effect is one ``concerned with policy       considerations for the future rather than the evaluation of       past or present conduct.'' The Policy Notice concerns the       administration of the BEAD Program going forward and outlines       changes that Eligible Entities and subgrantees will be       required to make to their applications for the program.       Therefore, the Policy Notice has future effect.

Third, the Policy Notice implements, interprets, and       prescribes law or policy. An agency action implements,       interprets, or prescribes law or policy When the action       creates new regulations, changes regulatory requirements or       official policy, or when it alters how the agency will       exercise its discretion, among other things. The Policy       Notice here implements the requirements of the BEAD Program       outlined in IIJA by describing how NTIA will administer the       program going forward and outlining the criteria Eligible       Entities and subgrantees seeking funding under the program       must meet. Furthermore, the Policy Notice prescribes policy       by imposing new requirements on Eligible Entities. For       example, it states that Eligible Entities ``shall eliminate       the following non-statutory requirements from BEAD       application scoring, subgrantee agreements, and subgrantee       reporting requirements[,]'' and that ``Eligible Entities are       hereby prohibited from imposing any of the obligations       removed by this Policy Notice on subgrantees as part of the       BEAD Program.'' In addition, the Policy Notice alters the       requirements for the prioritization of projects under the       program by providing a new definition of a ``priority       broadband project'' to include technologies other than end-      to-end fiber, which similarly implements and prescribes law       or policy.

Our conclusion here is consistent with our previous       decisions finding that agency actions implement, interpret,       or prescribe law or policy when they define procedures by       which potential recipients may apply for grant programs, and       describe the process by which the agency will evaluate those       applications. For example, in B-335488, Oct. 18, 2023, we       considered whether a U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)       NOFO, which ``outlined the precise eligibility and selection       criteria for each program, as well as the types of projects       eligible to receive DOT funding under each one'' and changed       the criteria used to evaluate applicants and make award       decisions from a previous NOFO--including how certain       criteria were rated--was a rule subject to CRA. We concluded       that the DOT NOFO for three IIJA grant programs implemented       or prescribed law or policy and described agency procedures,       as it described the process by which eligible entities may       apply for three grant programs and defined how DOT would       evaluate these applications, among other things. Similarly       here, the Policy Notice alters the criteria used to evaluate       applications under the program and changes program       requirements, as established by the BEAD NOFO. As a result,       the Policy Notice also satisfies this element of the APA       definition.      CRA Exceptions

We must next determine whether any of CRA's three       exceptions apply. CRA provides for three types of rules that       are not subject to its requirements: (1) rules of particular       applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or       personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or       obligations of non-agency parties.      (1) Rule of Particular Applicability

The Policy Notice is a rule of general applicability,       rather than particular applicability. Rules of particular       applicability are rules addressed to specific, identified       persons or entities and determine actions that person or       entity may or may not take, considering facts and       circumstances specific to those persons or entities. Here,       the Policy Notice does not apply to a particular entity.       Instead, the Policy Notice applies to all Eligible Entities       under the BEAD Program--all 50 states, the District of       Columbia, and several territories--and notes that ``[e]ach       Eligible Entity must comply with this Policy Notice to gain       approval of its Final Proposal from the Assistant       Secretary.'' Therefore, the Policy Notice is a rule of       general applicability, rather than particular applicability.      (2) Rule of Agency Management or Personnel

The Policy Notice is not a rule of agency management or       personnel. We have previously held that rules that fall into       this category relate to purely internal matters. Because the       Policy Notice is concerned with the administration of the       BEAD Program, rather than management of NTIA or its       personnel, it does not meet the second exception.      (3) Rule of Agency Organization, Procedure, or Practice with           No Substantial Effect on Non-Agency Parties

Lastly, the Policy Notice is not a rule of agency       organization, procedure, or practice that does not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties. We have previously explained that this exception was       modeled on the APA exception to notice-and-comment rulemaking       requirements for ``rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice.'' The purpose of the APA exception is to ensure       ``that agencies retain latitude in organizing their internal       operations,'' so long as such rules do not have a substantial       impact on non-agency parties. Following this interpretation       in the CRA context, we have only applied CRA's third       exception to rules that primarily focus on the internal       operations of an agency. For instance, in B-329926, Sept. 10,       2018, we found that updates to a Social Security       Administration (SSA) hearings manual governing SSA       adjudicators' use of information from the internet qualified       as a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice.       There, the manual outlined procedures for SSA employees to       follow in processing and adjudicating benefits claims.       Because the manual was directed to and binding only on SSA       officials without imposing new burdens on claimants, we       concluded that the manual met the third exception.

However, rules that are directed at and primarily concerned       with the behavior of non-agency parties are not rules of       agency organization, procedure, or practice. Here, the Policy       Statement is primarily concerned with the behavior of       Eligible Entities and subgrantees, rather than with the       internal operations of NTIA itself. The Policy Notice       prescribes actions program participants should and should not       take in carrying out the BEAD Program. Therefore, it is not a       rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice.

Moreover, the Policy Notice cannot fall under this       exception because it also substantially affects the rights or       obligations of non-agency parties. In the federal funding       context, we have previously determined that rules amending or       clarifying the requirements of existing financial assistance       programs for non-agency parties substantially affect those       parties' rights or obligations. Where a rule modifies an       existing financial assistance program through actions such as       defining eligibility requirements and selection criteria, it       has a substantial effect on non-agency parties who       participate in the program. Here, the Policy Notice modifies       and clarifies how NTIA will administer the BEAD Program.       Among other things, the Policy Notice eliminates certain       requirements previously imposed on Eligible Entities and       subgrantees through the BEAD NOFO; alters the criteria by       which NTIA will evaluate applications; requires Eligible       Entities to conduct an additional round of subgrantee       selection after rescinding aII preliminary and provisional       subaward selections; and modifies the agency's interpretation       of statutory terms, such as ``priority broadband project.''       By changing the manner in which the BEAD Program is       administered, these actions substantially affect the rights       or obligations of non-agency parties participating in the       BEAD Program. Therefore, the Policy Notice cannot fall into       CRA's third exception.                                  CONCLUSION

The Policy Notice is a rule for purposes of CRA because it       meets the definition of a rule under APA and no CRA exception       applies. Therefore, the Policy Notice is subject to CRA's       requirement that it be submitted to Congress and the       Comptroller General before it can take effect.
