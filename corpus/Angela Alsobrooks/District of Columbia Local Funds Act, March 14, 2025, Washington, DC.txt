Ms. ALSOBROOKS. Madam President, I, too, want to thank Senators  Collins, Van Hollen, Warner, and Kaine. I am glad we can work together  in this bipartisan way to ensure fairness for the residents of  Washington, DC.

I rise today to speak for the over 700,000 DC residents who do not  have representation in this body. They are our friends and our  neighbors. Beyond those who work in DC, Maryland partners with DC on  resources like emergency services, police, water, and more. This  bipartisan, stand-alone bill ensures that DC tax dollars stay in DC.  Again, these funds that have been cut are tax dollars that have  literally already been paid by DC residents. All this bill does is to  continue to ensure that DC receives what it is owed. So I urge all of  my colleagues today to join me in voting yes.

Thank you.
