Gulf of America Act

Ms. RIVAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding to  me.

Mr. Speaker, there are many issues that we could be talking about  today, like lowering the cost of living, protecting Medicaid and Social  Security, or protecting immigrant communities. Instead, House  Republicans are prioritizing Trump's vanity project, renaming the Gulf  of Mexico, like that is going to help Americans with their cost of  living.

Millions of Americans are struggling because of Trump's policies that  are tanking our economy and raising the cost of living. The Republicans  in this Chamber have yet to put forth anything that addresses their  issues.

I am disappointed that House Republicans blocked my amendment to this  bill that would actually help working families across the country. My  amendment would require the official name change to not take effect  until the Department of the Interior can prove that this bill would  lower food prices, including the price of eggs, spur economic growth,  create jobs, and lower  the unemployment rate, but the Republicans voted it down in committee  and blocked it from getting to the floor today. That shows where their  priorities are.

It was not just the House Republicans who opposed helping working  families. The Trump White House also hated this amendment and sent out  a statement of opposition. They went to FOX News to complain that we  are doing our job to serve the people. Call me crazy, but I believe  that the work we do in Congress should improve the lives of the  American people.

As the Congresswoman proudly representing the San Fernando Valley in  California, I believe that the true test of how we are as a country is  how we treat our most vulnerable, and this bill fails that test.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this ridiculous  bill.
