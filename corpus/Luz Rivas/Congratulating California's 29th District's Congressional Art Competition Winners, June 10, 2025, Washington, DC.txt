Congratulating California's 29th District's Congressional Art Competition Winners


Ms. RIVAS. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce California's 29th  District's winners of this year's Congressional Art Competition.

In third place, from Ulysses S. Grant High School in Valley Glen, we  have Daniel Graciano's ``Whispers of the Woods.'' Daniel's piece shows  a lonely cabin sitting quietly by the water's edge, embraced by  towering pines and deep shadows. This ink drawing captures a sense of  isolation of nature, where time stands still and every tree tells a  story. It is a perfect escape drawn in silence. This piece will be  hanging in my district office in Arleta.

In second place, from Van Nuys High School, we have Gayane Charyan's  ``Forlorn Art Piece.'' In this piece, we see a girl sitting alone on a  swing. The shadow of herself is her only company. This is an important  piece that lets people know that loneliness and mental health affects  all of us.

Mr. Speaker, I also take this time to share the 988 lifeline that is  available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Help is available for everyone  who needs it.

This piece will be hanging in my Washington, D.C., office.

Mr. Speaker, in first place, from PUC Lakeview Charter High School in  Sylmar, we have Nevaeh Cortez' piece, ``Heavy Minded.'' This piece  shows how your inner thoughts can sometimes feel heavy. However, this  piece also shows how to appreciate the beauty in the things that you  find joy in. This piece will proudly be on display in the Cannon tunnel  for the next year.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud of all the students who submitted their  pieces for this year's art competition. This year's submissions told  personal stories about what it means to be a high schooler in 2025. I  thank all the students who submitted a piece, and I look forward to  seeing where these students' talents carry them in their future  endeavors.
