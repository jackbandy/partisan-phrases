Standing with Senator Alex Padilla

Ms. RIVAS. Mr. Speaker, Americans watched today in horror as the  Trump administration assaulted a United States Senator.

Senator Alex Padilla is not only the senior U.S. Senator in  California, but he is my childhood friend, my mentor, and the Senator  to my constituents of the 29th Congressional District in California.

What we witnessed today were actions of an authoritative government.  The Trump administration quickly resorted to violent actions to silence  Senator Padilla, erase our democracy, and rewrite our Nation's values.

Every American should be outraged at how the Trump administration is  treating anyone who dares to stand in their way. Whether you are a U.S.  Senator, a U.S. citizen, or an immigrant, no one is protected by the  Trump regime. It is my job to ensure that my constituents, immigrants,  and all Americans are protected from this administration's horrible  actions.

If a U.S. Senator is treated this way on camera, imagine how they are  treating immigrants when the cameras are off.

Mr. Speaker, I stand today as a proud daughter of immigrants. I stand  with Senator Padilla. I stand for all the residents of California's  29th Congressional District.
