Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families

Ms. RIVAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Leader Jeffries and Chair Ledger  Fernandez for hosting this important discussion on the disastrous  impact Republican cuts to Medicaid would have on women and children  across the country.

In the middle of the night, Republicans on the Rules Committee will  consider a bill that contains the largest cuts to Medicaid in our  country's history. This outright assault on healthcare will result in  13.7 million Americans losing their health coverage, including many of  the 370,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in my district.

This includes people like Yvette from Van Nuys who said that she  wants to retire without spending a large portion of her pension on  medical coverage.

I also heard from Joe from Panorama City who, without the help of  Medicaid, would not be able to afford medical treatments for his  children.

Cutting Medicaid will be a disaster for families across the country.  I stand with my House Democratic Caucus colleagues in protecting it  from Republicans' cruel and extreme budget.
