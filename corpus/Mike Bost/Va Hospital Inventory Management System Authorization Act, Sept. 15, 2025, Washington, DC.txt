Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3494) to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  carry out an information technology system and prioritize certain  requirements to manage supply chains for medical facilities of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3494

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``VA Hospital Inventory       Management System Authorization Act''.            SEC. 2. MANAGEMENT OF SUPPLY CHAINS FOR MEDICAL FACILITIES OF                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.

(a) Authorization.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is       authorized to--

(2) implement such system.

(b) Pilot.--If the Secretary purchases or develops a system       under subsection (a), the Secretary shall carry out a pilot       program at one Veterans Health Administration facility before       implementing the system throughout the Veterans Health       Administration. The pilot program shall be designed to       determine whether the functions of the system are       satisfactory.

(1) a comprehensive supply chain strategy to guide       enterprise-wide implementation, as recommended in the report       of the Comptroller General of the United States titled ``VA       Acquisition Management: Comprehensive Supply Chain Management       Strategy Key to Address Existing Challenges'' (GAO-21-445T;       published March 24, 2021), which includes success metrics, a       plan for data standardization, and staffing models;

Section 5503(d)(7) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``November 30, 2031'' and inserting       ``December 31, 2032''.

Mr. BOST.  3494, as amended.

Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3494, as amended,  offered by Representative Kiggans. This bill would ensure VA finally  has a reliable system to track hospital supplies and equipment.

For too long, an unreliable system has wasted taxpayer dollars and  left doctors and nurses searching for basic tools they need to care for  our veterans. That kind of mismanagement is unacceptable. Veterans  should never face delays in treatment because a hospital can't find the  supplies and equipment it needs.

A modern supply chain means stronger care for our veterans, smarter  spending for taxpayers, and greater accountability at the VA. It means  no excuses, no wasted dollars, and no veterans left waiting because the  system failed them. That is exactly what this bill delivers for our  Nation's heroes.

I thank Representative Kiggans for her continued leadership on the  committee and her tireless commitment to solving this problem at the  VA. I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 3494, as amended.

Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Kiggans), the sponsor of this bill.

Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to  support this legislation.

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
