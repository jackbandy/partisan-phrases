Recognizing the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir


Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 75th anniversary of the  Battle of Chosin Reservoir and recognize the heroic veterans of the  Chosin Few.

Seventy-five years ago, in the bitter winter of 1950, 30,000 United  Nations forces, most of them United States Marines, were surrounded by  more than 120,000 Chinese troops near the Chosin Reservoir in North  Korea. Facing the freezing conditions, overwhelming odds, and heavy  casualties, these men executed a successful fighting retreat to the  port of Hungnam. In doing so, these heroes evacuated over 100,000  troops and civilians, through unyielding courage, sacrifice, and  determination.

The Battle of Chosin Reservoir is remembered not only for the extreme  conditions that were faced, but more importantly the courage of those  who fought. Over the course of 14 days, 17 Medals of Honor and 78  Service Cross Medals were awarded to these men for their actions in  combat.

Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring the Chosin Few and in  recognizing the enduring legacy of courage, sacrifice, and freedom that  their service represents.
