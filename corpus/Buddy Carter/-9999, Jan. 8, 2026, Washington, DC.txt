Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend  and my colleague, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.

Doug was always a steady voice for his district and a principled  Member of this House. He was serious about policy, direct in his  approach, and deeply committed to the people he represented, but anyone  who has worked alongside Doug also knows he had quite a sense of humor.

I learned that early on. Doug and I both did a lot of 1 minutes. He  used to intentionally leave this speaking podium raised up to above my  head to remind me of how short I was and how tall he was.

However, that small moment says a lot about Doug. Doug worked hard.  He took his job seriously, and he still found room for good-natured  humor and friendship.

Tonight, we thank Congressman LaMalfa for his service, his  leadership, and the many moments he shared with all of us.
