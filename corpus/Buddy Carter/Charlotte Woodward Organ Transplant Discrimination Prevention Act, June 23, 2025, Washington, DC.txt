Charlotte Woodward Organ Transplant Discrimination Prevention Act

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Charlotte Woodward  Organ Transplant Discrimination Prevention Act, which prohibits  discrimination against people with disabilities in the organ transplant  system.

This bill prohibits covered entities from determining that an  individual is ineligible to receive a transplant or denying a  transplant based solely on the fact that the individual has a  disability.

The bill is named after Charlotte Woodward, an advocate with Down  syndrome who received a lifesaving heart transplant a decade ago. Since  then, she has advocated tirelessly to ensure that others living with  Down syndrome and other disabilities have the same access to lifesaving  care that she did.

Unfortunately, there have been too many instances in which  individuals with disabilities have been denied a lifesaving organ  transplant, and this is unacceptable.

Congress has the opportunity to help ensure that individuals with  disabilities are treated fairly within the organ transplant system. No  one, Mr. Speaker--no one--should be denied access to an organ  transplant just because they have a disability.

That is why I am proud to support this bill, which will make sure  that all Americans, no matter their disability status, will be able to  receive the access to care that they need and deserve.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friends, Representative Cammack and  Representative Dingell, for their leadership on this important issue,  and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
