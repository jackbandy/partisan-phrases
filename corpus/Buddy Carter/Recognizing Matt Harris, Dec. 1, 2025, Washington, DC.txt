Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  unanimous appointment of Matt Harris as president and chief executive  officer of the Northwest Georgia Joint Development Authority.

Mr. Harris brings a strong track record of innovation and leadership  in education and community development. Previously, he served as  principal and coordinator of innovation for Walker County Schools,  where he led Gilbert Elementary to national recognition by establishing  Georgia's first public school forest kindergarten and earning U.S.  Department of Education Green Ribbon status. Beyond his work in public  education, Mr. Harris has private-sector experience as a businessowner  and operator.

In his new position, Mr. Harris is charged with advancing business  recruitment, strengthening site and infrastructure readiness, and  fostering prosperity across northwest Georgia. The board of directors  noted his professionalism and commitment as key reasons for his  selection.

Please join me in congratulating Matt Harris on this important  appointment and thanking him for his service to our region.
