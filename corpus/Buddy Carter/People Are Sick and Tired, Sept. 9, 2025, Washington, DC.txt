Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and I thank him for his kind comments.

I did have two granddaughters in Texas, and they are okay, but they  did lose their cousin, Janie Hunt, 9 years old. What a tragedy. I thank  both of these gentlemen for their work during that time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Judy  Jurgensen Melroy.

A native of Savannah, Georgia, Mrs. Melroy lived a life defined by  faith, service, and love for others. Her passion for learning led her  to become a teacher, where she inspired countless young people and  passed on her joy for education to future generations.

At home, she poured her heart into raising her sons, who remember her  not only for her guidance but also for her playful spirit, often  joining them in the yard. Through her devotion, each pursued the  highest levels of education, a reflection of the values she instilled.

Beyond her family and classroom, Mrs. Melroy was known throughout her  community as a nurturer, always ready to offer comfort, encouragement,  and care. Her faith was central to her life, and her talents as a  painter and singer brought joy to all who knew her.

To her husband, Donald, to her sons, Michael, Chris, and Joel, today  we celebrate her extraordinary legacy of love, service, and light.
