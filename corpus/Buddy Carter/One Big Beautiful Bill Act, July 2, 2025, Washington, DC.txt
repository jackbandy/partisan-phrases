One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1. We have a choice. We can continue down our current fiscally  unsustainable path where we have waiting lists for Medicaid,  insufficient border security resources, and are facing the largest tax  hike in American history, or we can change course.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act ushers in the golden age of America,  as our great President says, where taxpayers, not illegal immigrants,  are put first. It eliminates taxes on tips and overtime and brings tax  relief to seniors. It saves and sustains Medicaid so it is there for  those who truly need it. It secures our southern border, making every  community safe.

All that is required of us, to unleash this prosperity, Mr. Speaker,  is to vote ``yes.'' I am proud to vote for this bill, and I encourage  my colleagues to unleash America's shackles and make this country work  for those who work for it every single day.
