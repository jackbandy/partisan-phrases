In 2025, the Army marked its 250th birthday with community  celebrations and tributes to the generations that defended our Nation.  Its annual Year in Review also features stories of soldiers preparing  for future challenges and meeting recruiting and retention goals well  ahead of schedule, demonstrating renewed commitment and purpose and  included in this Year in Review was Fort Stewart's Rock of the Marne.

This retrospective honors those who served today and those who served  before. It reminds us that our Army stands ready to protect the  homeland, support partners, and uphold peace at home and abroad.

Today, we celebrate the Army's achievements in 2025 and thank our  soldiers for their enduring dedication to duty and to country.
