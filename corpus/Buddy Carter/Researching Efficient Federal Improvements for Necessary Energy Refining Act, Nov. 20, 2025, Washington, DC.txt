Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  3109, the REFINER Act.

For too long, America has fallen behind in refining capacity. In  fact, we have lost an estimated 1 million barrels of fuel per day due  to low refining capacity.

The Biden administration declared war on American energy by  suspending oil and gas leasing on Federal lands, delaying permits for  energy infrastructure, and canceling the Keystone XL pipeline.

With President Trump and House Republicans in charge, those days are  over with now.

The REFINER Act offers a commonsense solution to this critical issue.  This bill requires the National Petroleum Council to submit a report to  Congress analyzing the capacity of American refining and recommending  how we can increase our refining capacity.

The American people elected us to lower prices, especially prices at  the pump. This bill will provide crucial data and guidance on how we  can best reinforce our domestic energy infrastructure and help ensure  fuel costs are low for Americans.

This bill is an important step toward delivering American energy  dominance. It is something the President has worked on and is diligent  about.

If we are going to power domestic manufacturing, if we are going to  beat China in the AI race, and then deliver on affordable energy for  all, we must ensure that domestic refining can keep up.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend Representative Latta for introducing  this important piece of legislation, and I urge its immediate adoption.
