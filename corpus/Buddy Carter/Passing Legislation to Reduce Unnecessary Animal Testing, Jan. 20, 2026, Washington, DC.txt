Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the House to  immediately consider and pass the FDA Modernization Act 3.0, which  reduces unnecessary animal testing.

Many of our families would feel incomplete without the pets and  animals that bring unconditional love to our lives. However, there are  millions of animals in our country that are forced into inhumane  testing for pharmaceutical development.

When I think about healthcare policy in Congress, I recognize the  need to protect the lives of those who cannot defend themselves. In  2022, I helped pass the FDA Modernization Act 2.0, allowing drug  developers to use modern, animal-free testing methods for the first  time.

This act was intended to cut the requirements from the FDA that put  so many animals in harm's way. Unfortunately, under the Biden  administration, the FDA did not fully implement this law, limiting its  effectiveness and leaving animals at risk.

That is why I introduced a bill called the FDA Modernization Act 3.0  to compel the FDA's career bureaucrats to finally implement the will of  the Congress and the American people.

This bill not only helps to reduce and replace the use of animals in  nonclinical research, but it works to improve these methods and reduce  the time of drug development.

Mr. Speaker, by passing this bill, Congress can save animal lives and  accelerate the delivery of safer, more affordable, and effective  medications.
