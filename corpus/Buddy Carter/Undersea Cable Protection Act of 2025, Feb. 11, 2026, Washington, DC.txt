Undersea Cable Protection Act of 2025

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 261, the Undersea  Cable Protection Act of 2025.

Undersea fiber optic cables carry roughly 95 percent of all  intercontinental internet traffic and nearly all transoceanic digital  communications.

Trillions of dollars in financial transactions--trillions--global  trade data, cloud computing, and secure government communications  depend on these cables every single day. They are critical  infrastructure, just as essential as ports, as pipelines, and our power  grids.

Yet despite their importance, the United States has allowed  overregulation and duplicative permitting to stand in the way of  deploying and maintaining this infrastructure, especially on the West  Coast, where permitting delays and overlapping approvals have made it  effectively impossible to lay new cables in certain areas for decades.  The chairman just described what we are talking about here.

These projects weren't stopped because they failed environmental  review. They were stopped because of bureaucracy. That is the problem  that H.R. 261 is designed to fix. Today, even when an undersea cable  project has already received full authorization from a Federal or State  agency, it can still be forced through an additional duplicate  permitting process with the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries.

That extra layer adds years of delay, drives up costs, and  discourages investment without providing meaningful environmental  protection. H.R. 261 clarifies that once a project has been lawfully  approved at the State and Federal levels, it should not be required to  obtain an additional permit for the same activity.

Let me be clear. This bill does not weaken environmental protections.  All existing environmental laws, reviews, and interagency coordination  requirements remain fully intact. This is about eliminating redundancy,  not eliminating oversight.

This matters for States like Georgia. Georgia's economy depends on  global connectivity from the Port of Savannah and our logistics and  supply chain networks, to manufacturing defense contractors, data  centers, and a growing technology sector. Reliable undersea cable  infrastructure supports jobs. It supports trade and economic growth  across the country.

There is also a serious national security component to this. Undersea  cables carry sensitive government and military communications. Delays  in installing, repairing, or maintaining this infrastructure create  real vulnerability to our national security. Even today, our  adversaries, like China, are actively targeting global communication  networks, especially cutting undersea cables that connect us to our  allies, like Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.

Secure, resilient connectivity is not optional. It is a strategic  necessity. H.R. 261 is a solution that offers a balanced, commonsense  solution. It cuts unnecessary red tape. It preserves environmental  safeguards. It strengthens our economy. Most importantly, it protects  America's national security.

I implore this Congress to pass this legislation to secure America's  technological dominance and fortify our national security.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 261.
