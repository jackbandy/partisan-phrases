Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of our  country's heroes, Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer Scott Ruskan.

Scott Ruskan hails from New Jersey and was an accountant at KPMG  before enlisting to serve in the Coast Guard in 2021.

After joining the U.S. Coast Guard, Scott participated in and  completed rescue swimmer training and was stationed in Corpus Christi,  Texas.

In the early morning of July 4, Scott, along with other local and  Federal first responders, was dispatched to aid in rescue efforts at  Camp Mystic in Kerr County as flooding from the nearby Guadalupe River  hit the camp.

Scott, while leading the Coast Guard triage at Camp Mystic, was able  to save over 160 people through his efforts, including my twin  granddaughters, whose birthday is today.

Scott's selflessness and bravery in the face of danger is something  that we should all strive to embody.

I thank Scott for his courage and for changing the course of many  families' lives, including my family. May God bless him.
