Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of  our Nation's greatest World War II museums, the National Museum of the  Mighty Eighth Air Force.

The museum, located just outside of Savannah in Pooler, Georgia,  received a preserved B-24 Liberator from the National Museum of the  U.S. Air Force at Barksdale Air Force Base.

The aircraft is one of the three remaining B-24 relics from World War  II, originally named Rupert the Roo II.

Rupert will undergo a brief restoration process and will join a B-17  Flying Fortress to become the newest centerpiece of the museum.

These two machines represent the complete collection of the aircraft  flown by the Mighty Eighth throughout the Second World War in both the  European and Pacific theaters.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the Barksdale Air Force Base for reallocation  and preservation of these historic planes. Efforts like these allow the  National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force to fully educate the  public on the Nation's most storied Air Force division ever known.
