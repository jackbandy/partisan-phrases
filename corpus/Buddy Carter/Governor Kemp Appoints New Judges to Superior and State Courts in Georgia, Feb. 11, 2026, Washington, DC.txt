Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  newly appointed Georgia State and Superior Court judges. These judges  are all accomplished attorneys and legal professionals who are stepping  into vital roles within Georgia's judicial system.

Among those appointed is a native of Brunswick, Georgia, in my  district, Steven Blackerby.

Mr. Blackerby, who was a partner at Brown Readdick, will now serve  the Superior Court of the Brunswick Judicial Circuit. Mr. Blackerby  earned his bachelor of arts in English from Emory University and his  juris doctor with honors from the University of Georgia School of Law,  where he served on the editorial board of the ``Journal of Intellectual  Property Law.'' He was also a member of both the Federalist Society and  the Student Bar Association.

Mr. Blackerby has devoted more than two decades of his career to a  wide range of legal matters, with expertise in representing local  governments and serving as city attorney for multiple municipalities.

Mr. Blackerby's experience is notable, and he will certainly excel in  this new position.
