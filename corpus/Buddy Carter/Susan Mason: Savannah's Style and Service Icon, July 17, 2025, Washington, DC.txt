Susan Mason: Savannah's Style and Service Icon


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Susan Mason, a resident of Savannah, Georgia, who has dedicated 40  years of her life to bringing elegance, excellence, and warmth to  thousands of life's most meaningful celebrations.

When Susan Mason founded her catering company in 1985, she was  recently divorced, living rent-free in a friend's home, and inspired by  a then-up-and-coming Martha Stewart.

What she lacked in resources, she made up for with resolve, talent,  and a sparkling sense of humor. Over the next four decades, Susan Mason  Catering became synonymous with silver service, culinary perfection,  and timeless Southern style. Whether planning wrap parties for A-list  celebrities or elegant weddings for local families, she made sure every  detail was flawless.

She is now 85 years young and still very much at the center of the  party. With her signature wit and stylish presence, she has become both  a cultural fixture and a business force in Savannah.

Mr. Speaker, Susan Mason represents the very best of resilience,  charm, and entrepreneurial spirit. It is an honor to recognize her  today for 40 years of extraordinary service.
