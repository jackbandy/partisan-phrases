Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Rachel  Kinsaul who was recognized by the Georgia Department of Education as  the Georgia Teacher of the Year for 2026.

She led an exceptional career in the Morgan County school system as a  teacher of agricultural science, extending her involvement beyond the  academic setting. Rachel serves as the chapter adviser to the Future  Farmers of America organization and the president of the Morgan County  Farm Bureau.

She continues to help inspire students to create their own  philanthropic projects, developing future community leaders. Her  efforts focus on fostering leadership, collaboration, and a sense of  community in the young minds she educates.

As an alumna of the University of Georgia--Go Dogs--she has received  several accolades, including the Outstanding Alumnus Award from the  College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences and recognition as  the 2025 Milken Educator of the Year.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Rachel on her well-deserved recognition  as Georgia Teacher of the Year.
