Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  City of Midway, Georgia and to honor its centennial celebration which  occured on August 28th.

Midway is located in Liberty County, a name given to the town in  remembrance of its citizens, Lyman Hall and Button Gwinnett, who  bravely signed their names to the Declaration of Independence, in  direct defiance of British rule.

Adding to the town's historical significance, another Midway resident  by the name of Nathan Brownson served in the Continental Congress from  1776 to 1778, helping guide our young nation through the turbulent  revolutionary years.

Established in 1752, the Midway Congregational Church was destroyed  during the Revolutionary War, highlighting the immense sacrifice made  by the citizens of Midway in advancing the cause of liberty.

The town is now home to Georgia's only colonial museum and serves as  one of the First District's most important cultural landmarks.

I am honored to celebrate the one-hundred-year anniversary of the  town's incorporation.
