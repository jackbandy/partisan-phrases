Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jay Burke  III, the Grand Marshal of the 201st Savannah St. Patrick's Day Parade.

This prestigious role is made even more special as Jay follows in the  footsteps of his father, James F. ``Jimmy'' Burke, Jr., who led the  same parade 28 years ago in 1997.

Their legacy is a testament to the deep tradition of this event, one  of America's oldest and grandest St. Patrick's Day celebrations.

Jay has long been a dedicated leader in Savannah's Irish community,  serving as a parade officer and as chairman. His leadership and his  passion have left an indelible mark on our city.

This St. Patrick's Day, Jay will carry forward not just a family  tradition but the enduring spirit of our community's Irish heritage  that defines this parade.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Jay on this richly deserved role.
