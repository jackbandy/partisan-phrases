Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the  following proclamation:

Whereas, for millennia, the Jewish people have sustained their shared  religious, cultural, and ethnic identity and traditions in the face of  enslavement, persecution, genocide, segregation, and discrimination,  and all manner of adversity; and

Whereas, ever since the first Jew set foot in America in 1654,  members of the Jewish community have made indelible contributions to  the culture, history, and social fabric of Georgia and the United  States of America, strengthening the country and helping shape all  areas of American life; and

Whereas, the first 42 Jewish immigrants arrived in Savannah, Georgia,  on July 11, 1733, making Savannah the largest Jewish settlement in the  English colonies in North America at the time; and

Whereas, the belief in the greatness of the American way of life, the  freedoms enshrined in American law and jurisprudence, and the  opportunities sustained by American democracy drew generations of  Jewish immigrants to America, including Jews fleeing persecution and  pogroms in Europe and the Middle East, Holocaust survivors, and Jews  trapped behind the Iron Curtain; and

Whereas, this history encouraged many Jews to become leading  proponents and supporters of the civil rights movement, marching  shoulder to shoulder with African Americans and others, united in  support for equal rights, equal protection under the law, and the  recognition and respect of human dignity; and

Whereas, the Jewish community has prominently participated in  virtually every civil rights effort in the American experience,  fighting against discrimination and bigotry in all its forms and  demanding the equal rights of every member of society; and

Whereas, despite the advances made in promoting social justice for  other minority groups, the Jewish community has continued to be  subjected to antisemitism and Jew-hatred, including discrimination in  the workplace, at school, and in public spaces; and

Whereas, this antisemitism and Jew hatred has manifested in places of  work, on campuses, and in society, expressing itself as both  discrimination and violence targeting Jews for their identity and  seeking to deny their shared identity, including their indigenous  connection to their ancestral homeland; and

Whereas, hate crimes directed against the Jewish community have  skyrocketed in recent years, inspiring the formation of a grassroots  End Jew Hatred civil rights movement to alter public discourse and make  Jew hatred unacceptable in contemporary society, empowering Jews with  positivity and strength to discover and enjoy their heritage in  whichever manner they choose, without fear of attack or persecution;  and

Whereas, we all share an obligation to condemn and combat Jew hatred  in all its forms; and

Whereas, April 29, 2022, marked the recognition of the first  #EndJewHatred Day, on which people joined together to commit to ending  Jew hatred across the United States and to work toward the promise of a  bright future that can only be achieved by fighting racism and bigotry  today; and

Whereas, we recognize the urgent need to stand resolute against Jew  hatred so that the intergenerational trauma of the past shall never be  repeated; now, therefore, be it

Proclaimed, that I, Honorable Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter, in  recognition of the need to end Jew hatred in this generation, declare  and proclaim every April 29 to be #EndJewHatred Day; and be it further

Proclaimed, that I, Honorable Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter, affirm and  proclaim that the 1st Congressional District of Georgia condemns Jew  hatred in all its forms and shall stand resolute to end discrimination  against, and persecution of, the Jewish community.
