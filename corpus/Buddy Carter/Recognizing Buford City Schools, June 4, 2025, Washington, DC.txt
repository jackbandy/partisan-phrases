Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Buford  City Schools as being named among the top school districts in America.

Education is one of the greatest gifts we can provide our children,  and I am proud that Georgia is receiving recognition for this honor.

Buford City Schools ranked at No. 22, achieving an overall A-plus  rating, with A-pluses in nearly all categories.

The top-rated public school serves 5,946 students from pre-K to 12th  grade, maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 18:1. Additionally, 70  percent of students are at least proficient in math and 65 percent in  reading.

I thank the teachers and the Buford community for setting an example  for the State of Georgia and the rest of our Nation to follow.
