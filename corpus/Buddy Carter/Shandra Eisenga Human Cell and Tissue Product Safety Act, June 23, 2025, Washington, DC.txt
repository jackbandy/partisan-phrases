Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  the Shandra Eisenga Human Cell and Tissue Product Safety Act, which is  a critical piece of legislation aimed at preventing tuberculosis  infections linked to tissue transplants.

In 2023, 36 patients across seven States contracted tuberculosis from  infected bone grafts.

One of these patients was Shandra Eisenga, who tragically passed away  on August 10, 2023, from tuberculosis, or TB.

This bipartisan bill requires the Department of Health and Human  Services to conduct public awareness campaigns to assist in preventing  TB outbreaks caused by contaminated human cell and tissue product  donations.

Shandra's death was a preventable tragedy, and we will honor her  memory by strengthening guidelines and improving education for these  medical products, so no other family has to suffer through this again.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
