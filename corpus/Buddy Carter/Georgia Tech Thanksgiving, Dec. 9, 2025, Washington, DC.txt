Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a  remarkable act of kindness happening right here in the State of  Georgia.

Georgia Tech faculty and staff opened their homes to students who  could not travel home for Thanksgiving. Through a program called Home  for the Holidays, students were welcomed like family.

Many of these students are international, far from home, and  experiencing an American Thanksgiving for the first time. Faculty  members cooked meals, shared traditions, and offered community to those  who needed it most.

This is a very best example of what it means to look out for one  another. It shows that a university is more than classrooms and  textbooks. It is a community.

These volunteers gave students comfort, belonging, and memories that  will last a lifetime. Their generosity reflects the values we cherish  in Georgia: hospitality, kindness, and service to others.

Mr. Speaker, I commend Georgia Tech faculty and staff for making  Thanksgiving feel like home for every student.
