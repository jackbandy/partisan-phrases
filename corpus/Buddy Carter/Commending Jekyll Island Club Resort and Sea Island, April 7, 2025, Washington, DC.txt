Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge a  true southern institution, Mrs. Wilkes' Dining Room in Savannah,  Georgia, which was recently highlighted on Southern Living's bucket  list.

In the Hostess City of the South, it is only fitting that lunch is  served with true southern hospitality. At Mrs. Wilkes', this means  gathering around tables set for 10 where guests take a seat, share a  meal, and leave as friends. Every day at 11 o'clock, the doors swing  open, inviting everyone to enjoy a rotating menu of classic southern  home cooking all served family style.

The meal is always a surprise. You never know what the day's entrees  and sides will be, and that is part of the restaurant's charm.

Whether it is crispy fried chicken, collard greens, cornbread, or  black-eyed peas, every dish is steeped in tradition. Mrs. Wilkes'  Dining Room isn't just a restaurant; it is an experience.

It is a place where history, hospitality, and home-cooked meals unite  to create something truly special.           Commending the Islands of St. Simons, Jekyll, and Tybee

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the  islands of St. Simons, Jekyll, and Tybee, which have recently been  recognized as three of the top five best beach towns in the South.

Jekyll Island was ranked as the fifth best beach town in the South,  celebrated for its beauty, pristine wilderness, otherworldly nature,  and function as a refuge for local wildlife.

Tybee Island was ranked fourth on the list, being praised as a little  island packing a big punch. Tybee contains over three miles of beaches,  hundreds of years of history, and countless opportunities to explore  nature making it one of the most beloved areas in the First  Congressional District.

St. Simons was ranked as the number one beach town in the South,  surpassing a list of 50 other iconic locations.

St. Simons' laid-back and welcoming atmosphere, delicious  restaurants, renowned golf courses, and historic landmarks are reasons  why the idyllic town beats out all the rest.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that Georgia's First District is home  to three of the best beach towns in the South.
