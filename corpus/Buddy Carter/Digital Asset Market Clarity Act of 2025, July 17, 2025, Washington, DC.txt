Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support  for the CLARITY Act.

The CLARITY Act is a bill that will make clear laws to help better  regulate digital assets and blockchain technology. This bill will  ensure that future innovations in the financial world will happen here  in the United States and not in foreign countries.

We cannot allow our adversaries, such as China, to control the  digital economy. The CLARITY Act will help modernize financial laws to  make innovation possible and clear up many opaque and sometimes  contradictory laws.

This bill delivers on President Trump's commitment to make the United  States the crypto capital of the world, and I am proud that we are  paving the path toward American dominance in the digital future.

Today, I again would like to give my support for the CLARITY Act, as  it cements America as a hub for the world's financial innovation.
