Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  remarkable achievement of professional golfer Russell Henley.

Russell, a University of Georgia alum--go Dawgs--recently secured his  fifth PGA Tour victory at the 2025 Arnold Palmer Invitational.

Russell delivered a pivotal chip-in eagle on the par 5 hole during  his final round at Bay Hill, taking lead over his playing partner,  Collin Morikawa. Ultimately, he maintained his score of 11 under par to  win by one stroke.

Russell was finally back in the winner's circle for the first time in  over 850 days, having been one of the most consistent players on the  PGA Tour since 2024. With this win, he has solidified his position as  one of the top ten players in the world. He outplayed some of the  world's best golfers, showing his determination under pressure and  setting an example for athletes worldwide.

Mr. Speaker, I applaud Russell Henley for his outstanding  performance.
