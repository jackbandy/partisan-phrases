Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the D.C. CRIMES Act,  legislation that builds on the extraordinary progress we have seen  under President Trump's leadership to restore law and order in  Washington, D.C.

Thanks to President Trump and his administration, we are finally  seeing real results in this city. Crime is down, homicides are down,  carjackings are down, and most importantly, people feel safer in their  Nation's Capital.

President Trump has handed us the blueprint to restore safety in  America's cities. Families are safely going out to restaurants,  businesses are seeing life return to their neighborhoods, and tourists  feel secure, knowing law enforcement officers are empowered to do their  job and enforce the law.

The D.C. CRIMES Act ensures that the gains we have made are not  rolled back by more Democratic pro-crime policies. Republicans are the  party of safe cities. We are the party that stands with our police and  responds to our communities that demand law and order.

This bill sends a simple message: Criminals will be held accountable,  victims will be protected, and Washington, D.C., will remain on the  path to becoming the safe, thriving Capital our Nation deserves.

I urge my colleagues to support the D.C. CRIMES Act and keep our  Capital safe, strong, and beautiful.
