Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor the retirement of Mr. Ronnie Fender after 44 years of  extraordinary judicial service to Cook County, Georgia.

For more than four decades, Judge Fender has served with integrity,  with patience, and an unwavering commitment to justice as a justice of  the peace and as a magistrate judge. His courtroom has been a place not  only of law but of fairness and respect for all who appeared before  him.

Beyond the bench, Judge Fender was an educator who shaped minds with  the same care and wisdom he brought to the law. His influence extends  far beyond written rulings. It lives on in the countless people he  taught, mentored, and served.

Though retiring from full-time service, Judge Fender will continue  contributing as a senior magistrate judge on an as-needed basis and as  a court bailiff. We are grateful for that continued dedication.                    Honoring Pharmacists as Key Resources

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  invaluable role of pharmacists in supporting older adults as they  navigate the difficulties of medication management.

This expertise is especially vital as we age when new prescriptions,  changing doses, and potential drug interactions become more common,  influenced by slower metabolism, reduced kidney function, and  heightened drug sensitivity.

Pharmacists, after six to eight years of rigorous training, including  a Doctor of Pharmacy degree, serve as trusted experts in how  medications work, interact, and affect aging bodies.

Through services like medication therapy management, they review  entire regimens, including prescriptions, over-the-counter products,  vitamins, and supplements to identify duplicates, unnecessary drugs, or  risky combinations that could lead to dizziness, falls, or confusion.

Pharmacists ensure medications are effective and taken correctly,  while offering simplified routines, clear explanations of benefits and  side effects, adherence tools such as pill organizers and synchronized  refills, and convenient delivery options.

Pharmacists provide accessible guidance anytime, empowering informed  decisions that promote safety, independence, and healthy aging.           Recognizing Scottish Rite Monuments in Savannah, Georgia

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise here today to recognize  the monuments being dedicated to the ancient Scottish Rite Valley of  Savannah, Georgia.

The birth of the Scottish Rite dates back to 1801 when the Supreme  Court of the 33rd Degree for the United States of America and the first  Supreme Council in the world was established.

The Scottish Rite of Freemasonry seeks to better its members and  strengthen their communities by teaching and promoting brotherly love,  tolerance, and truth. The Rite embraces strong social, moral, and  spiritual values that include compassion and dedication to God, family,  and country.

These monuments serve as symbols of all the values the Scottish Rite  stands for.

I thank the generous donors: Illustrious Brother Albert Nelson, Jr.,  and Lady Nellie; Dr. and Sir Knight James Arnold and Lady Barbara;  Illustrious Brother Charles White and Lady Nordene; and Brother Morgan  Derst and Lady Pam for their kind contributions.                     Honoring Science Teacher Bill Eswine

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize science  teacher Bill Eswine, who has decided to retire at the end of the school  year after 54 years of service to Savannah Country Day School.

Mr. Eswine was originally hired in 1972, and through his enthusiasm,  adaptability, and love for teaching has taught science to generations  of children. His impact is visible across the school's campus in the  Savannah community, serving as director of the Coastal Ecology Camp and  caretaker to various campus educational gardens.

Beyond Country Day, Mr. Eswine has been recognized as Teacher of the  Year and honored by organizations such as Garden Club of America, the  Georgia Independent School Association, and the Georgia Department of  Natural Resources. His commitment to education and fondness for  learning has made a lasting difference in Savannah.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Eswine on a well-earned retirement.
