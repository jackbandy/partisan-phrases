Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong and  unapologetic support of the SAVE America Act, legislation that defends  the integrity of our elections and makes one principle perfectly clear:  U.S. elections are for U.S. citizens only.

This is not extreme. It is common sense. Citizenship matters.  Sovereignty matters. Americans alone must decide America's future.

Yet radical Democrats have abandoned the standard. New York City has  allowed noncitizens to vote in local elections. Washington, D.C., has  done the same, granting political power to foreign nationals in the  Capital of our Nation.

Georgia's own Senator John Ossoff, who once said that voter ID was  right and appropriate, now supports his party reframing it as voter  suppression.

The law didn't change. Public opinion didn't change. What changed was  he and other Democrat politicians like him realized that illegal  immigrants could no longer vote to keep Democrats in office.

They oppose this bill because it chips away at their voting base,  plain and simple. For years, conservatives warned that this was the  radical left's goal, and we were mocked for it.

That is exactly what Democrats are doing right now, fighting to allow  illegal aliens to vote. This is not only grotesquely unjust, but it  waters down the meaning of American citizenship.

Mr. Speaker, by passing this bill, we reaffirm a simple but sacred  truth. American elections belong to Americans, no loopholes, no  exceptions, no apologies.
