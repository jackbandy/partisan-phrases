Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  outstanding team from Savannah, Georgia, the dedicated staff of WTOC-TV  and congratulate them on their recent Emmy Award win at the 2025  Southeast Emmy Awards.

This remarkable team was honored with the award for best morning  newscast in a smaller market, recognizing their exceptional coverage of  Savannah's 200th Saint Patrick's Day celebration, a signature event in  the city's history and culture.

WTOC-TV represents the very best in local journalism, combining  heart, hustle, and hometown pride. Covering Savannah's Saint Patrick's  Day is no small task. It is an all-hands-on-deck event that calls for  early mornings, late nights, and unwavering dedication.

Everyone involved in that broadcast played a vital role. From  producers and anchors to editors, photographers, and  technical staff, it was truly a team effort and it showed. These  individuals displayed incredible skill in their respective professions,  but also in communication and collaboration with each other.

WTOC's achievement stands as a shining example of professionalism,  collaboration, and a deep commitment to fostering a well-informed  community.

It is an honor to recognize and congratulate this team today.
