Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Coastal Area District Development Authority, CADDA, as it proudly marks  its 50th anniversary.

CADDA was founded in 1976 with a modest grant from the Economic  Development Administration, immediately saving critical seafood  processing plants and jobs in coastal Georgia.

From those humble beginnings, CADDA has grown into a powerhouse of  economic opportunity, heavily contributing to Georgia's status as the  best State to do business for 12 consecutive years.

Over five decades, this nonprofit has delivered more than 1,340 small  business loans, investing $526 million in coastal communities. These  efforts have created and preserved more than 9,300 jobs across coastal  Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.

I thank CADDA for their steady commitment to expanding access to  capital and building stronger communities.
