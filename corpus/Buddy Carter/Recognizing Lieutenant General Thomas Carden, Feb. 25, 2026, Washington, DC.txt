Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Lieutenant General Thomas Carden.

General Carden has been promoted to Vice Chief of the National Guard  Bureau, the second highest position in the National Guard, overseeing  soldiers and airmen. He is the first vice chief ever to wear the four- star rank.

Previously, General Carden served as commander of the Georgia  National Guard from 2019 to 2024.

He began his journey of selfless service at age 18, when he enlisted  as a private in the Georgia Army National Guard. Throughout his career,  General Carden has held many leadership roles, serving as a shining  example to those he led.

He has a strong academic background, with degrees in history, human  resource management, and strategic studies.

Few people have demonstrated unwavering commitment, integrity, and  dedication to duty the way that General Carden has.

As a fellow Georgian, I am proud of his exemplary service to our  State and to our Nation. I am confident he will lead with honor in this  new role.

Mr. Speaker, I thank General Carden for his lifelong service to this  great country.
