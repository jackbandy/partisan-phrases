Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Paul W. Brown on his retirement from the FBI, where he served as  Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Atlanta Field Office.

Mr. Brown has served the FBI diligently since 2006, with experience  spanning counterterrorism and weapons of mass destruction.

Holding degrees from both Western Illinois and Tarleton State  University, Mr. Brown built a well-rounded foundation that supported  his work in law enforcement and investigations.

Mr. Brown's leadership and public service have contributed greatly to  safety in our communities and will leave a lasting impact on the United  States of America.

I congratulate Mr. Brown on his well-deserved retirement. I know the  FBI and the American people are forever indebted to him for his work to  keep us safe.
