Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support  for  S. 1582, the GENIUS Act of 2025, which will provide a clear regulatory  framework for the issuance of stablecoins in the U.S.

This bipartisan, industry-supported bill will finally give the  stablecoin asset class clear rules of the road for the issuance and use  of digital assets. The GENIUS Act will establish standards so that  issuers are credible and stablecoins are quality assets in a rapidly  innovating digital market.

I thank the Senate for passing this bill and getting it to the House  so quickly. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in support of the  GENIUS Act. It is a vital step in keeping America at the pinnacle of  financial innovation.

Mr. Speaker, let's make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.
