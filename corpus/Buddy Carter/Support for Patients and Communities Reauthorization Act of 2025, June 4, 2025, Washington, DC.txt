Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of Chairman Guthrie's  SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025.

This critical legislation reflects House Republicans' ongoing  commitment to fighting the opioid and fentanyl crisis that is  devastating families across this Nation.

Under the leadership of President Trump and Chairman Guthrie, we are  finally seeing real progress.

Listen to these figures, Mr. Chairman:

For the first time in years, opioid overdose deaths have declined,  dropping from over 83,000 in 2023 to under 55,000 by the most recent  data.

Those are good numbers. They did not happen by accident. It happened  because we took bold action to secure our borders, to prioritize  treatments, and invest in recovery programs that work.

We can help continue this trajectory by advancing the SUPPORT for  Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025, which is one of  the single largest congressional efforts to address our opioid crisis.

Through the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act  of 2025, we are reauthorizing prevention programs and recovery services  and ensuring that first responders can access and administer Naloxone.  We are ultimately restoring hope and healing by putting a stop to drug  overdose and poisoning.

Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Guthrie for his work on this important  issue, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this legislation.

Mr. Chairman, let's pass this bill. Let's secure our borders. Let's  stem the tide of the growing fentanyl crisis, and let's save lives.
