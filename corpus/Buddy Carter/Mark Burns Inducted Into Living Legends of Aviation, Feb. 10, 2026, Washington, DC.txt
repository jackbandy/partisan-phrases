Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Mark Burns, president of Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, on his  induction into the 23rd annual Living Legends of Aviation.

Founded in 2003, the Living Legends of Aviation awards recognize  individuals who have significantly impacted the aviation industry. This  includes entrepreneurs, innovators, industry leaders, astronauts,  record setters, pilots turned celebrities, and celebrities who have  become pilots.

A Savannah native, Mr. Burns earned his bachelor's degree in  mechanical engineering from Georgia Southern University and began  working at Gulfstream Aerospace in 1983. Over the course of more than  four decades, he has served in numerous leadership roles across the  company, including engineering and customer support.

In July 2025, Mr. Burns was named president of Gulfstream Aerospace  Corporation, proudly leading the organization since then, contributing  significantly to its growth and success.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Burns on his leadership in both the  aviation industry and his induction into the Living Legends of  Aviation.                  Honoring Former UGA President Michael Adams

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life and legacy of Michael Adams, the former president of the  University of Georgia.

Unfortunately, Dr. Adams passed away on January 25 at the age of 77.

From 1977 to 2013, he served as the University of Georgia's 21st  president, transforming our State's flagship university into one of the  Nation's most prominent public institutions.

Under his visionary leadership, enrollment grew from nearly 30,000 to  35,000 students, Federal research expenditures nearly tripled, and the  endowment more than doubled.

Dr. Adams oversaw more than $1 billion in campus construction and  renovation, creating vital facilities for teaching, research, and  student life. His success as a university administrator was recognized  by more than 50 higher education awards. He deeply believed in the  transformative power of higher education, and his stewardship directly  strengthened Georgia for generations.

Mr. Speaker, Dr. Adams has left an enduring legacy that will forever  touch the soul of our beloved State.                 Honoring Colonel Stephen ``Tracker'' Thomas

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel  Stephen ``Tracker'' Thomas, who is retiring from command of Georgia's  Combat Readiness Training Center at Savannah Air National Guard Base.

Since assuming command in 2023, Colonel Thomas has led this premier  training hub with unmatched commitment and devotion.

Drawing on nearly two decades of combined Active-Duty and Air  National Guard service, he elevated the CRTC's role in preparing  warfighters for great power competition.

Under his leadership, the center continued hosting quarterly large  force exercises, training specialists in theater-deployable  communications, and delivering exclusive cross-demand training from  Charleston to Orlando.

His vision has solidified the CRTC as a vital national asset for the  Air Force, Air National Guard, Reserves, and other partners.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Colonel Thomas for ensuring global air readiness  and dominance. We wish him and his family a fulfilling retirement.                  Honoring the Memory of George Whittenburg

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory  of George Whittenburg, a bright young man taken from us far too soon  following a tragic car accident on January 30.

George was a 21-year-old student at the University of Georgia from  Austin, Texas. He was a beloved son, brother, cousin, and friend whose  infectious spirit touched countless lives.

Through his involvement in Sigma Phi Epsilon and Cru, a religious  organization at the University of Georgia, George exemplified faith,  leadership, and kindness. His friends would describe him as smart,  confident, and a source of comedic relief, a Christlike man who  overcame personal struggles to inspire others toward ministry and  service.

George's personal growth and friendship have left a lasting impact on  the Athens community, with thousands praying for him following the  accident.

Mr. Speaker, our hearts ache for this loss. I pray for the  Whittenburg family and all who knew him. May God's perfect plan bring  them comfort.
