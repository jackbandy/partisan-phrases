Arms Sales Notification


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699550/arms-sales-notification


Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is still available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the Record the notifications that have been  received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such  an annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign  Relations Committee, room SD-423.

Hon. James E. Risch,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

The total estimated program cost was $4.0 billion. Major       Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $2.0 billion of this       total.

On September 27, 2022, Congress was notified by       congressional certification transmittal number 22-01 of the       possible sale, under Section 36(b)(5)(C) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of MDE items that were previously reported as       non-MDE items: fifty-four (54) AN/ARC-231A (RT-1987) radios.       The following non-MDE items were also included: M261 2.75-      inch Rocket launchers; and AN/AVS-6 Aviator Night Vision       Devices (NVDs). The estimated total value of these items was       $39 million. The total MDE value was increased by $27 million       to a total MDE value of $2.027 billion. The estimated total       non-MDE value was decreased by $15 million (after deducting       MDE values previously notified as non-MDE and adding new non-      MDE costs), resulting in a total non-MDE value of $1.985       billion. The total estimated case value was increased to       $4.012 billion. MDE constituted $2.027 billion of this total.

This transmittal notifies an adjustment to the following       previously reported MDE item:       the remanufactured Embedded Global Position Systems with       Inertial Navigation (EGI) with Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) are       being replaced with thirty-six (36) EGIs with MMR from new       procurement. This transmittal also notifies an adjustment to       the following previously reported non-MDE item: the       remanufactured Longbow Crew Trainer (LCT) is being replaced       with a LCT from new procurement. The estimated total value of       the new items is $49.43 million. The estimated MDE value will       increase by $12.4 million to a revised $2.04 billion. The       estimated non-MDE value will increase by $37.03 million to a       revised $2.02 billion. The estimated total case value will       increase by $49.43 million to a revised $4.06 billion.

(iv) Significance: The inclusion of this MDE represents an       increase in capability over what was previously notified.

(v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of a major       non-NATO ally that has been an important force for political       stability and economic progress in the Middle East.

(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensitivity of       Technology Statement contained in the original notification       applies to items reported here.

The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.
