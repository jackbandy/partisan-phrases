Arms Sales Notification


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695536/arms-sales-notification


Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is still available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the Record the notifications that have been  received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such  an annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign  Relations Committee, room SD-423.

Hon. James E. Risch,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements       of Section 36(b)(5)(C) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA),       as amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 25-1F.

The total estimated value was $3.5       billion. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $2.5       billion of this total.

This transmittal notifies the inclusion of up to thirty-      three (33) Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) systems (29       installed, 4 spares). The following non-MDE items are also       included: Blue force tracking 2 (BFT-2) systems and KGV-72       programmable encryption devices. The estimated total cost of       the new items is $150 million. The estimated MDE value will       increase by $140 million. The estimated non-MDE value will       increase by $10 million to a revised $1.01 billion. The       estimated total case value will increase by $150 million to a       revised $3.65 billion. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) will       constitute $2.64 billion of this total.

(iv) Significance: This notification is being provided as       the MDE items for CIRCM systems were not enumerated in the       original notification. The proposed articles and services       will support Australia's capability to meet current and       future threats and will enhance interoperability with U.S.       and other allied forces.

(v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States. Australia is one of the most important U.S. allies in       the Western Pacific. The strategic location of this political       and economic power contributes significantly to ensuring       peace and economic stability in the Western Pacific. It is       vital to the U.S. national interest to assist our ally in       developing and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense       capability.

(vi) Sensitivity of Technology:

The CIRCM system is the next-generation lightweight, laser-      based, infrared countermeasure system for rotary-wing, tilt-      rotor, and small fixed-wing aircraft across the DoD. CIRCM       provides near spherical coverage of the host platform to       defeat infrared-seeking threat missiles. CIRCM receives an       angular bearing hand-off from the Common Missile Warning       System and employs a pointing and tracking system that       acquires and tracks the incoming missile. CIRCM jams the       missile by using modulated laser energy, thus degrading the       tracking capability of the missile and causing it to miss the       aircraft.

The KGV-72 programmable encryption device provides traffic       encryption for Force Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2)       Blue force tracking (BFT) satellite network multicast and       unicast transmission of mapping, short messaging, and       geolocation application data. Designed for use in tactical       ground and rotary wing platforms, the KGV-72 connects to a       commercial L band transceiver and FBCB2 BFT computer to       secure beyond line-of-sight communication.

The Sensitivity of Technology statement contained in the       original notification applies to additional items mentioned.

The highest level of information that may be transferred in       support of this proposed sale is classified SECRET.

(vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: September 15,       2025.
