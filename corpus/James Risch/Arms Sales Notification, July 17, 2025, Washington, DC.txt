https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693742/arms-sales-notification


Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale  may be reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is still available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the Record the notifications that have been  received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such  an annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign  Relations Committee, room SD-423.

Hon. James E. Risch,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements       of Section 36(b)(5)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA),       as amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 0G-25. This       notification relates to enhancements or upgrades from the       level of sensitivity of technology or capability described in       the Section 36(b)(1) AECA certification 22-17 of June 22,       2022.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael F. Miller,                                                          Director.

Enclosure.                            transmittal no. 0G-25       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(A), AECA)

(iii) Description: On June 22, 2022, Congress was notified       by congressional certification transmittal number 22-17 of       the possible sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of two hundred thirty-nine (239) GBU-39/B small       diameter bombs, Increment I; two hundred four (204) FMU-152       fuzes; two hundred four (204) Mk 82 500 lb general purpose       bombs; and fifty (50) BLU-109 2000 lb hard-target-penetrator       bombs, that will be added to a previously implemented case.       The original FMS case, valued at $1.87 million, included       forty (40) GBU-39/B small diameter bombs, Increment I.       Therefore, this notification was for a total of two hundred       seventy-nine (279) GBU-39/B small diameter bombs, Increment       I; two hundred four (204) FMU-152 fuzes; two hundred four       (204) Mk 82 500 lb general purpose bombs; and fifty (50) BLU-      109 2000 lb hard-target-penetrator bombs. Also included were       smoke signal cartridges; engineering and technical support       and assistance; and other related elements of logistical and       program support. The total estimated cost was $22.7 million.       Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $21.8 million of       this total.

This transmittal reports the inclusion of the following       additional MDE items: fifty (50) GBU-39/B Small Diameter       Bombs, Increment I (SDB-I); and one hundred sixty-four (164)       BLU-109 2000 lb hard-target-penetrator bombs. The following       non-MDE items will also be included: GBU-39/B Tactical       Training Rounds (TTR); cartridges, chaff, and flares; and       other related elements of logistics and program support. The       estimated total value of the new items is 815.1 million. The       estimated MDE value will increase by $12.1 million. The       estimated non-MDE value will increase by $3.0 million to a       revised $3.9 million. The estimated total case value will       increase by $15.1 million to a revised $37.8 million. MDE       will constitute $33.9 million of this total.

(iv) Significance: This notification is being provided       because the additional MDE items were not enumerated in the       original notification. The proposed sale will improve NATO's       capability to meet current and future ground threats with       precision. NATO will use the enhanced capability as a       deterrent to regional threats, and to increase       interoperability within contingency operations.

(v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the       United States by improving the security of NATO partners that       are a force for political stability and economic progress in       the North Atlantic region.

(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The GBU-39/B Tactical       Training Round (TTR) is identical to a live tactical weapon,       except that the live warhead is replaced with an inert fill.       The TTR functions the same as a GBU-39/B. The TTR is suited       for training missions.

The Sensitivity of Technology statement contained in the       original notification applies to additional items reported       here.

The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.

(vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: July 10, 2025.
