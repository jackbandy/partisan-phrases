Arms Sales Notification


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697340/arms-sales-notification


Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is still available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the Record the notifications that have been  received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such  an annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign  Relations Committee, room SD-423.

Hon. Mike Johnson,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.

*As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             POLICY JUSTIFICATION       Kingdom of Saudi Arabia--Cooperative Logistics Supply Support

Arrangement Program, Foreign Military Sales Order II Case

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has requested to buy a       Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Arrangement (CLSSA)       Foreign Military Sales Order (FMSO) II case to requisition       orders for centrally managed spares and repair parts. This       case supports the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Corps' UH-      60A/L/M Black Hawk utility helicopters; AH-64 A/D/E Apache       attack helicopters; CH-47F Chinook cargo helicopters;       Schweizer 333 helicopters; and Aerial Scout helicopters; and       other related elements of logistics and program support. The       estimated total cost is $500 million.

This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a partner country that contributes       to political stability and economic progress in the Gulf       region.

The proposed sale will enhance Saudi Arabia's ability to       effectively maintain and operate their U.S.-procured       helicopter fleet. This will allow better integration with       U.S.-led coalitions and operate independently in support of       U.S. interests and the security of U.S. forces in theater and       is consistent with U.S. bilateral and multilateral defense       plans in the Central Command region. Saudi Arabia will have       no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.

The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the military balance in the region.

There are no principal contractors involved with this       potential sale. At this time, the U.S. government is not       aware of any offset agreement proposed in connection with       this potential sale. Any offset agreement will be defined in       negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor.

Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. government or contractor       representatives to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

There will be no adverse impact on defense readiness as a       result of this proposed sale.
