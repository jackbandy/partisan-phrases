Arms Sales Notification


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699127/arms-sales-notification


Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is still available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the Record the notifications that have been  received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such  an annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign  Relations Committee, room SD-423.

Hon. Mike Johnson,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.

Kuwait--PATRIOT Program Sustainment and Follow-On Technical Support

The Government of Kuwait has requested to buy equipment and       services related to sustainment and follow-on technical       support for its PATRIOT program. The following non-Major       Defense Equipment items will be included: spare and repair       parts; storage and aging; surveillance firing; stockpile       reliability; shared and country-unique PATRIOT PAC-3 Missile       Support Center support; operator and maintenance support;       test program set development process support; publications       and technical documentation; personnel training and training       equipment; U.S. Government and contractor engineering,       technical, and logistics support services; studies and       surveys; transportation; and other related elements of       logistics and program support. The estimated total cost is       $800 million.

This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a major non-NATO ally that is a       force for political stability and economic progress in the       Middle East.

The proposed sale will improve Kuwait's capability to meet       current and future threats by assisting it in maintaining       higher levels of operational readiness while meeting its       modernization and professionalization goals. Kuwait will have       no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its       armed forces.

The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.

The principal contractors will be RTX Corporation, located       in Waltham, MA, and Huntsville, AL; Lockheed Martin, located       in Bethesda, MA, and Huntsville, AL; LEIDOS, Inc., located in       Reston, VA, and Huntsville, AL; and KBR, located in Houston,       TX, and Huntsville, AL. At this time, the U.S. Government is       not aware of any offset agreement proposed in connection with       this potential sale. Any offset agreement will be defined in       negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor.

Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of six U.S. Government and four contractor       representatives to provide technical support and equipment       familiarization.

There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.
