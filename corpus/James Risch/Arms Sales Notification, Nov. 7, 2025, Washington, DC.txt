Arms Sales Notification


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696581/arms-sales-notification


Mr. RISCH. Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is still available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the Record the notifications that have been  received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such  an annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign  Relations Committee, room SD-423.

Hon. Mike Johnson,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.

Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements       of Section 36(b)(5)(C) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA),       as amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 25-1R. This       notification relates to enhancements or upgrades from the       level of sensitivity of technology or capability described in       the Section 36(b)(1) AECA certification 17-12 of June 23,       2017.

Enclosure.                            Transmittal No. 25-1R       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(C), AECA)

(i) Prospective Purchaser: Government of Australia.

(ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 17-12.

Date: June 23, 2017.

Implementing Agency: Air Force.

(iii) Description: On June 23, 2017, Congress was notified       by congressional certification transmittal number 17-12 of       the possible sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of up to five (5) Gulfstream G-550 aircraft       modified to integrate Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance,       Reconnaissance, and Electronic Warfare (AISREW) mission       systems, Global Positioning System (GPS) capability, secure       communications, aircraft defensive systems; spares, including       whole life costs of airborne and ground segments; aircraft       modification and integration; ground systems for data       processing and crew training; ground support equipment;       publications and technical data; U.S. Government and       contractor engineering, technical and logistics support       services; flight test and certification; and other related       elements of logistical and program support. The estimated       total cost was $1.3 billion. Major Defense Equipment (MDE)       constituted $.04 billion of this total.

On August 26, 2020, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 20-0J of Australia's request       for the inclusion of the following non-MDE items and       services: spares and repair/return parts: consumables and       support equipment; publications and technical documentation;       maintenance, training and training equipment; U.S. Government       and contractor flight test and certification, aircraft       modification and integration, engineering, technical and       logistics support services; and other related elements of       logistical and program support. These additional items       resulted in an increase in non-MDE cost of $500 million,       causing a revised total cost for non-MDE of $1.76 billion.       Major Defense Equipment (MDE) remained $.04 billion. The       total estimated case value increased by $500 million to $1.8       billion.

This transmittal notifies the addition of the following       non-MDE items: follow-on sustainment support of the Royal       Australian Air Force's Gulfstream G-550 aircraft modified       with airborne intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and       electronic warfare (AISREW) mission systems; and other       related elements of logistics and program support. The       estimated total cost of the new items is $230 million. The       estimated total case will increase by $230 million to a       revised $2.03 billion. There is no MDE associated with this       sale.

(iv) Significance: The proposed sale will support       Australia's efforts to modernize its electronic warfare       support capability and increase interoperability between the       U.S. Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force.

(v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States. Australia is one of the most important U.S. allies in       the Western Pacific. The strategic location of this political       and economic power contributes significantly to ensuring       peace and economic stability in the region. It is vital to       the U.S. national interest to assist our ally in developing       and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense capability.

(vi) Date Report Delivered to Congress: November 7, 2025.
