Arms Sales Notification


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699891/arms-sales-notification


Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is still available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the Record the notifications that have been  received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such  an annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign  Relations Committee, room SD-423.

Hon. Mike Johnson,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.

* As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export       Control Act.                             POLICY JUSTIFICATION                       Ukraine--Class IX Spare Parts

The Government of Ukraine has requested to buy Class IX       spare parts in support of U.S. Army-supplied vehicles and       weapon systems, as well as other related elements of       logistics and program support. The estimated total cost is       $185 million.

This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a partner country that is a force       for political stability and economic progress in the Europe.

Ukraine has an urgent need to strengthen local sustainment       capabilities to maintain high operational rates for U.S.-      provided vehicles and weapon systems. The spare parts will       directly contribute to battlefield effectiveness with higher       overall operational rates, improved logistics, and a reduced       financial burden as a result of a more resilient and rapid       repair cycle.

The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the military balance in the region.

The principal contractor(s) will be determined from       approved vendors. At this time, the U.S. Government is not       aware of any offset agreement proposed in connection with       this potential sale. Any offset agreement will be defined in       negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor.

Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. government or contractor       representatives to Ukraine.

There will be no adverse impact on defense readiness as a       result of this proposed sale.
