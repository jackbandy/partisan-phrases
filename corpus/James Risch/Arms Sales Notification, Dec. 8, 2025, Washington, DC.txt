Arms Sales Notification


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697584/arms-sales-notification


Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is still available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the Record the notifications that have been  received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such  an annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign  Relations Committee, room SD-423.

Hon. Mike Johnson,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.

The       Republic of Korea has requested the case be amended to       include an additional six hundred twenty-four (624) GBU-39/B       SDB-Is.

* As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             Policy Justification

Republic of Korea--GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs-Increment 1 (SDB-I)

The Republic of Korea has requested to buy an additional       six hundred twenty-four (624) GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs       (SDB-I) that will be added to a previously implemented case       whose value was under the congressional notification       threshold. The original Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case,       valued at $18.8 million ($15.4 million in major defense       equipment (MDE)), included three hundred eighty-seven (387)       GBU-39/B SDB-Is; aircraft components, spares, and       accessories; explosive charges, devices, propellants, and       components; spare parts, consumables and accessories, and       repair and return support; U.S. Government and contractor       engineering, technical, and logistics support services; and       other related elements of logistics and program support. The       estimated total cost is $111.8 million.

This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a major ally that is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in the       Indo-Pacific region.

This proposed sale will improve the Republic of Korea's       capability to meet current and future threats by increasing       its critical air defense capability to deter aggression in       the region and to ensure interoperability with U.S. forces.       The Republic of Korea already has GBU-39/B SDB-Is in its       inventory and will have no difficulty absorbing these       articles and services into its armed forces.

The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.

The principal contractor will be The Boeing Corporation,       located in Arlington, VA. At this time, the U.S. Government       is not aware of any offset agreement proposed in connection       with this potential sale. Any offset agreement will be       defined in negotiations between the purchaser and the       contractor.

Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the Republic of Korea.

There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                                 Transmittal No. 25-111       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:

1. The GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb Increment I (SDB-I) All       Up Round (AUR) is a 250-pound GPS-aided munition with precise       positioning services provided by Selective Availability Anti-      Spoofing Module or M-Code, and it is a small, autonomous, day       or night, adverse weather, conventional, air-to-ground       precision glide weapon able to strike fixed and stationary       relocatable non-hardened targets from standoff ranges. The       SDB system employs a smart carriage capable of carrying four       250-lb class guided air-to-surface munitions. It is capable       of destroying high-priority fixed and stationary targets from       Air Force fighters and bombers in internal bays or on       external hard-points. SDB increases aircraft loadout,       decreases the logistical footprint, decreases collateral       damage, and improves aircraft sortie generation times.

2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.

3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.

4. A determination has been made that the Republic of Korea       can provide substantially the same degree of protection for       the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This proposed sale is necessary in furtherance of       the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives       outlined in the Policy Justification.

5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Republic of Korea.
