Condemning the January 6 Pardons


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698990/condemning-the-january-6-pardons


Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my outrage and  ask my colleagues to join me in condemning the actions of the President  when he pardoned so many of the individuals convicted after January 6.

At least 13 individuals who have been pardoned by President Trump  have gone on to commit additional crimes, including sexual assault  against a minor and a fatal DUI.

Instead of promoting accountability and rehabilitation, when  possible, in our justice system, shouldn't the President and the  majority look at these pardons and make sure that they accept the  consequences of his actions and their actions by not ignoring them?

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning the  President's unvetted and ill-advised pardons that are leading to repeat  offenses. Congress should be here to protect innocent Americans and not  look away from the consequences of the President's actions.
