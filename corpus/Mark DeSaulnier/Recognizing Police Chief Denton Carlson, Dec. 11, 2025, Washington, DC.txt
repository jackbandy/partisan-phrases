Recognizing Police Chief Denton Carlson


Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary career of San Ramon, California, Police Chief Denton  Carlson as he retires after 27 years of service.

Chief Carlson began his law enforcement career in 1998 and later  joined the San Ramon Police Department during its founding in 2007.  Quickly rising through the ranks, he became captain in 2017 and chief  in 2022.

Chief Carlson additionally served as the director of the city's  Office of Emergency Management from 2015 to 2022. His leadership was  instrumental in launching the police department's community resource  and crime prevention division and its social media and emergency  communications systems.

Deeply respected in the community by all the citizens, please join me  in thanking Chief Carlson for his extraordinary and many years of  public service and for public safety and congratulating him on a well- deserved retirement.
