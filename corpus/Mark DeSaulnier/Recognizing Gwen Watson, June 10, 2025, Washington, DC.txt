Recognizing Gwen Watson


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692306/recognizing-gwen-watson


Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  service of Gwen Watson, who worked to uplift vulnerable populations  throughout her life in my community in the East Bay of the San  Francisco Bay Area and throughout the State of California.

Gwen began her career as a teacher in Louisiana, working with high  school students seeking vocational services.

She later moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where she served Contra  Costa County's homeless population through the St. Vincent de Paul Hope  Conference and the Interstate Faith Council of Contra Costa.

Gwen also served as the president of the League of Women Voters  Diablo Valley, overseeing the ``You Don't Need a Home Vote'' project.  In addition, in that position on the League of Women Voters, she  facilitated candidate forums. I remember many years ago when I first  ran for the Concord City Council, Gwen was there doing her civic best  with the League of Women Voters.

Sadly, Gwen passed away in May. She will be remembered for her  advocacy and her commitment to service. She was an inspiration to all  of us who knew her and called her a friend. Please join me in honoring  Gwen Watson for her invaluable contributions to her community and to  our country.
