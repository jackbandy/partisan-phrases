Restoration of Funding for Cancer Research

Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a survivor of stage IV  cancer to express my astonishment and to object to the Trump  administration's cuts to American cancer research.

Over the last 50 years, the 5-year cancer survival rate for people  like myself has risen from 49 percent to 68 percent. This is largely  because of American taxpayers' investment in the brilliant researchers  at the National Cancer Institute.

The administration's cuts to the National Cancer Institute's spending  by $842 million in its first 7 months alone put that trend in jeopardy.  Just as a return on investment, this is astonishingly bad. For every $1  spent by American taxpayers at NCI, they get almost $3 back. Experts  warn that we will lose a generation of scientists because of this  recklessness.

I urge the administration and my Republican colleagues to reverse  course, maintain our global leadership, and work toward a better future  for the 40 percent of Americans who will be diagnosed with cancer in  their lifetimes.
