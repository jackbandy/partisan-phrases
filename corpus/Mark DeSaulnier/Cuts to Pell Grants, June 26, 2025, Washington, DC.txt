Cuts to Pell Grants

Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, on May 22, House Republicans passed  their budget bill, which would make major cuts to the Pell Grant  program in order to finance tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy. This will  be one of the largest transfers of multigenerational wealth in the  history of the country.

Pell grants are awarded to help low-income students afford the cost  of higher education so that they can focus on their coursework.  Republican changes would force students with disabilities, students  with jobs, and primary caregivers to increase their course load or risk  losing their Pell grant awards.

Over 5,000 students in the district I represent in northern  California receive Pell grants. A study by the Center for Economic and  Policy Research found that the average income in a community rises by  2\1/2\ percent for every 1 percent increase in Pell grants.

We should focus on making education more accessible and doubling the  maximum Pell grant, not cutting off support for students who need it  the most for people who need support the least.
