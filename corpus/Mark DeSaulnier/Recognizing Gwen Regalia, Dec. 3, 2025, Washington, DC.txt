Recognizing Gwen Regalia


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1697386/recognizing-gwen-regalia


Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  public service of a mentor of mine and many people in California and in  the bay area, and a wonderful human being, a dedicated public servant  from Walnut Creek, California, in the East Bay of the San Francisco  Bay.

Gwen Regalia began her career as a fourth grade teacher--she was a  teacher all her life in many ways--before serving on the Walnut Creek  School District governing board for almost a decade.

Gwen later served on the city council for 21 years and also served  regionally on the Association of Bay Area Governments. She had five  terms as the mayor of the city of Walnut Creek, during which time she  championed the development of local institutions, like the Lesher  Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek and the Walnut Creek Library, two  remarkable local institutions.

Sadly, Gwen passed away in November. She will be remembered for her  outstanding leadership, her indelible mark that she left on Walnut  Creek and the San Francisco Bay Area, the State of California, and,  indeed, the United States of America.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Gwen, for her service and incredible  personality.
