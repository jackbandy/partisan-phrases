Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, in 2005, the 988 National Suicide  Prevention Lifeline was launched to provide 24/7 access to counseling  and referrals for Americans in crisis.

In recognition of these challenges, the challenges these Americans  face, the 988 lifeline provides specialty services targeted at LGBTQ  youth, who are at a higher risk of suicide than the population at  large.

According to a 2024 survey by the Trevor Project, 12 percent of LGBTQ  youth attempted suicide in the past year--12 percent of American youth  in this category.

Now, the Trump administration is reportedly considering eliminating  these specialized support services, which would cut off the lifesaving  resources they provide.

Young people, young Americans, when they are in crisis, should be  able to speak to a professional counselor who understands their  experiences and is trained to communicate with people facing similar  struggles.

This is a cruel idea. For the health and safety of all young  Americans, the President must immediately reverse course on this ill- advised, cruel, and dangerous plan.
