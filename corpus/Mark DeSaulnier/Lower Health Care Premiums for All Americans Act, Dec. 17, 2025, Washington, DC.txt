Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise as a former small business owner having over  three decades owning and managing restaurants in strong opposition to  this sad healthcare plan.

After kicking 10 million Americans off Medicaid in the big, ugly  bill, Republicans are following up with this proposal that the  Congressional Budget Office says will take healthcare away from an  additional 100,000 Americans a year.

We need to make healthcare more affordable for all Americans. Despite  spending 18\1/2\ percent of our GDP in the United States on healthcare,  we have the worst outcomes: the highest mortality rate, life  expectancy, and acuity.

We need to make it more affordable. I agree with the ranking member  and the chair that we should work together on the inefficiencies in the  system. However, this is not it.

After spending 15 years on their healthcare plan, Republicans have  just repackaged some of their old ideas, and they are hoping the  American people won't notice that it is not going to help. Instead, we  should extend the tax credits for 3 years and come together.
