Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Father Paul  Shaughnessy and to welcome him as our guest chaplain for today.

I first met Father Shaughnessy at the College of the Holy Cross in  Mr. McGovern's district, in Worcester, Massachusetts. We were  classmates, friends, teammates, and we spent an occasional evening in  Worcester at an Irish bar having a pint, maybe two--we were young-- talking about life.

Father Shaughnessy joined the Jesuits and became an ordained priest  before making the noble decision to enlist in the Marines in 1994.

Lieutenant Commander Shaughnessy brought faith and comfort to many  soldiers, including a congregation of 32,000 in Iraq.

His impact has earned him a number of accolades, such as Meritorious  Service Medals and the Navy and Marine Corps commendation medals.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Father Paul Shaughnessy for his service and for  sharing his wisdom and faith with us today.
