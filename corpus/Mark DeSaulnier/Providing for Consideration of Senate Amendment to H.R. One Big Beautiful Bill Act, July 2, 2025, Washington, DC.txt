Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, this bill would cause household resources for the  poorest Americans to decrease while the obscenely rich will get richer.

I offered two amendments in the Rules Committee, one to prevent  people with disabilities from being kicked off Medicaid and one to help  low-income students afford an education that they earned.

Unfortunately, Republicans refused to consider them, as they yet  again worked through the dead of night to rip off hardworking Americans  and give tax breaks to the richest Americans who don't need them.

Even FOX News reports that it is projected to increase the Federal  deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade.

This bill is nothing more than a vanity project for the President,  and it betrays the American people. I strongly oppose this reckless  legislation and urge my colleagues to do the right thing.
