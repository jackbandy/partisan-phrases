Recognizing Suicide Prevention Month


Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of September  being Suicide Prevention Month.

More than 35 years ago, my father took his own life by firearm.  Unfortunately, this kind of tragedy is too common in America.

There were 1.4 million suicide attempts in 2019, making suicide one  of the most pressing public health crises in America. In 2023, over  49,000 Americans died by suicide. Of those deaths, nearly 6 out of 10  involved a firearm.

Firearms also account for just 5 percent of American suicide  attempts, but unfortunately, firearms account for over 50 percent of  the deaths.

This points to a disturbing trend that those who attempt suicide by  other means often regret their attempt. They don't do it again, and  they seek help. That option, unfortunately, is rarely available to  those people like my dad who had a weapon available.

Too many people don't seek help when they need it. Whether they are  held back by fear, stigma, or lack of access, we need to do more as a  society to remove all the barriers and encourage open and supportive  communities.

Please, if you are having issues around depression or suicidal  thoughts, seek help and call 988.
