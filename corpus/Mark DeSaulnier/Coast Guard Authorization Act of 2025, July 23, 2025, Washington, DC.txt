Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2025

Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding me the time. I acknowledge the leadership of the chair and the  ranking member of the full committee and the subcommittee for their  great, bipartisan work on this initiative.

One of the Coast Guard's primary missions is search and rescue. In  fiscal year 2025 alone, their efforts saved more than 2,200 people and  $40 million in property. To keep up this important work, they need  robust funding and support, which is just what this bill delivers.

With the administration's aggressive funding and staffing cuts,  however, at the National Weather Service and FEMA and the increasing  severity and frequency of natural disasters due in my opinion to  climate change, the risks associated with those disasters continue to  rise.

Unfortunately, we don't have to look any further than recent floods  and devastating storms to know how important the Coast Guard can be in  responding to these emergencies and disasters, but they need their  partners at FEMA and NOAA.

I strongly support this bill and the great work the Coast Guard does  to protect our citizens and waters, including in and around the  district I represent in the San Francisco Bay Area. I also ask my  colleagues to continue to endeavor to invest not just in the Coast  Guard but in their partner agencies like FEMA and the National Weather  Service to ensure safety and mission readiness.
