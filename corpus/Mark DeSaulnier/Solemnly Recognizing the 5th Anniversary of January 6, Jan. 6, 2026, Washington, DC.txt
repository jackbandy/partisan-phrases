Solemnly Recognizing the 5th Anniversary of January 6

Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the fifth anniversary of  an awful day in American history and this Chamber.

I was one of the last Members of Congress evacuated by the Capitol  Police into a room just to my left off the floor. On that day, the  damage caused is hard to quantify. Mr. Speaker, 174 Capitol Police  officers were injured while protecting this sacred place, and 5  officers lost their lives. The Capitol itself sustained $30 million in  damages. In total, that day cost American taxpayers $2.7 billion, Mr.  Speaker. Think of that.

While the insurrectionists did not succeed that day, they did cause  even bigger damage than the dollar damage. The person most responsible  for this continues to behave the way he did then.

George Santayana famously said that those who forget history are  condemned to repeat it. I pray that that is not the case. We must  remember honestly, all of us, what happened that day.
