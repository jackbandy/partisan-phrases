Rising Costs for Small Businesses


Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, as a former small business owner, I  would like to spend a moment talking about the consequences of the  administration's policies, both tariffs and the erratic behavior, that  have an impact on people like myself, people who owned restaurants for  decades, and the thin margins they operate under.

Mr. Speaker, recent surveys have said, 42 percent of small businesses  reported increased costs due to the administration's policies, both  tariffs and otherwise. I don't think they realized or thought through  the effect of these policies on Main Street America.

Over 45 percent of Americans are employed by small business. They are  the backbone of Main Street and our economy.

The administration and my colleagues on the other side have to think  through the consequences of this erratic behavior on Main Street  America.
