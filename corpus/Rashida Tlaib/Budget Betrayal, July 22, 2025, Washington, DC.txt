Budget Betrayal

Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, Republicans rammed through Trumps' big  budget betrayal with the largest cut to healthcare in American history.  It will cut Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act by over $1.1 trillion.

In Michigan, in my State alone, over 450,000 people are now at risk  of losing their healthcare coverage, including children, seniors, and  people with disabilities in our district.

These cuts will also impact EMS and ambulance services across our  Nation. This budget will shrink the funds available to these  departments and make it impossible for them to keep operating.

The impact will also be felt in rural areas where hospitals and  community health centers will close because they rely heavily on  Medicaid reimbursements.

We all know we have sick care in our country, and Medicaid is the  only Band-aid right now to keep it all together. This bill is a death  sentence, and over 50,000 people will die as a result of it.

Madam Speaker, you will see. Republicans gave away trillions of  dollars to the richest people on the planet and are letting our  children and seniors die from the lack of healthcare coverage.

They should be ashamed.
