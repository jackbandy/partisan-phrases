Stop Body Camera Paywalls

Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, we all know the public deserves full  transparency when it comes to holding police accountable for  misconduct. Instead, States and cities all across our country have  started adopting new laws to charge the public hundreds of dollars in  fees to view or access police body camera footage.

These videos are public records and are essential for accountability  and justice for victims of police violence. Putting this footage that  should be publicly available behind a paywall makes achieving  accountability much more difficult for our residents, especially those  who won't be able to afford it, and they tend to be the ones more  frequently abused by police.

That is why I am introducing the Stop Body Camera Paywalls Act to  prevent any State or unit of local government that creates a paywall  for access to these public records from receiving Federal law  enforcement grants.

Again, we must make sure that we have transparency, especially when  it comes to Federal law enforcement grants. This bill is a necessary  step in a wider effort to end police impunity for abuses and ensure the  utmost transparency, accountability, and justice for our communities.
