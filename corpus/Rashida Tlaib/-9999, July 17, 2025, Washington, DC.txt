Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, the 12th Congressional District recognizes  and honors Richard  LeBlanc for his extraordinary 33-year career in public service and on  his recent retirement as the City of Westland's City Clerk.

Mr. LeBlanc's steadfast dedication to community and service to our  residents has spanned five elected offices, from his start on the  Wayne-Westland Board of Education to the Michigan House of  Representatives, and most recently, as Westland City Clerk. At every  step, LeBlanc was known as a hard worker and accessible leader, focused  on making our government work for everyday families. He modernized the  Clerk's Office, expanded access to civic participation, and mentored  countless public servants along the way, shaping the lives and careers  of young leaders. He is proud of his strong roots and service to the  Western Wayne community. I have seen his commitment firsthand.

His retirement marks our district's appreciation for his service to  our families. His recent heartfelt tribute from city officials and the  presentation of a key to the city, is a symbol of how deeply he shaped  Westland's civic life and communities. While Richard LeBlanc's formal  legislative work has ended, his legacy of service and integrity will  continue to inspire our community for generations to come.
