Housing is A Human Right

Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, we all know that right now the housing crisis  is real for so many of our families across the country, and I know many  of us in this Chamber, especially those on the left, have always said  housing is a human right.

To address this crisis, we know that we need action at every level of  government, but many local communities need additional assistance and  capacity. That is why I am so incredibly grateful that the House passed  the Housing Our Communities Act, part of the Housing for the 21st  Century Act legislative package.

The Housing Our Communities Act directs the HUD Secretary to  establish a competitive grant program to support a wide range of  affordable housing planning and implementation activities.

For example, grants can support officials in crafting their housing  plans, updating their zoning codes, or increasing capacity to conduct  housing inspections so that new developments are completed faster and  much more efficiently.

This bill provides civil servants and policymakers with the support  they need to make affordable housing a reality for so many of our  communities.

I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation  immediately and begin to address the housing crisis that is devastating  our country.
