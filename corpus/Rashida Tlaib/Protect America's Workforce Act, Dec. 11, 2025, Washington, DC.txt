Protect America's Workforce Act


Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, our Federal workforce deserves a voice. We  know the executive order was the largest act of union busting in our  Nation's history. It stripped away collective bargaining rights of over  a million Federal employees in over 40 Federal agencies.

The agencies covered by the executive order employ nearly 82 percent  of the unionized Federal workforce. They are workers in every single  congressional district.

These are workers that protect our food, our water, our air, our  skies, and care for our veterans, our children, and our seniors. They  are our neighbors.

Many people in this Chamber know that a union may have helped them  achieve the dream that they have of serving, as well as being able to  take care of their families. Many of us are recipients indirectly or  directly because of unions.

Collective bargaining isn't a privilege, Mr. Speaker, that can just  be signed away. It is a fundamental right. When working people have a  voice on their job, services improve, accountability grows, and we all  benefit. The bill doesn't just restore fairness, Mr. Speaker. It  restores dignity and due process.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support Protect America's  Workforce Act.
