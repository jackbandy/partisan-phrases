Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, the 12th Congressional District congratulates  Reverend Lydie Ngoie and the members of Trinity Faith United Methodist  Chuich on 35 years of spiritual worship and leadership in our  community.

Trinity Faith blossomed from humble beginnings. Founded in 1918 in  the basement of a building under construction on Twelfth Street, just  eleven devoted charter members came together, united by a vision of  faith and service. Their commitment and love for their community  sparked growth, soon reaching 23 members. As the neighborhood around  them evolved, so did the church, embracing change and relocating to a  new home on West McNichols in 1950. By May 27, 1951, Trinity Church  broke ground on their new fellowship hall, proudly serving a growing  congregation of 210 strong.

While expanding their congregation and educational programs, Trinity  Church opened its doors to Faith Bethany United Methodist Church,  offering them a temporary home until a permanent location was secured.  In 1989, the two churches united, forming what we now know as Trinity  Faith United Methodist Church. Over these 35 years, they've shown a  deep commitment to serving others--whether through their food pantry  that nourishes those in need or through their dedication to spiritual  learning and growth.

The 12th Congressional District honors their service and dedication  to creating a place of friendship and learning for our community. I  thank them for being a guiding light rooted in faith and service to  all.
