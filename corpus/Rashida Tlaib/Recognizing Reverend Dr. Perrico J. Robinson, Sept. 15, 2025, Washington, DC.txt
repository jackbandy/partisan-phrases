Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District  celebrates Reverend Dr. Perrico Robinson, Sr., as the newly appointed  Pastor to the Womack Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal Church of  Inkster, Michigan.

Reverend Robinson is a passionate figure in the ministry and began  preaching at the age of 14 in his home state of Tennessee. He began his  education at Freed-Hardeman University, where he received a bachelor's  degree in biblical studies. He also holds a Master of Ministry in  Pastoral Counseling from Rawlings School of Divinity and a Doctorate  from Andersonville Theological Seminary.

With over two decades of ministerial experience, Reverend Robinson  has held several leadership roles in churches across our country,  including Louisiana, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Illinois. Dr. Robinson is  known for delivering powerful sermons. His favorite biblical passage is  Ephesians 3:20, which states, ``Now unto Him who is able to do  exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the  power that works in us.''

The 12th Congressional District is pleased to welcome Reverend  Robinson and look forward to his contributions to our community. We  wish him all the best in his leadership and ministry and look forward  to the significant impact he will have on the C.M.E. Church and our  district.
