Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, the 12th Congressional District of Michigan  recognizes the opening of the MaryAnn Wright Animal Adoption and  Education Center in Dearborn. The center is a new facility that belongs  to the Friends for Animals of Metro Detroit, a nonprofit animal shelter  that provides invaluable services to our community and our beloved  animals.

Friends for Animals of Metro Detroit has extended their animal  rescue, adoption, and education services over the past 27 years to  serve people and animals within and beyond the Detroit Metropolitan  Area. We extend our deepest gratitude to the staff and volunteers who  make the MaryAnn Wright Animal Adoption and Education Center work every  day.

Our district and community recognize the crucial services the MaryAnn  Wright Adoption and Education Center delivers. We will see the impact  of their contributions for generations to come, and we, alongside our  animals, will continue to acknowledge their selfless dedication. I  congratulate them on this momentous occasion.
