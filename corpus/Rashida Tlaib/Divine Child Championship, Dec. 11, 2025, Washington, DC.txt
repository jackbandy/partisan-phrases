Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Dearborn's Divine Child High  School for winning the Division 4 State championship with a thrilling  23-22 win.

After a dominant season, they rose to the moment at Ford Field to  earn their first State championship in 40 years. It was an incredible  game and an accomplishment that these players, coaches, and families  will remember forever.

The Falcon players showed grit, heart, and determination from the  start to finish. Their offense came alive when it mattered most, and  their defense stood strong under pressure.

We saw remarkable leadership on the field and witnessed the team's  incredible perseverance through challenges.

I thank the coaches, the families, and all those who helped with the  mentorship and planning and the belief in our athletes.

I congratulate the team on a game and a season that they will  remember, again, for the rest of their lives. They all brought home a  championship, and they did it with teamwork and pride. They made us all  incredibly, incredibly happy that day.

They made their school and community and so many smile, so I  congratulate the Falcons.
