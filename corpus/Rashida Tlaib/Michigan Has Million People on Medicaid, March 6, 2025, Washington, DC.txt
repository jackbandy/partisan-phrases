Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I remind many of my constituents in the 12th  Congressional District that I hear you and I understand the pain and  the fear that you all are going through as you continue to hear about  the $880 billion in Medicaid cuts.

The budget proposal, that overwhelmingly on party lines Republicans  supported, cuts the very health coverage for those that only use it for  long-term care. Families and parents that have a child with  disabilities and special needs rely heavily on this.

I remind you all, the Trump administration continues to really attack  the values that we have in regard to taking care of our most  vulnerable. However, shredding the Constitution--that is what I kept  really seeing as I continued to watch the joint address. He is  illegally dismantling--I say illegally, not me, but the judges continue  to say that it is illegal--dismantling Federal agencies that we have  authorized to provide services for our families.

Mr. Speaker, I remind folks that 60 percent of Americans live  paycheck to paycheck. In Michigan, 2.6 million residents have Medicaid.  We have got to stick with the people, not the billionaires.
