Starvation in Gaza


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693848/starvation-in-gaza


Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, the Israeli Government has deliberately  blocked food, medicine, and fuel from entering Gaza. The entire  population of Gaza is experiencing famine, and half a million  Palestinians are facing catastrophic levels of starvation.

At least 66 Palestinian children have already been starved to death.  Maybe if my colleagues would close their eyes, or pretend that they are  not Palestinians, they would care, that they would care that  Palestinians have been forced to eat grass and animal feed--they are  human beings--while thousands of trucks carrying food sit blocked at  the border.

The Israeli Government is using starvation as a weapon of war. Now,  the Israeli forces are deliberately shooting and killing starving  Palestinians lined up for food, and the responses by the Israeli  Government do not add up. Mr. Speaker, 875 have been murdered in 6  weeks alone.

The so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, backed by the Israeli  Government and the Trump administration, is a deadly sham. The United  Nations calls it a death trap.

The Israeli soldiers have even admitted it themselves. They were  ordered to deliberately shoot unarmed Palestinians, many of them  children, calling it a killing field.

This is not a game, Mr. Speaker. These are human beings.

If colleagues need to close their eyes again and pretend they are not  Palestinians to care, then maybe they should. We would stop this  madness and stop supporting the genocide in Gaza.
