Epstein Remarks

Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, Republicans have to decide if they are going  to protect pedophiles or seek justice for survivors of sex trafficking  and abuse.

I sat across from survivors--some of them were as young as 13 and 14  at the time--and they told us over and over again to follow the money.

The Treasury Department, Mr. Speaker, is sitting on suspicious  activity reports on Epstein's financial network, detailing thousands of  transactions totaling more than $1.5 billion. In fact, J.P. Morgan knew  about these suspicious transactions for more than a decade. He had 134  accounts with J.P. Morgan, but they chose to look the other way and  continue to profit.

The corrupt administration would rather protect the rich and  powerful, their billionaire donors, and stop the truth from coming out.

Survivors of this horrific and systematic sexual abuse deserve  justice, and the public deserves to know the full truth.

Don't be fooled. President Trump has the power to release the full,  unredacted files right now without congressional action and end the  coverup today.
