Water Rate Increase


Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, water is a human right. We can't live without  it, but far too often our government treats it as just another product  to be sold.

In Michigan, the Great Lakes Water Authority voted to increase water  rates by 5.9 percent and sewage rates by 4.5 percent. They approved  these unaffordable increases despite unanimous and passionate public  opposition, Mr. Speaker.

I want folks to imagine how it feels for many of our residents in  Detroit who have been living out of hotels for weeks after a massive  water main break flooded their neighborhood, their homes, and even  their vehicles. Now they are going to have to be paying more for their  water.

The Trump administration is already slashing every critical support  program that the most vulnerable in our communities, especially our  seniors, rely on to pay their bills. This will mean more water shutoffs  and more stories of families melting snow and harvesting rainwater to  shower and cook with.

Our policy has to meet our principles. Water must be a human right in  the United States of America.
