Voter Suppression, Plain and Simple

Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, the SAVE Act is not about protecting  elections; it is about silencing voters. It is voter suppression, plain  and simple. The so-called SAVE Act is also attacking, of course, voting  rights and our access to the ballot box.

This bill would create unnecessary new barriers that would  disenfranchise millions of Americans. This bill would also increase the  purges of registered voters, literally kicking people off the list.

Very clearly, Federal law already prohibits noncitizens from voting  in Federal and State elections. Over 21 million Americans lack easy  access to the documents this law would require for voter registration.

The SAVE Act would target marginalized communities like those in my  district, and of course impacting people of color, naturalized  citizens, and low-income folks. Mr. Speaker, 69 million American women  would also be unable to register to vote simply because they changed  their last name after they got married.

We need to pass legislation to stop billionaires from buying our  elections, not making it harder for the American people to vote. I am  going to vote ``no'' on this bill. I did it last term, and I am going  to do it again. Shame on those who continue to support this kind of  legislation.
