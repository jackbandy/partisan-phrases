Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, this is not about America first. This is  about billionaires first and corporations first.

I will take a moment to bring part of my district into this Chamber.  I will read a letter from Angeline from Redford Township.

She said: ``I am terrified about what the Trump administration is  doing to those of us living in poverty with these cuts to SNAP and  Medicaid.

``My family and I could not survive without these programs. It is bad  enough we are struggling to purchase the basic essentials and have been  heavily leaning on food pantries not only for extra food but also for  toilet paper and soap.''

That is with having the benefits that they have now.

``I am waiting for my Social Security case to go on appeal. I  currently have no income. I am unable to work due to spinal injuries.  With less people working at the Social Security office, it has taken  longer than it should to review my case.

``I am barely surviving as it is, and I couldn't see any of my  doctors without Medicaid. My grandchildren couldn't be able to see  doctors. My single daughter and myself both rely on SNAP to eat and  Medicaid to see our doctors.

``It is very clear those voting for these cuts have never experienced  the traumatic effects of living in poverty and the threat of taking the  only help we have away. Please don't let them do this.''
