Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, Agent Orange exposure continues to negatively  impact the lives of our veterans, Vietnamese people, Vietnamese  Americans, and their children.

As we mark 50 years after the United States' withdrawal from Vietnam,  it is time to meet our moral and legal obligations to heal the wounds  inflicted by these atrocities. That is why I am proud to introduce the  Victims of Agent Orange Act and the Agent Orange Relief Act, because we  know that the devastating harms that our country committed in Vietnam  did not end in 1975.

The U.S. exposed millions of people in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to  deadly toxins like Agent Orange which to this day causes birth defects  and deadly disease, as well as premature death, Mr. Speaker.

For there to be any justice for the war crimes committed in Vietnam,  the United States, our country, must devote itself to repair by  cleaning these ongoing Agent Orange contamination sites, investing in  medical care for those impacted, and removing unexploded ordnance. Our  country must never again commit these acts of violence anywhere.

I ask my colleagues to please support this legislative package to  bring justice for those victims of Agent Orange.
