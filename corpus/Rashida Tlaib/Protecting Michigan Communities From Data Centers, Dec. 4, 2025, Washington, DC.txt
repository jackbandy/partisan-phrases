Protecting Michigan Communities From Data Centers

Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, 267 percent, that is how much energy prices  increase in communities located near Big Tech data centers.

DTE Energy, in my State, already charges us some of the highest rates  in the Nation with some of the most unreliable services.

Do you like clean water coming out of your taps at affordable prices?  So do I. You better hope a data center doesn't get built near you.

Do you like breathing clean air and being outdoors? I do. Organize  like hell to keep these extremely loud data centers and their emissions  out of your community.

So, for more expensive utility bills, and increased air, water,  light, and noise pollution, we get a lot more AI slop bullshit that  nobody asked for.

The Silicon Valley billionaires don't care about our communities.  Believe me when I tell you, all they care about is profit. They don't  care that these data centers will absolutely make life miserable. All  they care about is the money and the power.

I am so inspired by the grassroots movement in the State of Michigan  right now popping up all over the State to protect our communities from  data centers. I want them to know loud and clear, here in Congress, I  have your back.
