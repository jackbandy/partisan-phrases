Letter to Alex Azar, Secretary of the Dept. of Health and Human Services - Senate Dems to HHS: Reopen the ACA Marketplace, Allow more Americans to Get Health Insurance During Covid-19 Pandemic


Dear Secretary Azar,

We write to urge you to reopen the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) online marketplace through aunique Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to allow any American to enroll in a comprehensivehealth insurance plan. Currently, millions of Americans are uninsured and anxious, not onlyabout what the possibility of contracting COVID-19 could mean for their health and that of theirfamily, but also for their financial stability. Opening up the ACA marketplace would provide aneasy pathway to coverage for those who under previous circumstances may have decided toforego health insurance or purchase a substandard, junk insurance plan, but now in a globalpandemic are in vital need of comprehensive coverage to protect themselves, their families, andour broader community.The Trump Administration's reported decision not to open an SEP, despite earlier congressionalrequests, and leave millions of Americans uninsured and underinsured during this unprecedentedpublic health crisis will inevitably mean fewer individuals seeking testing and treatment--prolonging the spread of the disease--and will put more families in dire financial straits. TheCOVID-19 pandemic is also causing millions of people to lose their jobs and their employerprovided health insurance. We should be promoting comprehensive health insurance plans to allthose impacted, not looking to divert funds appropriated to support hospitals, or promoting junkinsurance plans that don't have to provide coverage for needed services or offer consumerprotections.When the ACA was passed, Congress included the authority to establish SEPs because weunderstood that everyday Americans may face extenuating circumstances for which they shouldnot be penalized. It is inexcusable for you not to exercise that authority during perhaps thelargest extenuating circumstance of our lifetimes, and to choose to lock out millions ofAmericans from the ACA exchanges because they failed to predict a sweeping global pandemic.Furthermore, the Administration's continued promotion of junk plans which are not required tocomply with consumer protections that limit out-of-pocket costs or coverage of essential health benefits, including those that are needed to pay for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19such as hospital care, emergency care, laboratory services, or preventive services, leave manyAmericans vulnerable. Families already struggling to make ends meet in light of the globaleconomic downturn should not be exposed to potential financial ruin because of a lack ofcomprehensive insurance coverage.An additional benefit of opening an SEP is that it would publicize to all Americans who havelost their jobs that the exchanges are open again and that they can enroll in high-quality healthinsurance, providing at least a modicum of reassurance during these deeply troubling times.Given the millions of job losses in recent weeks and the likelihood of millions more in the nearfuture, now is the time to open up the health insurance marketplace to everyone so that peopleknow that losing their job does not mean they must also lose access to health insurance coverage.We believe opening an ACA SEP is the clearest way to cover the millions of uninsured andunderinsured Americans in the 38 states that use the federal platform, and to providecomprehensive protections for COVID-19-related treatment and prevention. In a demonstrationof the dramatic demand for such a move, all but one of the 13 state-based marketplaces haveopened an SEP, with such high levels of interest that many are now extending the period byseveral weeks.We urge you to put aside the partisan politics of the past, and to expand health coverage tomillions of Americans by opening an SEP expeditiously.

Sincerely,
