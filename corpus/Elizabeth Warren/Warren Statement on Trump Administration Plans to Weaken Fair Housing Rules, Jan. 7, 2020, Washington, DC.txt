Warren Statement on Trump Administration Plans to Weaken Fair Housing Rules


United States Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) today released the following statement on the Trump Administration's plans to replace the 2015 Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule.

"It's shameful that at a time when housing discrimination is still rampant, President Trump and Secretary Carson continue to try to gut foundational civil rights laws like the Fair Housing Act," said Senator Warren. "This new proposal is a major retreat in the Federal Government's efforts to confront its history of discrimination and reverse that legacy so that all families, across all communities, have access to the resources they need to succeed."

In March 2019, Senator Warren led her colleagues in reintroducing the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act, historic legislation that would help bring down costs for renters and buyers, level the playing field so working families everywhere can find a decent place to live at a decent price, and take the first step to address the effects of decades of housing discrimination on communities of color. In 2018 she penned an op-ed in The Root on "America's Ugly History of Housing Discrimination."
