Mass. Congressional Delegation Urges White House to Support Commonwealth's Coronavirus Efforts


United States Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Edward J. Markey (D-MA), along with Representatives James P. McGovern (D-MA-02), Stephen F. Lynch (D-MA-08), William Keating (D-MA-09), Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-MA-04), Katherine Clark (D-MA-05), Seth Moulton (D-MA-06), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA-07) and Lori Trahan (D-MA-03), sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence, head of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus, urging him to take swift, specific action to support Massachusetts and other states as they combat the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This request comes in the wake of Governor Baker declaring a state of emergency in the Commonwealth.

"As the Task Force continues to respond to COVID-19's spread, it is essential that it supports and communicates with the state, local, and tribal governments providing on-the-ground responses to the virus," the lawmakers wrote.

In their letter, the Massachusetts lawmakers highlighted several steps the federal government could take to support Massachusetts during the outbreak, including:

Supporting the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's request for assets from the Strategic National Stockpile;Taking all necessary steps to expand access to affordable COVID-19 diagnostic tests;Continually monitoring the supplemental funding needs of Massachusetts public health officials and request supplemental funding from Congress as necessary; andConsidering the need for wraparound services for quarantined, sick, and other individuals affected by COVID-19."While our request is specific to Massachusetts, we believe that the Task Force should consider taking these actions in support of other states as well," the lawmakers continued.
