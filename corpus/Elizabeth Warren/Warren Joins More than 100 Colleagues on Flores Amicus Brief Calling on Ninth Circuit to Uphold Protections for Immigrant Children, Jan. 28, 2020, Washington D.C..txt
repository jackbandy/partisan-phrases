Warren Joins More than 100 Colleagues on Flores Amicus Brief Calling on Ninth Circuit to Uphold Protections for Immigrant Children


United States Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) joined U.S Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (CA-12) along with 112 of their colleagues in submitting an amicus brief in Flores v. Barr. The brief urges the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to reject the Trump administration's latest attempt to use regulations to gut the Flores Settlement Agreement, which provides vital, long-standing protections ensuring minimum health and safety requirements for children in custody.

The lawmakers wrote: "Congress enacted [the Homeland Security Act and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008] to ensure the safety and well-being of migrant children and to set forth specific procedures for the screening, processing, and custody of those children. The regulations, by contrast, deprive children of access to those statutory protections and do not comport with the text and history of those statutes, or with Congress's plan in passing them."

In addition to Leader Schumer and Senator Warren, the brief was signed by U.S. Senators Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Benjamin L.

Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Michael F. Bennet (D-CO), Christopher A. Coons (D-DE), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Jack Reed (D-RI), Tina Smith (D-MN), Robert P. Casey (D-PA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Bernard Sanders (D-VT), and Patrick J. Leahy (D-VT).
