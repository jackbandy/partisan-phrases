Senators Markey, Sanders, Warren Call for Trusted Source Outside Trump White House to Provide Unbiased Coronavirus Information


Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), joined by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), today wrote to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, calling on them to serve as a trusted authority outside of the executive branch for coronavirus information.  In their letter, the Senators point out that the Trump administration has repeatedly misled the public, twisted the truth for political gain, and marginalized public health experts when convenient, causing confusion and chaos in the national response to the pandemic. Senators Markey, Sanders, and Warren argue that the expertise of scientists, physicians, and engineers is especially valuable to help guide decisionmakers and local elected leaders in moments of uncertainty but extraordinary consequence.

 

"Conflicting messages from the Trump administration have caused confusion and chaos in the national response," write the Senators in their letter. "Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Nationals Institutes of Health are capable and well-qualified to help address many of these questions, we have seen the Trump administration's willingness to stifle the ability of these agencies to communicate openly with the public. The public needs a trusted authority outside of the executive branch."
