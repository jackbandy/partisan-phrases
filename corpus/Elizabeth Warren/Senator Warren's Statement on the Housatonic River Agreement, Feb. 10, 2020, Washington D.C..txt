Senator Warren's Statement on the Housatonic River Agreement


United States Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) today released the following statement on the mediated settlement reached between the Environmental Protection Agency and General Electric Co. regarding clean-up of the Housatonic River.

"When harmful chemicals are released into our environment, we owe it to our families and communities to come together at the federal, state, and local levels to fight for responsible clean-up and environmental justice," said Senator Warren. "Massachusetts communities are holding GE accountable for at least part of the Housatonic River clean-up, and together we'll keep fighting for better protections."
