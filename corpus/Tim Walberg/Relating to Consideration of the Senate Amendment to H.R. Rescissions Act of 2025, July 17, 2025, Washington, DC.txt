Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration's reckless  spending caused rampant inflation, burdening workers, families,  farmers, and small businesses, unless you believe the spin that  continues tonight. I don't think America is believing it.

After passing the largest savings in America's history through the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this month, the Rescissions Act  builds on House Republicans' unprecedented success in reining in  wasteful spending and the President's willingness to not spend  everything that we give him. That is unusual.

The list of egregious foreign aid projects is endless. Here are just  a few: $3 million for Iraqi Sesame Street, $18 million to improve  gender diversity in the Mexican street lighting industry, $2.5 million  to teach children how to make environmentally friendly reproductive  health decisions, whatever that means.

This abuse of taxpayer dollars must end. The Rescissions Act would  prioritize the needs of Americans over everyone else.

Mr. WALBERG. The Rescissions Act would prioritize the needs of  American people instead of funding far-left foreign initiatives.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, which represents  a vital step in reining in wasteful spending and Big Government abuse  of the taxpayer.
