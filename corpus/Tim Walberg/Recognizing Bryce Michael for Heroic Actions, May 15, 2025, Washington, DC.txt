Recognizing Bryce Michael for Heroic Actions


Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bryce Michael for  his heroic actions and dedication to helping our Nation's students.

Bryce is a bus driver for the Columbia School District in Brooklyn,  Michigan, and was driving students home when a kindergarten student  placed a quarter in her mouth and began to choke.

Bryce immediately sprang into action, assisted the student so that  she was able to cough up the quarter and was no longer under duress.

I thank Bryce for his quick actions and calm demeanor, as well as his  commitment to caring for the students on his bus every day. His  dedication and passion for his job is evidenced through his daily  actions.

Bryce is a hero, and his many contributions to our community are  worthy of recognition.
