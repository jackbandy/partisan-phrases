One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is one big,  beautiful win for the American people.

Americans struggled under crushing inflation driven by the Biden- Harris administration's outrageous spending. Even worse, the Biden- Harris administration spent billions on reckless student loan repayment  pauses, forcing Americans who never set foot on a college campus to  cover the costs of elite Ivy League degrees.

House Republicans have the chance to right those wrongs and deliver  real results for the American people by passing the One Big Beautiful  Bill Act.

Under President Trump, our economy is booming, thanks to progrowth  policies that help workers, students, and taxpayers prosper. By passing  this bill, we have a chance to seize on a generational opportunity to  help put more Americans back on the path to the American Dream.
