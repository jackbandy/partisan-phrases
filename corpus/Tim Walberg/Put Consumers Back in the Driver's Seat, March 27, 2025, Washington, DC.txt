Put Consumers Back in the Driver's Seat

Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, last year, the EPA finalized a rule which  set aggressive emission standards for vehicles, amounting to a de facto  EV mandate.

While I am not against EVs or certainly against reducing emissions,  we must not push misguided regulations that limit consumer choice,  burden the American auto industry, and increase reliance on China.

President Trump recently issued an executive order to eliminate the  EV mandate, demonstrating his commitment to repealing excessive  regulations. However, we must take further steps to prevent future  administrations from issuing similar mandates.

That is why I have partnered with Representative Fulcher to introduce  the Choice in Automobile Retail Sales, or CARS, Act, which will prevent  similar EV mandates and safeguard Americans' freedom to choose the  vehicle that is best for them. We must put consumers back in the  driver's seat and ensure the future of the auto industry is forged  through innovation and not mandates.
