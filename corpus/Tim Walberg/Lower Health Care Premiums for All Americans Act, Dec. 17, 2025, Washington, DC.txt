Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6703.

Because of the unaffordable care act, healthcare costs are out-of- control, and small businesses and the families that they employ are  paying the price. The unaffordable care act drove premiums up and added  red tape forcing many small employers to drop coverage or stop offering  it altogether.

Now my Democrat colleagues want to extend enhanced benefits that they  couldn't get their own party to support for more than 3 years when they  passed them.

They made this problem, and now they want us to fix it by doing the  same thing that has extended this problem. They want our family,  friends, and neighbors to suffer further pain as opposed to joining us  and fixing the problem as opposed to extending it.

My bill, the Association Health Plans Act, allows small businesses  and self-employed Americans to band together, like large companies, to  lower costs and deliver high-quality coverage. The CBO report today  estimates that this could cover more than 200,000 previously uninsured  Americans and attract 700,000 people annually to association health  plans.

Complementing this, the Self-Insurance Protection Act, authored by  Representative Bob Onder, shields small businesses from regulatory  overreach while expanding affordable healthcare options.

Together, these measures, included in the Lower Health Care Premiums  for All Americans Act, cut red tape, protect choice, and lower costs.

I plead with my Democrat colleagues to join us in bringing about a  remedy to our healthcare system which is broken because of the  unaffordable care act.

They broke it, but please join us to fix it.

Mr. WALBERG.

Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.

Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, most Americans rely on employer-provided healthcare, but  government-driven costs are making that coverage more expensive every  year. Families are paying more, and small businesses are struggling to  keep up with the mandates and the red tape.

Americans deserve affordable, high-quality coverage that puts  decisions back where they belong with workers, families, and employers,  not the Federal Government.

Bottom line, the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act  empowers workers and job creators and makes healthcare more affordable  for everyday Americans. By the way, perchance you want to keep the  unaffordable care act for yourself, you still can.
