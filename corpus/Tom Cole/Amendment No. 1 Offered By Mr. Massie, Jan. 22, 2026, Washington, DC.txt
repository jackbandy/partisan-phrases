Mr. COLE. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.

The motion was agreed to.

Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Fulcher) having assumed the chair, Mr. Walberg, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 7148)  making further consolidated appropriations for the fiscal year ending  September 30, 2026, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution  thereon.
