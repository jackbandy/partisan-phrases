Mr. HARDER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  opening of The Cambodian Experience: Our Journey to America, Finding  Freedom at the Haggin Museum in Stockton, California. This exhibit  documents the experiences of Cambodian Americans, tracing their journey  from the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge regime to refugee resettlement  and community building in the United States.

Developed and curated by the United Cambodian American Network  (UCAN), a nonprofit organization based in Stockton, the exhibit  presents a comprehensive narrative through oral histories, archival  materials, artifacts, and multimedia storytelling. It highlights the  contributions of Cambodian Americans and underscores the role of  refugee communities in the broader American story.

Stockton, which became a major resettlement site during the 1980's  and 1990's, is home to one of the largest Cambodian communities in the  United States. This exhibit reflects the significance of the city as  both a destination and a foundation for Cambodian American life.

Key contributors include Sophy Reese, President of UCAN and project  manager; collaborating organizations such as the Khmer Language Arts  and Culture Academy and A Khmer Buddhist Foundation; and survivors and  descendants who provided firsthand accounts and materials for display.  The Haggin Museum provided exhibition space, curatorial support, and  logistical coordination for the project.

This exhibit is the fourth in a continuing series of Cambodian  cultural exhibits presented in partnership with the Haggin Museum. It  serves both as a remembrance of a difficult history and a testament to  cultural preservation, community strength, and intergenerational  resilience.

I commend the individuals and organizations whose efforts have  resulted in this important public exhibit and recognize its role in  fostering historical understanding and cultural appreciation.
