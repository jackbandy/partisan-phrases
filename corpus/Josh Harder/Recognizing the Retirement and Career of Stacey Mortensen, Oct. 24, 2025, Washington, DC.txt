Mr. HARDER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my  colleague, Congressman Mark DeSaulnier, to recognize and celebrate the  retirement and career of Stacey Mortensen, whose visionary leadership  has transformed public transportation across the Central Valley and  Northern California.

For more than three decades, Stacey has championed investments in  passenger rail that have connected communities, expanded opportunity,  and laid the groundwork for a more sustainable future. As Executive  Director of the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission, she led the  launch of the Altamont Corridor Express--ACE--in 1998, uniting San  Joaquin, Alameda, and Santa Clara Counties through a first-of-its-kind  commuter rail partnership. This complex initiative required building  infrastructure and relationships across three different regions, a  challenge Stacey met with innovation and unwavering determination.  Through her work, Stacey helped establish the San Joaquin Joint Powers  Authority and spearheaded the Valley Rail Program, securing nearly $2  billion in funding and enabling major infrastructure projects such as  the Stockton Diamond Grade Separation.

Under her leadership, ACE has continued to evolve to meet modern  needs, including the recent launch of a specialty train service to  Levi's Stadium for San Francisco 49ers games--an example of the  flexible, community-responsive transit vision she has cultivated. Her  efforts brought together more than 20 local and regional agencies to  develop a shared vision for passenger rail in the Central Valley.

In 2024, Stacey helped launch the Rail Academy of Central California  (TRACC), a critical workforce development program that prepares young  people for careers in the rail industry. Her deep commitment to the  next generation is reflected in this initiative, which ensures the  continued success and sustainability of our region's transit systems by  investing in talent right here in the Valley. What truly sets Stacey  apart is her deep belief in partnership and public service. Her  collaborative approach has not only built rail lines--  it has built trust across counties, cities, and communities. Thanks to  her leadership, thousands of Central Valley residents now have better  access to jobs, education, and opportunity.

I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Stacey Mortensen for her  extraordinary contributions and for her steadfast commitment to the  people of California's Central Valley.
