Recognizing Sovanna Koeurt


Mr. HARDER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Sovanna Koeurt for her decades of service to the Southeast Asian  community in Stockton and the broader San Joaquin Valley.

Ms. Koeurt arrived in Stockton in the early l980's as a refugee from  Cambodia following the Khmer Rouge regime. Like many others in her  community, she faced significant challenges resettling in a new country  after surviving violence and displacement. In the years that followed,  she channeled those experiences into building stronger, safer  communities.

In 1989, following the tragic shooting at Cleveland Elementary School  in Stockton, Ms. Koeurt joined with 34 Southeast Asian refugee families  at Park Village Apartments to co-found the Asian Pacific Self- Development and Residential Association, or APSARA. The organization  was founded on the belief that communities must come together to  advocate for safer, more equitable living conditions.

Under Ms. Koeurt's leadership, APSARA purchased the Park Village  complex from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for  one dollar in 1993--a landmark act of community ownership and self- determination. Since then, APSARA has grown into a trusted community  institution offering affordable housing, youth development, health  access, workforce support, and immigrant advocacy.

For more than 30 years, Ms. Koeurt has served as Executive Director  of APSARA. Her work has helped ensure that hundreds of families have  access not only to housing, but to the tools and resources needed to  succeed.

In a 2024 interview, she said, ``I've been here. I love this place  because they give a lot of opportunity to everyone.'' Her comments  reflect a clear commitment to making Stockton a place where all  residents--regardless of background--have the chance to thrive.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Sovanna  Koeurt for her leadership and dedication. Her decades of service have  had a lasting impact on Stockton's Southeast Asian community and helped  create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all residents.
