Standing Up for Americans

Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I spent the weekend listening to my  constituents, and it damn near broke me.

I heard from seniors worried about Musk's attacks on Social Security  and Medicaid, small businesses confronting bankruptcy from Trump's  tariffs, and parents seeing their college and retirement savings wiped  out.

I met with teachers worried about students who don't have the  resources to weather the hardships so casually inflicted by this White  House.

I heard from Federal employees who lost their jobs but were more  concerned about the veterans and seniors and kids with disabilities  they could no  longer serve. I met with medical researchers whose work fighting cancer  and pandemics had been abandoned by this White House.

I heard from veterans stunned that they had been fired for no reason  and volunteer firefighters who had lost FEMA funding. I heard from a  dry cleaner terrified that her family would be deported, even though  they have no criminal records and are legally in this country.

I also heard from mental health specialists fighting opioid and  fentanyl addiction, whose funding was canceled.

My question for House Republicans is: What does it take to get them  to stand up for Americans?
