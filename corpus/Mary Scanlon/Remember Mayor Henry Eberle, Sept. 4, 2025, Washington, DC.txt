Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, Henry Eberle, better known as ``Mayor  Hank,'' served as the mayor of Ridley Park for 28 years before his  death last month at the age of 91.

From student council president at Sharon Hill High to a standout  athlete at Franklin & Marshall College where he was inducted in the  hall of fame, Hank was a born leader.

Hank raised a family in ``Delco,'' where he became an executive at  Sun Company and was active with his church and local civic groups.

In retirement, he visited every national park in the continental U.S.  during dozens of cross-country road trips. Hank will long be remembered  as a quintessential small-town mayor. As mayor of Ridley Park, he  showed up at every community event, emceeing the Fourth of July parade  in his trademark top hat and striped socks, greeting neighbors at the  farmers market and Victorian Fair, and officiating at over 100  weddings.

He was a tireless advocate for revitalization of Ridley Park's  business district and rebuilding the Sellers Avenue bridge.

Mayor Hank's humor, humility, and purpose will be deeply missed  across our community.
