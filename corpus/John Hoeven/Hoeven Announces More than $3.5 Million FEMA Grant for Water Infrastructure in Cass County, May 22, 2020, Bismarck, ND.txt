Hoeven Announces More than $3.5 Million FEMA Grant for Water Infrastructure in Cass County


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded a $3,564,967 grant to the State of North Dakota to serve the City of Fargo, City of West Fargo and surrounding rural Cass County. Today's funding will support the ND Resilient Infrastructure Project to protect drinking water sources serving these areas, including water from the Red River as other water sources are not able to fully support the region. This grant will also support relocating electrical equipment behind a new short section of floodwall.

"This FEMA grant will help fund important improvements and construction to ensure safe, reliable water for homes and businesses in the area," said Hoeven.
