Hoeven: EPA Proposes Reforms to Provide Transparency, Certainty when Issuing New Regulations


Senator John Hoeven issued the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed reforming its cost-benefit analysis for new regulations issued under the Clean Air Act to provide more transparency and certainty. The agency is seeking to develop future analyses in a consistent manner that includes all relevant information, helping to ensure the agency's actions are justified and supported by the latest in economic, engineering, biological and physical sciences.

"Federal regulations often impose significant compliance costs, in terms of time and money, which is why we've worked to streamline federal rules and provide relief from unnecessary and burdensome regulations," said Hoeven. "It makes sense to ensure that the benefits of the administration's actions outweigh the costs, and to do so in a consistent and transparent manner. We welcome the EPA's effort to do just that, and we encourage North Dakotans from across sectors, including agriculture, energy and construction, to give their input on this proposal."
