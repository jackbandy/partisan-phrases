Hoeven Statement in Honor of Armed Forces Day


Senator John Hoeven today released the following statement in observance of Armed Forces Day to thank all men and women currently serving in the United States' armed forces, both at home and abroad. 

"Members of the U.S. military have willingly answered the call to serve their country and we can never thank them enough," said Hoeven. "While we set aside this day to express our gratitude, we know the freedom and liberties we enjoy would not be possible if it weren't for their courage and bravery expressed every day. To the heroes currently serving in a branch of our armed forces and their families, thank you for your continued support and sacrifices on behalf of our great nation."
