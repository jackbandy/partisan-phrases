Hoeven Statement on U.S. Ending Support for The World Health Organization


Senator John Hoeven today issued the following statement after President Trump announced that the U.S. would end its support for the World Health Organization (WHO):

"China has not been transparent and the WHO has not held China responsible for its actions. The President's action today is about holding China and the WHO accountable," said Hoeven. "We need transparency and accountability, which is why I support the Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee oversight of the WHO's response to the pandemic, so we do all we can to prevent future pandemics."
