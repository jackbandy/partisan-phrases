Hoeven Announces $2.6 Million DOT Grant to Fund Transportation Research at NDSU


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Committee, today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded $2,632,700 to the Upper Great Plains Transportation Institute at North Dakota State University (NDSU). Today's funding includes the fifth and final round made available under DOT's University Transportation Centers (UTC) program included in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act and will be used by the Mountains-Plains Consortium (MPC) program. The MPC program, led by NDSU, advances transportation research and works to develop new professionals in the transportation field and includes Colorado State University, South Dakota State University, University of Colorado Denver, University of Denver, University of Utah, University of Wyoming and Utah State University.

"Today's funding allows NDSU to continue leading the way for eight regional universities as they advance transportation research and solutions," said Hoeven. "It's vital we invest in our transportation infrastructure in a smart, innovative way and this program supports that."
