Hoeven Statement on Executive Order to Provide Regulatory Relief, Help Jumpstart the Economy


Senator John Hoeven today issued the following statement after President Trump signed an executive order to provide regulatory relief that will help jumpstart the economy as the nation addresses the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and continues to re-open. Hoeven recently joined a group of his Senate colleagues in calling on Senate leadership to include regulatory relief as part of the next COVID-19 legislative response.

"Regulatory relief has been a top priority throughout my time in the Senate, helping to reduce unnecessary burdens and costs, and it makes sense to include this as part of the COVID-19 response," said Hoeven. "I look forward to working with the administration to advance relief that will get all sectors of our economy moving and growing again, including for our agriculture and energy producers, who have faced unprecedented challenges in recent times, beyond the current public health emergency."

The president's executive order directs agencies to:
