Hoeven Announces Funding for Clean Water Project


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has awarded $7,780,000 to the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. This grant is provided under the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which Hoeven continues to prioritize in the annual appropriations process and will be used to support infrastructure projects in the state regarding wastewater treatment and pollution control.  

"As we work to maintain access to clean water, these funds for improvements to our state's water infrastructure will provide important protection to public health," said Hoeven.
