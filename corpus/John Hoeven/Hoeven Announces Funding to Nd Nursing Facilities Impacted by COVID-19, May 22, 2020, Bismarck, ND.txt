Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has awarded $16,342,500 to 59 skilled nursing facilities in North Dakota. This funding, made available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, will be used to support continued efforts to combat the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, helping address increased operating expenses and lost revenue.

"Nursing homes provide important care and services to seniors in North Dakota," said Hoeven. "This funding announced by HHS today will help provide much needed relief and support these facilities' continued efforts to keep their residents and staff safe through the pandemic."
