Hoeven Presses Saudi Ambassador To Pull Back On Oil Price War With Russia


Senator John Hoeven today pressed Princess Reema Bandar Al Saud, the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the U.S., to help pull back on Saudi's oil price war with Russia. The senator stressed the ongoing economic impacts of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the need to provide stability to global markets. Hoeven emphasized that Saudi Arabia needs to work with the United States and the community of nations on this as the world battles the COVID-19 pandemic. The call builds on Hoeven's efforts to help maintain America's domestic energy industry during current market challenges. This includes:

Urging President Trump during a recent meeting to press the Saudi leadership on this matter.Joining his Senate colleagues in calling on the Saudi Crown Prince to cease the price war."Domestic energy production is critical to our national security, provides good jobs and contributes directly to our citizens' quality of life," Hoeven said. "We need stability in the oil markets during these challenges with COVID-19 to ensure we don't lose long-term capacity in this essential industry. That's why we've been pressing to end Saudi's price war with Russia, including in today's call with the Saudi Ambassador as well as conversations I've had with the president and our letter to the Saudi Crown Prince. We will continue to press our ally on this matter, while also working on a stimulus package to help counter the widespread impact of coronavirus on our economy."
