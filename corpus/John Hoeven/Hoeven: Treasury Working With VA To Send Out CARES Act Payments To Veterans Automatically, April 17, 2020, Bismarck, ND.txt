Hoeven: Treasury Working With VA To Send Out CARES Act Payments To Veterans Automatically


Senator John Hoeven today issued the following statement after the U.S. Treasury announced that it would work with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure veterans receive their recovery rebate checks provided under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Veterans and their beneficiaries who receive Compensation and Pension benefits will receive the payments automatically without additional paperwork required. The CARES Act provides payments of up to $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for married couples and an additional $500 per child. The payments begin phasing out for individuals and couples with incomes of $75,000 and $150,000, respectively.

Hoeven, along with Senator Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), recently led a bipartisan group of senators in urging Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and VA Secretary Robert Wilkie to issue the payments as quickly as possible, noting the VA's ability to identify eligible veterans through its disability and pension programs. The full text of the senators' letter can be found here.

"Veterans deserve our support and are facing the challenges of COVID-19 right along with the rest of our nation," said Hoeven. "As many veterans are not required to file taxes, they would've faced added barriers in receiving their checks. We appreciate Treasury for heeding our call to work with the VA on getting these payments to veterans in a timely and efficient way."

In addition to Hoeven and Hassan, the letter sent to the Treasury and the VA was signed by Senators Jim Risch, Michael Bennet, Mike Crapo, Jeanne Shaheen, Steve Daines, Doug Jones, John Cornyn, Jon Tester, John Boozman, Cory Booker, James Lankford, Kyrsten Sinema and Chris Coons.
