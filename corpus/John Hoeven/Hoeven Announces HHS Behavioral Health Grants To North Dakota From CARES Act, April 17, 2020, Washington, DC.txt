Hoeven Announces HHS Behavioral Health Grants To North Dakota From CARES Act


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded funding to two groups in North Dakota. Today's funding was made available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The North Dakota State Department of Human Services has received $2 million for crisis intervention services and mental health and substance use disorder treatment. This funding will support recovery efforts related to children and adults impacted by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). HHS has also awarded $500,000 to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe for addressing mental health and substance use disorders related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

"It's vital the current pandemic does not contribute to the number of individuals struggling with behavioral health issues," said Hoeven. "Today's funds will provide important resources across our state that will allow children and adults to seek proper treatment as we all continue to get through the coronavirus pandemic together."
