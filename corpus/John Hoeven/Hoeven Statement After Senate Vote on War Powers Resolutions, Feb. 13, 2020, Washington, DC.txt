Hoeven Statement After Senate Vote on War Powers Resolutions


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee, today released the following statement after the U.S. Senate vote on the Iran War Powers resolution: 

 "I do not support this resolution because I think it undermines our nation's maximum pressure campaign on Iran, including diplomatic, economic and military pressure. I believe it sends the wrong message to Iranian leaders that the U.S. is relieving, rather than increasing, pressure on the regime, particularly in the context of widespread anti-government protests in Iran."
