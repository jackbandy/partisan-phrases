North Dakota to Receive $52 Million for COVID-19 Testing


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded $52,621,819 to the North Dakota Department of Health for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing. This funding will be used to support statewide testing efforts and was made available through the most recent legislation passed by Congress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

"Today's funding will support North Dakota's efforts in meeting its testing goals," said Hoeven. "Testing plays a critical role in helping to safely reopen our economy and continue our efforts to combat and recover from the COVID-19 public health emergency."
