Hoeven: $1.25 Billion in Federal Assistance Can Be Used For Unemployment Insurance Fund


Senator John Hoeven today announced that the State of North Dakota will be able to utilize the Coronavirus Relief Fund to relieve pressure on the state's unemployment insurance program. The senator, at the request of Governor Doug Burgum, has been working with the Administration to ensure that the State is able to utilize the $1.25 billion it will receive from the Coronavirus Relief Fund to help offset the rise in unemployment insurance costs.

Hoeven raised the issue directly with President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in recent phone calls. Additionally, the senator outlined the need to help provide relief for the state's unemployment program with Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia during a conference call last week with North Dakota business leaders.

"We've been working with the Administration to ensure that Governor Burgum is able to use funds from the Coronavirus Relief Fund to meet our state's specific needs," said Hoeven. "This flexibility will enable the state to bolster its unemployment insurance program and help prevent dramatic increases in unemployment insurance costs for employers. The last thing our businesses need as they reopen is to be hit with big increases in unemployment costs."

As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Congress provided $150 billion for the Coronavirus Relief Fund, from which each state will receive at least $1.25 billion to support state pandemic response. Under guidance issued by the Treasury Department last night, states will be able to utilize this fund for expenses including unemployment insurance costs related to the COVID-19 public health emergency.
