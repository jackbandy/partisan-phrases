Hoeven Announces Funding for Water Infrastructure Improvements in Hettinger


Senator John Hoeven, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee, today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development has awarded a $228,000 loan and a $185,650 grant to the City of Hettinger. Today's funding will be used to repair a lagoon cell to allow treated water to be retained and used for irrigation as well as reduce future costs for maintenance and required hours to complete the treatment process. 

"This funding will permit Hettinger to make important improvements to their water infrastructure by replacing outdated equipment to continue serving the city," said Hoeven.
