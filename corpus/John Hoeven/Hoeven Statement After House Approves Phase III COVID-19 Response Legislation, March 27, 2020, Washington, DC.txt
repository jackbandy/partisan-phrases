Senator John Hoeven issued the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives approved the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The Senate approved the legislation Wednesday, so the legislation will now go to the President to be signed into law.

"This Phase III legislation will help us battle both the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic," said Hoeven.

The CARES Act will help provide much needed support for the American people so that we can beat the coronavirus."
