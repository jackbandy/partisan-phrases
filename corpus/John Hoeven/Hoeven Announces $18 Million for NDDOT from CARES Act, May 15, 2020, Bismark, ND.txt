Hoeven Announces $18 Million for NDDOT from CARES Act


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Committee, today announced that the North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT) will receive $18 million from the Federal Transit Administration. The funds were made available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act and will be used for operations and preventative maintenance regarding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to benefit rural and intercity bus operators. NDDOT is receiving the funds after successfully completing its application for the grant, which was first announced in April. 

"These funds will offer support to public transportation across the state as preventative measures are carried out to protect drivers and passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic," said Hoeven.
