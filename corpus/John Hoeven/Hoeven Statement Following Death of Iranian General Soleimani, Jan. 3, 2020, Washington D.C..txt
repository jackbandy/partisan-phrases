Hoeven Statement Following Death of Iranian General Soleimani


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee, released the following statement after the death of Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force General Qasem Soleimani:

"As the leader of the Quds Forces, General Soleimani was a terrorist responsible for the deaths of many Americans, and was planning additional attacks on U.S. interests. Our brave U.S. servicemembers and intelligence officials have once again brought a terrorist to justice. Iran's terrorist activities and its nuclear program are unacceptable, and the U.S. will continue to defend its interests and its people."
