Hoeven Statement on U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Agreement Going Into Effect on July 1


Senator John Hoeven, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee and a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today issued the following statement after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer notified Congress that the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will go into effect on July 1, as each of the three nations have taken the proper steps to implement and comply with the agreement. Hoeven previously joined President Trump as he signed USMCA into law in January, following the senator's efforts to move the agreement through Congress, having repeatedly made the case for USMCA and outlining its benefits to the American people.

"We appreciate the efforts of our allies and closest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, to comply with USMCA and enable it to go into effect," said Hoeven. "USMCA will benefit a wide variety of industries, including our energy and agriculture producers, bringing a needed economic boost at a particularly challenging time."

According to the International Trade Commission, once fully implemented, USMCA will increase U.S. agricultural and food exports to Canada and Mexico. The senator worked to ensure that USMCA benefits North Dakota producers, including eliminating Canada's automatic downgrade of imported U.S. wheat to feed grade, which will help ensure that grading standards and services are non-discriminatory.

Additionally, USMCA makes needed modernizations on intellectual property, digital trade and financial services.
