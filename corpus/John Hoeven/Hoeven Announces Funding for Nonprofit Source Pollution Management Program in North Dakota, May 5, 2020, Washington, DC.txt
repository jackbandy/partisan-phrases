Hoeven Announces Funding for Nonprofit Source Pollution Management Program in North Dakota


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has awarded $3,960,000 to the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality for the Nonpoint Source Management Program. Today's funds are made available under the Clean Water Act and will be used to promote a voluntary pollution control program across the state, primarily related to agricultural land.

"Today's funds will support our state's efforts in protecting our water supply and help landowners reduce or prevent pollution from nonpoint sources," said Hoeven.
