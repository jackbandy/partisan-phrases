Hoeven Statement on President Signing Additional CARES Act Funding Into Law


Senator John Hoeven issued the following statement after President Trump signed into law legislation providing additional funding for small businesses, health care providers, hospitals and COVID-19 testing. As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee, Hoeven worked to include a provision to ensure that farmers and ranchers are eligible for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and Emergency EIDL Grants.

"This supplemental funding agreement is key to ensuring small businesses can access needed assistance through the programs established by the CARES Act, while also supporting the critical work of our nation's health care providers," said Hoeven. "This is welcome relief, including for our agriculture and energy producers, who are facing challenges above and beyond COVID-19. That's why we worked to ensure farmers and ranchers can benefit from the EIDL program, and we will continue our efforts to provide stability for our oil and gas industry, which is key to our national and economic security."
