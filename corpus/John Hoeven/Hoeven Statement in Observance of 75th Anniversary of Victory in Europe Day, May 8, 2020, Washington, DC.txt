Hoeven Statement in Observance of 75th Anniversary of Victory in Europe Day


Senator John Hoeven today issued the following statement in observance of the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, which marked the end of World War II. 

"Today, and always, we remember the incredible sacrifices our servicemembers and country endured during World War II to preserve our freedom and liberties," said Hoeven. "We can never repay the debt we owe our selfless and heroic WWII veterans but today on the 75th anniversary of V-E Day, we pay tribute to our Greatest Generation and celebrate the end of World War II in Europe. Our nation is eternally grateful the Allied Powers were victorious."

Last summer, Hoeven joined a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Normandy to honor U.S. veterans on the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of World War II.
