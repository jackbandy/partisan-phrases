Hoeven Statement on FISA Reforms


Senator John Hoeven released the following statement after the U.S. Senate approved legislation to reform and reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

"This bipartisan legislation makes important changes that will increase transparency in the FISA process, ensure greater accountability and help prevent government overreach," said Hoeven. "At the same time, given the security challenges facing our nation, it provides important national security tools to prevent and protect against espionage and terrorist threats."
