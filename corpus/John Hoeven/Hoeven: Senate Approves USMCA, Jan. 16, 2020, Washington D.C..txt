Hoeven: Senate Approves USMCA, Benefitting North Dakota Ag Producers & Wide Range of Industries


Senator John Hoeven today joined a bipartisan majority of his Senate colleagues in approving the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

"The final approval of USMCA is tremendous news for our nation's entire economy, especially for our agriculture producers, who are working to overcome the challenges of trade disputes and disasters," said Hoeven. "This agreement provides farmers and ranchers much-needed certainty with our two largest trading partners, helping to remove barriers and better ensure they receive fair treatment. That's why we worked promptly in the Senate to move USMCA forward, following a more than year-long delay by the House. I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues, who joined me in passing the agreement out of committee earlier this week and helped secure its timely approval in the full Senate."

According to the International Trade Commission, USMCA will increase U.S. agricultural and food exports to Canada and Mexico when fully implemented. The senator worked to ensure that the USMCA benefits North Dakota producers, including eliminating Canada's automatic downgrade of imported U.S. wheat to feed grade, which will help ensure that grading standards and services are non-discriminatory.

Additionally, USMCA makes needed modernizations on intellectual property, digital trade and financial services.
