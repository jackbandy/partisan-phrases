Hoeven Statement in Commemoration of Peace Officers Memorial Day


Senator John Hoeven today released the following statement on Peace Officers Memorial Day and during National Police Week to commemorate the sacrifices made by fallen heroes and honor the men and women of the law enforcement community. Hoeven this week cosponsored a bipartisan resolution which passed the Senate to honor law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in 2019 and designate May 10-16 as National Police Week.

"Law enforcement officers are dedicated to their communities and committed to serving their fellow citizens," said Hoeven. "We honor National Police Week to express strong support for the vital role men and women in uniform play and to thank these officers and their families for the personal burdens and risks they take on to keep us safe every single day. We extend our sympathies on Peace Officers Memorial Day to the families of those lost in the line of duty, and commemorate the sacrifices made by continuing our efforts to ensure their names and honorable service will never be forgotten."

Since 1962, Peace Officers Memorial Day has been observed every May 15th. The week in which that day falls has been designated as National Police Week.
