Hoeven Statement Following President's Remarks on Iran


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee, released the following statement after the President's address regarding Iran:

"Our men and women in uniform are the best in the world, and we are grateful that there were no casualties following Iran's attacks last night in Iraq. Today, the President made clear that while the U.S. does not seek an escalation, we will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon and will not stand by in the face of continued Iranian aggression. We need to continue the maximum pressure campaign, including the additional sanctions the president outlined today, to stop Iran's terrorist activities and deter their aggressive actions."
