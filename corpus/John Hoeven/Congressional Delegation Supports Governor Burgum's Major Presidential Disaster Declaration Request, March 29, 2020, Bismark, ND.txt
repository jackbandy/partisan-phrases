Congressional Delegation Supports Governor Burgum's Major Presidential Disaster Declaration Request


U.S. Senators John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer and Representative Kelly Armstrong issued the following statement in support of Governor Doug Burgum requesting a major presidential disaster declaration to unlock federal assistance for North Dakota's response to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic:

"We support Governor Burgum's request and urge President Trump to approve it quickly. A major presidential disaster declaration would allow the state to receive much-needed federal assistance as it responds to the pandemic. Our Governor is doing an excellent job responding to COVID-19, and this declaration would give him more resources while building on the unprecedented support Congress has authorized. We appreciate President Trump's strong leadership and tireless work during this pandemic, and we trust he will provide North Dakota with the resources it needs to keep our constituents healthy and safe."
