Hoeven Statement on Administration's Middle East Peace Plan


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee, today issued the following statement after the administration released its plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

"The plan announced by the president today helps advance the cause of peace, while maintaining strong support for a critical ally, Israel. At the same time, it helps lay the groundwork for self-governance and greater prosperity for the Palestinian people. While there is still much work to do, including good-faith negotiations from Palestinian leaders and ending terrorism, we welcome this important step forward."

The administration's plan has the support of both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition leader Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz. The plan outlines borders for a two-state solution, with the aim to achieve mutual recognition for Israel and the future Palestinian State. Specifically, the plan would:

Continue the administration's policy of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital city, while providing the opportunity for a future Palestinian State to declare its capital within East Jerusalem.Make a new Palestinian state contingent upon Palestinians ending terrorism and enacting political reforms, with the new state being demilitarized at first and assuming more security responsibilities over time.Double the amount of land under Palestinian control, while halting Israel's construction of settlements for four years, provided that Israel's sovereignty over existing West Bank settlement blocs be recognized.Ensure that no Israelis or Palestinians are uprooted from their homes and provide a trust for Palestinian refugees to move to the new state, remain in the country where they currently reside or resettle in a third country.Incorporate a $50 billion international investment plan to bolster the Palestinian economy.
