Hoeven Announces $135 Million in CARES Act Funding for North Dakota Hospitals & Providers


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has awarded $135,152,313 to 59 hospitals and health care providers in North Dakota. This funding was made available through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act and will be used to assist hospitals and providers in rural areas that have been impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 

"This funding will assist hospitals and providers in rural areas that have been impacted by COVID-19," said Hoeven. "We secured these funds in the CARES Act to help support those across the state who have been on the front lines battling this pandemic. We continue to urge HHS to ensure that the needs of rural providers as well as providers who predominantly serve Medicaid patients are met as we look forward to the disbursement of the remaining CARES Act funds, as well as the additional HHS funds we recently appropriated." 

Today's funding is the latest disbursement from the CARES Act's Provider Relief Fund, and comes as part of a $10 billion Rural Provider Allocation established by the HHS. This is the third round of funding made available using the initial $100 billion in funding provided by Congress under the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund. Earlier this week, Hoeven announced funding for health care providers serving significant Medicare populations. On April 10, the senator announced the first tranche of hospital and provider funds. Congress has approved an additional $75 billion to support health care providers and hospitals, which has yet to be disbursed.
