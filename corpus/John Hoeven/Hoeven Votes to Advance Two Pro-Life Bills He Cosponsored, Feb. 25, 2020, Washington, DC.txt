Hoeven Votes to Advance Two Pro-Life Bills He Cosponsored


Senator John Hoeven today voted to advance two pieces of legislation that he cosponsored to protect both the unborn at 20 weeks of development and infants who survive an attempted abortion. The bills, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Act and the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, received bipartisan support and were supported by more than half of the Senate, but neither met the 60-vote threshold required to proceed to consideration by the full Senate.

"These are common sense bills that seek to protect unborn children who can feel pain and infants who survive attempted abortions, while providing legal protections for mothers," said Hoeven. "The 20 week limit on abortion matches the standards set by most nations around the world and aligns with the law in North Dakota, and it is only reasonable to expect that doctors will give appropriate care to infants born alive. It is unfortunate that not enough of our colleagues in the Senate voted to advance consideration of these bills."
