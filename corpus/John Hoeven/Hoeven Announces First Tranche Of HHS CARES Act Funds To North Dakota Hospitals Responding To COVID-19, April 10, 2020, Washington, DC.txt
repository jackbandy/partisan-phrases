Hoeven Announces First Tranche Of HHS CARES Act Funds To North Dakota Hospitals Responding To COVID-19


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has awarded the first tranche of HHS funds under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act to 841 providers and health care systems in North Dakota.  Today's funds, totaling $91,064,579, will be used to support health care-related expenses including lost revenue attributable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and will help ensure individuals have the opportunity to receive testing and treatment as needed.

"As our health care providers and systems continue responding to COVID-19, these funds we secured in the CARES Act will help support their efforts," said Hoeven. "At the same time, we continue to push for additional funds to be released as soon as possible to further support our medical professionals on the front-lines of this pandemic, including those serving rural areas."

The next tranche of HHS funding for hospitals and providers is expected to be disbursed in the coming weeks with a primary focus on rural providers and hospitals serving significant Medicaid populations. Hoeven recently joined Senator John Barrasso in sending a letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding the need to ensure that the funds from the CARES Act are distributed quickly and assist rural providers.
