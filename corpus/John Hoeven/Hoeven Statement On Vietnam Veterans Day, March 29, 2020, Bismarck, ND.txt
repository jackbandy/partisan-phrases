Hoeven Statement On Vietnam Veterans Day


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, today issued the following statement in recognition of Vietnam Veterans Day. 

"Our freedoms have been secured by the sweat and sacrifice of the courageous men and women who have fought to protect our nation and way of life," said Hoeven. "Today, we honor the service of our Vietnam Veterans and express our gratitude to them for answering the call to serve. While we pay tribute on Vietnam Veterans Day, we seek to honor them every day by ensuring they receive the support and benefits they have earned."

Hoeven has been working to support veterans in North Dakota and around the nation, by:

Strengthening the VA's ability to provide care for veterans and give veterans more options to seek care in their home communities.Enabling more long-term care (LTC) providers to accept veteran patients.Securing an expansion of the VA's hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) clinical demonstration program to include the Fargo VA, the fifth such location in the nation, making access to this alternative treatment option for PTSD available to veterans who have not experienced positive outcomes from traditional treatments.
