Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has awarded $304,400 to the North Dakota Department of Agriculture. This funding through the Performance Partnership Grant (PPG) will provide the state with additional resources to address environmental priorities and help strengthen the partnership between the EPA and North Dakota.
