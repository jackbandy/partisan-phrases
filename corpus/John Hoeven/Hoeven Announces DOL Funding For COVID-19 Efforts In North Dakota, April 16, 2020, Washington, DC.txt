Hoeven Announces DOL Funding For COVID-19 Efforts In North Dakota


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor has awarded $509,615 to Job Service North Dakota. Today's funding comes from the Dislocated Worker Grant (DWG) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act and will help create temporary jobs for individuals currently dislocated from work due to the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Such jobs may include assisting with prevention and response efforts related to the pandemic and humanitarian efforts in impacted areas.

"Today's grant will help eligible employees support our prevention and response efforts in North Dakota as we continue combatting COVID-19," said Hoeven. "We appreciate Secretary Scalia for supporting our work force and selecting North Dakota as one of 24 states and territories to receive these funds."
