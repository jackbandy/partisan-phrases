Hoeven Announces Partial Second Tranche of HHS CARES Act Funds to North Dakota Hospitals & Providers


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has awarded a portion of the second tranche of HHS funds under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. As part of the initial distribution of the second tranche of funding, $14,108,992 will go to 40 providers in North Dakota, and will be used to provide support to health care providers and hospitals serving significant Medicare populations, with additional funds expected. Hoeven previously announced the first tranche of HHS payments to be distributed to hospitals and providers. HHS plans to soon distribute as part of the second tranche of the CARES Act's $100 billion Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, $10 billion to rural hospitals and $10 billion to hospitals providing care in areas that have experienced a high number of COVID-19 cases.

"These funds we secured in the CARES Act will help provide additional economic relief to health care providers and hospitals in North Dakota that are on the front lines and have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to work with HHS to urge them to ensure the remaining funds provided under the CARES Act, as well as the additional $75 billion for providers and hospitals Congress passed last week, are distributed in a timely manner and will assist providers in rural areas as well as providers that serve a high number of Medicaid patients," said Hoeven.
