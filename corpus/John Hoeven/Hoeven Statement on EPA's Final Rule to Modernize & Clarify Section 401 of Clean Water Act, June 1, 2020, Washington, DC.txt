Hoeven Statement on EPA's Final Rule to Modernize & Clarify Section 401 of Clean Water Act


Senator John Hoeven issued the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a final rule to modernize and clarify the existing requirements for water quality certifications under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. This action comes as a result of the President's Executive Order 13868 "Promoting Energy Infrastructure and Economic Growth," which was issued on April 10, 2019.

"We've worked hard to advance regulatory relief to strengthen our nation's economy, including for the development of critical energy infrastructure," said Hoeven. "It's important that states and the federal government work together to ensure we can safely and efficiently deliver the U.S. produced energy needed to power homes and businesses. We appreciate the administration's action today to bring certainty to the infrastructure permitting process while preserving environmental stewardship, as we continue our efforts to protect America's energy and economic security."
