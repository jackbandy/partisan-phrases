Hoeven Announces CDC COVID-19 Funding From CARES Act


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is awarding $5,075,000 to the State of North Dakota. This funding comes from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act and will support the state in efforts to reopen including enhancing testing capacity, conducting contact tracing and working with health care systems to manage and monitor system capacity. This comes in addition to $4,567,500 previously awarded to the state under the Phase I coronavirus legislation passed in March.

"As we continue responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and begin taking vital steps to safely reopen the state, today's funds will support important practices to ensure we're doing what we can to protect our citizens," said Hoeven.
