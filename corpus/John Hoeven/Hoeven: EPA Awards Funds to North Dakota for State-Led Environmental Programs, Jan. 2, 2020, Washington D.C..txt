Hoeven: EPA Awards Funds to North Dakota for State-Led Environmental Programs


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has awarded $473,998 to the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality (NDDEQ) through the Performance Partnership Grant (PPG). Today's funds support implementing programs that help ensure clean air and water and manage hazardous and solid waste, drinking water, underground storage tanks, underground injection control and radon. 

"PPG funds allow states to manage and make environmental improvements at a local level," said Hoeven. "This allows our state greater flexibility to address environmental priorities."
