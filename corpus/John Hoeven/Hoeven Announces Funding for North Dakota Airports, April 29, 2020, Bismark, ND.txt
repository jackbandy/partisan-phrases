Hoeven Announces Funding for North Dakota Airports


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Committee, today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded funding to airports in North Dakota. Today's awards come from the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) with an additional match granted from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act intended to eliminate local shares and allow airports to continue projects regardless of current financial circumstances. Details of the funds are as follows: 

-Williston Basin International Airport (XWA) has been awarded $9,493,453 with a $1,054,828 match from the CARES Act to construct a second, crosswind runway, and to install the necessary guidance systems for the new runway at the airport.-Dickinson Theodore Roosevelt Regional Airport (DIK) has been awarded $4,850,000 with a $538,889 match from the CARES Act to be used for runway extension at the airport. Last fall, the congressional delegation wrote a letter to Secretary Chao in support of funding for this project. -Jamestown Regional Airport has been awarded $1,531,989 with a $170,221 match from the CARES Act to acquire aircraft rescue and firefighting safety equipment as well as reconstruct the apron and rehabilitate the runway and taxiway. -Garrison Municipal Airport has been awarded $1,088,000 with a $120,889 match from the CARES Act to construct an access road, taxilane and taxiway as well as improve the parking lot and reconstruct perimeter fencing. -Casselton Robert Miller Regional Airport has been awarded $451,121 with a $50,125 match from the CARES Act for the rehabilitation access road. -Robertson Field Airport has been awarded $300,000 with a $33,333 match from the CARES Act to acquire snow removal equipment.-Devils Lake Regional Airport has been awarded $95,000 with a $10,556 match from the CARES Act to reconstruct the apron, taxilane and taxiway. -Bottineau Municipal Airport has been awarded $60,000 with a $6,667 match from the CARES Act to conduct and update their miscellaneous study.

"As North Dakota has seen an increase in population over the last decade, airports across the state have provided vital services, assisting with the movement of people and goods," said Hoeven. "This funding will allow airports to continue critical projects to improve and update their capabilities."
