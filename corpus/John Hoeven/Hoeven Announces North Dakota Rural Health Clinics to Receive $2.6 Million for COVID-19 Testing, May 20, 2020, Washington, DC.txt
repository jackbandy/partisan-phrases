Hoeven Announces North Dakota Rural Health Clinics to Receive $2.6 Million for COVID-19 Testing


Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), has awarded $2,621,455 to 53 Rural Health Clinics (RHC) in North Dakota. This funding was made available under the most recent legislation passed by Congress in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and will be used to support COVID-19 testing efforts and expand access to testing in rural communities.

"Rural Health Clinics play a vital role providing health care to individuals and families across North Dakota," said Hoeven. "These funds will help provide important resources for these clinics to further testing efforts as the state continues to safely reopen the economy."
