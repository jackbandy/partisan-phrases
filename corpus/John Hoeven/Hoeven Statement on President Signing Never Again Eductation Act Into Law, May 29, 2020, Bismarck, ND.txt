Hoeven Statement on President Signing Never Again Eductation Act Into Law


Senator John Hoeven today issued the following statement after President Trump signed the Never Again Education Act into law. Hoeven cosponsored the Senate companion to the bill, which authorizes funding to develop and improve Holocaust education programs, and he supported Senate passage of the House bill earlier this month.

"The Holocaust is one of the greatest tragedies of the modern era, and this legislation provides federal resources to ensure we never forget the circumstances of this horror and the lessons we can learn from it. We welcome the president signing the bill into law," said Hoeven.
