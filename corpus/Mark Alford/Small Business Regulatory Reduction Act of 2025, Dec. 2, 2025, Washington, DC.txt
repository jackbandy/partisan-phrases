Mr. ALFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank our chair for his leadership and the  ranking member for her leadership, as well.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2965, the Small  Business Regulatory Reduction Act of 2025.

For 4 long years under the previous administration, America's small  businesses, the backbone of our economy and the heart of Missouri's  Fourth Congressional District, have been smothered by an onslaught of  overreaching Federal regulations that have made goods less affordable  in the United States of America.

Under the Biden-Harris administration, small businesses were hit with  an unprecedented $1.8 trillion--not billion--$1.8 trillion in new  regulatory costs while inflation soared over 20 percent.

Where do you think that cost goes, Mr. Speaker? It goes to the  consumer. Main Street cannot thrive under that kind of bureaucratic  chokehold. Americans are demanding affordability, and this is a good  step in that direction.

This bill, championed by my colleague Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne,  finally puts a stop to it. H.R. 2965 requires the Small Business  Administration to report on the regulatory costs imposed by other  Federal agencies on small businesses.

It is transparency. It is all about transparency. It is going to show  the American people exactly where the Democrat blue tape is strangling  growth in America.

This legislation supports President Trump's regulatory rightsizing  agenda and gives our job creators the relief they desperately need to  start, to grow, and to succeed once again.

Mr. Speaker, do you want to make things more affordable in America?  Do you want to cut down on overregulation? This is the bill to do it.  Let's all stand with America and our small businesses and our  entrepreneurs, our family-owned businesses, and support H.R. 2965.
