Mr. ALFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize our July Veteran  of the Month, Edward Eugene Holmes. He was a proud Missourian and a  resident of the Missouri Veterans Home, and I got a chance to meet him  this past winter.

He just left this Earth last month at the age of 99, and we want to  take the time to honor his life and legacy today.

Edward was born on April 7, 1926. He joined the U.S. Navy in June of  1944,  just weeks after graduating from high school. He served as a gunner's  mate in the Pacific during World War II and was later assigned to the  USS Ault, part of the Seahorse Squadron, in preparation for the  invasion of Japan.

After the war ended, Edward remained on duty during the occupation  until January of 1946. During his service, he traveled the world from  Australia to Africa to Japan and back home through the Panama Canal.

He was honorably discharged with the rank of Seaman 1st class.

After the Navy, Edward built a long and successful career in the  floral industry and was known for his love of fishing, golfing,  hunting, and making breakfast for his grandchildren. He was the proud  father of 3 sons, grandfather to 6, and great-grandfather to 13.

Madam Speaker, Edward Holmes served his country faithfully with  honor, humility, and always heart. It is my privilege to recognize him  posthumously as our July Veteran of the Month.
