Mr. ALFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership.

Mr. Speaker, in the words of Yogi Berra: ``This seems like deja vu  all over again.''

Fifty-nine days ago, I stood at this very lectern debating the  ranking member and a friend of mine over the continuing resolution to  keep our government open.

On September 19, we did our work in this body, but Senate Democrats  chose to hold America hostage with the Schumer shutdown. Democrats in  Congress, including the minority whip, shamefully admitted they were  using the misery they inflicted on the American people as leverage to  achieve their leftist wish list of demands, slowly twisting the heads  of the American people in a vice.

Tonight, I am relieved to say the misery of the Schumer shutdown is  on our doorstep.

Mr. Speaker, this package proves that when Republicans stay united  and put America first, we can govern with strength, compassion, and  common sense. Tonight, Mr. Speaker, we will reopen the government and  liberate the Schumer hostages.
