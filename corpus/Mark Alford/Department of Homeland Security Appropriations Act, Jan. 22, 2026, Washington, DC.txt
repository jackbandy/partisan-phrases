Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. ALFORD. Mr. Speaker, this moment matters. For too long, we here  in Washington have governed by crisis. We rushed preholiday omnibuses,  backroom deals, and broken promises.

Mr. Speaker, those days are over.

Today, following President Trump's America First agenda, along with  Chairman   Tom Cole's unmatched leadership, we are doing what the  American people sent us here to Washington, D.C., to do: Put America  first.

Mr. Speaker, 12 out of 12 appropriations bills will be passed today,  including Homeland Security. These are transparent bills, accountable  bills, and fiscally responsible bills.

This hasn't happened in years, and it sends a clear, powerful message  back home that the House is back at work. We are back to governing.

These bills strengthen our military, secure our border, invest in  health and workforce readiness, modernize transportation, and deliver  real savings for taxpayers.

It is peace through strength. This Homeland bill makes us safer at  home by deporting illegal criminal aliens.

In the overall bills through our Member-directed investments, we are  expanding Skyhaven Airport to improve safety and grow aviation training  at the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg.

We are launching a workforce training center for ag in Sedalia to  prepare the next generation.

We are replacing a failing bridge so first responders, schoolbuses,  and commerce can move safely and reliably in Oak Grove, Missouri.

These are reasonable Member-directed investments in America, our true  Article I authority.

Mr. Speaker, we are just inches away from the finish line. Let's not  slow this down. Let's get over the finish line. Let's deliver now for  what the American people sent us here to do: Donald J. Trump's America  First agenda backed by 12 appropriation bills passed out of this House,  signed by the President. Let's fund our government.
