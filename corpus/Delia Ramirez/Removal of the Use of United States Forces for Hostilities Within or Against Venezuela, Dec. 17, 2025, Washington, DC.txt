Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, from the start of the Trump  administration, this Republican-led Congress has willingly given up our  powers and authority: our power of the purse, our oversight authority,  our legislative authority, and now, our war powers.

Members of this body have surrendered their ability to check the  executive and have failed to stand up for democracy and the American  people.

I say: Enough is enough. Congress must start acting as a coequal  branch of government. Trump and his administration, while waging a war  in our cities, are committing war crimes in the Caribbean.

While Trump lies to us about how they are going after  narcotraffickers, he is pardoning convicted narcotraffickers who are  probably responsible for many of the overdoses we have seen around the  country.

The hypocrisy is suffocating. The administration is lying,  consolidating power, and committing war crimes in order to control, to  dominate, and to seize Venezuelan oil and pursue regime change for  their imperialistic agenda in the Western Hemisphere. They do this all  so they can extract resources, they can expand their wealth, and they  can make sure that one day, should they lose their hold on power, which  they will, they can be pardoned for their corruption.

It seems like Republicans love Trump and protecting pedophiles more  than they love America and children. It is shameful, and it is pitiful.  It is filthy, and we have to put an end to it.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution.  Let's take back the power and authority that rightfully belongs to  Congress and put an end to the lawlessness that makes us all less safe.
