We Have A Shared Humanity


Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, bigotry and hate threaten our mutual  safety, and they deny our interconnectedness.

Yet, from the murder of Wadee Alfayuomi in Illinois to the recent  attack on celebrants during the Assyrian New Year Parade in Iraq to the  persecution of Ukrainian Christians by Russian occupation forces, so  many of our neighbors at home and abroad live with vulnerability and  insecurity as they endure the dangers of religious and ethnic  persecution within their own communities.

It is important that these incidents, though only a fraction of the  examples we have of the destructive force of hate are confronted and  placed on the Congressional Record.

Congress must renew its commitment to root out hate-fueled violence  that violates our neighbors' safety, their dignity, and their rights  because of their ethnicity, religion, or beliefs.

A more just, peaceful, and loving world that recognizes our diversity  and honors our shared humanity is, in fact, possible.
