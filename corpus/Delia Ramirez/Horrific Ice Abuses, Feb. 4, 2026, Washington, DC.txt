Horrific Ice Abuses

Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, it has been 365 days of Trump 2.0, 365 days of terror,  abuse, and violations of our rights.

After infusing $150 billion into DHS and ICE, people in this Chamber  have chosen to give them even more money, even after seeing what DHS  does with its unlimited resources, even after seeing what they do with  unchecked power.

Let me say what they did to Silverio, what they did to Marimar, to  Keith, to Renee, to Alex, what they did to Illinois resident Nenko  Gantchev in an ICE detention center. Also, Mr. Speaker, what they are  doing right now to my own constituent, Steven, a 14-year-old boy with  autism in a detention center plagued with measles, it is  unconscionable. It is unacceptable.

Many of us are clear: The Department of Homeland Security is the  greatest threat to the homeland right now, and that is why we must claw  back funding for DHS and ICE. It is why we must pass my Melt ICE Act  and end DHS detention and monitoring, disrupt immigration enforcement,  and return taxpayer dollars back to the communities.

We also must immediately start the proceedings to impeach Noem. I  said it before, and I will say it again. She will either quit, she will  get fired, or we will impeach her.

Here is the thing: Our tax dollars should be used to make sure  working people have every single thing they need to thrive, not money  used to execute U.S. citizens.

Let me end by saying this: We brought the Department of Homeland  Security into this world just two decades ago. We also have the ability  and the authority to build a world without it, and I will work every  day to make that happen.
