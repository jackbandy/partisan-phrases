Protect Children's Innocence Act

Mrs. RAMIREZ. Madam Speaker, the Republican Party is quickly becoming  the party of child suffering. Under their leadership and because of  their policies, children are sick from cuts to Medicaid and the end of  the ACA subsidies. They are hungry from cuts to SNAP. They are orphaned  by violently abducting their parents. They are criminalized and strip- searched at the border, and now they are denied lifesaving gender- affirming care.

Since my Republican colleagues seem confused about what love, care,  and protection looks like, let me be very clear. The Protect Children's  Innocence Act is not it. No one who causes or tolerates the suffering  of children can claim to be their protector.

Love for our children would ensure each of them have every single  thing they need to thrive assured to them.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues here in the House of  Representatives to vote ``no.'' Let's build a future where our  children, including our transgender little ones, are seen, are loved,  and are valued.
