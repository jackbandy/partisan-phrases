Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act

Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the SAVE Act. The bottom  line is that the SAVE Act suppresses the votes of women; Black, Brown,  and indigenous people; veterans; and working-class Americans.

In advancing it, Republicans invoke those historical policies that  were intended to disenfranchise Americans. Let me remind Members what  they were: literacy tests and poll taxes for eligible voters,  grandfather clauses that tied voters' rights to the grandfathers before  the Civil War, all-White primaries to eliminate Black voters' presence  in the electoral process, and now: Show me your papers.

The SAVE Act is the same trash, just a different day. It is the  Republicans' latest attempt to make clear who the majority believes  should have access to vote and who should not.

Anyone who votes for this resolution will go down in the history  books with the likes of Confederate politicians, Jim Crow advocates,  and white supremacists as bigots.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
