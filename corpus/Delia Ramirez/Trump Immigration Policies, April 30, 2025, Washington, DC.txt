Trump Immigration Policies


Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, fascism always demands a public enemy.  Through lies and scapegoating, the Trump administration has tried to  make immigrants the enemy. They have tried to convince us that the  problem isn't their abuses of power or the unchecked greed of  multinational corporations but it is immigrants.

In their 100 days in office, the Trump administration and Noem, the  Secretary of Homeland Security, have abused the power of the Department  of Homeland Security to pursue a campaign of persecution, of mass  incarceration, and of deportation.

Day after day, they have disregarded the authority of Congress, the  laws of the land, and the constitutional rights of residents, the  courts, due process, and every check and balance that protects us from  fascist authoritarians.

No one has been spared from their abusive authoritarian assault, not  United States citizens, children with cancer, not pregnant women, not  fathers with legal residency, not organ donors, not student activists,  not professors, not green card holders, not asylees, not DACA  recipients.

Trump and Noem have wasted millions of taxpayer dollars in their  criminal acts from a $200 million anti-immigrant ad campaign to $46  million paid to illegally detain people in offshore prisons to more  than $300 million to militarize and end parole and due process at our  borders. There is no end to how they will abuse their power, and we  have to say: Enough.

As I demanded yesterday in the Homeland Security Committee, Noem must  step down. We can't give one more dollar to this administration to  continue its unconstitutional, anti-immigrant, authoritarian agenda.

I will close with this: Today, Trump, Noem, and the administration  have made the immigrants the enemy. Tomorrow, it will be whoever they  deem undesirable.
