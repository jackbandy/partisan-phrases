Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Eric Sirota for his work  to expand tenants' rights and reshape the housing landscape.

As director of housing justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law  and now as the director of a tenant advocacy clinic, Eric uses  litigation advocacy to advance housing equity in Illinois and beyond.  His work with the Illinois Fair Housing Coalition led to the passage of  a State law prohibiting discrimination against housing choice voucher  holders.

Eric co-led the Partnership of Just Housing, a national coalition  that improved housing access for people with arrest and conviction  histories. As a trusted counsel to countless tenant associations, Eric  has maintained his commitment to housing for all.

On behalf of Illinois' Third Congressional District, it is my honor  to commend Eric Sirota for his work to ensure safe, just, and  affordable housing as a fundamental human right.

I thank and congratulate Eric.
