Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to introduce the Medical Research  for Our Troops Act, a bill to amend the Full-Year Continuing  Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, by restoring essential funding  for Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs within the  Department of Defense Account. I thank my colleague, Rep. Mike Levin  for joining me as a co-lead of this important legislation, the 21  original cosponsors who support the bill, and the 66 organizations who  endorse the bill text.

Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs have been  instrumental in advancing groundbreaking medical research that directly  benefit our service members and veterans. Over the years, this program  has supported lifesaving innovations in areas such as traumatic brain  injury. PTSD, breast cancer, and other conditions that  disproportionately affect our military community. Many treatments and  therapies that were once experimental are now standard care, thanks to  the success and dedication of Congressionally Directed Medical Research  Programs-funded research.

Our bill restores funding to levels aligned with the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2024, ensuring continuity of these vital research  efforts. By doing so, we reaffirm our commitment to sustaining the  momentum of these proven programs that save lives and improve the  health outcomes of those who serve our Nation.

I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to ensure that  medical research for our troops and veterans remains strong,  innovative, and fully funded.
