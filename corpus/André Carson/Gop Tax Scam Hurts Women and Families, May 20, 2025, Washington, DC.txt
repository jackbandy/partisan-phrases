Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families

Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Medicaid and nutrition  assistance. I would like to tell you about Arica from Indianapolis'  Eastside, a single mother of five, including one child with special  needs. She says that if Medicaid is cut, she and her five children will  not be able to survive.

There is Carol Ann from Indianapolis' Northside. Her Meals on Wheels  have already been reduced. She told me simply: We need food to live.

Bethany from Center Township says that without Medicaid, she would be  dead. If Trump cuts Medicaid, she will probably die.

These are the stakes. Every corner of my district, every corner of  the great Hoosier State, and every corner of our country will be  impacted by these very cruel budget cuts.

Under this budget, 14 million people will lose healthcare. Millions  will lose SNAP benefits. Those aren't just numbers. These are people  like Arica, Carol Ann, and Bethany.

I implore my colleagues to remember our shared humanity and vote  ``no'' on this heartless bill.
