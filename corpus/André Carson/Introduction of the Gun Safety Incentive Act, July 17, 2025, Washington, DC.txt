Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Gun Safety  Incentive Act, a commonsense and life-saving measure to address one of  the most urgent crises facing our Nation: the epidemic of gun violence,  particularly as it affects our children.

I am proud to be joined in this effort with my co-leads-- Representatives Robin Kelly and Lucy McBath--who, like me, believe that  protecting children, families, and veterans should be above politics.

Firearms are now the leading cause of death for children and  teenagers in the United States. Every year, more than 2,500 young lives  are lost to gun violence. For children under the age of 13, these  deaths most often occur inside the home. In 2021, firearms accounted  for nearly 19 percent of all childhood deaths--a staggering 50 percent  increase since 2019.

Disturbingly, three out of every four children under the age of 10  live in a household with a firearm. More than a third of these children  have reported personally handling an unsecured gun in the home.

We can and we must do more to prevent these tragedies. The Gun Safety  Incentive Act takes meaningful, practical steps to promote responsible  firearm storage and protect our children.

First, the bill provides a 10 percent federal tax credit through 2030  for individuals who purchase certified firearm safes and secure storage  devices. This incentive directly supports gun owners who take steps to  store their firearms safely--an action proven to reduce the risk of  accidents, suicides, and theft.

Second, the legislation directs the Department of Justice to develop  and promote voluntary best practices for secure firearm storage, making  this information readily accessible to the public both online and in  print.

Third, the bill requires clear labeling on all handgun, rifle, and  shotgun packaging, stating: ``Safe Storage Saves Lives.'' These labels  will also direct consumers to DOJ's storage guidelines, ensuring that  every gun owner receives trusted, research-based information on how to  keep their weapons out of the wrong hands.

Finally, the bill authorizes funding for Safe Firearm Storage  Assistance Programs--community-based efforts that promote secure  storage practices through education, outreach, and local partnerships.  These programs meet people where they are and empower them to be part  of the solution.

Mr. Speaker, this bill is not about politics--it is about prevention.  It is about using the tools at our disposal to keep guns away from  children and out of the hands of those who might harm themselves or  others. The Gun Safety Incentive Act is a reasonable, measured, and  life-saving response to an ongoing public health emergency.

I urge all my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--to join me  in supporting this critical legislation. Let us stand together to  protect America's children from senseless, preventable tragedy.
