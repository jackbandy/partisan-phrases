Recognizing Hannah Dickinson, Gold Award


Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me  in congratulating Hannah Dickinson. Hannah is a member of Sandy Beaches  Service Unit within Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida, and has  exemplified extraordinary leadership, innovative problem-solving, and a  demonstrated commitment to making a lasting, positive impact, by  earning the most prestigious award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award.

Gold Award Girl Scouts are recognized as trailblazers who are willing  to tackle the most pressing challenges facing their communities and the  world with measurable, sustainable, and far-reaching results. To earn  the Girl Scout Gold Award, high school-age Girl Scouts must identify  and investigate an issue they care about, devise a plan, and then lead  a team of experts and community members to implement a project that  produces lasting change. Over the course of 1-2 years, Gold Award Girl  Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and leadership,  distinguishing them from their peers. Through their resourcefulness and  perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to truly make the world a  better place.

Hannah's project, Kindness Counts, in partnership with Port Charlotte  High School and the National Honor Society and Key Club, was an  excellent endeavor to address mental health and bullying in our  community. Hannah took action by coordinating with school  administrators, educating community members about the harmful effects  of bullying, and creating a motivational mural to be displayed at her  school, which will have a positive impact on our community for years to  come.

On behalf of the 17th Congressional District of Florida,  congratulations to Hannah for achieving the highest distinction in Girl  Scouts, the Gold Award. We thank Hannah for her leadership and making  such a positive, lasting change in our community.
