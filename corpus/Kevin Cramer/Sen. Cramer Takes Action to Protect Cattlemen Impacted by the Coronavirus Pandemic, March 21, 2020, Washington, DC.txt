Sen. Cramer Takes Action to Protect Cattlemen Impacted by the Coronavirus Pandemic


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) took action this week to protect cattlemen who are disproportionately harmed by the Coronavirus (COVID--19) pandemic.

"COVID--19 is wreaking havoc in nearly every sector of our economy. We want to ensure the Administration uses every tool at its disposal and has Congressional authority to do so," said Senator Cramer. "Our efforts would use existing Department of Agriculture (USDA) resources to protect our cattle producers from the consequences of this pandemic."

As part of his effort, Senator Cramer joined Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) and a bipartisan group of senators in writing a letter to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue urging him to use his authority under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act to make one-time, emergency payments to cattle producers.

"It is important that we act quickly to provide assistance to cattlemen in these unprecedented times without unnecessarily intruding into the markets," the senators wrote. "I urge you to use your authorities under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act to make a one-time emergency payment to help beef cattle producers during this crisis."

Senator Cramer also helped Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD) introduce legislation requiring Secretary Perdue to provide market assistance to cattle producers. The bill would set up a price support program for feeder and live cattle, using existing USDA research agencies to calculate support payments.
