Sen. Cramer Statement on President Trump Signing The Emergency GI Fix for Coronavirus School Closures Bill


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee member, issued the following statement on President Trump signing into law S.3503, the "Emergency GI Fix for Coronavirus School Closures":

"I'm grateful to President Trump for signing this important legislation quickly. Schools moving to online classes because of the coronavirus exposed an obvious flaw in the GI Bill, which threatened to upend the education of many of our veterans simply because they could not participate in online learning like their peers. Thankfully we were able to unite behind an immediate solution for our veterans."

Senator Cramer joined his colleagues on the Senate VA Committee in introducing this legislation earlier this month.
