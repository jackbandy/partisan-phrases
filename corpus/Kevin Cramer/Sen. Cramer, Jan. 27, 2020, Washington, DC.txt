Sen. Cramer, Colleagues Welcome House Passage of Never Again Act to Support Holocaust Education


U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) applauded the passage of the House counterpart to the senators' bipartisan Never Again Education Act (S.2085), which would establish dedicated federal funding to provide teachers with resources and training necessary to teach our students the important lessons of the Holocaust.

"Thank you to the House of Representatives for recognizing the importance of educating the next generation about this terrible moment in history," Senator Cramer said. "Learning the lessons of the Holocaust helps ensure a tragedy such as this is never repeated. While we pause to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day today, I hope the Senate works quickly to pass our legislation."
