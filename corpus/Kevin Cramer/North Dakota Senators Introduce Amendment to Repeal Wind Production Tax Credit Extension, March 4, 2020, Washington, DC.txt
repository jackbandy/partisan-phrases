North Dakota Senators Introduce Amendment to Repeal Wind Production Tax Credit Extension


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) with U.S. Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) introduced an amendment to the American Energy Innovation Act repealing the extension of the wind production tax credit (PTC).â€ª

"For years we have been promised the wind PTC would be phased out, yet some in Washington jammed it through despite our opposition," the Senators said. "Instead of continuing the wind PTC, baseload coal should be fairly valued to ensure we have grid reliability and resiliency."

The wind PTC, originally meant to phase out by January 1, 2020, was extended for one year as part of the appropriations package passed by Congress last December.

This week the Senate is debating S.2657, the bipartisan energy bill introduced by Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Joe Manchin (D-WV). Senators Cramer and Hoeven are offering several amendments and working with their colleagues to advance North Dakota's energy priorities.
