Sen. Cramer: Saudi Arabia to Reduce its Oil Production in June


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement today on Saudi Arabia announcing it will reduce its oil production in June:

"It is nice seeing Saudi Arabia heed our call for additional action by reducing its oil production in June on top of the cuts in the OPEC+ deal. As American producers began cutting production in March and April, Saudi Arabia ramped up, greatly harming the industry before the OPEC+ deal went into effect in May. I will continue monitoring the Saudi's efforts as we ensure access to support our producers and begin to reopen our country."

Senators Cramer and Dan Sullivan led a call with a group of senators to the Saudi Arabia's energy officials last month, urging them to take further action. This followed the agreement secured by President Trump and his Administration to cut production.
