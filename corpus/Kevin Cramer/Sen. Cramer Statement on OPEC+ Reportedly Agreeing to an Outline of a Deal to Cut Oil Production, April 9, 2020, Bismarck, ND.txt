Sen. Cramer Statement on OPEC+ Reportedly Agreeing to an Outline of a Deal to Cut Oil Production


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on reports of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) agreeing to an outline of a deal to cut oil production:

"These reports are encouraging and a step in the right direction. No matter what, the mess Saudi Arabia and Russia made may take years to clean up. I look forward to reviewing more details as they come out and seeing if these actions are enough to provide market stability and will be watching closely to ensure follow through by the parties. If not, the United States will be further empowered to take immediate action."

Senator Cramer has been a leading voice in the fight to end the oil dispute between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which is greatly harming American energy producers.
