Sen. Cramer, Colleagues Introduce Legislation to Prohibit Teleabortions


U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) this week introduced legislation to protect the sanctity of human life by prohibiting chemical abortions from being performed without the supervision of a healthcare provider. U.S. Senators John Kennedy (R-LA), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), James Lankford (R-OK), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Tim Scott (R-SC), and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) joined Cassidy as original cosponsors of the bill.

The Teleabortion Prevention Act would make it a federal offense for healthcare providers to perform a chemical abortion without first physically examining the patient, being present during the procedure, and scheduling a follow-up visit for the patient. This legislation builds on the efforts of several states to curtail teleabortion and care for mothers throughout their pregnancy.

The bill would also stop attempts by pro-abortion groups who use teleabortion to work around state law.

"Proponents of abortion say it should be a safe, rare decision made between a mother and a qualified doctor, but now there is a movement to provide abortions with little-to-no consultation with a physician. Killing an unborn child is wrong, and encouraging women to undergo that procedure without knowing the impact is egregious," said Cramer. "Our pro-life legislation counters these efforts and works to protect mothers and unborn children."
