Sen. Cramer Statement on Democrats Refusing to Advance the COVID--19 Phase Three Relief Package


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on Senate Democrats voting against proceeding to debate on the Phase Three Coronavirus (COVID--19) relief package tonight:

â€ª"How pathetic. Tonight's vote was not even on passing a bipartisan plan, it was merely to begin debating it. The American people are hurting, the clock is ticking, but Senate Democrats would rather cave to Speaker Pelosi's eleventh-hour demands. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle should worry more about getting relief to their constituents and less about the House Speaker's partisan wish list. This cannot go another day."
