Sen. Cramer Statement on USDA's Direct Relief Payment Details, Exclusion of Sunflowers and Pulse Crops


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) releasing details of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP):

"Today Secretary Perdue announced the specifics for USDA's COVID-19 direct payment program, and I encourage North Dakota's agricultural community to be ready to apply for the aid next week.

"While I am glad to see many of our commodities are eligible for this assistance-- and at a higher payment limit, as we requested -- unfortunately sunflowers and several pulse crops were not explicitly included.

"I appreciate the Department signaling they will remain flexible on deeming other crops eligible, and I look forward to working with USDA to make sure our sunflower and pulse crop producers receive the assistance they need."

According to USDA's announcement, additional crops not yet named may be deemed eligible at a later date.
