Sen. Cramer Statement on USDA's COVID-19 Food Assistance Program


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) unveiling its COVID-19 food assistance program:

"President Trump and Secretary Perdue understand the great importance of protecting our food supply chain and supporting American agriculture. I applaud their efforts, as well as Senator Hoeven, who worked hard to secure support for North Dakota's producers."

USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the program details at the White House today.

"During this time of national crisis, President Trump and USDA are standing with our farmers, ranchers, and all citizens to make sure they are taken care of," said Secretary Perdue. "The American food supply chain had to adapt, and it remains safe, secure, and strong, and we all know that starts with America's farmers and ranchers. This program will not only provide immediate relief for our farmers and ranchers, but it will also allow for the purchase and distribution of our agricultural abundance to help our fellow Americans in need."

Today's program was authorized as part of the CARES Act which Senator Cramer helped pass through the Senate. As detailed by USDA, the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) is a $19 billion immediate relief program, with $16 billion in direct support payments and $3 billion in food purchases and distribution.
