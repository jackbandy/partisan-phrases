Sen. Cramer Statement on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement after voting in favor of S.3275, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act:

"I promised the people of North Dakota if they sent me to the Senate I would fight for life, and I intend to keep that promise. Late-term abortion is choosing to end the life of an unborn child who can feel pain just like the rest of us. It has no place in a society which values life, and should be banned as our legislation dictates. I urge my colleagues who oppose it to reconsider their votes today, and for all citizens who understand the importance of this issue to get involved and be a voice for the voiceless."

The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act reflects the broad scientific community's belief that babies feel pain at 20 weeks or earlier, which is why it is common to provide anesthesia when an unborn child at that stage undergoes surgery. The only procedure where anesthesia is not administered is an abortion, which often involves dismembering the child.

The United States is one of only seven countries allowing on-demand abortions past 20 weeks, putting it in the company of North Korea, China, Vietnam, Singapore, Canada, and the Netherlands. There are an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 late-term abortions per year, roughly the same number as the population of Jamestown, North Dakota.

Senator Cramer, an original cosponsor of today's legislation, was the first freshman senator of the 2018 class to speak on the Senate floor. In his January 16, 2019, speech, Senator Cramer spoke about his support for legislation designed to protect unborn children.

"This fight is not a political fight, but a fight for humanity itself," Senator Cramer said during this speech. "It is a war against all of us and against all of our children, no matter our ideologies."
