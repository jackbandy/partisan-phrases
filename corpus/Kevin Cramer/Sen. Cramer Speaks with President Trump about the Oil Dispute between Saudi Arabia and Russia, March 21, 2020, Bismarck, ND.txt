Sen. Cramer Speaks with President Trump about the Oil Dispute between Saudi Arabia and Russia


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) spoke with President Donald Trump last night about the ongoing oil dispute between alleged ally Saudi Arabia and Russia, which is hurting American energy producers.

"I am encouraged President Trump is reaching out to Russia's Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman to help resolve the dispute," said Senator Cramer. "I told the President we need tough diplomacy. We cannot tolerate having 2,500 troops and missile defense batteries protecting Saudi Arabia's oil assets while they declare war on our oil assets in North Dakota and across the United States. I am glad to see President Trump is engaged on this issue and wants to see a more balanced approach. American jobs and national security depend on it."

Senator Cramer introduced legislation with Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan last week to move troops from Saudi Arabia to a different location in the Middle East.

Senator Cramer first detailed his conversation with the President on Fox Business's Mornings with Maria. It is the latest in a series of steps the Senator has taken in the fight to protect American energy interests. Learn more here.
