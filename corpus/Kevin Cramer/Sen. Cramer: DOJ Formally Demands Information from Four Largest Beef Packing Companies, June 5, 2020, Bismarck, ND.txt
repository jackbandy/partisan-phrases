Sen. Cramer: DOJ Formally Demands Information from Four Largest Beef Packing Companies


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on the Department of Justice (DOJ) formally demanding information from the country's four largest beef packing companies:

"I am pleased to see Attorney General William Barr following through with President Trump's request to look into the meatpacking industry. These four companies control 80 percent of our nation's beef packing plants, and the inverse price relationship from farm to store we have seen during COVID-19 is cause to be suspicious about possible antitrust violations. I look forward to seeing what comes as a result of DOJ's investigation."

Senator Cramer called on the DOJ to launch this investigation in March, which President Trump answered in early May.
