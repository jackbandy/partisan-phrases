Sen. Cramer Statement on President Trump Signing USMCA


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement after attending the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement signing ceremony with President Donald J. Trump at the White House today:

"Approving this deal ensures the manufacturers, service providers, agricultural communities, and energy producers in North Dakota and across the country are able to operate on an equal playing field with some of our biggest trading partners and puts them in a better position to fulfill their missions. Thank you to President Trump and our allies in Congress for their tireless work to make this deal a reality."

Senator Cramer outlined the benefits USMCA delivers for North Dakota when the deal passed the Senate and recently spoke with the Daily Caller and the Washington Examiner about the importance of securing these trade deals. USMCA agreement has now been approved by Mexico and the United States with Canada expected to ratify it shortly.
