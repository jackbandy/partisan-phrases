Sen. Cramer: Treasury Approves Burgum's Request for Allowing States to Use CARES Act Funds on Unemployment Insurance


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on the U.S. Department of Treasury releasing guidance allowing states to use COVID-19 relief funds for unemployment insurance:

"Thanks to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin for listening to the input of Governor Burgum and others who are working at the state and local level to get our workers help. Treasury's guidance gives states like North Dakota the flexibility they need to ensure their unemployment insurance programs are properly funded."

Senator Cramer worked with the Trump Administration on this guidance at the request of Governor Burgum. These funds, totaling $1.25 billion, were appropriated in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
