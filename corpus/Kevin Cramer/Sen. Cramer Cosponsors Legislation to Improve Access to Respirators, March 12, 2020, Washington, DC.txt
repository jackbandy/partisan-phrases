Sen. Cramer Cosponsors Legislation to Improve Access to Respirators


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) this week cosponsored bipartisan legislation to help increase access to respirators during the current coronavirus outbreak.

"We need to set aside the partisan posturing and focus on addressing the coronavirus outbreak," said Senator Cramer. "The Health Care Workforce Protection Act is a commonsense way to help equip our medical personnel with the tools they need to manage the outbreak and modernize this part of the system to ensure we are prepared in the future. The bill should be noncontroversial and I hope we see it pass quickly."
