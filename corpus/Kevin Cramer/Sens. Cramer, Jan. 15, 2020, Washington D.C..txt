Sens. Cramer, Cortez Masto Introduce Bill to Protect High School Students on Commutes to School


U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Senator Kevin Cramer (R.-N.D.) today introduced bipartisan legislation to make pedestrian and bicycle safety projects targeting high school students who walk or bike to school eligible for federal support from the Department of Transportation (DOT).

"The Safe Routes to School program empowers local education systems to make traveling to school safer, but it only applies to elementary and middle schools," said Senator Cramer. "In the highway bill Congress is considering, we included language amending this program to also provide funding for high schools. As we debate that legislation, our standalone bill raises awareness for this issue and, if passed, would help prevent tragic accidents for all students."
