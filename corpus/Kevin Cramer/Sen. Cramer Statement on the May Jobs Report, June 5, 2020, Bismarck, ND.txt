Sen. Cramer Statement on the May Jobs Report


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a Senate Budget Committee member, issued the following statement on the May 2020 Jobs Report:

"Despite being told by experts and naysayers the opposite would happen, America's unemployment rate fell and our economy is adding jobs by the millions. I agree with the New York Times: this is a testament to the success of the Paycheck Protection Program we crafted in the Senate. Credit also goes to people in states like North Dakota who used common sense to begin reopening responsibly and successfully. There's more work to be done, but the recovery begins today. President Trump has built a rocket ship economy before, and under his leadership, it will happen again."
