Sen. Cramer Statement on Senate Democrats Agreeing to a COVID--19 Phase Three Relief Package


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on Senate Democrats agreeing to a Phase Three COVID--19 relief package:

"Better late than never. Democrats waited until Wednesday to accept a deal closely resembling what we had Sunday while playing politics and delaying help for the American people. I am reviewing the agreement and will provide details as they become available. While no major deal is ever perfect, the American people need relief immediately."
