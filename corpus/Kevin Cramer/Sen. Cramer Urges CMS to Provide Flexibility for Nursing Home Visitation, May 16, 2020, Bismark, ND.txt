Sen. Cramer Urges CMS to Provide Flexibility for Nursing Home Visitation


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) spoke to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma today urging her to update CMS guidance providing states with flexibility for nursing home visitations.

 "As states like North Dakota reopen and testing continues to ramp up, the Trump Administration should update its recommendations on nursing home visitors accordingly. On our call I urged Administrator Verma to modify CMS guidance to provide flexibility for states like ours to responsibly allow visitors in nursing homes."

Current CMS guidance recommends restricting all visitors to nursing homes with few exceptions.
