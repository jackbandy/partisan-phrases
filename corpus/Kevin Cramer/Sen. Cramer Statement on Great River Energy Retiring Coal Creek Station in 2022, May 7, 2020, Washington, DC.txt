Sen. Cramer Statement on Great River Energy Retiring Coal Creek Station in 2022


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on Great River Energy (GRE) retiring Coal Creek Station in 2022:

"While Great River Energy decided to retire Coal Creek Station, GRE is leaving the door open for the plant to be sold and to continue operating. I, and all of North Dakota's leaders, need to take a comprehensive approach, working with interested stakeholders and every level of government to play our part to demonstrate Coal Creek's value. This station has given our state over 260 important jobs -- and more at the Falkirk Mine -- for the last 30 years. North Dakota leans on reliable energy sources like coal, which renewable sources like wind simply cannot compete with, to keep the power on. While GRE may be abandoning Coal Creek Station, we must look at all available options moving forward."
