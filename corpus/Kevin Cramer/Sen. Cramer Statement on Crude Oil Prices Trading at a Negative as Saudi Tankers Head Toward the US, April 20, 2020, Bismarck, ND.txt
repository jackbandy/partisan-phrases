Sen. Cramer Statement on Crude Oil Prices Trading at a Negative as Saudi Tankers Head Toward the US


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on crude oil prices trading at a negative price today as Saudi oil tankers make their way to the United States:

"Today's collapse poses a devastating threat to our oil and gas sector, with job losses in the thousands and national security being weakened if the industry cannot recover. The dramatic low underscores why we cannot allow Saudi Arabia to flood the market, especially given our storage capacity dwindling. Right now, the highest number of Saudi oil tankers in years is on its way to our shores. Given today's news, I call on President Trump to prevent them from unloading in the United States."
