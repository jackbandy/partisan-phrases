Sen. Cramer: USDA Improves the Livestock Risk Protection Insurance Program


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA) announcing changes to the Livestock Risk Protection (LRP) insurance program today:

"USDA is making the LRP insurance program more accessible to livestock producers. I appreciate this effort by Secretary Perdue and Administrator Barbre, and I encourage North Dakotans to explore whether this program works for them."

According to RMA, the changes:

Allow premiums to be paid at the end of the endorsement period, putting it in line with other policies.

Increase the premium subsidy for coverage levels above 80 percent. Those with an 80 percent or higher coverage level will get a 5-percentage point subsidy increase.
