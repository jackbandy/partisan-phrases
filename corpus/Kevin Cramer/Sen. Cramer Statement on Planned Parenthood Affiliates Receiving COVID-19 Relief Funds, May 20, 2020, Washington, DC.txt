Sen. Cramer Statement on Planned Parenthood Affiliates Receiving COVID-19 Relief Funds


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on Planned Parenthood affiliates receiving $80 million in Paycheck Protection Program funds:

"Paycheck Protection Program funds are for saving jobs, not killing babies. We established that Planned Parenthood would not be eligible to receive these funds when we passed the CARES Act, but apparently some of its affiliates missed that part of the law. Planned Parenthood reported over $1.6 billion in income and bragged last year about not taking money from the Trump Administration. Its affiliates should immediately return the loan and be transparent about how this happened so we can prevent it from reoccurring."
