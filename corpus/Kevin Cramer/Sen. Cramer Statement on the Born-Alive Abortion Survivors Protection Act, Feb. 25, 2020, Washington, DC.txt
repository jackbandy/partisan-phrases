Sen. Cramer Statement on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement after voting in favor of S. 311, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act:

"This legislation should not be controversial. It merely ensures a child born alive after a failed abortion will be given the same immediate medical attention as any other human being whose life is in peril. Allowing the cries of an already-born baby to go unanswered is haunting, and it should not be polarizing to think our society would condemn those who willfully neglect these children. That such a commonsense mandate is not already law demonstrates the federal government's misplaced priorities on health care. We should change that immediately."
