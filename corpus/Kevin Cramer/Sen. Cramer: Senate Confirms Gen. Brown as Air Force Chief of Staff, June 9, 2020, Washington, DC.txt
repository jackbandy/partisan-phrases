Sen. Cramer: Senate Confirms Gen. Brown as Air Force Chief of Staff


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) member, issued the following statement on the Senate confirming U.S. Air Force (USAF) General Charles Brown as USAF Chief of Staff today:

"General Brown is ready to help lead the Air Force. He understands the important role North Dakota's bases play in protecting the United States, and the great potential they possess. President Trump made an excellent choice in choosing him to replace retiring Chief of Staff, General Goldfein. I thank both of them for their willingness to serve our country, and I look forward to hosting General Brown in North Dakota soon."

Senator Cramer spoke to General Brown during his confirmation hearing in May about the Arctic Mission and the importance of Northern Tier bases and invited the General to the University of North Dakota. General Brown currently serves as the Commander of Pacific Air Forces, where he oversaw Minot's B-52 fleet when it was stationed in Guam.
