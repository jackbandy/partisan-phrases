Sen. Cramer: BOR Seeks Public Comment on Draft EIS for the ENDAWS Project


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Water, issued the following statement on the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) seeking public comment on its Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Eastern North Dakota Alternate Water Supply (ENDAWS) Project:

"It is encouraging to see the Bureau of Reclamation move this project forward on time. I urge North Dakotans to review today's announcement and offer their comment on the draft environmental impact statement."

Senator Cramer announced BOR would be performing this EIS last September and called on North Dakotans to offer their input when BOR published a Notice of Intent in November.
