Sen. Cramer: USDA to Launch Signup for COVID Assistance on May 26


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announcing last night the signup for the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) will launch on Tuesday, May 26:

"Secretary Perdue announced last night the long-awaited CFAP signup will be available the day after Memorial Day. I encourage North Dakota's agricultural producers to be ready to apply for this assistance."

According to Secretary Perdue, CFAP funds will be sent to applicants as soon as one week after USDA launches the signup portal, which will remain open through August. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) CFAP contains $16 billion in direct payments for producers.

Senator Cramer applauded this program when USDA unveiled it in April and worked with the Administration to increase relief payment limits.
