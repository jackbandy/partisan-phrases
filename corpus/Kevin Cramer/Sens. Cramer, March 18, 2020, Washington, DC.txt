Sens. Cramer, Sullivan Lead Colleagues in Urging the Saudis to Stop Energy Market Distortions


U.S. Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK) led a discussion between a group of 10 senators and HRH Princess Reema Bandar Al Saud, the Saudi Ambassador to the United States. During the call, the Senators urged the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to halt its recent harmful efforts to boost oil production and lower crude oil prices.

Today's phone call follows a letter, led by Senators Cramer and Sullivan, written by a group of senators to the Saudi Crown Prince asking him to stabilize the global energy market.

"Saudi Arabia has been a strategic global partner with the United States, and that relationship should mean something," said Senator Cramer. "We will continue pressuring and advocating for a course correction from the Saudis and every nation actively engaged in harmful market distortions in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. We won't be bullied and we won't be blindsided by friend or foe."

Senators Cramer and Sullivan were joined on today's call by Senators Jon Cornyn (R-TX), John Barrasso (R-WY), James Lankford (R-OK), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Jon Kennedy (R-LA), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and John Hoeven (R-ND).
