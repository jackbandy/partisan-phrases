Sen. Cramer: EPA Proposes Honest Accounting Standard to Improve Future Clean Air Act Rules


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee member, issued the following statement on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issuing a proposal to improve the rulemaking process under the Clean Air Act:

"Administrator Wheeler is taking further action to improve the way the EPA writes federal regulations. Today's proposal ensures the EPA considers the full economic impact of any potential Clean Air Act regulation and would hopefully prevent atrocities like the Clean Power Plan from happening again. It aligns with President Trump's efforts to rein the overreaching bureaucracy."

According to the EPA, today's proposal will help ensure Clean Air Act rules are analyzed consistently, transparently, and appropriately, and will provide the public with a better understanding of how the EPA is evaluating benefits and costs when developing regulatory actions.
