Sen. Cramer Statement on President Trump Signing the COVID--19 Phase Three Relief Package into Law


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on the House of Representatives passing the Phase Three Coronavirus (COVID--19) relief package and President Donald Trump signing it into law:

"North Dakota reported its first death related to COVID--19 today. My family will be praying for the loved ones this man left behind and for all the sick and affected in our state and across the country. This North Dakotan acquired the virus as a result of community spread, a strong reminder that every citizen has a role they must play in preventing the disease from reaching more people, especially the most vulnerable among us.

"Today the House of Representatives played its role, passing a package which not only helps Americans weather this economic downturn but also equips our health care professionals with the tools they need as they work to combat COVID--19 and discover a cure.

"I thank President Trump for signing the bill right away and for his leadership throughout the entire process. I urge the Administration to implement this package as quickly as possible. The lives of countless Americans depend on it."
