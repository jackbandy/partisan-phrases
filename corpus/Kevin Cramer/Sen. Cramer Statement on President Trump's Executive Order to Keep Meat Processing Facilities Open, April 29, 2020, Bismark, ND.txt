Sen. Cramer Statement on President Trump's Executive Order to Keep Meat Processing Facilities Open


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement after President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to keep meat and poultry processing facilities open during the COVID-19 pandemic:

"The United States must maintain a robust food supply chain, without sacrificing the safety and health of workers or consumers, if we are going to make it through COVID-19. I applaud President Trump for taking further action to support this critical part of our nation's infrastructure and keep food on the shelves for the American people."

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), under President Trump's Executive Order and the authority of the Defense Production Act, USDA will work with meat processing facilities to affirm they will operate in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines. The Department will also work with state and local officials to ensure the plants are allowed to operate.

"I thank President Trump for signing this executive order and recognizing the importance of keeping our food supply chain safe, secure, and plentiful. Our nation's meat and poultry processing facilities play an integral role in the continuity of our food supply chain," said USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue. "Maintaining the health and safety of these heroic employees in order to ensure that these critical facilities can continue operating is paramount. I also want to thank the companies who are doing their best to keep their workforce safe as well as keeping our food supply sustained. USDA will continue to work with its partners across the federal government to ensure employee safety to maintain this essential industry."
