Sen. Cramer Speaks with Alberta, Canada's Premier about the Oil Price War


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) spoke with Alberta, Canada's Premier Jason Kenney today.

"Just like the United States, Canada understands how detrimental this price war is to the oil and gas industry and its millions of good paying jobs. I reiterated to Premier Kenney the same point I made at the White House last Friday: we must keep all options on the table, including tariffs," said Senator Cramer. "Saudi Arabia pretends to be an ally, using our military resources to protect its oil while the Kingdom declares war on ours. Their behavior must change. I thank the Premier for his outreach and look forward to working with him and our Administration leaders to develop a North American strategy to counter this attack."

Premier Kenney requested the call with Senator Cramer to discuss the ongoing oil dispute between Saudi Arabia and Russia.
