Sen. Cramer Statement on President Trump Declaring a National Emergency to Manage the Coronavirus Outbreak


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on President Donald Trump declaring a national emergency to manage the coronavirus outbreak:

"This is the right thing to do and the right time to do it. As he has at every step, President Trump demonstrated the extraordinary leadership our country needs, striking the right balance of bold and decisive action with diplomacy and collaboration. Today's event was an incredible show of force, bringing the private and public sectors together for the health, safety, and security of the American people. I stand ready to help both President Trump as he combats the outbreak and Governor Burgum as he and local leaders manage the response efforts in North Dakota."
