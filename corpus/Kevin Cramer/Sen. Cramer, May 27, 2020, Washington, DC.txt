Sen. Cramer, EPA Administrator Discuss WOTUS, Regional Haze Program at EPW Hearing


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water, and Wildlife, spoke to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler last week during an EPW Oversight hearing.

Senator Cramer began by thanking Administrator Wheeler for his work on the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule. Senator Cramer hosted Wheeler in North Dakota last year as the EPA was developing this rule.

"The previous Administration's rule was burdensome and illegal," said Senator Cramer. "The Trump Administration listened to states and landowners, working to protect their waters while also protecting their rights. I thank you for coming to North Dakota to receive our input as the Agency crafted this WOTUS rule."

Senator Cramer then questioned Administrator Wheeler on the EPA's Regional Haze program, which the Obama Administration weaponized as part of their effort to shut down North Dakota's energy producers, even though North Dakota is a national leader in air quality. After agreeing with Senator Cramer that congressional intent for the Regional Haze program was not to put producers out of business, Administrator Wheeler outlined the way the Trump Administration is working with states like North Dakota to provide flexibility on meeting the program's requirements.

Before he began his questioning, Senator Cramer highlighted the Administrator's opening remarks.
