Sen. Cramer: Senate Passes Additional Funding for Small Business Programs, COVID-19 Testing, Health Care Providers


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on the Senate passing $475 billion in emergency funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, COVID-19 testing, and health care providers today:

"I am grateful the Trump Administration and Senate Republicans were able to once again overcome the stonewalling of Democrats who want to hold funding for the Paycheck Protection Program hostage to advance their priorities. While not perfect, this is a popular, bipartisan, and well-executed program. We also appropriated more resources for health care providers and COVID-19 testing, which will be critical for reopening our economy." 

Senator Cramer and his Senate Republican colleagues spoke with President Trump and Secretary Mnuchin about this deal on Sunday. It includes $310 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, with $60 billion set aside for small banking institutions and new language clarifying eligibility for agricultural enterprises. Today's package also contains $50 billion for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), $10 billion for EIDL Advance grants, $75 billion for hospitals, and $25 billion for testing.
