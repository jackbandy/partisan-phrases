'My Guide for Future Senators' - Sen. Cramer Submits Final Thoughts on Impeachment to the Congressional Record


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) submitted his final thoughts on the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump to the Congressional Record last week. The Congressional Record on impeachment was kept open to give senators the opportunity to offer additional insight on the trial.

"This was a rare moment in our young nation's history. We had little to guide us other than the Founding Fathers' collective wisdom and sparse precedent," wrote Senator Cramer. "The process may seem daunting, and the debate over even the most basic mechanics of the trial could leave the future members of this body susceptible to deception or misinformation. I therefore want to offer my thoughts for future senators when this issue inevitably rises again."

In his submission, Senator Cramer specifically highlighted the role career federal employees played and emphasized the importance of reigning in a bureaucracy run rampant.

"President Trump was impeached because an unelected bureaucrat provided falsehoods to an overly receptive Democratic House Chairman's office with a directive to remove President Trump," wrote Senator Cramer. "The opinion of federal career staff is not sacrosanct. Without further action, these impeachment proceedings will be interpreted as empowering to them, rather than a reminder of who holds constitutional power."
