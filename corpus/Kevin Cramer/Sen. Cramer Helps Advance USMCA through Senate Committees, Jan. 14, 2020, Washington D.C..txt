Sen. Cramer Helps Advance USMCA through Senate Committees


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) helped advance the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement in the Senate today, voting for its passage from his seats on the Budget Committee and the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee.

"After a year of unnecessary delay, real progress is being made to pass USMCA," said Senator Cramer. "I thank Leader McConnell, EPW Chairman Barrasso, and Budget Chairman Enzi for prioritizing this trade agreement, which includes vital provisions for North Dakota. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it when it reaches the Senate floor."

In addition to the Budget and EPW committees, five other Senate committees have jurisdiction over USMCA: Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), Commerce, Appropriations, Finance, and Foreign Relations. Each are in the process of considering the agreement. After they do so, USMCA will be considered by the full Senate.
