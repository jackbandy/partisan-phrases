Sen. Cramer Announces Support for Nominee to Lead the Army Corps of Engineers


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works and Armed Services committees which oversee the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), delivered floor remarks last week announcing his support for USACE Major General Scott Spellmon, whose promotion to Lieutenant General and nomination to be the USACE's Chief of Engineers and Commanding General is before the Senate.

"As many of my colleagues can attest, I rarely compliment the Army Corps," Senator Cramer's remarks began. "This agency is the epitome of cumbersome bureaucracy."

Senator Cramer then outlined his recent work with General Spellmon on the Snake Creek Embankment in Central North Dakota and western state water rights. In both cases, Spellmon has closely and thoughtfully worked with Senator Cramer.

"General Spellmon listened intently to our concerns and provided thorough, honest responses which will be used as a guidepost for USACE policy moving forward," said Senator Cramer. "Of equal importance, he acknowledged the flaws within his organization. In my time in Congress, honesty sometimes seems to be missing, but not with General Spellmon. He has proven he's willing to listen and be responsive in a forthright manner."

Senator Cramer concluded his remarks by offering his support for General Spellmon's nomination and promotion, urging the rest of the USACE bureaucracy to follow Spellmon's example.
