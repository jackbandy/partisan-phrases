Sen. Cramer: President Trump Proclaims Today as Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives Awareness Day


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on President Donald J. Trump proclaiming May 5, 2020, as "Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives Awareness Day":

"As President Trump states, the violence our tribal communities have endured - especially women and young girls - is egregious and unconscionable. On Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives Awareness Day, I join the President in reaffirming our efforts to stand against injustice, to fight for the safety and wellbeing of Native Americans, and to reverse the unacceptable trend of violence aimed at those who are most vulnerable."

Senator Cramer also helped introduce a resolution with Senator Steve Daines designating today as the "National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls."
