Sen. Cramer Statement on the War Powers Resolution


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a Senate Armed Services Committee member, issued the following statement after voting against the War Powers Resolution today:

"The Constitution makes it clear today's War Powers resolution is unnecessary and seems designed to embarrass President Trump. An unintended consequence of this resolution could also be demoralizing our troops, who are asked to protect our country but could be left wondering whether their Commander-in-Chief can protect them. The troops have our back, and they deserve to know the President can have theirs. I urge the President to veto it and Congress to take up more productive issues."
