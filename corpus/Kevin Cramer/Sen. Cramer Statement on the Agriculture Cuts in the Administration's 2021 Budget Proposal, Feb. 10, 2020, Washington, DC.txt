Sen. Cramer Statement on the Agriculture Cuts in the Administration's 2021 Budget Proposal


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a member of the Senate Budget Committee, issued the following statement on the agriculture cuts in the Trump Administration's 2021 Budget proposal:

"I applaud the Administration for aiming to tackle the debt and deficit by addressing federal spending, but I do not support the disproportionate cuts to important agricultural programs. Our producers have struggled enough with extreme weather and unfair retaliatory actions amid trade disputes. The cuts proposed today would save little but inflict severe pain in American agriculture. Instead of reducing essential services as the Administration proposes, I'll work in Congress to ensure we focus on eliminating waste, fraud, and bureaucratic inefficiency.
