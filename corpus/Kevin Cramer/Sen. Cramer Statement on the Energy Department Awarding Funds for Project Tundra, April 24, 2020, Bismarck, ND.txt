Sen. Cramer Statement on the Energy Department Awarding Funds for Project Tundra


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee member, issued the following statement on the U.S. Department of Energy announcing $17 million in funding for the University of North Dakota's (UND) Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) for Project Tundra today:

"The Energy Department is continuing the Trump Administration's work to bolster American energy dominance and support carbon capture projects in North Dakota. I thank Secretary Brouillette for delivering these funds for Project Tundra and supporting our energy efforts. This is a positive step as we await the Administration finally completing its final rules on the 45Q tax credit, allowing more producers and utilities to confidently invest in carbon capture projects."

Today's announcement came as part of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Fossil Energy announcing $131 million for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) research and development (R&D) projects nationwide. Project Tundra is a project led by Minnkota Power Cooperative, along with UND's EERC, to retrofit the Milton R. Young Station with carbon capture technology.
