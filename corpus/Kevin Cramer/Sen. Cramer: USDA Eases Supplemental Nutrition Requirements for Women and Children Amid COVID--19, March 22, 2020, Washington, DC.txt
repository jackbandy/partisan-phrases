Sen. Cramer: USDA Eases Supplemental Nutrition Requirements for Women and Children Amid COVID--19


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) announced temporary changes made for North Dakota and Standing Rock citizens by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Service (FNCS) to the Special Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program in response to the Coronavirus (COVID--19) pandemic.

"Thanks to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue quickly implementing requirements in the Phase Two legislation we passed, women and children relying on this program won't have to risk their health to receive assistance," said Senator Cramer. "I encourage North Dakotans to follow CDC guidance and to use all assistance programs available to them."

As mandated by H.R. 6201, FNCS waived the physical presence requirements in the WIC program through May 30, 2020. The waiver includes the ability to defer anthropometric and bloodwork requirements necessary to determine nutritional risk for the period the physical presence waiver is in effect. H.R. 6201 is the "Phase Two" legislation passed by Congress last week as part of the federal response efforts to the COVID--19 pandemic.

The WIC program provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age five who are found to be at nutritional risk.
