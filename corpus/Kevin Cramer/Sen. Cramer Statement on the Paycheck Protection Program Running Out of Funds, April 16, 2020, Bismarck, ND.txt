Sen. Cramer Statement on the Paycheck Protection Program Running Out of Funds


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on the Paycheck Protection Program running out of funds today:

"The blame lies at the feet of Democrats who would rather exploit a crisis to advance their extreme partisan agenda than fund a wildly popular program they helped create. I urge them to stop their reckless behavior and support a clean appropriation for the Paycheck Protection Program."

The Paycheck Protection Program was created as part of the Phase Three COVID--19 relief package known as the CARES Act. It offers small businesses forgivable loans to continue paying employee-related expenses in order to retain those workers during the pandemic. While other parts of the CARES Act are still properly funded, the Paycheck Protection Program is already in need of further assistance.

Senator Cramer called for additional funding for it yesterday on Fox News.
