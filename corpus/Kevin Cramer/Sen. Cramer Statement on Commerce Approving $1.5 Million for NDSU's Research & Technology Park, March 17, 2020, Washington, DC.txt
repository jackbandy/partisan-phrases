Sen. Cramer Statement on Commerce Approving $1.5 Million for NDSU's Research & Technology Park


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announcing a $1.5 million grant for the North Dakota State University (NDSU) Research & Technology Park today:

"President Trump and his Administration give North Dakota unprecedented access and attention, and an investment in protecting the region now while empowering the next generation is a prime example of that. These funds will help diversify the area's economy and increase entrepreneurial activity, and I thank President Trump, Secretary Ross, and Assistant Secretary Fleming for recognizing our region's great potential."

This grant comes from the Economic Development Administration (EDA), an agency within the Commerce Department. The grant will assist NDSU in purchasing equipment for a newly retrofitted makerspace which supports students and local entrepreneurs in a disaster-impacted region. It will be matched with $500,000 in local funds and is expected to help create 180 jobs.
