Sen. Cramer Statement on Senate Democrats Blocking Small Business Assistance: 'It's Disgraceful'


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on Senate Democrats blocking additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program today:

"Here we go again. Lest they let the country forget about their disgraceful acts just weeks ago, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats are once again holding help hostage and exploiting the COVID--19 pandemic to advance House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's extreme, left-wing "vision.' It's disgraceful. American small businesses, their employees, and their consumers need this assistance now. It's time for Senate Democrats to stop pandering to the far left and step up to the plate to get the job done."

The Paycheck Protection Program was created as part of the Phase Three COVID--19 relief package known as the CARES Act. It offers small businesses forgivable loans to continue paying employee-related expenses in order to retain those workers during the pandemic. While other parts of the CARES Act are still properly funded, the Paycheck Protection Program is already in need of further assistance, which Senate Democrats just blocked.
