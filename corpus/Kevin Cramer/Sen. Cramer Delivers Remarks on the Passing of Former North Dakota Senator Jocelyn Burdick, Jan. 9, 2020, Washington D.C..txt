Sen. Cramer Delivers Remarks on the Passing of Former North Dakota Senator Jocelyn Burdick


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) delivered remarks on the U.S. Senate floor today honoring former North Dakota Senator Jocelyn Burdick, who passed away on Christmas Eve.

"Throughout her life, Jocelyn embraced her place in public life with grace, dignity, and class," said Senator Cramer. "She demonstrated by example how people can be principled in their beliefs; yet still be friendly, cordial, even affectionate with those of differing political views."

Jocelyn Burdick served in the Senate for three months in 1992 to fill the vacancy created by the death of her husband, longtime North Dakota Senator Quentin Burdick. Senator Cramer uses the same desk both Quentin and Jocelyn Burdick used while serving in the Senate.
