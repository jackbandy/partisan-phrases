Sen. Cramer Statement on Democrats Again Refusing to Advance the COVID--19 Phase Three Relief Package


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on Senate Democrats once again voting against debating the bipartisan Phase Three Coronavirus (COVID--19) relief package today:

"Senator Schumer and his Democrat colleagues were given a second chance to begin considering the package we put together in a bipartisan fashion. Yet again, they all decided to prioritize Speaker Pelosi's partisan wish list above the lives and wellbeing of the American people. These actions are more reflective of petulant children than Senators whose constituents are looking to them for help. Enough is enough. It's time for them to grow up and do their jobs."
