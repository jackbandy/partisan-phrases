ND Congressional Delegation Supports North Dakota's Request for Presidential Disaster Declaration


Senators John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer and Congressman Kelly Armstrong today issued the following statement in support of Governor Doug Burgum's request for a major presidential disaster declaration for the period of March 2 to April 25 for 21 counties due to spring flooding in North Dakota:

"We support Governor Burgum's request for a presidential disaster declaration and urge President Trump to approve it quickly," said the delegation. "As our nation battles COVID-19, North Dakotans are also dealing with rising waters and the damages of spring flooding. A presidential disaster declaration would unlock important federal resources under the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to help our state rebuild and recover."
