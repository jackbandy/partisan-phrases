Sen. Cramer Statement on President Trump Cutting US Ties with the WHO


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on President Donald J. Trump announcing the United States will terminate its relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO):

"I will always stand with a President who puts the American people ahead of communist sympathizers. The United States disproportionately subsidizes the WHO, which in turn promulgates false Chinese propaganda instead of sharing the truth about the COVID-19 pandemic. I am glad our taxpayer dollars will now be used for other global health efforts."
