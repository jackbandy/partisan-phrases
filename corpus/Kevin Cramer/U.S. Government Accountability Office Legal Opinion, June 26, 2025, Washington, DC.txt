Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land           Management--Applicability of the Congressional Review Act           to North Dakota Field Office Record of Decision and           Approved Resource Management Plan      File: B-337175      Date: June 25, 2025                                    DIGEST

The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land       Management (BLM) issued the North Dakota Field Office Record       of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan (North       Dakota RMP). The North Dakota RMP replaced the 1988 North       Dakota Resource Management Plan and provides directives and       guidance for the management of BLM-administered lands across       North Dakota.

The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires that before a       rule can take effect, an agency must submit the rule to both       the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as the       Comptroller General. CRA adopts the definition of ``rule''       under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) but excludes       certain categories of rules from coverage. We conclude that       the North Dakota RMP meets the APA definition of a rule, and       no CRA exception applies. Therefore, the North Dakota RMP is       a rule subject to CRA's submission requirements.                                   DECISION

On January 14, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Interior       (Interior), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), issued the North       Dakota Field Office Record of Decision and Approved Resource       Management Plan (North Dakota RMP).\1\ We received a request       for a decision as to whether the North Dakota RMP is a rule       for purposes of the Congressional Review Act (CRA).\2\ As       discussed below, we conclude that the North Dakota RMP is a       rule for purposes of CRA.

Our practice when issuing decisions is to obtain the legal       views of the relevant agency on the subject of the       request.\3\ Accordingly, we reached out to Interior to obtain       the agency's views.\4\ We received Interior's response on       April 18, 2025.\5\                                  BACKGROUND       BLM Public Land Management

Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976,       as amended (FLPMA), BLM is responsible for developing,       maintaining, and, when appropriate, revising ``land use plans       which provide by tracts or areas for the use of the public       lands.'' \6\ BLM land use plans, referred to as ``resource       management plans'' (RMPs), establish goals and objectives to       guide future land and resource management actions implemented       by BLM.\7\ Pursuant to FLPMA, BLM established procedures for       the development, revision, and amendment of RMPs.\8\

The objective of resource management planning is to       maximize resource values for the public through a rational,       consistently applied set of regulations and procedures which       promote the concept of multiple use management.\9\ An RMP       generally establishes land use designations; allowable       resource uses, resource conditions, goals, and objectives;       program constraints and general management practices; areas       to be covered by more specific plans; and other related       information.\10\      North Dakota Resource Management Plan

BLM determined that its 1988 North Dakota RMP needed       revision to address significant changes in resource       conditions, evolving demands for land use, advances in       technology, updated policies and program guidance, and the       availability of new scientific data since the original RMP       was developed in 1988.\11\ On July 28, 2020, BLM issued a       notice in the Federal Register initiating the process to       revise the 1988 North Dakota RMP.\12\

On January 8, 2025, following a comprehensive planning       process, including public scoping and comment, data analysis,       alternative development, environmental review, stakeholder       engagement, and selection of a preferred management approach,       BLM approved the North Dakota RMP through a Record of       Decision (ROD) incorporated into the document.\13\ The ROD       states that it represents the agency's final decision, issued       after completing procedures required by FLPMA, environmental       reviews in accordance with the National Environmental Policy       Act (NEPA), and considering public comments.\14\

The North Dakota RMP provides directives and guidance on       how 58,500 acres of BLM-administered surface land and 4.1       million acres of BLM-administered mineral estate, mostly       split estate, across North Dakota will be used and managed       over the next 20 years.\15\ More specifically, it establishes       various land uses for recreation, motorized vehicles, oil and       gas leasing, renewable energy projects, grazing, wildlife       habitat protection, and cultural preservation.\16\      Congressional Review Act

CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires federal agencies to submit a       report on each new rule to both houses of Congress and to the       Comptroller General for review before a rule can take       effect.\17\ The report must contain a copy of the rule, ``a       concise general statement relating to the rule,'' and the       rule's proposed effective date.\18\ CRA allows Congress to       review and disapprove rules issued by federal agencies for a       period of 60 days using special procedures.\19\ If a       resolution of disapproval is enacted, then the new rule has       no force or effect.\20\

CRA adopts the definition of ``rule'' under the       Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which states that a rule       is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or       particular applicability and future effect designed to       implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or       describing the organization, procedure, or practice       requirements of an agency.'' \21\ However, CRA excludes three       categories of rules from coverage: (1) rules of particular       applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or       personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or       obligations of non-agency parties.\22\

Interior did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the       Comptroller General on the North Dakota RMP.\23\ In its       response to us, Interior provided additional       information about the North Dakota RMP but did not       state a position as to whether it is a rule under CRA.\24\                                  DISCUSSION

To determine whether the North Dakota RMP is a rule subject       to review under CRA, we first address whether it meets the       APA definition of a rule. As explained below, we conclude       that it does. We then consider whether the North Dakota RMP       falls within any CRA exceptions. We conclude that it does       not. As such, the North Dakota RMP is subject to review under       CRA.      The North Dakota RMP is a Rule Under APA

Applying APA's definition of rule, the North Dakota RMP       meets all of the required elements. First, the North Dakota       RMP is an agency statement as it was issued by BLM, a federal       agency.\25\

Second, the rule is of future effect as it is to be used to       guide the use of the public land for the next 20 years.\26\       Decisions made in the North Dakota RMP became effective on       January 8, 2025, when the Record of Decision was signed.\27\       As of that date, according to BLM, the North Dakota RMP will       guide management of BLM-managed public lands in the planning       area for the next 15 to 20 years for the benefit of current       and future generations.\28\ Therefore, the North Dakota RMP       has future effect.

Finally, the North Dakota RMP implements, interprets, or       prescribes law or policy, because it designates areas of BLM-      administered land for certain purposes in accordance with       BLM's responsibilities for land use management under FLPMA.       The North Dakota RMP establishes a broad framework for land       use management, governing approximately 58,500 acres of BLM-      administered surface land and 4.1 million subsurface acres of       BLM-managed land and minerals across North Dakota.\29\       Specifically, it designates various land uses for the public,       including recreation, motorized vehicle access, oil and gas       leasing, renewable energy development, grazing, wildlife       habitat conservation, and cultural preservation.\30\

Our conclusion here is consistent with our previous       decisions finding that similar land use plans and RMPs       implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\31\ For       instance, in B-238859, Oct. 23, 2017, we found that an       amendment to the Forest Service's Tongass Land and Resource       Management Plan (Tongass Amendment) implemented law by       establishing new criteria for the sale of timber to non-      agency parties. We explained that with the Tongass Amendment,       the Forest Service set forth its policy for timber sales and       thus implemented its statutory responsibility under the       National Forest Management Act.\32\

Similarly in B-329065, Nov. 15, 2017, we concluded that       four RMPs issued by BLM prescribed policy by establishing       available uses for the areas that each RMP covered. We noted       that each RMP implemented provisions of FLPMA and other       applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.\33\ The same       can be said for the North Dakota RMP as issue here. The North       Dakota RMP implements FLPMA and prescribes policy by       designating or foreclosing specific activities or land use on       BLM-administer land. As such, the North Dakota RMP meets the       third element of APA's definition of a rule. Having satisfied       all the required elements, the North Dakota RMP meets the APA       definition of rule.      CRA Exceptions

We must next determine whether any of CRA's three       exceptions apply. CRA provides for three types of rules that       are not subject to its requirements: (1) rules of particular       applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or       personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or       obligations of non-agency parties.\34\      (1) Rule of Particular Applicability

Consistent with our previous decisions, the North Dakota       RMP is a rule of general applicability, rather than       particular applicability. In B-238859, Oct. 23, 2017, the       Forest Service proffered that its Tongass Amendment was a       rule of particular applicability because it applied to a       single national forest. We disagreed, noting that the Tongass       Amendment governed all natural resource management       activities, all projects approved to take place, and all       persons or entities using the forest. As such, it was a rule       of general applicability.\35\ Likewise, the North Dakota RMP       establishes land use designations that govern all activities       conducted by any person or entity on BLM-administered land       and subsurface estate managed by the North Dakota Field       Office, making it a rule of general applicability.      (2) Rule of Agency Management or Personnel

The North Dakota RMP is not a rule of agency management or       personnel. We have previously held that rules that fall into       this category relate to purely internal agency matters.\36\       Because the North Dakota RMP is concerned with public use of       the areas it governs rather than management of BLM itself or       its personnel, it does not meet CRA's second exception.      (3) Rule of Agency Organization, Procedure, or Practice That           does not Substantially Affect Non-Agency Parties

Lastly, the North Dakota RMP is not a rule of agency       organization, procedure, or practice that does not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties.\37\

We have previously explained that this exception was       modeled on the APA exception to notice-and-comment rulemaking       requirements for ``rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice[.]'' \38\ The purpose of the APA exception is to       ensure ``that agencies retain latitude in organizing their       internal operations,'' so long as such rules do not have a       substantial impact on non-agency parties.\39\

Following this interpretation in the CRA context, we have       only applied CRA's third exception to rules that primarily       focus on the internal operations of an agency.\40\ For       instance, in B-329926, Sept. 10, 2018, we found that updates       to a Social Security Administration (SSA) hearing manual       governing SSA adjudicators' use of information from the       internet qualified as a rule of agency organization,       procedure, or practice. There, the manual outlined procedures       for SSA employees to follow in processing and adjudicating       benefits claims. Because the manual was directed to and       binding only on SSA officials without imposing new burdens on       claimants, we concluded that the manual met CRA's third       exception.\41\

In contrast, rules that are directed at and primarily       concerned with the behavior of non-agency parties do not fall       within this category.\42\ Thus, in B-274505, Sept. 16, 1996,       we declined to apply CRA's third exception to a Forest       Service memorandum on the Emergency Salvage Timber Sale       Program, because it was not limited to the Forest Service's       methods of operations. Instead, the memorandum established       the standards by which program determinations would be made,       thus directly affecting the area for and number of timber       sales that would result in contracts. In essence the       memorandum went beyond how the Forest Service organized its       internal operations.\43\ Similarly, in B-238859, Oct. 23,       2017, we declined to apply CRA's third exception to the       Tongass Amendment, because it was directed at land and       resource use by non-agency parties.\44\

Here, the North Dakota RMP does entail some changes to       agency procedure as it introduces new internal directives,       practices, and procedures necessary to carry out these       policies.\45\ However, like the Forest Service memorandum in       B-274505 and the Tongass Amendment in B-238859, the North       Dakota RMP is not limited to changes in internal agency       operations. Instead, the North Dakota RMP is directed at, and       concerns itself primarily with, the behavior of non-agency       parties. Therefore, the North Dakota RMP does not qualify as       a rule of agency organization, procedure or practice.

We must also consider whether the North Dakota RMP       substantially affects the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties.\46\ When analyzing this aspect of CRA's third       exception, ``the critical question is whether the agency       action alters the rights or interests of the regulated       entities.'' \47\ Along similar lines, courts have determined       that ``[a]n agency rule that modifies substantive rights and       interests can only be nominally procedural, and the exemption       for such rules of agency procedure cannot apply.'' \48\

In previous decisions, we have consistently concluded that       where an RMP designates use by non-agency parties in the       areas it governs, it has a substantial effect.\49\ For       instance, in B-275178, July 3, 1997, we reached this       conclusion by noting that the Forest Service's RMP provided a       ``management prescription'' giving general direction on what       may occur within an area allocated to a particular land use       designation. Similarly, in B-329065, Nov. 15, 2017, we       concluded that four BLM RMPs had a substantial effect on non-      agency parties where the plans limited the use of public land       and prohibited mining and operation of off-highway vehicles       in the areas they governed.

Consistent with our caselaw on other RMPs, the North Dakota       RMP has a substantial effect on non-agency parties.       Specifically, it governs when and where the public may engage       in activities such as recreation, motorized vehicle use, oil       and gas leasing, renewable energy development, and grazing,       thereby altering their substantive rights and obligations.       Accordingly, the North Dakota RMP fails to meet CRA's third       exception.                                  CONCLUSION

The North Dakota RMP is a rule for purposes of CRA because       it meets the definition of a rule under APA and no CRA       exception applies. Therefore, the North Dakota RMP is subject       to CRA's requirement that it be submitted to Congress and the       Comptroller General before it can take effect.
