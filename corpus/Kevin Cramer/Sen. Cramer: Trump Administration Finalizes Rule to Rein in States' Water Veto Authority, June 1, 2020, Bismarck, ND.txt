Sen. Cramer: Trump Administration Finalizes Rule to Rein in States' Water Veto Authority


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Water, issued the following statement on the Trump Administration finalizing its rule to rein in states' water veto authority:

"Just as we expect the federal government to stay within the confines of the law, states must do the same. States like Washington and New York have abused their authority, using the Clean Water Act as an excuse to disrupt interstate commerce and weaken energy producing states to try to score cheap political points. With this finalized rule, EPA Administrator Wheeler and the Trump Administration are working to protect American energy from partisan games, and I thank them for listening to North Dakotans throughout this process."

After an Executive Order from President Trump on energy infrastructure, the Trump Administration last August proposed the rule it finalized today.

Senator Cramer worked with the Administration to garner support for this rule, which North Dakota leaders like Governor Doug Burgum praised after it was proposed.

"This action to streamline the permitting of essential energy infrastructure promotes overall U.S. energy dominance, allowing us to sell energy to our friends and allies versus buying it from foreign sources," said Governor Burgum. "We thank the EPA and Trump administration for supporting responsible energy development that protects our environment, creates jobs and grows our economy."

Prior to the rule, Senator Cramer with Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Steve Daines (R-MT), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Mike Enzi (R-WY) introduced legislation to place procedural guardrails and requirements on states as they process requests for certification to prevent future abuses.
