Sen. Cramer Statement on the Defense Cuts in the Administration's 2021 Budget Proposal


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a member of the Senate Armed Services and Senate Budget committees, issued the following statement on defense cuts in the Trump Administration's 2021 Budget proposal:

"Each year the President delivers his budget proposal, then Congress gets to work on its own. The Administration's 2021 Budget contains several provisions I do not agree with. This includes cuts to intelligence gathering resources for our military, which protect our troops and global interests. I believe taking these assets off the battlefield and out of the hands of North Dakota's Airmen will create too much risk and hurt our national security. Through the Congressional budget process, I'll fight to ensure the needs of our military leaders are heard, properly addressed, and adequately funded."
