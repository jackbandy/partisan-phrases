Sen. Cramer Statement on President Trump's 2020 State of the Union Address


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement after President Donald J. Trump's 2020 State of the Union Address:

"President Trump delivered a strong State of the Union address with an optimistic outlook for our country and a compelling case for continuing the policies which have led to this Great American Comeback. Whether through tax reform, trade deals, deregulation, a secured border, a rebuilt military, or America's energy revolution, the President's record of delivering real results for the American people cannot be denied. Now it's time to put division aside, work with President Trump, and renew our focus on tackling unifying issues like infrastructure, education, and high prescription drug costs."
