Sen. Cramer Statement on President Trump Ordering Strategic Petroleum Reserve Purchases; Senator Lays Out Recommended Next Steps


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement today regarding President Trump ordering the Energy Department to purchase United States crude oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) after Russia and Saudi Arabia caused significant disruptions to the energy market:

"This is an important first step, and I am confident Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette will carry it out well."

Senator Cramer laid out his recommendation for what next steps should be taken in the oil market in order to prevent further pain.

"We must statutorily delay SPR sales. After President Trump's order, the Energy Department delayed a planned sale of SPR oil, but any further delay requires Congressional action. I believe this is necessary and logical, and Congress should act quickly.

"As we address the SPR, our leaders should reevaluate United States oil import levels from countries involved in market disputes. I believe these are commonsense steps we ought to take if we are going to see positive changes."
