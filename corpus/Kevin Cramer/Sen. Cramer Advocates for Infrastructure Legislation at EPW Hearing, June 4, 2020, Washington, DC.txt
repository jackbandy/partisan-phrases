Sen. Cramer Advocates for Infrastructure Legislation at EPW Hearing


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) continued his push for infrastructure legislation at a Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee hearing today. The hearing, entitled "Infrastructure: The Road to Recovery," focused on America's Transportation Infrastructure Act, a bipartisan highway bill EPW passed through committee last July.

"I've been a strong advocate for including infrastructure legislation as part of the economic recovery efforts for COVID-19," said Senator Cramer. "Infrastructure is a responsibility of the federal government. Investing in it would create immediate stimulus and bolster the profitability of businesses who need our roads and bridges to effectively move their product."

Senator Cramer spoke with Douglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum, about why the federal government should follow North Dakota's model of choosing infrastructure as a long-term investment. Senator Cramer advocated for this approach in a Fox News op-ed at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
