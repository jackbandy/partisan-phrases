Sen. Cramer Statement on the Senate Passing a Short-Term Reauthorization of FISA


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement after the Senate passed a short-term reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) today:

"This is the right call by Senate leadership. The House gave us six days to consider a three-year reauthorization with no time to debate alternative approaches. From what we have seen, their rushed plan is insufficient for protecting the Constitutional rights of American citizens and does not properly address the underlying inappropriate behavior of career bureaucrats who abused the system during the last election. Senate Republicans are in the majority. We don't have to accept mediocrity. Passing this short-term extension allows us to focus on addressing the coronavirus outbreak now while giving this important issue the time and attention it deserves. I hope the House passes it quickly."
