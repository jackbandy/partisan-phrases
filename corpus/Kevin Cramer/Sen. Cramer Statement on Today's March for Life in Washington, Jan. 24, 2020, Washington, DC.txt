Sen. Cramer Statement on Today's March for Life in Washington, D.C.


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on today's March for Life on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.:

"To all who march today, thank you. Thank you for every sacrifice you made in order to march for the most important issue of our day. Thank you for giving your time and for braving the cold to stand as a voice for the voiceless and to hear from one of the most pro-life leaders in our nation's history, President Trump. Do not worry when the national liberal media writes you off and says you can't make a difference. They wrote him off too."
