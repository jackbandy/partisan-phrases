Sen. Cramer Statement on Leader McConnell Introducing the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introducing the ""Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act" today:

"Well done to Leader McConnell and Senate Republican chairmen. Phase Three is moving at warp speed, as it should. Now is not the time for slow walking or procedural purity. Today's plan aims to stabilize the economy, help the American people with their finances, provide relief for small businesses and their employees, and continue supporting our health care workers. I am sure these are goals shared by our Democratic colleagues, and I urge them to take their seat at the table to get this done in a quick, bipartisan fashion and move on to Phase Four."
