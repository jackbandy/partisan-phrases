Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Issues Decision to Vacate the Registrations of Three Dicamba Herbicides

"As Commissioner Doug Goehring said, this ruling could not have come at a worse time. The Ninth Circuit's decision presents a significant challenge for North Dakota's soybean producers who may have already put seed in the ground with the expectation of using these tools. Our producers are already struggling due to adverse conditions in farm country. We are closely monitoring the situation and working with North Dakota's leaders and our partners in Congress, the Administration, and the agricultural community to find solutions."
