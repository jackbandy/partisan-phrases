Sen. Cramer Statement on Passage of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement after the Senate passed H.R. 6201, the "Families First Coronavirus Response Act": 

"Negotiated by President Trump and House Democrats, this bill gives immediate and vital relief for American workers and small businesses who are suffering and unsure of what the future holds. It also provides flexibility for the Administration to direct assistance where it's needed most. This legislation is an important step, and its passage is a necessity for the American people. Several of my colleagues have offered good amendments to this bill and excellent ideas to help mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus. However, we cannot let perfect be the enemy of the good."
