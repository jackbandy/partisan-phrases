Sen. Cramer Statement on the Trump Administration Proposing Modernized NEPA Regulations


U.S. Senator and Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee member Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement regarding President Donald J. Trump announcing the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has released its proposed rule to update National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations:

"Thank you to President Trump and Administration leaders for taking another step to increase government efficiency and decrease bureaucratic delay. Since it became law over 40 years ago, the NEPA process has grown increasingly complicated and unnecessarily burdensome. I urge our stakeholders and all interested citizens to engage in the rulemaking process to make sure NEPA is modernized in a way that works for the American people."
