Sen. Cramer: President Trump Signs Additional CARES Act Funding into Law


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on President Donald Trump signing the Paycheck Protection Program Increase Act today, which increases funding for small business programs, COVID-19 testing, and health care providers:

"Another hard fought, unnecessary fight concludes with the passage and signing of this latest relief package. The Paycheck Protection Program Increase Act is another step toward economic recovery, with a focus on refilling small business programs like the Paycheck Protection Program and further assisting our health care providers. I thank President Trump for his support and for signing this quickly despite the delays by Democrats. I am glad we were able to fend off their efforts and get this done."

President Trump signed this legislation after the House of Representatives passed it yesterday. The Senate crafted this bill and advanced it on Tuesday.
