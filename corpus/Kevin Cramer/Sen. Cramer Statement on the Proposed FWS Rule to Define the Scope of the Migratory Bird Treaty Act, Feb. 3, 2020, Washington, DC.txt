Sen. Cramer Statement on the Proposed FWS Rule to Define the Scope of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act


U.S. Senator and Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Subcommittee on Fishers, Water, and Wildlife Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement regarding the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (FWS) proposed rule to define the scope of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA):

"Thank you to Secretary Bernhardt and Director Skipwith for proposing a rule to provide regulatory certainty and rein in bureaucratic abuse. Under the Obama Administration's interpretation of MBTA, anyone could be prosecuted without even making a deliberate effort to kill species protected by the MBTA. Had it not been stopped in court, this interpretation would have had severely negative consequences for North Dakotans. Thankfully, the Trump Administration's proposal limits unnecessary and unrealistic liability. I urge all concerned citizens to offer their input to make sure the final rule works well for them."
