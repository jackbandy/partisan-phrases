Sen. Cramer: CMS Issues Guidance to Ensure States Have Plans to Safely Reopen Nursing Homes


U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma issuing guidance to ensure the safe reopening of nursing homes:

"I am grateful to Administrator Verma for following President Trump's reopening guidelines and creating a path forward for people to visit their loved ones in nursing homes. I trust Governor Burgum to implement this guidance in a way that works best for North Dakota, and I hope we are able to begin reuniting these nursing home residents with their friends and family soon."

Senator Cramer spoke to Administrator Verma on Friday urging her to provide flexibility for nursing home visitation.
