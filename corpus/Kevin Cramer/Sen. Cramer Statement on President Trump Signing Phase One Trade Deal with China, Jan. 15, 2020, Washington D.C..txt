U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement on President Donald J. Trump signing the "Phase One" trade deal with China today:

"This deal is a major victory for the United States and for North Dakota. It includes China committing to purchase $200 billion of American products over two years, with $40 billion for agricultural goods, while also pledging to stop intellectual property theft and currency manipulation. I thank President Trump for fighting tirelessly to deliver trade deals that are good for North Dakota's producers and put American interests first."
