Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure to  rein in President Trump's unlawful boat strikes.

These strikes and Trump's naval blockade represent appalling  violations of international law and Congress' constitutional authority  to authorize the use of military force.

Drug trafficking is a serious offense. Communities across the United  States have seen the devastating impact of addiction. But that does not  give Donald Trump the right to go to war, to deploy military forces  without congressional authority, or to kill anyone against the laws of  war.

Drug trafficking cases should be handled in a courtroom. Listen, the  majority's entire argument that this was so serious it required action  without congressional approval is completely destroyed when the  President himself just pardoned the former Honduran President, who has  been convicted by an American jury for a drug trafficking scheme that  moved about 4\1/2\ billion doses of cocaine into the United States.  Give me a break. It doesn't pass the laugh test.

By the way, if Donald Trump were serious about addressing the opioid  epidemic, he would not have cut Medicaid funding, and he would not have  frozen $8 billion in funding for drug abuse and addiction.

We have seen the disastrous impacts of attempted regime change in  Latin American. The American people do not want another forever war.  Vote ``yes'' on this resolution.
