Epstein Files Transparency Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696817/epstein-files-transparency-act


Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, thousands of girls, children, were abused  by Jeffrey Epstein and his massive and powerful ring of pedophiles and  protectors of pedophiles. We can't say all their names here. We don't  have time. Let's at least bring a few of the courageous survivors and  their names onto the House floor right here as we debate this: Haley  Robson, Jena-Lisa Jones, Michelle Licata, Ashley Rubright, Annie  Farmer, Marina Lacerda, and Rachel Benavidez.

These women have carried a burden that they never should have had to  bear. Today, they demand, we demand, and the American people demand  that we answer their clarion call to justice.  Today, despite all the giant coverup attempts by this administration  and this Speaker of the House, we will vote to release all the Epstein  files.

To be clear, there is no protection for pedophiles, no protection for  the rich and powerful men of either party who participated, who turned  a blind eye, and who winked and grinned while witnessing the horrific  abuses of young children. Release all the damn files now.
