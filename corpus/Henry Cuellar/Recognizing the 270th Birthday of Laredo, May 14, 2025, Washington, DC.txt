Recognizing the 270th Birthday of Laredo, Texas


Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a historic milestone  for my hometown--the 270th anniversary of the founding of the City of  Laredo, Texas.

Founded in 1755 along the banks of the Rio Grande, Laredo stands as  one of the oldest communities in our Nation--established even before  the birth of the United States. Originally known as Villa de San  Agustin de Laredo, it was founded by Don Tomas Sanchez de la Barrera.  Nearly three centuries later, we continue to celebrate the enduring  spirit, culture, and resilience that define our community.

Throughout its history, Laredo has flown under seven different flags:  Spain, France, Mexico, the short-lived Republic of the Rio Grande, the  Republic of Texas, the Confederate States of America, and ultimately,  the United States. Each chapter reflects the complex and vibrant story  of a city shaped by shifting borders and strong people.

Today, Laredo and its sister city, Nuevo Laredo, form the Dos  Laredos--creating the largest inland port in both the United States and  Mexico. This dynamic economic engine is a hub for land, rail, and air  cargo, driving billions in trade annually and supporting families  across both nations.

But Laredo is more than just a commercial gateway--it is a cultural  cornerstone. From the Washington's Birthday Celebration, one of the  oldest and largest of its kind in the country, to our strong  educational institutions and proud neighborhoods, Laredo remains rooted  in tradition while embracing innovation and growth.

Mr. Speaker, Laredo is a city of hardworking families, a city rich in  heritage, and a city that stands as a testament to the enduring promise  of the American Dream.

Happy 270th birthday to Laredo. May we continue to thrive for  generations to come.
