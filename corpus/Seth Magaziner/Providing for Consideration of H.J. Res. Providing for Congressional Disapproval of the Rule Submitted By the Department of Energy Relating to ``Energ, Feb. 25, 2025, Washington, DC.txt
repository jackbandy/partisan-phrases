Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to Donald Trump,  Elon Musk, and House Republicans stealing trillions of dollars from the  middle class to fund massive tax cuts for billionaires. Instead of  focusing on the cost of living or making America safer, Republicans are  planning a massive giveaway to the rich, with working people picking up  the tab.

They want $2 trillion in tax cuts for people making more than  $500,000 a year by extending Trump's 2017 tax plan. That is $2 trillion  for people making more than $500,000 a year.

How are they going to pay for it?

By cutting Medicaid.

That is healthcare for 77 million Americans, 80,000 Rhode Islanders,  including seniors, children, and people with disabilities.

Nursing homes and community health centers all across this country  will shut down.

It is not just healthcare. This bill takes money from education,  farmers, and small businesses, all for billionaire tax cuts. These  Republicans are not fighting for the middle class. They are fighting  for Donald and Elon's rich friends at Mar-a-Lago, and the middle class  is paying for it.

I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
