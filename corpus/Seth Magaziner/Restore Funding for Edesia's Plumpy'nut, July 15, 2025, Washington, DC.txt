Restore Funding for Edesia's Plumpy'nut


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693597/restore-funding-for-edesias-plumpynut


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the 28th time to call on  the Trump administration to restore lifesaving food aid for  malnourished children. I see some of my friends and colleagues are here  who perhaps haven't heard this before. I will set aside my prepared  remarks.

This is Plumpy'Nut. It is a peanut paste that is used to treat  children with malnutrition whose organs are no longer able to process  food because they are starving.

Prior to January, the United States of America saved the lives of  millions of children by shipping this peanut paste that is manufactured  here in the United States to children around the world. That program  was halted when funding for USAID was stopped by the Trump  administration.

However, the Trump administration has said repeatedly that they  intend to restore funding for this program. Marco Rubio said it. Elon  Musk said it when he was still running DOGE. They have still yet to do  it.

There are thousands of boxes of this product sitting in warehouses in  Georgia and in Rhode Island. All that we need is for someone in the  administration to sign a piece of paper to get the shipments going  again. Every day that we do not is a day that children are starving.

We are not asking the administration to change their policy. We are  just asking them to deliver on their stated policy. We are asking them  to restore the shipments and to save lives.
