Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, more than any other day I have been in  Congress, the cruelty of the Trump administration and the Republican  majority is on display. They are asking us to rubber-stamp Elon Musk's  cuts to PEPFAR, which saves millions of lives treating people with HIV,  funding for clean water, funding to fight malaria, funding to help  people starving from famine.

Donald Trump and Republicans are doing this at the same time they are  giving trillions of tax cuts to the rich. While they are at it, they  are also cutting educational programming for children, like PBS.

Why are they doing this? It is not to reduce the deficit because this  $9 billion is a fraction of a fraction of the tax cuts they are trying  to pass for billionaires. These are the richest people in the world  taking food and medicine away from the poorest children in the world.

I have news for Elon Musk and Donald Trump and the billionaires: No  matter how much money you have, no matter how many poor people you take  food and medicine away from, it will not fill that hole inside of you.

To my colleagues in the House: History will judge us today. You have  the chance to be heroes. Vote ``no.''
