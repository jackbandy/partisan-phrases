Call for Restoration of Global Emergency Food Aid Funding

Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the third time to call for  funding for global emergency food aid to be restored.

For years, USAID funded the production of ready-to-use therapeutic  foods at Edesia Nutrition in my district. The food that was  manufactured there has been shipped across the developing world, saving  the lives of 25 million  children since 2010, until funding for new orders was halted by the  Trump administration earlier this year.

This is not just about saving lives. This food aid has also  strengthened America's national security and commercial interests. In  the same country where this ready-to-use food has saved the lives of  children, the United States relies on cooperation on a range of issues  from counterterrorism to access to critical minerals.

When the administration pulled back on this food aid, China and our  other adversaries were happy to swoop in to win hearts and minds across  the developing world.

Our Nation is safer and more competitive as a result of our goodwill  toward others.

So I rise the third time to urge the White House and my colleagues in  Congress to restore funding to protect America's global leadership.
