Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, in Rhode Island and all across the  country, people are being crushed by high healthcare costs because  Republicans have refused to extend the Affordable Care Act funding.  People are seeing their premiums go up by thousands of dollars a year,  and many of them are having to make that hard choice to not go with  insurance at all and hope that they won't end up with an emergency room  bill that will bankrupt them.

Meanwhile, President Trump and the Republicans are talking about  buying Greenland. They have the money to buy Greenland but not to help  fund healthcare for the American people. They have the money. Donald  Trump wants to expand the size of the military budget by $500 billion  which he just posted today, but they don't have the money to fund  healthcare for the American people. They have the money for ballrooms  and lavish parties.

Here is an idea. How about we invest in providing relief to the  American people who are being crushed by out-of-control healthcare  costs. We have an opportunity now to do the right thing by the people  who sent us here and to extend this Affordable Care Act funding now  once and for all.
