Edesia Product Still in Warehouse


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the 30th time to call on  the Trump administration to restore lifesaving food aid for starving  children.

When children are starving, their organs shut down. At a certain  point, they are not able to eat traditional food anymore. Ready-to-use  therapeutic food is the only chance they have to survive and to get  back to health.

Right now in Rhode Island, there are 87,000 boxes of ready-to-use  therapeutic foods, already bought and paid for, but sitting in a  warehouse because the Trump administration has frozen this aid.

It is time for the administration to honor the will of Congress, to  honor its own commitment, and to do the right thing and get this food  to the kids around the world who need it. I will keep speaking out  every day until they do.
