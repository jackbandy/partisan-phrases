Gulf of America Act

Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, we are here today debating and wasting  time on a ridiculous bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico when the  American people want us to be focused on real issues that impact their  lives.

Prices are still too high. Donald Trump's tariffs are making it  worse. The stock market is tanking. People are losing their savings,  and in the midst of all this, the Republican majority isn't focused on  trying to solve the problems that everyday people care about. Instead,  they are focused on stroking the ego of one man, Donald Trump, the man  who they would make king.

We are wasting time today, an entire legislative day where this is  the only bill that is being debated, so that our Republican colleagues  can get up and show their fealty to Donald Trump instead of the voters  who elected us who expect us to be focused on them.

Another reason that Republicans are wasting time on this bill--which,  by the way, 70 percent of the American people oppose--is because they  want to distract us from what else they are trying to do. They are  working on a bill right now that would give trillions of dollars of tax  cuts to billionaires like Elon Musk by cutting healthcare for working  people. They don't want to talk about that. That part they only talk  about behind closed doors while they distract the media, the American  people, and their own Members with this nonsense bill about the Gulf of  Mexico.

Mr. Speaker, the American people are smarter than this. They are  smarter than our Republican colleagues give them credit for. Seventy  percent of the American people reject this nonsense bill, and this  Congress should as well.
