Calling on Trump Administration to Restore Lifesaving Food Aid

Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the 26th time to call on  the Trump administration to honor its word and restore funding for  lifesaving food aid around the world.

Mr. Speaker, the words from the Trump administration have been pretty  good on this. Elon Musk said that funding for emergency food aid will  be restored. Marco Rubio has repeatedly said he was going to do it.  They even got FOX News to write a glowing online article about their  plans to restore funding.

Yet, it has been 6 months since they cut this funding off. It has  been 6 months, and every day that they wait is another day that  children die of starvation unnecessarily.

Every day, there are children whose organs are shutting down, who are  unable to eat conventional food, and who can only have their lives  saved by ready-to-use therapeutic food manufactured in the United  States.

Every day, the clock is ticking. The administration needs to do what  it said it is going to do: restore funding for this aid. I will  continue to stand on this floor every day until they do.
