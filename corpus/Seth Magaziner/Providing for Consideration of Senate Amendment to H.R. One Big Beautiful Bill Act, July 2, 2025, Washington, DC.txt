Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, when we say that the Republican Party has  turned into a cult, this is what we mean. Our Republican colleagues are  pushing a bill that would throw their constituents under the bus, a  bill that flies in the face of everything they claim to stand for, all  because Donald Trump wants a bill-signing photo op by the Fourth of  July.

My Republican colleagues know that this bill will cost 17 million  Americans their health insurance. They know that nursing homes in their  own districts will have to close down. They know that, under this bill,  $5 trillion of debt is being added that will be paid for by my  children, your children, and their children for generations to come so  that today's billionaires can get a tax break.

They know that this bill is unpopular. Many of their vulnerable  Members will lose reelection over it, but the cult leader has decided.  He wants his photo op on July Fourth, and our Kool-Aid-drinking  colleagues are going along with it.

They know this is wrong. They still have a chance to do right by  their constituents and their convictions.

Vote ``no'' on this bill.
