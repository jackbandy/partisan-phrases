Impact of Volatility and Policy Reversals

Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the seventh time to call  on the Trump administration to restore funding for lifesaving food aid  for malnourished children.

Rhode Island's Edesia Nutrition has helped save 25 million lives with  this ready-to-use therapeutic food manufactured in North Kingstown,  Rhode Island, supported by USAID. Yet, that work is now in jeopardy.  Trump is now 3 months into his administration, and funding is still cut  off, throwing Edesia's operations into chaos.

Mr. Speaker, I have already spoken on this floor about the gut- wrenching impact to children around the world who are suffering from  starvation, but I will talk today about the impact on American lives  that this funding freeze is wreaking.

Edesia has had to lay off staff at the factory and is unable to make  long-term decisions. American farmers, factory workers, and  transportation workers who produce this product have had their lives  thrown into disarray. Every day of uncertainty puts more children's  lives at risk and costs American workers their livelihoods.

Mr. Speaker, I will speak on this floor every single day until  funding for ready-to-use therapeutic food is restored.
