2025 Economic Report and Manufacturing Jobs


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1699065/2025-economic-report-and-manufacturing-jobs


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, 2025 was one of the worst years for job  growth in decades. In fact, if you don't count COVID, the United States  created fewer jobs last year than any year since 2009. You don't need  data. Just ask anyone who has been looking for a job. They will tell  you no one is hiring.

This weak economy is a direct result of President Trump's policies:  the crazy tariffs that are raising costs for businesses and consumers,  massive cuts to healthcare, and the political attacks on clean energy  that are driving up energy costs.

The President claimed that his tariffs would help American  manufacturing, but instead we have lost 72,000 manufacturing jobs since  Liberation Day, after years of gains.

What is the President focused on as working people struggle? He is  focused on building himself a new ballroom, naming the Kennedy Center  after himself, trying to take over Greenland, and selling  cryptocurrency out of the White House to enrich himself. None of this  creates jobs or lower costs for you or the millions of Americans who  are struggling. It is time for the President to focus on the real needs  of the American people.
