Relating to A National Emergency By the President on February 2025


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, President Trump's tariffs are raising  costs on working people. Just like everything else that Donald Trump  does, his tariffs are all about helping himself and his rich friends at  the expense of everyday people.

The Big Tech companies and the Big Oil companies have been donating  millions of dollars to Trump's ballroom and lavishing him with gifts  like a golden iPhone.

Wouldn't you know it, Mr. Speaker, he exempted them from the tariffs.

Who is not exempt?

They are the small businesses, the farmers, the restaurants, and the  small manufacturers who can't afford to go to Mar-a-Lago to ask for  special deals. They are the builders who are paying thousands of  dollars more for materials to build new homes, and they are everyday  people who are stuck with higher costs, working themselves to the bone  and who can't keep up with their bills.

In Donald Trump's America, the rich and connected are always taken  care of, and everyone else struggles.

For what, Mr. Speaker?

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' report that came out  today, we lost more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year.

End these tariffs. Stop this madness, and lower costs for working  people.
