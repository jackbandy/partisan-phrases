Lifesaving Foreign Aid


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692117/lifesaving-foreign-aid


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the 17th time to demand  that the Trump administration deliver on its promise to restore funding  for lifesaving food aid.

This so-called pause on lifesaving food aid is unnecessary and  unconscionable.

``Anybody who tells you that we can slash foreign aid and that will  bring us to balance is lying to you.'' Foreign aid is less than 1  percent of our budget. That is a quote from Marco Rubio before he  worked for Donald Trump. This is not how we solve our budget problem. A  fraction of a fraction of a percent of the Federal budget goes to  lifesaving global food aid.

The Trump administration has said they will restore it. They need to  follow their own words and do so immediately before more lives are  lost.

I will keep speaking on this floor every day until they do.
