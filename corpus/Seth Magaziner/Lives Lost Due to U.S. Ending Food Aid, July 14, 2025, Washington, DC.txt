Lives Lost Due to U.S. Ending Food Aid

Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the 27th time to call on  the Trump administration to restore funding for lifesaving food aid for  malnourished children.

According to data compiled by Boston University, more than 70,000  children--children--have died this year because the Trump  administration has frozen food aid that had been delivered by this  country for years prior. This is the real-time human cost of inaction.

Again, the Trump administration has said that they are going to  restore this aid. They have been saying it for months. Marco Rubio said  it. Elon Musk said it when he was still at the administration. They  haven't done it.

A month ago, they said that they were going to issue an RFP now and  get this aid moving again. The RFP was issued. Nonprofit organizations,  including Edesia Nutrition, have responded to it. The administration  has been sitting on it for a month.

What are they waiting for? Every day that they fail to act is a day  that children die. They need to keep their word. Restore this aid.
