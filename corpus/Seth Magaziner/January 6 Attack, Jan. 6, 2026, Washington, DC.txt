Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, do not let anyone rewrite the history of  what happened on January 6, 2021. A mob tried to overturn a free and  fair election and deny the American people of our God-given right to  choose our own leaders. They attacked police officers with pipes,  rocks, and other weapons. It was domestic terrorism. Let's call it what  it is.

They did it because President Trump lied to them and repeatedly said  that he did not lose the election when he, in fact, did. Democracy only  survives when leaders put the will of the people ahead of their own  selfish ambition and when the rule of law is enforced. We thank the  hundreds of brave police officers who put their lives in harm's way to  defend the Capitol and our democracy.

They know what it means to be patriotic Americans and their courage  stands in sharp contrast to many of the Republican Members of this  Congress who are too cowardly to tell the truth about what really  happened on January 6.

We deserve leaders who stand for the Constitution, stand for our  democracy, not only when it is convenient for them but always. We must  defend American democracy.
