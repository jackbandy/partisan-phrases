Restore Funding for Lifesaving Food Aid

Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the 28th time to call on  the Trump administration to restore lifesaving food aid for  malnourished children.

This program began 70 years ago, an idea from a Kansas farmer, and it  was launched by President Eisenhower. They called it Food for Peace,  and it sent American-grown grain to hungry people around the world. It  has enjoyed bipartisan support from Democrat and Republican Presidents  for 70 years.

This Republican Congress passed a funding bill to continue to fund  the program, but the Trump administration continues to hold up funding.  Every day they do, children are starving and American farmers are not  getting paid.

The crazy part is that the administration has said over and over that  they intend to relaunch the program, but it has been 6 months. What are  they waiting for?

They should do what they say they are going to do, stop delaying, and  stop gaslighting. They should just do it. Every day counts.

I will continue to speak on this floor until they do.
