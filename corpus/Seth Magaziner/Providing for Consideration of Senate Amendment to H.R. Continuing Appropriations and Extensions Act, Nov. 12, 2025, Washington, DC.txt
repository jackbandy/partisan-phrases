Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are back from their 54- day taxpayer-funded vacation. But don't get me wrong, they do know how  to work hard. When billionaires wanted tax breaks, they moved mountains  to make it happen. When Argentina needed a $40 billion bailout to help  Trump's buddy, they moved quickly to make it happen at the White House.

When working people need help, when millions of Americans are seeing  their health insurance costs double and triple and Americans all across  this country are feeling like they are going to have to go without  health insurance for the first time in their lives because they can't  afford it anymore and have to make that terrible decision about which  of their family members they are going to cut off of their insurance,  House Republicans are nowhere to be found.

When Donald Trump's stupid tariffs are raising the price of groceries  and the cost of coffee is up 40 percent over the last year, House  Republicans are silent. When working people need help, they are absent.  Shameful.

They will work when billionaires need tax cuts, when Argentina needs  a bailout, but when working people need relief, they go on a taxpayer- funded vacation. Shameful, Mr. Speaker.

Vote ``no'' on this budget. Do not cut the healthcare of the American  people.
