Restore Funding for Malnourished Children


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the 24th time to demand  that the Trump administration restore funding for lifesaving food aid  for malnourished children.

This is Plumpy'Nut. It is used to treat malnutrition. Until this  Trump administration began, we were shipping Plumpy'Nut around the  world, saving millions of lives a year. Starvation is still the leading  cause of death for children globally.

Before he became Secretary of State, Trump's own Secretary of State,  Marco Rubio, understood the value of food aid. He once said: ``We don't  have to give foreign aid. We do so because it furthers our national  interest.''

He is right. This is not just charity. This is about strengthening  our alliances, bringing stability to fragile regions, and saving lives.

Secretary Rubio needs to do the right thing: Restore this aid  immediately.

This is sitting in warehouses in Rhode Island, here in the United  States. It should be getting to kids who need it, and I will continue  to speak out until it does.
