Restore Lifesaving Food Aid

Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, for the 39th time, to call  on the Trump administration to restore lifesaving food aid for children  around the world.

We are grieving today. We are grieving the lives lost on September  11, 2001. We are grieving the lives of Charlie Kirk and others who have  been victims of political violence and mass shootings.

We don't always have the power in this Chamber to save every life,  but we do have the power to save many lives, including the lives of  children suffering from starvation, lives that are valuable and that  deserve a chance.

The Trump administration cut off this program in January, and they  have been promising to restore it, going so far as to issue RFPs and to  make promises that the program will be restored, but they have not yet  done it.

All it takes is for them to take the simple action of restoring the  Food for Peace program so that kids like this can have a chance.
