Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, while Donald Trump gives billions of  dollars to Argentina and gets rich selling cryptocurrency to criminals  and foreign agents, millions of Americans are facing financial ruin  from rising health insurance costs.

All across the country, Americans are getting letters like this from  their insurance companies telling them how much their premiums are  going up because of the failure of Republicans to extend the Affordable  Care Act tax credits.

Susan, from Foster, Rhode Island, a marketing consultant, is seeing  her insurance go up from $600 a month to $2,100, a 250 percent  increase.

Sarah, a small business owner from Cranston, is seeing her premiums  go up more than $5,000 a year. Hillary, from Providence, her family of  four is going to be paying $10,600 more next year for the same  insurance.

It is time for President Trump and House Republicans to wake up to  what the American people are experiencing and extend the Affordable  Care Act tax credits now. Stop playing games. Let's save the healthcare  of the American people.
