Lifesaving Food Aid

Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the 43rd time today to call on  the Trump administration to restore lifesaving food aid for starving  children around the world.

Edesia Nutrition, an organization in my district, in North Kingstown,  Rhode Island, manufactures Plumpy'Nut, a nutritional supplement that is  needed to get starving children back to health. When kids are starving,  their organs break down, and they cannot digest conventional food.

Millions of lives have been saved by this product, and now there are  thousands of boxes sitting in a warehouse in Rhode Island because the  Trump administration has stopped this program.

They continue to promise that they are going to bring it back online.  Over and over again, they have said that this program will continue.  They have even named the organization in my district. They have said  that it will continue, but it has been 9 months, and we are still  waiting.

We are about to debate and vote on a budget. What is the purpose of  passing a budget if the administration will just ignore it?

I have spoken on this floor about the humanitarian necessity to  restore this program, the national security necessity to restore this  program, but it is a constitutional necessity as well because the  legislative branch has the authority to pass budgets and the executive  must execute on them.

I will continue to speak on this floor every day until this program  is restored.
