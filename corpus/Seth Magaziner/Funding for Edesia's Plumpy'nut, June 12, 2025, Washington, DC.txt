Funding for Edesia's Plumpy'nut


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692483/funding-for-edesias-plumpynut


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, today the House majority took a shameful  vote to cut billions of dollars of aid that goes to PEPFAR to treat  people around the world with HIV. They cut aid for malaria. They cut  aid for clean water around the world.

Thankfully, this bill did not cut funding for emergency food aid like  Plumpy'Nut. The problem is that even though this funding has not been  cut and it is still available, the Trump administration still continues  to hold up the money instead of getting it to companies like Edesia in  North Kingstown, Rhode Island, who manufacture this food aid to ship it  around the world. We continue to have a now 5-month pause in the  delivery of emergency food aid to starving children.

The Trump administration needs to keep its word to deliver this food  aid. The money is available so that lives can be saved.

This is the 2lst time that I have spoken on the House floor demanding  that the Trump administration restore emergency food aid. I will  continue to speak every legislative day until they do it.
