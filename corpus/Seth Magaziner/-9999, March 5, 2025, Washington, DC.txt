Mr. MAGAZINER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of David DePetrillo, a tireless champion for Rhode Island.

For over three decades as our State's tourism director, David made it  his mission to showcase the best of Rhode Island, including our  historic landmarks, small businesses, and stunning coastlines.

To him, this work wasn't just a job. It was his way of life. He  helped people across the country and the world see what Rhode Islanders  have always known, that there is no place like the Ocean State.

Under his leadership, tourism became a major economic driver,  creating thousands of jobs and boosting local businesses. He is perhaps  best remembered for the iconic ``Biggest Little State in the Union''  campaign, which cemented Rhode Island's place on the map.

David's vision lives on in the bustling streets of Providence and the  welcoming small businesses of South County.

My heart goes out to his wife, Jean, all of his brothers and sisters,  and all who were lucky enough to know and love him.

May his legacy endure, and may he rest in peace.
