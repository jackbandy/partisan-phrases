Biology of Hunger


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the fifth time to bring  attention to the Trump administration's failure to restore funding for  food aid for malnourished children, despite their promise to do so.

I speak today about the biology of hunger. A 2-year-old child may  weigh the same as a newborn. Their bodies stop growing. Their immune  systems shut down. They lose the ability to walk and sometimes even the  ability to cry. That is what severe malnutrition looks like, and it is  the leading cause of death for children under 5.

There is treatment. Ready-to-use therapeutic food is a nutrient-rich  peanut paste that delivers the fat, protein, and vitamins that starving  children need to survive. It can save a child's life in just 8 weeks.

The Edesia factory in Rhode Island has helped save 25 million lives  with this food, but that work is now in jeopardy because the  administration hasn't followed through on its own promises to continue  funding the program.

We must restore funding for emergency food aid now. Lives are at  stake. I will keep speaking on this floor until that funding is  restored.
