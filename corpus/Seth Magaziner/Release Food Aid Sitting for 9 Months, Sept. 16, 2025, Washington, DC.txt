Release Food Aid Sitting for 9 Months

Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise for the 40th time to call  on the Trump administration to restore lifesaving food aid for  malnourished children.

When kids are starving to death, their organs break down. Even if we  are able to feed them conventional food, they cannot digest it. It  takes specialized nutrition to bring them back to health, including the  nutrition manufactured by Edesia Nutrition in North Kingstown, Rhode  Island, in my district, where thousands of boxes of emergency food aid  have been sitting in a warehouse since Donald Trump and Elon Musk froze  the program back in January.

They continue to promise that the program is going to come back  online any day now and that those boxes will be shipped, but it has  been 9 months.

Starving children cannot survive on promises. They cannot survive on  words. They cannot survive on tweets, purchase orders, or RFPs. They  need this food aid to move.

The administration needs to keep its word and act with urgency, and I  will speak on this floor every day until they do.
