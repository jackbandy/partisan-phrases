DC Criminal Reforms to Immediately Make Everyone Safe Act

Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in staunch  opposition to H.R. 4922, the D.C. CRIMES Act. This is not a serious  legislative effort to enhance public safety; it is a blatant political  maneuver to override the local authority of Washington, D.C., and  restrict judges' ability to make individualized sentencing decisions  for young adults. It is a bill that uses the nearly 700,000 residents  of D.C., who pay more federal taxes per capita than any state, as  political pawns.

This bill is a direct assault on the District's local sovereignty. It  would fundamentally alter D.C.'s criminal justice system by reducing  the eligibility age for the Youth Rehabilitation Act (YRA) from 24 to  18. It seeks to eliminate judicial discretion to impose sentences below  mandatory minimums, and would restrict vital alternatives like  probation, community service, and the ability to seal the records of  young adult offenders. This proposal is particularly egregious because  it undermines a program that works. The YRA, which provides a path for  rehabilitation, has been shown to reduce recidivism, thereby supporting  public safety. Individuals who have convictions set aside under the YRA  are significantly less likely to reoffend. Instead of celebrating this  success, H.R. 4922 would dismantle it.

Let us be clear about the hypocrisy of this measure. House  Republicans from 34 states, including Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio,  Alabama, and North Carolina, voted to reduce the eligible age to 18  here in D.C., even though the age in their own home states is 20 or  higher. Supporters of this bill are targeting a program in D.C. that is  similar to laws that exist in their own states. In perhaps the most  glaring example of this double standard, representatives from Utah  voted to lower the age here while their own state sets the age at 25, a  full year older than D.C.'s current law. In those states, such programs  are deemed effective, but here, in the Nation's capital, they are being  singled out for elimination. This double standard exposes this bill for  what it is: an act of political punishment, not a genuine reform.

Real solutions to crime do not come from a ``Super City Council'' in  Congress. They come from empowering local communities and trusting  judges to make thoughtful, individualized decisions. I urge my  colleagues to stand with the residents of D.C. and against this  discriminatory and hypocritical bill. Vote No on H.R. 4922.
