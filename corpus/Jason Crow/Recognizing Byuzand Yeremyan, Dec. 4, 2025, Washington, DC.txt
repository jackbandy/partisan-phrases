Recognizing Byuzand Yeremyan


Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent, Mr.  Byuzand Yeremyan, President of Armenians of Colorado, for his  exceptional dedication and steadfast commitment to our community.

This year marks the tenth anniversary of Mr. Yeremyan's volunteer  service with Armenians of Colorado. Armenians of Colorado is a  nonprofit organization devoted to preserving and promoting Armenian  culture and heritage in our state.

Over the last decade, Mr. Yeremyan has devoted his time and  leadership to the community, including through the establishment of the  Armenian School of Colorado in 2017. Through this initiative, students  learn about Armenian language, literature, history, and culture,  ensuring they continue to be passed down to future generations.

Nourishing younger generations, supporting Armenian Americans in  Colorado, and engaging the broader community are just a few of the ways  Mr. Yeremyan shows up for Coloradans. He also previously served on the  boards of the Lone Tree Arts Center Fund and the U.S. Bank Development  Network, and currently contributes his time and expertise as a board  member of the Coalition Against Global Genocide (COAGG).

I commend Mr. Yeremyan for years of devoted leadership, service, and  commitment to the Armenian community and to the people of Colorado. His  efforts embody the spirit of civic engagement and cultural stewardship.
