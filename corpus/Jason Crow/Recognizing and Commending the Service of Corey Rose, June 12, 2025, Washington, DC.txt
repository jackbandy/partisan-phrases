Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend Corey  Rose for her fifteen years of unwavering dedication and service through  her Wishes & Heroes Benefit Concert. This event has not only been a  beacon of hope but a critical fundraiser for two outstanding  organizations: the Colorado Professional Firefighter Foundation and the  Make-A-Wish Foundation.

For the past fifteen years, Corey has poured her heart and soul into  organizing this annual concert, driven by a deep desire to give back to  her community and support those in need. Her tireless efforts have  brought together artists, volunteers, and supporters from across  Colorado, all united in a common cause.

The Colorado Professional Firefighter Foundation provides vital  support to firefighters and their families, offering assistance in  times of crisis and honoring the sacrifices of these brave men and  women. The Make-A-Wish Foundation grants life-changing wishes to  children with critical illnesses, bringing joy and hope to families  facing immense challenges. Through the Wishes & Heroes Benefit Concert,  Corey has made a tangible difference in the lives of countless  individuals served by these two organizations.

The fifteenth and final Wishes & Heroes Benefit Concert marks the  culmination of an incredible journey. Corey's dedication, passion, and  commitment have left an indelible mark on our community. She has  inspired others to give back and has demonstrated the power of music to  heal, uplift, and unite.

On behalf of the Sixth Congressional District of Colorado, I extend  my gratitude to Corey Rose for her fifteen years of service and her  extraordinary contributions to the Colorado Professional Firefighter  Foundation and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Her work has made a profound  and lasting impact, and she exemplifies the true spirit of community  and compassion.

I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Corey Rose and her  Wishes & Heroes Benefit Concert for their outstanding contributions and  wishing her all the best in her future endeavors.
