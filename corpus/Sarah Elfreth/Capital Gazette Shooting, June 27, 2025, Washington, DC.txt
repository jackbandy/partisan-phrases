Capital Gazette Shooting

Ms. ELFRETH. Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, on June 28, 2018, a gunman who  should never have been able to purchase a firearm, walked into the  Capital Gazette and killed five members of our hometown newspaper:  Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith, and Wendi  Winters.

Amid the shock and horror, just hours after the shooting, the Capital  issued a simple statement: We are putting out a damn paper tomorrow,  and that they did.

These journalists made clear that the fourth estate cannot be  silenced, and they made Maryland damn proud.

On this tragic anniversary, I will make it clear on this House floor  that as elected officials, we were not sent here to look away, to give  up, or to offer our thoughts and prayers alone. That is why I rise  today to remember the journalists we lost, to continue the fight for  full freedom of the press, and for commonsense gun safety legislation  that protects all of our communities.
