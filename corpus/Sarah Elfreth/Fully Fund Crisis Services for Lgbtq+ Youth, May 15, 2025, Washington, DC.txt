Fully Fund Crisis Services for Lgbtq+ Youth

Ms. ELFRETH. Mr. Speaker, the Trevor Project estimates that at least  one LGBTQ+ youth attempts suicide every 45 seconds. That is less time  than my remarks will take today.

Instead of addressing this very real public health crisis that our  Nation's youth face, the Trump administration has issued a budget  proposal that seeks to eliminate funding for specialized crisis  services for LGBTQ+ youth.

The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline has saved countless lives. Mr.  Speaker, when you call that lifeline, you have the option to seek care  via a specialist. Those specialists serve veterans, callers who speak  Spanish, and LGBTQ+ youth.

Mr. Speaker, 1.2 million Americans have selected that last option,  but it might not be an option for much longer.

The service has saved lives and allowed Americans to receive the care  they need on the hardest days of their lives. To me, that is what  public service is all about. It is about being there for folks on their  hardest days.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues and this administration to support  full funding for these lifesaving services.
