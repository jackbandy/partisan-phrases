Filling Firefighter Positions on Military Installations


Ms. ELFRETH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give voice to an issue that  has gone unaddressed for far too long, and it is one this body must  take up before it is too late and lives are lost. We must address the  alarmingly low staffing levels of firefighters on our military  installations.

Recent reports indicate that the military service intends to  eliminate vacant firefighter positions, restrict the use of overtime,  and interpret requirements in a manner that could lead to station  closures.

Let me be clear. While staffing level shortages have been an ongoing  challenge, these new actions, coupled with the continued hiring freeze,  put our servicemembers in harm's way.

It is why Congresswoman Kiggans and I wrote to the Secretaries of the  Army, the Navy, and the Air Force to ensure robust emergency services  that maintain safety and mission readiness across the Force.

Across the DOD, more than 8,800 civilian firefighters respond to  structural fires, aircraft emergencies, hazardous materials incidents,  and other life-threatening events each year.

Mr. Speaker, I cannot think of a more critical and all-American cause  or more of a win-win than having the backs of our fire firefighters and  our servicemembers.
