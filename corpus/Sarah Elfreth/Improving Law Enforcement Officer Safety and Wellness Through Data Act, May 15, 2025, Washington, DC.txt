Ms. ELFRETH. Mr. Speaker, local law enforcement officers bravely and  tirelessly work to protect our communities day in and day out. The  situations that these law enforcement officers encounter put them, as  we all know, at an increased risk of developing mental health  disorders, including PTSD, depression, and anxiety.

This Police Week, I thank the sponsors of the bill, my colleagues  across the aisle, for introducing H.R. 2240, the Improving Law  Enforcement Officer Safety and Wellness Through Data Act.

I did offer an amendment to require that the Department of Justice  include recommendations on improving training programs for domestic  violence cases because far too often our local law enforcement officers  are at the front lines of response to domestic violence cases. These  situations not only need to be handled carefully with specialized  training, but they also take a toll on officers' own well-being.

While this amendment was not made in order, I rise today because I  believe it is essential to address the issues of domestic violence and  the mental health of our officers in a bipartisan manner.

I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle in  addressing this critical need and continuing to address these issues  together.
