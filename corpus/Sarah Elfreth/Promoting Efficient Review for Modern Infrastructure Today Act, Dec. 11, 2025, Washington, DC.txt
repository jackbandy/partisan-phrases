Ms. ELFRETH. Mr. Chair, 2.8 million acres of farmland protected;  35,000 miles of fish passages opened; nearly 1,500 new public water  access sites established; upgrades to every large wastewater treatment  plant in the watershed to improve water quality; and the largest oyster  reef restoration in the world: These are just five of the biggest wins  in the last 43 years of the landmark Chesapeake Bay Watershed  Agreement. In fact, it was just updated last week after years of  careful and difficult negotiation and public input to unite States  across the bay to think bigger and bolder to restore the beloved  watershed we all share.

We know that water does not adhere to arbitrary political boundaries.  Pollution in Pennsylvania will and does flow downstream to Maryland and  Virginia.

All States rely on the EPA to conduct oversight and enforcement of  pollution entering our waterways and to hold everyone accountable to  our shared communities.

Yet, the bill before us today, the PERMIT Act, attempts to dismantle  this partnership between States and the EPA by watering down the key  enforcement mechanisms that are needed to ensure compliance with  evidence-based pollution standards.

I know these bipartisan, multistate partnerships are not easy. I was  a part of them before I joined this Chamber. They take years of  collaboration.

Mr. Chairman, that should be fostered and not dismantled by this and  future Congresses, which is why I urge my colleagues to support this  decades-long partnership by voting ``no'' on this bill.
