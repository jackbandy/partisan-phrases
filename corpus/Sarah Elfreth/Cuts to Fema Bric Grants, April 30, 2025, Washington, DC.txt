Cuts to Fema Bric Grants


Ms. ELFRETH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to this  administration's devastating cuts to FEMA's BRIC program, otherwise  known as the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grants.

Towns like Crisfield in Maryland, Baltimore, and dozens of  communities across this Nation, rely on this funding to ward off the  very real and very devastating effects of flooding.

Not only do these programs save lives, but it is also one of the best  investments that this Federal Government can make in this country,  matching State and local funding. These projects in the long-term save  $6 for every $1 in upfront spending.

Yet, on this Earth Day, and just before we are about to enter  hurricane season, instead of protecting our communities from sea level  rise, the Trump administration ended this program.

When we talk about government cuts to environmental programs, I will  caution that rising seas don't care who is in the White House. The  water doesn't care how a small town that experiences 90 days of  flooding or more a year voted in the last election. Flooding will  continue to devastate communities, even if the President does not  believe in climate change.

That is why I will continue to fight for the reinstatement of these  funds for Crisfield, for Maryland, and for every community affected by  flooding across this country.
