Recognizing the Life of Hugh Nie

Ms. ELFRETH. Mr. Speaker, on May 30, Severna Park and Maryland's  Third Congressional District lost one of our youngest members of our  community, Hugh Nie. Hugh was not even 18 months old when he died of  sudden, unexplained death in childhood, or SUDC.

Hugh's parents, Eddie and Jessica, who are here today, described him  as joy personified. He loved going to the park, circle time at the  library, and getting booped in the nose at bath time.

With his loved ones, Hugh read over 1,000 books and was a dear friend  to our public library system. In Hugh's memory, our community is now  building Hugh's Corner at the Severna Park Library.

Mr. Speaker, there are approximately 400 cases of SUDC in the U.S.  every year. Without a known cause or form of prevention, the NIH  research conducted on SUDC is critical and could be lifesaving.

I urge my colleagues to join in supporting full funding for the NIH's  lifesaving work so that not another family has to experience what the  Nies have endured.
