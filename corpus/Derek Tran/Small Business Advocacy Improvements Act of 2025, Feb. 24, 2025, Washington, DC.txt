Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act of 2025


Mr. TRAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 832, the Small  Business Advocacy Improvements Act.

This bipartisan bill would provide small businesses with improved  access to international markets by expanding the function and duties of  SBA's Office of Advocacy.

In particular, the bill authorizes the office to represent the views  and interests of small businesses in international discussions and  analyze international economic data for the benefit of America's small  business owners.

As the world becomes more and more connected, participating in the  global economy is vital to small businesses' success.

I proudly represent California's 45th Congressional District, an  international hub for America's small businesses. Businesses in my  district connect with diverse companies and international markets every  day and are a dynamic part of the economic engine driving southern  California. Over 90,000 small businesses call Orange County home,  including many in Little Saigon, where exporting and importing goods  and working with partners overseas is an important part of their  success and allows them to grow.

This bill would ensure that small businesses have a strong voice  advocating on their behalf regarding international matters and help us  to better understand how international economies impact our Nation's  small businesses.

I am proud to be a co-lead on this bill, and I thank Chairman  Williams and Ranking Member Velazquez for working together to advance  this bill to the floor, as well as my colleagues Congressman Van Drew  from New Jersey and Congresswoman Goodlander from New Hampshire, for  working with me to improve SBA's Office of Advocacy.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  bipartisan bill.
