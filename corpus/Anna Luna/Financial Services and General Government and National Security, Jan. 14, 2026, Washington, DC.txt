Financial Services and General Government and National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2026


Mrs. LUNA. The National Endowment for Democracy needs to change its  name to the National Endowment for Censorship.

I hear if we defund programs in Pakistan, Congo, and the Ukraine, all  of which--Pakistan has election fraud, Congo has 40,000 child slaves in  cobalt mines, and Ukraine is jailing Christians--then we are simply  despots and part of the problem, but I disagree. In fact, we have proof  that NED actually was a part of deplatforming President Trump, which I  don't think the President would take kindly to Republicans supporting  its efforts, not to mention their head makes close to $500,000 a year.

Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to not vote for this. It is a  farce, it is nonsense, and our tax dollars should not be going toward  it.
