Mrs. LUNA. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.

Mrs. LUNA. Mr. Speaker, I was wondering if the Speaker of the House  of Representatives can explain why leadership on both sides, both  Democrat and Republican, are cutting back-end deals to cover up public  corruption in the House of Representatives for both Republican and  Democrat Members of Congress.

Mrs. LUNA. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much, but I think the American  people know what happened tonight.
