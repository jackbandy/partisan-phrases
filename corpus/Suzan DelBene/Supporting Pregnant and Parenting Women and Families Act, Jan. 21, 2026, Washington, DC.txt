Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act


Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I have heard story after story of people  seeking care from crisis pregnancy centers only to be provided with  misleading or deceptive medical information or services that endanger  their health.

That is why during last week's markup on this bill, I introduced a  responsible amendment that would have prohibited fraudulent centers  from receiving TANF funds funded by taxpayer dollars.

Republicans regularly talk about rooting out government waste, fraud,  and abuse, but not a single one supported my amendment.

It's clear that Republicans have no interest in addressing fraud if  it conflicts with their dogmatic ideology even at the cost of their  constituents' health.

Republicans are outraged at the idea of simply holding crisis  pregnancy centers to the same medical standards as licensed health  facilities.

Why are Republicans willing to categorically turn a blind eye to the  countless horror stories happening at these sham health clinics?

It is because for Republicans, when it comes to women's health,  accountability isn't required.

This bill defines pregnancy centers as organizations that support  ``protecting the life of the mother and the unborn child,'' but  Republican's commitment to funneling taxpayer dollars to medical  grifters endangers both.

I urge my colleagues to vote No on this irresponsible bill.
