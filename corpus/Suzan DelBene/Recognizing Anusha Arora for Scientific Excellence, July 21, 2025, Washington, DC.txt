Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Anusha Arora  on being the Gold Medal recipient at the Washington State Science and  Engineering Fair for her project titled ``Smart Strings: A Novel Low- Cost Multimodal System for Intelligent Sensory Feedback through  Artificial Intelligence.'' The Washington State Science and Engineering  Fair aims to advance the studies of STEM in grades 1-12 through the  State of Washington. They work to provide opportunities for students to  display their projects and provide support and guidance for the  operation of science and engineering fairs throughout Washington State.

Additionally, Anusha had the opportunity to represent Washington  State at the 2025 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.  For more than 70 years, thousands of students from various science fair  networks have explored their passion for scientific research at the  world's largest pre-college science competition. Students from more  than 75 countries, regions and territories competed across 21 different  STEM disciplines. This year, Anusha competed among the top young  scientists from around the globe and was selected as a Grand Award  Winner in the category of ``Technology Enhances the Arts.'' Anusha  Arora attends Interlake High School in Washington's 1st Congressional  District.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Anusha  Arora and this victory for science education in Washington. Her work  demonstrates not only exceptional scientific excellence, but a deep  commitment to addressing real world challenges. We are grateful for her  contributions to the scientific community and wish her a successful  career.
