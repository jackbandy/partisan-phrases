Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Brian Holtzclaw  for his twelve years of dedicated service to the City of Mill Creek.  Mayor Holtzclaw was elected to the city council in 2013, served as  Mayor Pro Tempore, and has led the city as mayor since 2020. During his  tenure, he has championed thoughtful city planning and growth, helping  Mill Creek expand economic opportunities and enhance tourism while  preserving the city's character.

Mayor Holtzclaw has lived in Mill Creek since 2003 and is deeply  engaged in the community he serves. He helped advance the South Town  Center Project and the DRCC properties, which include four city-owned  parcels the city is exploring for a new community campus. He is also an  avid cyclist, a hobby he pursues with energy and enthusiasm. His  collaborative approach within Snohomish County has strengthened  regional partnerships while keeping Mill Creek's unique identity  intact.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Mayor  Holtzclaw for his leadership and service. He has left a lasting mark on  Mill Creek, and I wish him well as he begins the next chapter of his  life.
