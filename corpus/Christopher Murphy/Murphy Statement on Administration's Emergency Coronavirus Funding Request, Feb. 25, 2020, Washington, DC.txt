Murphy Statement on Administration's Emergency Coronavirus Funding Request


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, on Tuesday released the following statement in response to President Trump's supplemental coronavirus budget request:

"The president's emergency funding request to respond to the coronavirus is far too little, and far too late. Weeks after it was already clear that this was a developing crisis where a speedy response was critical, President Trump finally sends up a supplemental request of $1.25 billion in new funding--a fraction of what we have done in previous health emergencies, and a tenth of what he has already spent in so-called emergency funding for his worthless border wall. It's clear this administration is completely unprepared for this public health crisis, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just admitted that even its tests for the virus are unreliable. This package is just a sliver of what is needed to mount the urgent public health response required to keep Americans safe. On top of that, the National Security Council unit that can coordinate a whole-of-government response to pandemics like this is still disbanded. We need leadership fast--and it's clear it won't come from the White House. Congress should come together to advance a strategic funding package that addresses coronavirus, and doesn't play into Trump's partisan political promises," said Murphy.
