Murphy Statement on Coronavirus Reaching Connecticut


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, released the following statement after it was announced that a Danbury Hospital and Norwalk Hospital worker tested positive for COVID-19. 

"We always knew it was a matter of when, not if, the COVID-19 would touch Connecticut. As we continue to monitor possible exposures related to a hospital worker -- I stand ready to do everything I can at the federal level to make sure the governor and Connecticut's state and local health officials have all the resources they need to contain and stop the spread of the coronavirus in Connecticut," said Murphy.
