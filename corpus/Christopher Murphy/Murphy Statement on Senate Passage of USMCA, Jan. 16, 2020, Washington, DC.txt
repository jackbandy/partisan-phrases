Murphy Statement on Senate Passage of USMCA


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Thursday released the following statement after U.S. Senate passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA):

"NAFTA was a job killing disaster for Connecticut. USMCA, which is an update to NAFTA, isn't perfect, but it's an improvement on both the original deal and the agreement that President Trump announced last year. I'm grateful to House Democrats--including Rosa DeLauro and John Larson--and union leaders for securing high labor standards and real enforcement mechanisms that will help level the playing field with Mexico. I am disappointed that the deal falls short in terms of environmental protections and addressing climate change, and future trade agreements must set a higher standard in this regard. However, on balance, this deal is better for Connecticut workers than the original agreement. Our state does a lot of business with Canada and Mexico and our manufacturers and workers rely on robust fair trade among our countries," said Murphy.

Murphy is a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee. All three committees have jurisdiction over the USMCA trade deal.
