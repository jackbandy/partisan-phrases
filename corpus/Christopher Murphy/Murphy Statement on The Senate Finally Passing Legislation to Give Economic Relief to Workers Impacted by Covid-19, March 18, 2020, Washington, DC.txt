Murphy Statement on The Senate Finally Passing Legislation to Give Economic Relief to Workers Impacted by Covid-19


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the U.S. Appropriations Committee, on Wednesday made the following statement after the U.S. Senate passed a coronavirus relief bill that included emergency paid leave, enhanced unemployment aid for workers and additional funding to state Medicaid programs. On Saturday morning, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 363-40.

"It is astounding that this bill sat in McConnell's lap for days before we passed it. Had we moved on this earlier, there would have been thousands of parents and workers in Connecticut who could have stayed home from work while still being paid. While people are stepping up to slow the spread of coronavirus, this epidemic has created real struggles that require a full, coordinated response from the federal government. Families throughout Connecticut are worried about whether they can get food on the table for their families and pay bills. Anything, and everything, Congress can do to help those in need during this crisis should be done ASAP. Now is not the time to play politics, and I hope we can come together to pass another economic stimulus package as soon as possible," said Murphy.   

This week, Murphy laid out his requests for the phase three economic stimulus package that the Senate will vote on next. On Monday, Murphy took to the Senate floor urging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring up the legislation immediately. Last week, Murphy and U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal held a press conference in Hartford urging the House and Senate to swiftly pass legislation to aid workers impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
