Murphy Statement on Failed Witness Vote


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Friday blasted Senate Republicans for voting against the need for additional witnesses and documents in the impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump: 

"The Senate just committed constitutional malpractice, and our nation is weaker for it. Never in the history of the United States has there been an impeachment trial without witnesses. Even Republicans have admitted that Trump's use of foreign policy to extort political gains is wrong. This is a blatant cover-up that should shake all Americans to their core. I worry for the future of our democracy and the United States Senate," said Murphy.
