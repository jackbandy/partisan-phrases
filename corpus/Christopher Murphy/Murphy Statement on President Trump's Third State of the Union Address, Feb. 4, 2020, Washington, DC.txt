Murphy Statement on President Trump's Third State of the Union Address


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) released the following statement on Tuesday after President Donald Trump delivered his third State of the Union address: 

"That was a disgrace. It wasn't even a half-hearted attempt at a State of the Union speech. It was a 2020 campaign speech from beginning to end, filled with political stunts unworthy of the House chamber and verifiable lie after verifiable lie. I regret attending, and I'm sad that President Trump chose to turn a sacred tradition into a cheap campaign spectacle, and I'm just as sad that my Republican colleagues egged him on the whole night. The speech makes any cooperation between the parties less possible than ever before, though I will do my best to put this sad night behind us and tomorrow get back to the business the people of Connecticut sent me here to do," said Murphy. 

Murphy invited Deborah Davis to be his guest at this year's State of the Union. Deborah, who lost her son to gun violence in 2010, is an organizer with Mothers United Against Violence (MUAV), an organization created by Reverend Henry Brown and Henrietta Beckman based in Hartford that seeks to provide spiritual support, closure and social justice for victims and families impacted by violence. As an organizer, Deborah frequently speaks on behalf of MUAV and meets with families impacted by gun violence.
