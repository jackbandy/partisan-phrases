Murphy Statement on Senate Replublicans' Efforts to Block Additional Documents, Witnesses at Start of Trump Impeachment Trial


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Wednesday released the following statement after Senate Republicans rejected Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's amendments to ensure that additional witnesses and documents could be considered as part of the impeachment trial against Donald J. Trump:

"The Senate's job isn't to rush a trial in order to protect the president. Our job is to find the truth. But yesterday every single Republican in the Senate, vote after vote, stood up and blocked a real, fair trial. Never before has a Senate impeachment trial had no witnesses and no document production, but that is where Senator McConnell is leading us. Yesterday was a really sad day for the Senate and a really dangerous day for democracy. I hope the Senate performs better today," said Murphy.
