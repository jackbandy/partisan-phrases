Murphy Statement on Trump Administration's New Medicaid Block Grant Guidance Which Threatens Medicaid, Access to Healthare


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, released the following statement on Friday after the Trump administration issued new Medicaid Block Grant guidance which opens the door to cuts in Medicaid and access to quality, affordable health care: 

"Instead of making health care more accessible and more affordable for every American, President Trump has continued on this crusade to dismantle and sabotage the entire system. It's completely mindboggling to me that this administration is hell-bent on stripping away protections for our country's most vulnerable people. This new Medicaid Block Grant guidance allows states to deny coverage and place restrictions on access to care for those who gained coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Too many Americans are left behind in Trump's economy. The least we can do is honor our promise to provide a safety net for our most vulnerable," said Murphy.
