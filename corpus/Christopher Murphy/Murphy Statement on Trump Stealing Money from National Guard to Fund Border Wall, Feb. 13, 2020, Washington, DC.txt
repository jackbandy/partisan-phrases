Murphy Statement on Trump Stealing Money from National Guard to Fund Border Wall


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, on Thursday released the following statement after the U.S. Department of Defense notified Congress of the transfer of funds from U.S. National Guard Equipment and F-35 production to pay for the president's border wall. Specifically, the Trump administration is transferring $3.8 billion into the "Drug Interdiction and Counter Drug Activities' account that will allow the administration to "construct additional barriers and roads in the vicinity of the United States border."

"The shortsightedness of this administration is dumbfounding. President Trump just stole money from national security priorities that keep our country safe and National Guard equipment that saves lives in real national emergencies to pay for his ineffective and racist border wall. The president is playing politics with U.S. national security, and manufacturers in Connecticut and the Connecticut National Guard are going to pay the price. This decision today only makes us less safe, less prepared, and more vulnerable to a natural disaster. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I'll continue to fight this administration to make sure these funds are restored," said Murphy.
