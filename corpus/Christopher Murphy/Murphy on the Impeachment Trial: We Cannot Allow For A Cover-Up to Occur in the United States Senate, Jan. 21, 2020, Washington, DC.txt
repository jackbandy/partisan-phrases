Murphy on the Impeachment Trial: We Cannot Allow For A Cover-Up to Occur in the United States Senate


Ahead of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) joined Facebook Live to answer questions from people in Connecticut about the process as outlined by Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the substance of the upcoming trial.

Murphy said: "[I]n order to do justice to this moment, we have to be as transparent as possible. We have to allow the American public to see what's happening inside the Senate, to know what senators are thinking about this moment. And so I'm going to try to be as transparent as I can."

"I have strong feelings about what the president has done. But I also remain open to hearing exculpatory evidence from this White House. And that's in part why I want to make sure that we have witnesses and documents, so that even for those of us who have strong feelings about the president's conduct and its potential illegality, that we are able to have information before us that may allow us to change our minds," Murphy continued.

Finally, Murphy concluded: "You still have a role to play here. This still is a democracy. You can still put pressure on members of the Senate to make sure that this trial is a fair one."
