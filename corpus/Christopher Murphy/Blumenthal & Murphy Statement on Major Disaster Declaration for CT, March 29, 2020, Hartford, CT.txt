Blumenthal & Murphy Statement on Major Disaster Declaration for CT


U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) released the following joint statement after President Donald Trump approved a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of Connecticut in response to the COVID-19 crisis:

"The disaster declaration is an important first step in supporting Connecticut's communities and first responders that on the frontline of this fight. The federal government has an obligation to ensure that our cities and towns receive the funding they need to protect the health and safety of their residents. We urge the White House to promptly complete their review and approve Governor Lamont's request for individual assistance. Over the past few weeks we have both spoken with workers and businesses impacted by the economic downturn, and they will need every possible source of economic relief to survive the coming months. Our offices will continue to work in close collaboration with Governor Lamont and White House to provide Connecticut with all the resources it will need."
