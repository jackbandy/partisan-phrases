Murphy Statement on Violence in Syria


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia, and Counterterrorism, on Thursday made the following statement on the recent escalation of violence in Syria:

"I'm incredibly worried about Assad's recent escalation of violence in Idlib. This offensive has Putin's fingerprints all over it, and has the potential to be the bloodiest phase of the Syrian war to date. As Assad recaptures more territory and the border with Turkey remains closed, people are running out of room to escape the violence. The ability to meet the humanitarian needs across northwest Syria is already strained and this violence further complicates the process of getting aid to millions of people in dire need. There must be an urgent de-escalation of violence and the only way that can happen is if Russia, Turkey, Assad, and other armed actors agree to an immediate ceasefire. The United States would normally be looked to as the leader to convene these conversations but, as usual, the Trump administration has been outmaneuvered by other players and is essentially AWOL as Syria falls further apart," said Murphy.

In October after the Turkish offensive in northeastern Syria, Murphy led five U.S. Senators in calling on the U.S. Secretary of State to ensure U.S. resources are made flexible for humanitarian efforts to evacuate personnel and continue assisting Syrian refugees inside Iraq.
