Murphy Statement on Afghanistan Negotiations


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on  Saturday released the following statement on the U.S.-Taliban deal to prompt negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government:

"The war in Afghanistan has gone on for too long, and the U.S.-Taliban deal to set the stage for dialogue between the Taliban and the Afghan government is a step in the right direction. It's critical that women and minorities are brought to the table in the coming negotiations and that the Taliban continues to adhere to the reduction of violence. We must sustain our diplomatic engagement with the Afghan people as we also work to begin bringing our troops home, while leaving critical counterterrorism operations in place. This is the longest war in our country's history, and that's exactly why Congress must be consulted before any final agreement is reached. That's why I am requesting Ambassador Khalilzad come before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the coming weeks," said Murphy.
