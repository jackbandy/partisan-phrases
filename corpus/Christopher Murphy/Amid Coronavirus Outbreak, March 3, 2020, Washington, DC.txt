Amid Coronavirus Outbreak, Murphy Statement on SCOTUS Decision to Hear Oral Arguments in ACA Lawsuit


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, on Tuesday released the following statement in response to the Supreme Court's announcement that they will hear oral arguments in Texas v. United States, a Republican-led and Trump administration-backed lawsuit aimed at overturning the Affordable Care Act, later this year:

"As the global coronavirus outbreak is starting to hit us here at home, the Supreme Court's decision to take up the partisan Affordable Care Act lawsuit this fall is just another daily reminder that President Trump and his Republicans allies are trying to take away your health care with no back-up plan in place. Their determination to end protections for those with pre-existing conditions and sabotage health care for millions of Americans is downright dangerous. We deserve better. Our fight to protect the 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions is far from over, and more important than ever with a possible global pandemic that's already reached our borders," said Murphy.  

Murphy blasted the Supreme Court's announcement earlier this year to not expedite review of the Obamacare lawsuit. Last December during open enrollment season, Murphy took to the U.S. Senate floor to discuss the importance of the Affordable Care Act. In July as the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in Texas v. United States, Murphy authored an op-ed in the Hartford Courant highlighting what's at stake for 522,000 residents in Connecticut and over 130 million Americans with pre-existing health conditions if the Affordable Care Act were overturned.
