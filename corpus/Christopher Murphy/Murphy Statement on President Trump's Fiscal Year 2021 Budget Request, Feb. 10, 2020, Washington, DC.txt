Murphy Statement on President Trump's Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Request


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, on Monday released the following statement after President Trump unveiled his proposal for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.

"Thankfully, President Trump's budget request to Congress is dead on arrival, and the only bright side is that the budget will serve a reminder of the administration's backwards priorities ahead of an election year," said Murphy. "This budget calls for deep cuts to Medicaid and Medicare that would devastate seniors and families in Connecticut, cripples our investments in rail in the Northeast Corridor, and eliminates funding to protect Long Island Sound. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I'll continue to fight against these proposed cuts. This budget is terrible for Connecticut, and I want my constituents to know that I'm here in Washington to make sure it never sees the light of day."

Murphy also put out a statement blasting the Trump administration after reports that the Pentagon is slashing submarine funding in this year's budget.
