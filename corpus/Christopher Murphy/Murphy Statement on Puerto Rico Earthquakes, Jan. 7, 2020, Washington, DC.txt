Murphy Statement on Puerto Rico Earthquakes


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Tuesday released the following statement on the earthquakes that hit Puerto Rico:  

"My heart is with the people of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of yesterday's and today's earthquakes. Connecticut is proudly home to thousands of people of Puerto Rican descent, who know firsthand the devastation the island has faced in recent years. The administration should promptly issue the emergency declaration that Governor VÃ¡zquez requested earlier today. I'll continue to monitor the situation, and do all I can in Washington to help Puerto Rico rebuild," said Murphy.
