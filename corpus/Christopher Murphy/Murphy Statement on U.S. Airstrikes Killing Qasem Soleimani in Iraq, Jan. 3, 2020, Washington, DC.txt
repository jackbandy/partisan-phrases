Murphy Statement on U.S. Airstrikes Killing Qasem Soleimani in Iraq


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia, and Counterterrorism, on Friday made the following statement after the United States confirmed the Pentagon carried out an airstrike which killed the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp Commander General Qasem Soleimani: 

"No matter how good it may feel that Qasem Soleimani is no longer alive, he likely will end up being more dangerous to the United States, our troops, and our allies, as a martyr than as a living, breathing military adversary. There will be reprisals, and Iran will likely target American troops and even our own political and military leaders. This is why the United States does not assassinate leaders of foreign nations--in the end such action risks getting more, not less, Americans killed in the long run," said Murphy. 

Murphy continued: "President Trump's disastrous approach to Iran has, from the beginning, been all tactics and no strategy. They make it up day by day. The assassination of Soleimani fits this pattern. I hope I am wrong, but I suspect this White House is totally unprepared for the cascade of consequences that will follow last night's actions. I pray for the Americans who, today, are in harm's way.  

"Now, it is up to Congress to press the president to disclose his legal basis for this action and the plan for how our nation manages the fallout. I doubt there is congressional authority for this strike, and I doubt the president has a plan for what comes next. But these are questions Congress must now ask," Murphy added.  

Last year, Murphy published a joint USA Today op-ed with U.S. Representative Jim Himes (CT-4) raising concerns about the president's march to war with Iran.
