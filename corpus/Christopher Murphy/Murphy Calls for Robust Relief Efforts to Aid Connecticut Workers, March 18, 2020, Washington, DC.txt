Murphy Calls for Robust Relief Efforts to Aid Connecticut Workers, Families, Hospitals Impacted by Covid-19


U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, on Wednesday called for robust legislative measures to aid workers and families across the country who will be directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Murphy laid out what he wants to see in a future relief package to help Connecticut's workers, families, and medical professionals. This includes: (1) immediately sending a $2,000 check to every adult and child to brunt the burden of COVID-19; (2) a 15% increase in benefits to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and a suspension of work requirements for up to 14 months; (3) an increase in funding to make sure food banks are stocked with the necessary food and supplies; (4) address homelessness, including payments to workers, institute medical safety protocols, and meet emerging needs; (5) necessary funding to hospitals to make sure they have the resources to handle a surge in capacity; (6) ensuring individuals impacted by the coronavirus who are unable to work due to quarantine aren't evicted from their homes; and (7) delaying mortgage payments for this month and waive the late payments as it relate to COVID-19.

"This is a minute by minute crisis for families in Connecticut, and Congress needs to get real help down to families, hospitals, businesses, and feeding centers right now," said Murphy. "Our first priority has to be stopping the virus. No economic stimulus will save the economy if the virus continues to spread. That's why I'm proposing massive assistance to hospitals that are expanding testing and bed capacity to meet the surge in demand. And President Trump has to stop downplaying the seriousness of the epidemic and solve the testing crisis."

Murphy continued: "But we do need to take emergency steps to rescue the economy, and I'm proposing a cash payment to families all across the country of $2,000 per person and $2,000 per family that will save both families and local economies from ruin."

Specifically, Murphy has called for the following to help Connecticut workers, families, and small businesses:
