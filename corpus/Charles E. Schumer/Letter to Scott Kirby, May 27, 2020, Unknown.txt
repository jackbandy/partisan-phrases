Letter to Scott Kirby, CEO of United Airlines - After securing +$1.7m for Ithaca Tompkins regional airport to recover from COVID crisis, Schumer urges united airlines to drop plans to cut Ithaca service; Schumer calls on United to continue flights to airport, a vital step to Southern Tier's recovery


Dear Mr. Kirby:

I write to you today regarding United Airlines' request to temporarily suspend service to Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport (ITH). In that regard, I ask that your company instead consider maintaining its current service level to ITH.

Firstly, I recognize the challenges of maintaining full flight schedules during the COVID-19 crisis so far and given the impact that this pandemic has had on airlines, I am grateful that United Airlines has met their service commitment to ITH so far. With the Southern Tier region of New York one of the first to reopen and resume normal life, the airport is seeing load factors rise substantially in comparison to the worst of the crisis just six weeks ago. For that reason, United's appeal to USDOT to temporarily suspend service to Ithaca does not seem congruent with the reopening of regional activity.

During the drafting of the CARES Act, I secured provisions providing grants for industry's worker payrolls and I also ensured that the industry would receive low-interest loans to cover other costs such as station rental fees and landing fees to airports, that were struggling just as much as airlines. Canceling service to airports such as ITH--even temporarily--could have a devastating effect on the airport and the community.

Due to the increased load factors, the effect this would have on travelers, and the significant impact that suspension of service would have on the airport, I strongly urge you to reconsider United Airlines' decision to suspend service at ITH.

I thank you for your time and look forward to hearing from you on this matter. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or my staff.
