Schumer, Gillibrand announce nearly $1 million in federal funding to promote connected care for New Yorkers


U.S. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $938,519 in federal funding to provide telehealth services for New Yorkers affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The funding was allocated through the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) COVID-19 Telehealth Program as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES). 

The third round of Telehealth Program funding awarded the NYU Grossman School of Medicine $772,687 to expand telehealth services that will allow high-risk, elderly, and vulnerable patients to remain at home while receiving complex care and treatment. Additionally, The White Plains Hospital Medical Center was awarded $165,832 to deploy telehealth services to treat high-risk patients with pre-existing pulmonary conditions and to safely address the facility's growing patient population by minimizing the risk of COVID-19 exposure for staff and patients. 

"As COVID-19 continues to sweep through New York, leaving no community untouched, it's imperative that New York communities have the tools necessary to keep up the fight against the pandemic," said Senator Schumer. "I am proud to have secured this vital funding for telehealth programs that will help New Yorkers get through this crisis and will continue to fight to make sure that hospitals have the dollars they need to keep both frontline healthcare providers and patients healthy."

"Everyone deserves to have access to quality health care," said Senator Gillibrand. "Telehealth services will ensure that our health care providers and patients can stay safe as we fight this pandemic. I will keep fighting in the Senate to ensure that our vulnerable and high-risk communities have access to the vital resources they need during this unprecedented health crisis."
