Schumer statement on Navy awarding Lockheed Martin in Salina +$185m contract to modernize electronic warfare equipment


U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer today released the following statement after the U.S. Navy awarded a $185,025,000 contract to Lockheed Martin in Salina, NY to provide state-of-the-art Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) equipment to keep Navy personnel and ships safe from harm:

"This well-deserved, $185 million contract is a major victory for Lockheed Martin in Salina and its dedicated workers," said Senator Schumer. "Each and every year, I fight tooth and nail to boost the Department of Defense programs that enhance America's military, support New York workers and protect important jobs. I applaud the Navy's significant investment in Lockheed Martin and the outstanding workforce right here in Central New York."

Schumer has long fought for funding the Department of Defense's SEWIP program, which provides enhanced shipboard electronic warfare capabilities for early detection, analysis, threat warning and protection from anti-ship missiles.
