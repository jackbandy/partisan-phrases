Letter to the Hon. Ronald Batory, Admin of the Federal Railroad Administration - Schumer announces, following his push, Feds approve permit allowing Amtrak to move next gen high-speed train & keep Amtrak growth in Hornell on track; senator says revolutionary trains support 400 southern tier jobs & improve rail safety, comfort & speed


Dear Administrator Batory,

I write to request that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) approve Amtrak's permit application for one time movement authority from the production facility in Hornell, New York to the FRA's test track in Pueblo, Colorado.

In 2015, Amtrak's Board of Directors approved the necessary steps for a contract to procure Next Generation High-Speed trains, of which I was a big supporter. This trainset for Amtrak will improve reliability, service, safety, and capacity, and they will replace existing Acela trainsets in the coming years.

I am pleased to learn that the first of the improved, Next Generation High-Speed trainsets has been completed at the Alstom facility in Hornell, New York and is scheduled to be tested at the FRA's test track facility in Pueblo, Colorado. I look forward to the day that the high-speed trains are put into service by Amtrak and hope that you will do what is necessary to make that a reality. I appreciate the support FRA has lent this important project thus far, and the timely approval of this permit will ensure the production schedule remains on track. I appreciate your efforts to ensure the swift approval of Amtrak's permit application for one-time movement authority.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or my staff.
