Letter to President Donald Trump - Pelosi, Schumer Write to President Trump Requesting Half Staff Flags to Honor Lives Lost when COVID-19 Death Toll Reaches 100,000


Dear Mr. President:

This weekend, we will observe Memorial Day an occasion of great importance as we honor the men and women who were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country.  We will always carry their memory in our hearts.  We reserve Monday to give special remembrance to them. 

As we pay our respects to them, sadly, our country mourns the deaths of nearly 100,000 Americans from COVID-19.  Our hearts are broken over this great loss and our prayers are with their families. 

Respectful of them and the loss to our country, we are writing to request that you order flags to be flown at half staff on all public buildings in our country on the sad day of reckoning when we reach 100,000 deaths.  It would serve as a national expression of grief so needed by everyone in our country.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter of grave concern.

Sincerely,

NANCY PELOSI

Speaker of the House

U.S. House of Representatives       

CHARLES E. SCHUMER
