MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019--Motion to Proceed


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his impassioned  words that were right on the money. 

  The Senate is going to adjourn shortly, but that doesn't mean  negotiations are slowing down one bit. Secretary Mnuchin just left my  office. We have had some very good discussions, and, in fact, the list  of outstanding issues has narrowed significantly. We are going to work  on into the night.
