Pelosi, Schumer Joint Statement on Coronavirus Phase 3 Legislation


Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer released the following joint statement regarding their vision for new legislation to aid those suffering in response to the coronavirus pandemic:

"House and Senate Democrats are united in our commitment to using all tools available to help fight the coronavirus outbreak like the health crisis it is and make sure all workers are protected from the loss of a paycheck or that no family falls into financial ruin because of this pandemic.  Democrats support a plan that puts "Workers First'.  That means taking bold action to help workers and small businesses first by greatly increasing unemployment insurance and Medicaid, making massive investments to help small businesses survive, expanding paid sick and family leave and putting money directly into the hands of those who need it most. 

"The number one priority is addressing this health crisis, which requires a Marshall Plan to rebuild our health care infrastructure on a continental scale and ensure the resources are there to test and treat everyone who needs it.

"To earn Democratic support in the Congress, any economic stimulus proposal must include new, strong and strict provisions that prioritize and protect workers, such as banning the recipient companies from buying back stock, rewarding executives and laying off workers.

"We look forward to working in a bipartisan way to deliver for the American people as soon as humanly possible."
