       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  

       This Act may be cited as the ``Endless Frontier Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  

       Congress finds the following: 

       (1) For over 70 years, the United States has been the       unequivocal global leader in scientific and technological       innovation, and as a result the people of the United States       have benefitted through good-paying jobs, economic       prosperity, and a higher quality of life. Today, however,       this leadership position is being eroded and challenged by       foreign competitors, some of whom are stealing intellectual       property and trade secrets of the United States and       aggressively investing in fundamental research and       commercialization to dominate the key technology fields of       the future. While the United States once led the world in the       share of our economy invested in research, our Nation now       ranks 9th globally in total research and development and 12th       in publicly financed research and development. 

       (2) Without a significant increase in investment in       research, education, technology transfer, and the core       strengths of the United States innovation ecosystem, it is       only a matter of time before the global competitors of the       United States overtake the United States in terms of       technological primacy. The country that wins the race in key       technologies--such as artificial intelligence, quantum       computing, advanced communications, and advanced       manufacturing--will be the superpower of the future. 

       (3) The Federal Government must catalyze United States       innovation by boosting fundamental research investments       focused on discovering, creating, commercializing, and       producing new technologies to ensure the leadership of the       United States in the industries of the future. 

       (4) The distribution of innovation jobs and investment in       the United States has become largely concentrated in just a       few locations, while much of the Nation has been left out of       growth in the innovation sector. More than 90 percent of the       Nation's innovation sector employment growth in the last 15       years was generated in just 5 major cities. The Federal       Government must address this imbalance in opportunity by       partnering with the private sector to build new technology       hubs across the country, spreading innovation sector jobs       more broadly, and tapping the talent and potential of the       entire Nation to ensure the United States leads the       industries of the future. 

       (5) Since its inception, the National Science Foundation       has carried out vital work supporting basic research and       people to create knowledge that is a primary driver of the       economy of the United States and enhances the Nation's       security.       SEC. 3. NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOUNDATION.  

       (a) Redesignation of National Science Foundation as       National Science and Technology Foundation.-- 

       (1) In general.--Section 2 of the Act of May 10, 1950 (64       Stat. 149, chapter 171; 42 U.S.C. 1861) is amended-- 

       (A) in the section heading, by inserting ``and technology''       after ``science''; and 

       (B) by striking ``the National Science Foundation'' and       inserting ``the National Science and Technology Foundation''. 

       (2) References.--Any reference in any law, rule,       regulation, certificate, directive, instruction, or other       official paper in force on the date of enactment of this Act       to the National Science Foundation shall be considered to       refer and apply to the National Science and Technology       Foundation. 

       (b) Establishment of Deputy Director for Technology.--      Section 6 of the Act of May 10, 1950 (64 Stat. 149, chapter       171; 42 U.S.C. 1864a) is amended-- 

       (1) in the section heading, by striking ``deputy director''       and inserting ``deputy directors''; 

       (2) in the first sentence-- 

       (A) by striking ``a Deputy Director'' and inserting ``2       Deputy Directors''; and 

       (B) by inserting ``and in accordance with the expedited       procedures established under S. Res. 116 (112th Congress)''       after ``the Senate''; 

       (3) in the third sentence, by striking ``The Deputy       Director shall receive'' and inserting ``Each Deputy Director       shall receive''; 

       (4) by inserting after the third sentence the following:       ``The Deputy Director for Technology shall oversee, and       perform duties relating to, the Directorate for Technology of       the Foundation, as established under section 8A, and the       Deputy Director for Science shall oversee, and perform duties       relating to, the other activities and directorates supported       by the Foundation.''; and 

       (5) in the last sentence, by striking ``The Deputy Director       shall act'' and inserting ``The Deputy Director for Science       shall act''. 

       (c) Establishment of Directorate for Technology.--The Act       of May 10, 1950 (64 Stat. 149, chapter 171; 42 U.S.C. 1861 et       seq.) is amended--
