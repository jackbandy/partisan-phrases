Pelosi and Schumer Joint Statement on Interim Emergency Coronavirus Relief


Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer issued this statement on Democrats' priorities for small businesses and working families in an interim emergency coronavirus package:

"The heartbreaking acceleration of the coronavirus crisis demands bold, urgent and ongoing action from Congress to protect Americans' lives and livelihoods.  As Democrats have said since Day One, Congress must provide additional relief for small businesses and families, building on the strong down-payment made in the bipartisan CARES Act.

"Congressional Democrats are calling for:

$250 billion in assistance to small businesses, with $125 billion channeled through community-based financial institutions that serve farmers, family, women, minority and veteran-owned small businesses and nonprofits in rural, tribal, suburban and urban communities across our country, and improvements to ensure all eligible small businesses can access this critical funding and are not turned away by banks; $100 billion for hospitals, community health centers and health systems, providing desperately needed resources to the frontlines of this crisis, including production and distribution of national rapid testing and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE);$150 billion for state and local governments to manage this crisis and mitigate lost revenue, doubling down on the investment secured in the CARES Act;Strong additional support for families with a 15 percent increase to the maximum SNAP benefit to help put food on the table."After we pass this interim emergency legislation, Congress will move to pass a CARES 2 Act that will extend and expand the bipartisan CARES Act to meet the needs of the American people.  CARES 2 must provide transformational relief as the American people weather this assault on their lives and livelihoods. 

"The American people need to know that their government is there for them in their time of great need."
