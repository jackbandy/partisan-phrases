Election Security


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. SCHUMER. The Republican majority also seems to have time to chase  all of President Trump's wild conspiracy theories about how he was  wronged by law enforcement--the poor, beleaguered President Trump. My  goodness. That is what is happening in Judiciary today. Republican  Majority Leader McConnell can devote time to that, but they can't  commit to time on the floor about how Black Americans are being wronged  by law enforcement. 

  In order to bring a small appearance of fairness to this ridiculous  Judiciary Committee vote today, Democrats will be requesting subpoenas  for Trump campaign associates like Michael Cohen, Rick Gates, George  Papadopoulos, and Michael Flynn, among others. These men have at one  time or another pled guilty to offenses related to Putin's interference  in the election. Let's hear what they have to say, or should this be  just a one-sided kangaroo court to please President Trump? 

  If the Republican conspiracy caucus wants to waste the Senate's time  dredging up old conspiracy theories about the previous election, let's  at least get the straight story. Let's at least hear witnesses who  might have something different to say. This is not a dictatorship. This  is not how courts or hearings are supposed to work, I would say to the  Republican chairman, and it is beneath his dignity and the dignity of  the body to conduct such sham, kangaroo court hearings.
