Tweet - "2 months ago today, President Trump told Americans:  "Anybody that needs a test gets a test."  It was a lie then. It's still a lie now.  President Trump: We've seen 1.2 million cases of COVID-19 and 70,000 deaths.  Why do you still not have an adequate national testing strategy?"

It was a lie then.It's still a lie now.

President Trump: We've seen 1.2 million cases of COVID-19 and 70,000 deaths.

Why do you still not have an adequate national testing strategy?"
