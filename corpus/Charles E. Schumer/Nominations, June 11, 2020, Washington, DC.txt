Nominations


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the Republican majority seems to have a  whole lot of time to push rightwing judges. That is what they want to  do next week. And both of the judges that they nominate--to show the  hypocrisy of those who talk about wanting to help and compare it to  their actions, both of those judges have an antipathy to our healthcare  law. In the middle of a public healthcare crisis, the Republican  majority thinks they can get away with stuff like this, but they can't.  Americans are catching on. One of the nominees, Cory Wilson, has an  alarming record on voting rights in the middle of a national reckoning  on racial injustice, and you are all going to vote for him? This guy  has opposed voting rights, and you are going to vote for him. They  oppose healthcare. You are going to vote for them. And then they are  going to give nice speeches on how they want equality. The two have to  add up together
