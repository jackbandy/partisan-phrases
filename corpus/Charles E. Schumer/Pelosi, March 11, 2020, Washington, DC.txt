Pelosi, Schumer Statement On President Trump's Coronavirus Address


House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer released the following joint statement after President Trump delivered an address to the nation on the coronavirus outbreak:

 

"We have a public health crisis in this country and the best way to help keep the American people safe and ensure their economic security is for the president to focus on fighting the spread of the coronavirus itself.  Alarmingly, the President did not say how the Administration will address the lack of coronavirus testing kits throughout the United States. 

 

"Tomorrow, we urge Republicans in the House and Senate to help immediately pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. The bill will include free coronavirus testing, paid emergency leave for workers, food security assistance, help to states overburdened by Medicaid costs, and strengthened Unemployment Insurance, among other much-needed measures to keep the American people safe."
