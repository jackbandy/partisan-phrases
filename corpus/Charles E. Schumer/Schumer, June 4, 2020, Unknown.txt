Schumer, Gillibrand announce nearly $4 million in federal funding for telehealth services


U.S. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $3,890,318 in federal funding to provide additional telehealth services for New Yorkers affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The eighth set of telehealth funding was allocated to 12 New York health care organizations through the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) COVID-19 Telehealth Program as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES). This federal funding will help ensure New Yorkers have reliable access to quality health care during the COVID-19 outbreak, while mitigating the risk of COVID-19 transmission in hospitals and emergency rooms. Specifically, the funding will be used to purchase telehealth devices and equipment that will allow providers to facilitate remote consultations and diagnostic services with New York patients.  

"As COVID-19 continues to deeply impact New York, it's imperative that New York hospitals and health centers have all the tools necessary to keep up the fight against the virus and prevent it from spreading," said Senator Schumer. "This vital funding for telehealth programs will help New Yorkers get through this crisis, and I will continue to fight to make sure that hospitals and health centers have the funding they need to keep both frontline healthcare providers and patients safe and healthy."

"As New Yorkers continue fighting the COVID-19 outbreak, we must ensure that telehealth services are widely available to health care providers and patients," said Senator Gillibrand. "These services will help New Yorkers receive necessary treatment while protecting health care facilities and providers from the spread of COVID-19. I will continue fighting for the resources our state needs to keep our communities safe during this unprecedented health crisis."
