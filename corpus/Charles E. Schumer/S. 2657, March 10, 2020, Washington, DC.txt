  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, before I get into the remarks,  substance, of coronavirus and H.R. 1, I would like to mention that  Leader McConnell did not give the right story when he talked about the  Energy bill. I would remind people, 13 Democrats voted for cloture; 15  Republicans opposed cloture. I would remind the leader that it was a  Republican, Senator Kennedy, who led the charge to deny cloture, and it  was well known that Democrats simply wanted an amendment on the Kennedy  bill--a Republican amendment--wanted an ability to vote. Once again,  because Leader McConnell does not allow amendments and debate and,  instead, just adds more items to his legislative graveyard, the bill  went down. But 13 Democrats voted for cloture. If he had his Republican  troops together, he might have been able to pass it anyway. To blame  Democrats and say we are moving the goalpost is just a total  misstatement of what happened.
