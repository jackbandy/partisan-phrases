Schumer announces over $3.4 million in emergency funding for Glens Falls as part of emergency package he negotiated


As part of the Schumer-negotiated CARES Act, which included economic relief for transit systems. U.S. Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer today announced $3,458,374 in federal funding allocated by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for Greater Glens Fall Transit.

"As upstate communities like the Adirondack Region battle the coronavirus pandemic, it's imperative that they get all the federal tools they need to react, respond and recover," said Senator Schumer. "This federal funding will offset the devastating financial impacts of COVID-19 on transit operations throughout the region and allow Greater Glens Falls Transit to reopen after being shut down for the past few weeks. I'm proud to have fought for this imperative funding to be included in the CARES Act and will continue to fight to make sure the Adirondack Region has every dollar they need to recover."
