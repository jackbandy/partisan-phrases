Letter to the Hon. Ronald Batory, Admin. of the Federal Railroad Administration - After terrifying train derailment in East Aurora last night, Schumer demands investigation from Feds; train was carrying highly flammable materials and overturned engines were leaking diesel fuel


Dear Administrator Batory:

Last night, a freight train operated by Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad derailed in the Village of East Aurora, NY. According to local reports, 15 cars and three engines, of 98 cars, were derailed. While fortunately no injuries were reported, residents in the surrounding area had to be evacuated for their own safety. It has come to my attention that the train was carrying highly flammable petrochemicals and diesel fuel from the engine had to be cleaned up at the site.

Again, while it is fortunate there were no injuries, the situation could have been much worse. I call on the Federal Railroad Administration to conduct a full and thorough investigation into the cause of this incident and report any appropriate steps that should be taken to prevent such future incidents.

This is not the first time a railroad car carrying highly flammable materials has derailed in Western New York. In 2017, a CSX freight train derailed at the railroad crossing at Donahue Road in the town of Batavia, with one of the overturned cars carrying flammable gunpowder. Freight trains carrying flammable Bakken shale products routinely make shipments through New York and more must be done to ensure that cargo is carried safely.

I look forward to hearing the results of your investigation and working with you to implement safer standards and procedures to prevent future train derailments. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or my staff.
