Letter to the Hon. Wilbur Ross, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce - On the heels of +$1.5 million in funding from Appalachian Regional Commission for Southern Tier Network in corning, Schumer calls for EDA to immediately award a matching $1.5 million in federal dollars to get critical broadband project started ASAP


Dear Secretary Ross:

I am pleased to write in support of Southern Tier Network, Inc.'s (STN) application to the United States Economic Development Administration's (EDA) Public Works grant program for funding to construct high capacity fiber optic cable in order to create a redundant and diverse pathway within its 500+ mile optical network.

With funding, STN proposes a regional build, which will improve their high speed network in six New York counties, including Steuben, Schuler, Chemung, Yates, Tompkins and Tioga. The additional fiber optic pathways are essential to strengthening the integrity of the STN high-speed broadband network and ensuring that local businesses, government, schools and hospitals retain fast and reliable internet service. These diverse routes are strategically planned to provide "ring redundancy," mitigating future service outages.

I applaud Southern Tier Network, Inc. for their foresight, and sincerely hope the application meets with your approval.

Thank you for your consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact me or my Grants Coordinator in my Washington, DC office at 202-224-6542.
