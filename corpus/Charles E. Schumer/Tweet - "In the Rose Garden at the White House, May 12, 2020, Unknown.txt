Tweet - "In the Rose Garden at the White House, President Trump said we have met the moment and prevailed.  With over 1.3 million infected and over 80,000 American fatalities?  With more than 30 million unemployed?  A stunning disregard for the truth. We need to act big and bold now."


"In the Rose Garden at the White House, President Trump said we have met the moment and prevailed.

With over 1.3 million infected and over 80,000 American fatalities?

With more than 30 million unemployed?

A stunning disregard for the truth. We need to act big and bold now."
