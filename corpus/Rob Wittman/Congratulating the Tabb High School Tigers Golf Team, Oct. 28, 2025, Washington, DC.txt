Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Tabb High  School Tigers Golf Team of York County, Virginia, for winning the  Virginia Class 3, Region A Golf Championship--their first regional  title since 2001.

The Tigers were led by Cooper Guldin, whose round of 74 earned him  the individual medalist honor followed by outstanding performances from  Jack Houseknecht and Brodi Bartee, who each contributed standout  performances shooting their lowest scores of the season, Ethan  Thompson, Chriss Bassett, and Ainsley Asbury.

Competing among seven strong teams at Dogwood Trace Golf Course in  Petersburg, the Tigers captured the championship by narrowly edging  York High School by just three shots for the victory. This hard-fought  win secured Tabb a well-earned berth in the Virginia High School League  (VHSL) state tournament and marked a historic return to regional  prominence for the golf team.

Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in congratulating the Tabb High  School Tigers Golf Team of York County, Virginia. May they continue to  represent their school with great pride.
