Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate National Adoption Month  this November, I find myself reflecting on the profound impact adoption  has had on my life.

When I was born, my birth mother made the courageous decision to  place me up for adoption, and I spent my first few months in the loving  care of the Children's Home Society of Virginia in downtown Richmond.

At just 8 months old, I was blessed to be adopted by extraordinary  parents who taught me the values of resilience and community service,  shaping who I am today.

This year, the Children's Home Society of Virginia proudly celebrates  its 125th anniversary of dedicated service and commitment to finding  families for children in need.

Adoption is a powerful act of love that provides children with the  opportunity to grow up in a supportive environment where they can  thrive much like I did.

National Adoption Month serves as a reminder of the importance of  raising awareness about the needs of children in the foster care system  and the families who open their hearts and homes to them.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating the gift of adoption.
