Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to formally recognize an  exceptional young student, Madeline Brobst, a senior at Franklin  Christian Academy who has received a perfect composite score of 36 on  the ACT exam. Through disciplined study, steady composure during  examinations, and unwavering commitment of time and talent, Ms. Brobst  has achieved academic success and joined the ranks of the best and  brightest students in Tennessee and our country.

In addition to her intellectual capability, Ms. Brobst serves as a  mentor to eighth grade students at Franklin Christian Academy; she is a  member of the Student Leadership Team, National Honor Society, and the  worship team during school chapel services. During her time at Franklin  Christian Academy, Ms. Brobst has participated in numerous theatrical  and musical productions.

It is with great distinction and pride that I honor Madeline for  achieving a perfect ACT score, a remarkable feat accomplished by only a  very small percentage of students nationwide. This achievement places  her among the most academically accomplished students in our country  and reflects a level of brilliance that is truly commendable.

Earning a perfect score on the ACT is a testament to remarkable  intellectual ability, diligent preparation, and an unparalleled  commitment to academic excellence. It demonstrates not only mastery  across English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, but also the  persistence, focus, and determination required to perform at the  highest level under rigorous testing conditions.

Madeline's dedication to learning and pursuing the highest standards  of performance speaks to both her exceptional aptitude and her strong  character. Achievements of this caliber do not occur by chance; they  are the result of sustained hard work, personal sacrifice, and a  devoted commitment to excellence.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating  Madeline Brobst on this milestone of academic distinction. We commend  her for this outstanding accomplishment and look forward with  confidence to the many successes that will undoubtedly follow in her  academic and professional journey.
