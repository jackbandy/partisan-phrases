Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Regan Hinson  and her service and contributions to Virginia's First District and the  Nation.

Regan always served our office and our team well. Always a friendly  face in the office, she was highly motivated and energetic about her  work and her relationships. Regan was very committed to connecting with  the wonderful people and beautiful landscapes of Virginia's First  District, both of which featured heavily in her communications on  behalf of our office.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in recognizing the service and  accomplishments of Regan Hinson. May the Lord bless her as she embarks  on a new challenge, and I look forward to seeing her continued success  in the future.
