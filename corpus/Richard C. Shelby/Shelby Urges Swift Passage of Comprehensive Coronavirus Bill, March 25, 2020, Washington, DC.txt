Shelby Urges Swift Passage of Comprehensive Coronavirus Bill


Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) today urged his Senate colleagues to support the advancement of the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which contains $339.855 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations to aid Americans during the coronavirus crisis.  More than 80 percent of the total funding provided in the coronavirus emergency supplemental appropriations division of the package will go directly to state and local governments.  The Senate is scheduled to vote today to advance the comprehensive package.

 

"A crisis of this magnitude demands bold action and considerable resources, and that's what we're working to provide for American families, workers, and businesses in this bipartisan package," said Chairman Shelby.  "States and localities facing this head-on are in desperate need of federal support.  Delivering these resources and providing relief is our responsibility.  I urge my colleagues to unify and support this legislation without reservation.  We must get this package to the President's desk expeditiously.  There is no time to waste."

 

The emergency supplemental appropriations portion of the legislation brings to bear the full resources of the federal government, including $117 billion for hospitals and veterans' health care; $11 billion for vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and other preparedness needs; $4.3 billion for the Centers for Disease Control; $16 billion for the Strategic National Stockpile; and $45 billion for FEMA disaster relief fund, among other things. 

 The comprehensive CARES Act will direct financial help for the American people, provide urgent relief for small businesses and their employees, take significant steps to stabilize our economy and protect jobs, and support the brave healthcare professionals and patients who are fighting the coronavirus on the front lines.
