Shelby Applauds Senate Passage of USMCA


U.S. Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) today applauded passage of H.R. 5430, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Implementation Act.  The measure was approved by a vote of 89-10 and is designed to boost economic growth by modernizing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  The trade agreement will now move to President Trump's desk for a signature. 

"Passage of this important trade pact is a significant win for our state and nation's farmers, manufacturers, workers, and businesses," said Senator Shelby.  "The agreement not only improves our trade policies, but it also counteracts many of the negative effects of NAFTA.  I commend President Trump on this legislative victory and look forward to the job creation and robust economic growth that will result from implementing USMCA."

In 2018, Alabama exported $6.6 billion in services and commodities to Canada and Mexico.  This trade deal will continue to boost trade throughout Alabama and the nation and serve the interests of Alabama's workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses.  It will also support mutually beneficial trade leading to free markets, fair trade, and continued economic growth in North America.

The Senate Appropriations Committee, of which Senator Shelby serves as chairman, in addition to six other committees, advanced the agreement on Wednesday by a vote of 29-2.
