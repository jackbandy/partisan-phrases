Senators Doug Jones and Tom Cotton Applaud Treasury's Adoption of Their Proposal to Use Debit Cards to Disburse COVID Relief Payments


U.S. Senators Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who serve together on the Senate Banking Committee, today applauded the announcement by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the Administration will adopt the senators' proposal to use debit cards to expedite distribution of CARES Act relief payments to eligible Americans. The senators released the following statement:

"We are very pleased that the Administration will implement our suggestion to use prepaid debit cards to make coronavirus relief payments to eligible Americans. Using debit cards instead of paper checks will be a faster, safer way to distribute payments for struggling American families trying to social distance, pay the bills, and navigate life during this pandemic."

Senators Jones and Cotton wrote to Secretary Mnuchin earlier this month requesting that the Treasury Department expedite the CARES Act direct assistance payments by making them available on debit cards for certain eligible groups of Americans.
