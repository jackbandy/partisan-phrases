Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we face a serious global crisis today with  the spread of the coronavirus. We all know that. The American people, I  believe, expect us here in the U.S. Senate to set aside politics and  set into motion a swift and sweeping response to this danger. Yesterday  was a big step in that direction. 

  I and Vice Chairman Leahy, who is on the floor here with me, in  conjunction with the leaders on both sides and with our House  counterparts, introduced a comprehensive plan that provides our experts  and agencies on the frontlines with the resources they tell us they  need to combat this crisis. 

  The package we introduced includes $7.8 billion in discretionary  appropriations for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the  National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the  State Department, the USAID, and the Small Business Administration. The  package also authorizes an additional $500 million in mandatory  spending for telehealth through Medicare. Combined, this emergency  supplemental provides $8.3 billion in resources to attack the crisis at  the local, State, Federal, and international levels. 

  In situations like this, I believe no expense should be spared to  protect the American people, and in crafting this package, none was. It  is an aggressive plan, a vigorous plan, that has received an  overwhelming positive reaction in the House and in the marketplace. It  is  the Senate's responsibility today to keep the momentum going. 

  I urge my colleagues to vote yes and demonstrate to the American  people that we here in the Senate are unified and have their backs on  this crisis.
