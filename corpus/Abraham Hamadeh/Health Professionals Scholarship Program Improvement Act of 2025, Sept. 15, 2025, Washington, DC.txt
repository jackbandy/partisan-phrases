Mr. HAMADEH of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of my bill, H.R. 3767, the Health Professionals Scholarship Program  Improvement Act of 2025.

As too many taxpayers well know, the VA spends millions of our hard- earned taxpayer dollars training healthcare professionals through  scholarships, yet, these same qualified professionals are forced to  wait months for employment contracts after graduation. All the while,  our veterans suffer.

It is government inefficiency at its worst, and our veterans seem to  always be paying the price. Veterans are sent to emergency rooms while  skilled doctors are waiting to serve patients.

That is why I introduced this bipartisan legislation with my  colleague, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski, because we saw a program that  required action. Bureaucratic red tape is the enemy.

The reports by the inspector general are a testament to what veterans  in my district already know: Staffing shortfalls are more than a  figure. They are missed appointments, endless long waits, and  canceled procedures.

American heroes' lives are at stake. Back home in Arizona, the  Phoenix VA Health Care System covers 100,000 veterans. The Southern  Arizona VA Health Care System covers yet another 170,000. Every one of  them deserves access to qualified providers.

Arizona's Eighth District alone has 65,000 veterans. These patients  deserve better than bureaucratic incompetence when they need medical  care. They did not wait to defend America, and America should not make  them wait for healthcare.

My bill offers a simple and commonsense fix. HPSP scholarship  recipients will be given offers of jobs within 90 days post-graduation.  They will not wait. Veterans will not be forgotten. We are going to  drain the VA swamp one regulation at a time.

Our bill also requires an annual report to Congress on hire dates and  placement rates. Transparency generates performance.

We are not just addressing the issue today. We are ensuring  bureaucrats cannot hide and escape tomorrow.

To those who would say 90 days is too aggressive, my response is: How  long should a veteran wait? How long should a trained physician sit  idle? The current state is intolerable. The status quo has failed, and  it is time for genuine reform.

Mr. Speaker, I have seen firsthand what occurs when the systems fail  for those on the front lines overseas. We cannot allow failure at home.  When I served as an Army intelligence officer overseas, we lived by a  simple creed: Mission first, and no Americans left behind.

My bill is an embodiment to that promise. This isn't partisan  posturing. This is about doing right by America's warfighters. The  House Committee on Veterans' Affairs agreed. They voted for my bill by  voice vote without opposition. There was zero dissent. There was  complete consensus and stakeholder support. It is now time for the  entire House to deliver.

Mr. Speaker, every day of delay is another day a veteran waits for  care. It is another day a qualified professional can't serve. It is  another day the system fails those who have served and protected us  all. It is another day the swamp wins and our heroes lose.

We ask our veterans to wait for many things. Quality healthcare  shouldn't be one of them, not in President Trump's America and not on  our watch.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the HPSP  Improvement Act. Our veterans have waited long enough. We must deliver  on the promise we made to the brave men and women who served our  country. It is time to put veterans first.
