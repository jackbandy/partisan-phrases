Commending Myesha Cooper and Robert Johnson, South Fulton Police Officers


Mrs. McBATH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend two City of South  Fulton police officers, Sergeant Myesha Cooper and Officer Robert  Johnson.

On Saturday, August 16, Sergeant Cooper and Officer Johnson were  called to the scene of an accident where they swiftly rescued a mother  and her two children from an overturned vehicle.

As I continue to reflect on an invigorating August work period, it is  a privilege to come back to Washington to uplift and to amplify the  everyday stories of exceptional bravery and quiet heroism that can be  found all across my district.

These two police officers represent the very best of law enforcement,  and I am honored to recognize their service to my community back home.

On behalf of my office, the Sixth Congressional District of Georgia,  and the United States House of Representatives, I thank Sergeant Cooper  and Officer Johnson.                  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Mrs. McBATH. Mr. Speaker, our public health system is on life support  while Secretary Kennedy pulls the plug on lifesaving programs.

Just 9 months in, he fired his own CDC director and has forced out  disease experts who protected us through a pandemic and disease  outbreaks.

He has perpetuated distrust in vaccines, while we see the highest  number of measles cases in more than three decades.

He has decimated gun violence prevention research while 10,000 people  have been killed by gun violence, and that is just so far this year,  including Georgia officer David Rose, who was shot and killed while  defending CDC employees from a gunman who was provoked by anti-vaxing  rhetoric.

While CDC's staff reels from the violence that they have witnessed,  they face threats to the work that they do that keeps us safe and  healthy. Our public servants who have dedicated their lives to the  health of others deserve better. The American people deserve better.
