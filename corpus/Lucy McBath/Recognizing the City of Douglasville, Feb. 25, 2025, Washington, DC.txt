Mrs. McBATH. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize the City of  Douglasville on the occasion of its Sesquicentennial Birthday. For 150  years, Douglasville has contributed to the rich history of the state of  Georgia, and I am honored to uplift today's remarkable milestone. Back  home in my district, constituents will gather this evening at the  Douglas County Museum of History & Art for a reflection on the history  of the city and a celebration of the progress they hope to make in the  future.

I want to commend Mayor Rochelle Robinson, the Douglasville City  Council, and every resident who made this week's celebration possible.  It is thanks to the devotion of public servants like them who make  Douglasville such a wonderful community in which to live, work, and  raise a family.

I congratulate the City of Douglasville on reaching 150 years, and  Happy Birthday.
