Mrs. McBATH. Mr. Speaker, I thank both of our leaders this evening,  Representative Hoyer and Representative Clyburn, for making sure that  we never forget.

Mr. Speaker, today we pause on the 5-year anniversary of one of the  darkest days of our democracy. On January 6, rioters stormed the heart  of American Government and sought to overthrow the will of the people  with bats and clubs. Now, the individual responsible for promoting such  baseless allegations once again occupies the highest office in the  land.

I extend profound gratitude for the Capitol Police who stood on the  front lines on that terrible day. I thank my colleagues, our appointed  officials, and every congressional staff member who worked to ensure  that the true will of the American people was done.

I urge every citizen that is watching today to remember that the eyes  of the world have not looked away in the 5 years since. We must work to  ensure that the American ideals of freedom, justice and liberty endure  for generations to come. Never, ever forget.
