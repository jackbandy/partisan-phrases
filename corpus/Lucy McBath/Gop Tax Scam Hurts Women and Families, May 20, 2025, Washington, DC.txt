Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families

Mrs. McBATH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to attempts by  Republicans to slash healthcare that millions rely on just to benefit  Elon Musk and the friends of the President.

Almost 14 million Americans will lose healthcare coverage if this  plan is successful. This is life or death.

In my home State of Georgia, these Republican cuts impact 2 million  people, real people. A single mother in Atlanta working two jobs is now  facing losing her Medicaid. A veteran in rural Georgia now has to face  red tape just to get the benefits he earned serving our country. This  isn't about accountability. It is about taking food and healthcare from  people who need it most.

People have seen how these policies fail. In Georgia, red tape and  paperwork errors have already kicked thousands off their healthcare  coverage, even when they are eligible.

This isn't reform. This is cruelty. My colleagues need to protect  healthcare for working families, not strip away their lifeline.
