Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025

Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  bipartisan CLARITY Act, commonsense legislation that finally gives  digital asset markets the regulatory certainty they need to grow  responsibly right here in the United States.

For too long, innovators have been stuck in a regulatory gray zone  caught between agencies and overlapping authority and subject to  enforcement instead of clear rules.

The uncertainty has driven jobs, investment, and innovation offshore  while leaving American consumers exposed.

The CLARITY Act fixes this. It establishes clear, functional rules  for digital assets, drawing a bright line between the SEC and the CFTC  and creating strong, enforceable protections for consumers.

It ensures the digital assets developers and consumer-facing firms  play by the rules, disclosing who owns what, segregating customer  funds, and avoiding conflicts of interest.

It is long overdue, and I commend the chairmen for bringing this bill  to the floor today.
