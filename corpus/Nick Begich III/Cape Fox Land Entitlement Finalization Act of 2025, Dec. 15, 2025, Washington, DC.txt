Mr. BEGICH. Mr. Speaker, Alaska's future is tied to land. It is how  we build infrastructure, develop our resources, and create  opportunities for our communities, but for far too long, Alaska Native  Corporations have faced unnecessary delays and constraints in securing  the lands they were promised under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement  Act.

After more than 50 years, Cape Fox Corporation, representing the  village of Saxman, is among the last southeast villages still waiting  for a full land entitlement.

H.R. 2815 fixes that. The bill authorizes a simple strategic land  exchange, about 180 acres, to finally connect two Cape Fox parcels and  honor a promise made decades ago.

This bill also paves the way for a renewable energy corridor and  year-round access to vital subsistence and tourism areas. It enables  local development, supports energy independence, and strengthens  southeast Alaska's economy, all while respecting Tribal sovereignty and  the original intent of ANCSA.

There is strong local support for this bill from utilities,  businesses, and local governments. It is a commonsense, consensus- driven solution. Let's finish what Congress started and deliver  resolution to the people of Saxman.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2815 and help move  the people of Saxman forward.
