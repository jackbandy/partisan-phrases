Mr. BEGICH. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on  H.R. 410, the Alaska Native Vietnam Era Veterans Land Allotment  Extension Act of 2025.

This bill extends the application period for the Alaska Native  Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program by 5 years, ensuring  eligible veterans can claim the land that they were promised.

For decades, thousands of Alaska Native veterans who served in  Vietnam were unfairly denied the ability to apply for land allotments  due to their service overseas. While Congress took steps to correct  this injustice, the executive branch until recently has been slowly  processing eligibility applications and conveyances, leaving many  veterans in limbo. As of January 2025, out of more than 2,000 eligible  Alaska Native veterans, only 41 applications have been certified, and  only 18 veterans have received their conveyances.

Fortunately, executive orders issued by the current administration  have reinstated Federal land withdrawals previously revoked, returning  lands to the State of Alaska and unlocking lands that had been closed.  This expansion of available land increases opportunities for veterans  to select and receive their rightful allotments. This bill will give  these veterans time to participate in the program with ample land for  viable selections.

These veterans served our country honorably, and we need to make sure  that they are not denied what they were promised.

Thank you for your consideration of H.R. 410. I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.
