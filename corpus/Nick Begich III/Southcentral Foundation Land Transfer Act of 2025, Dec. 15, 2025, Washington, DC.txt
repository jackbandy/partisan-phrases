Southcentral Foundation Land Transfer Act of 2025

Mr. BEGICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3620, the  Southcentral Foundation Land Transfer Act of 2025. This is a bill that  reflects both common sense and compassion, and I am proud to sponsor  it.

Southcentral Foundation is a nationally respected Alaska Native  health provider, serving over 70,000 people with an integrated,  culturally grounded model of care that works. Some of the buildings  that they are using for behavioral health services, buildings like the  Quyana Clubhouse, are aging, inadequate, and, in some cases, were never  meant to facilitate medical services. One facility was literally a  former morgue.

Mr. Speaker, this legislation enables something critically important,  the ability to deliver modern mental health care in a space designed  for healing and recovery.

In Alaska, we face real challenges. People dealing with serious  mental illness are being served in locations that  were not designed for clinical care. That is unacceptable. They deserve  better--safe, dignified, purpose-built treatment environments that  reflect the seriousness of their needs and the inherent dignity of  their lives.

H.R. 3620 clears the way for Southcentral Foundation to build that  future. This bill transfers land already in use and allows Southcentral  Foundation to make long-term investments in modern infrastructure. The  bill supports Tribal self-determination, strengthens care delivery, and  empowers a trusted partner to do even more for our communities.

This is a narrowly tailored, fiscally responsible bill with broad  support. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in advancing this  measure and helping more Alaskans get the care that they deserve.

Mr. BEGICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3176, the bill to  reauthorize the National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System.

This is a program of national importance. Volcano monitoring  strengthens safety and emergency preparedness across the country, from  the Cascades to Hawaii to the Rockies, but there is no question that  Alaska has the most at stake.

Our State is home to over 130 active volcanos, by far the largest  concentration in the United States. These aren't isolated or dormant.  Mount Spurr, just 80 miles from Anchorage, reached a yellow alert level  due to elevated seismic activity earlier this year, and it is still  listed as a very high threat by the most recent edition of the USGS  National Volcanic Threat Assessment. If it erupts, as it did in 1992  and 1953, ashfall could shut down air traffic, damage critical  infrastructure, and put lives at risk.

H.R. 3176 is a straightforward, 5-year reauthorization that keeps the  program funded and operational. It maintains existing funding levels  but provides the U.S. Geological Survey and its partners with the  continuity that they need to monitor high-threat volcanos and  coordinate real-time alerts with emergency responders.

Early warning is essential. It gives pilots time to reroute, gives  communities time to prepare, and saves lives, especially in rural,  high-risk States like Alaska where response logistics are already  challenging.

This is a bipartisan, science-based system that works. I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 3176 and ensure that every community living  in the shadow of volcanic risk has the tools to stay safe.
