Young Commends 47th Annual March for Life


U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) issued the following statement regarding the 47th annual March for Life.

"As hundreds of Hoosiers come to Capitol Hill to show their support for the unborn, it is clear that Hoosiers are united behind our most fundamental right - the right to life" said Senator Young. "Last year, Indiana saw just how important it is to protect innocent life when more than 2,200 fetal remains were discovered in the home of the late Indiana abortionist Dr. Ulrich Klopfer. His blatant disregard of the sanctity of life stands in stark contrast to the pro-life principles supported by most Hoosiers. As I continue to serve the state of Indiana, I will always fight to protect life at all of its stages."

In 2019 Senator Young co-sponsored:  No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2019, Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, and the Dignity for Aborted Children Act.

 

In addition, Senator Young sat on the Board of Directors of the Hannah House in Bloomington, Indiana, which offers women loving support during pregnancy. He also spent two years as a small-town attorney offering legal services to parents who wanted to adopt.
