"As of this morning, the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) has confirmed the first Hoosier case of coronavirus. Under the leadership of Governor Holcomb, the state, in coordination with our medical community, was prepared and ready to respond. To further help our state and local governments in the days to come, I voted to pass $7.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding which has now been signed into law.

I will continue to work closely with our state and local officials as the situation unfolds," said Senator Young.
