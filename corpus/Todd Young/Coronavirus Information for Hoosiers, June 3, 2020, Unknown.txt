About the Coronavirus:

In December 2019, a newly discovered respiratory virus -- the 2019 Novel Coronavirus -- caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China. Similar to the common flu, the virus is thought to be transmitted from person-to-person via close contact or through droplets when a person sneezes or coughs. It may also be spread through contact with infected surfaces or objects. According the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms include: fever, cough, sore throat, difficulty breathing, and a general feeling of being unwell.   

U.S. public health agencies are closely monitoring the situation and are aggressively working on a response strategy, but it is important to take daily precautions to prevent the spread of germs. 

On January 29, Senators Young and Merkley urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the international coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). To read the letter, click here. 

On February 11, the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the current outbreak of coronavirus disease, COVID-19.
