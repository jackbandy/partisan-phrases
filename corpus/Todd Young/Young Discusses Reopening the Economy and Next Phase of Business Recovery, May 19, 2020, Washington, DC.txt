Young Discusses Reopening the Economy and Next Phase of Business Recovery


Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined Senate Republican leaders to discuss responsibly reopening the economy, his RESTART Act to enable the next phase of business recovery, and Nancy Pelosi's unworkable $3 trillion partisan bill.

"I am introducing a bill that I worked on with Senator Bennet that would make some commonsense changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, which incidentally provided $10 billion in loans to the state of Indiana and has saved over 50 million jobs. So it's been a fantastic program, we are finding that a number of people need a little bit more time to deploy those funds and thus have those loans forgiven. So we propose extending that time window from 8 weeks to 16 weeks and then establishing a RESTART program," said Senator Young.

"It's these sort of responsible provisions that need to be incorporated, I think, into our next round of response. Not a $3 trillion, far-left liberal wish list, which is what we've seen from Nancy Pelosi. Her proposal has been characterized as unserious and in a sense it is. When you are in the middle of a pandemic and you are proposing money for the U.S. Geological service, dealing with issues like cannabis, trying to make structural changes to our election system and federalizing our elections. Look the American people, we don't want structural changes at this time. We want to go back to work quickly and as safely as possible. That's what the republican controlled Senate is focused on and we are going to be working on this every step of the way with the President of the United States," Senator Young continued.

Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) will be formally introducing the Reviving the Economy Sustainably Towards a Recovery in Twenty-Twenty (RESTART) Act this week. Learn more HERE.
