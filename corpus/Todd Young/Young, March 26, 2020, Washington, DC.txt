Young, Murphy Call On Houthi Authorities To Stop Obstructing Humanitarian Aid


U.S. Senators Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), both members of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Thursday called for Houthi authorities in Yemen to stop restricting humanitarian assistance from reaching Yemeni citizens ahead of a Friday deadline. The Senators also called for an immediate halt to violence in the region and a return to negotiations involving all parties to the conflict to bring an end to the now five year long war.

"The coronavirus pandemic has yet to hit Yemen, but as it sweeps through the Middle East, it is just a matter of time. It's unconscionable that Houthi authorities would impose unacceptable restrictions on the ability of the United Nations and other aid organizations to deliver assistance to millions of people in need," said Young and Murphy. "We are calling on Houthi officials to stop obstructing humanitarian aid from reaching Yemeni civilians while the country is teetering on the brink of starvation and famine. And although we are encouraged by the news of a possible ceasefire by warring forces in Yemen, absent an immediate halt to violence and a return to negotiations, people will continue to suffer."
