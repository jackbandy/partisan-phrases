Young Gives Coronavirus Update


U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) today spoke about the coronavirus and steps being taken to protect Hoosiers, prevent the spread of the disease, and minimize the economic impact.  

 

"We're preparing for the absolute worst so the absolute worst doesn't happen. That is a good way to think about the process we are going through right now. We are certainly trying to contain and prevent the spread of coronavirus to the extent we can. We're learning more everyday about this virus. We want to minimize the economic impact and we're weighing a number of different policy measures to figure out how to most responsibly and responsively respond to the needs of our economy," said Senator Young.
