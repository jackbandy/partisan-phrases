Senator Young Statement on Yemen Ceasefire


U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) today issued the following statement regarding the ceasefire in Yemen:

"The threat of a coronavirus outbreak in Yemen would be a devastating blow to a people that have been struggling for years to meet their basic needs. This pandemic knows no boundaries, religious beliefs, or political affiliations. It is only when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Houthis, the Government of Yemen and all other parties come together in recognition of our shared humanity that we can combat this virus and end further suffering of the people of Yemen. As a tireless advocate for ending the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, I hope and pray that this moment will bring about lasting peace."
