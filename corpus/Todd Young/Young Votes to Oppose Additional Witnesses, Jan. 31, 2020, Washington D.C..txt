Young Votes to Oppose Additional Witnesses


U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) today issued the following statement regarding his vote to oppose additional witnesses in the impeachment trial:

"It would establish a dangerous precedent if the Senate were to fix defective articles of impeachment. If the House felt that additional witnesses and evidence were necessary to prove their case, they should have pursued these legal disputes in the courts to protect the rights of the accused. This is exactly what our Founding Fathers' carefully designed system of constitutional checks and balances calls for. In their rush to impeach this President, the House did not follow the appropriate process. It is for this reason, that I am duty bound to oppose the motion to call additional witnesses."
