Young Calls for Passage of Two Pro-Life Bills to Protect Innocent Children


U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) today spoke about protecting the rights of unborn children and the need to pass two bills being voted on in the Senate today: the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Senator Young is a cosponsor of both bills.

 

"Pro-life principles are supported by a majority of Americans and these bills are critical to protect all of our children," said Senator Young. "Last year in Indiana, the horrific discovery of more than 2,000 aborted children was made in the basement of the late South Bend abortionist Dr. Klopfer. This sickening discovery underscores how important it is for our colleagues to join with us to protect innocent life. We need to come together and pass these bills for the sake of our children."
