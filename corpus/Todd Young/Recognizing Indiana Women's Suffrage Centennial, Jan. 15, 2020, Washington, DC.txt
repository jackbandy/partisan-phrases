Recognizing Indiana Women's Suffrage Centennial


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise to formally recognize an important  event that will be occurring in my home State of Indiana this week. 

  On Thursday, January 16, the Indiana Women's Suffrage Centennial  Commission will be hosting a celebration at the Indiana Statehouse to  commemorate the 100th anniversary of Indiana ratifying the 19th  Amendment. Moreover, the Indiana General Assembly will present a  resolution honoring this historic milestone and the Hoosiers who led  the way to ensure equal representation for women in their government. 

  As we celebrate the anniversary, it is important we acknowledge that  the record of Hoosiers seeking equal voting rights for women goes back  to the 1850s, when Amanda Way, a Winchester native, organized the  Indiana Woman's Rights Association and called for its first convention.  This act of passionate leadership was just the beginning of a  generation-spanning story of determination, sacrifice, and advocacy.  Countless women and men followed in Amanda's footsteps and continued to  campaign for the betterment of their society and government. Nearly 70  years later, these Hoosiers' tireless efforts led to Indiana becoming  the 26th State in the Union to ratify the 19th Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution, prohibiting States from denying the right to vote on the  basis of sex. 

  The centennial of women's suffrage is an opportunity to highlight  Indiana's leadership in uniting communities, tearing down barriers to  better relationships, and promoting representative governance. On  behalf of all Hoosiers, I wish Indiana continued success as it  commemorates and recognizes a proud history of supporting equality and  constitutional freedom.
