Young Statement on Iran War Powers Resolution


U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) today issued the following statement regarding his vote on the Iran war powers resolution:

 

"I commend President Trump's decisive leadership taking out the terrorist mastermind Qasem Soleimani. Let's be clear, our nation and the world is safer today with Soleimani dead.  Now we are dealing with Iran from a position of strength and I believe the result will be a safer and more stable Middle East.

 

"Consideration of this resolution would not be necessary if, over the years, Congress had been more serious about fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities. 

 

"Unfortunately, for nearly two decades, Congress has been AWOL on certain matters of national security and attempted to pass the buck to our Commander in Chief when things go wrong. It's time for us to do our job. As a Marine, I have been a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform by reasserting Congress' war making powers, and the need to jump start long overdue debates about our military engagements around the world.

 

"Following today's vote, I will continue working with my colleagues to ensure Congress restores its appropriate constitutional role as I support President Trump's efforts to ensure we do not become immersed in forever wars."
