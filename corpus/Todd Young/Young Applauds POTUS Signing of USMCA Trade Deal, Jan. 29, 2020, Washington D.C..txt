Young Applauds POTUS Signing of USMCA Trade Deal


U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) today issued the following statement regarding President Donald Trump signing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Implementation Act:

"Now that President Trump has signed the USMCA Implementation Act into law, Hoosiers have the certainty needed to grow businesses, create jobs and increase exports. Over 60,000 manufacturing jobs in Indiana are directly tied to trade with our closest neighbors, and our 94,000 farmers will be able to increase exports by $2.2 billion with this historic agreement. I look forward to seeing USMCA fully implemented over the coming months," said Senator Young.

USMCA will modernize the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and support freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth in North America.

Senator Young has been an ardent supporter of this historic trade deal, signing multiple letters to Ambassador Lighthizer and working with his Senate colleagues to secure its passage, including:

Publicly calling for USMCA's passage after a full year of languishing in the house.Issuing statements of support.Reaffirming his commitment to seeing the USMCA signed into law during press conferences.Voting to pass the USMCA out of the Senate Finance Committee and out of the full Senate.
