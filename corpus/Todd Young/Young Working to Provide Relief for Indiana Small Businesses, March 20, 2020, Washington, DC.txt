Young Working to Provide Relief for Indiana Small Businesses


U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.), a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today announced he is working with Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and members of the committee to secure the Keeping Workers Paid and Employed Act in the Senate's phase 3 economic relief package.

 

The Keeping Workers Paid and Employed Act is a $300 billion small business emergency economic relief plan that will help small businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic make payroll and cover expenses. A section by section can be found here.

 

"Small businesses in Indiana are hurting. We must offer relief so these businesses can keep their doors open and pay their employees," said Senator Young. "I'm working with Senator Rubio and my colleagues on the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee to ensure that these critical provisions are included in the next economic relief package."
