Information on the Coronavirus for Hoosiers


In December 2019, a newly discovered respiratory virus -- the 2019 Novel Coronavirus -- caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China. Similar to the common flu, the virus transmits from person-to-person via droplets when a person sneezes or coughs. According the Center for Disease Control, symptoms include: fever, cough, sore throat, difficulty breathing, and a general feeling of being unwell.  

U.S. public health agencies are closely monitoring the situation and are aggressively working on a response strategy, but it is important to take daily precautions to prevent the spread of germs. My office is encouraging Hoosiers to learn more transmission, prevention, and treatment by visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, click here. 

On January 29, Senators Young and Merkley urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the international coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). To read the full letter, click here.
