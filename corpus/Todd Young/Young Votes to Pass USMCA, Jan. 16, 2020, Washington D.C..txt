Young Votes to Pass USMCA, A Win for American Workers and Farmers


Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) voted to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Implementation Act. The trade agreement passed on an 89-10 vote.

"House Democrats held up USMCA for over a year. During that time, tens of thousands of Hoosier jobs supported by exports to Canada and Mexico have been on the line. Today, the Senate passed this historic trade agreement and marked a win for American workers," said Senator Young. "This agreement is finally able to help modernize the outdated and unworkable North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). I'm proud to support USMCA, which secures freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth in America."
