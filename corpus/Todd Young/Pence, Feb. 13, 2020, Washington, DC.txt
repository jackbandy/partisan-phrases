Pence, Young Introduce Resolution to Honor 75th Anniversary of Iwo Jima


U.S. Representative Greg Pence (IN-06) and Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) today introduced a Joint Resolution to honor the 75th Anniversary of the Battle for Iwo Jima during World War II. The resolution recognizes the bravery and heroism demonstrated 75 years ago during the victory that was led by the United States Marine Corps on the island of Iwo Jima.

Next month, Congressman Pence and Senator Young will participate in a congressional delegation to Iwo Jima, now known as Iwo-To, to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima.

"As a Beirut Veteran, I understand that our first duty is to remember. The 75th anniversary of the Battle for Iwo Jima is a time to remember and honor the relentless courage of our men and women in uniform. Our Marines took Iwo Jima at a heavy cost, but their bravery made possible the Allied Victory in World War II. It is one of the deadliest days in Marine Corps history, and those heroes will never be forgotten,"said Congressman Pence. "I had the solemn experience of going to Iwo Jima when I was deployed as a Marine. I am honored to return this year with the Commandant of the Marine Corps to remember the nearly 7,000 Marines who made the ultimate sacrifice at the Battle for Iwo Jima."

"Iwo Jima is hallowed ground for me, my fellow Marines, and all those who lost loved ones in the battle. This resolution helps to recognize those who gave their lives in Iwo Jima seventy-five years ago," said Senator Young. "The resolution also calls upon Americans to honor these veterans and reaffirm the deep bonds of friendship
