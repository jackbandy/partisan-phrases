Young: Energy Bill Benefits Hoosier Jobs, National Security, Energy Prices


U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) today spoke about the energy package the Senate is considering week. The American Energy Innovation Act contains more than 50 bipartisan measures that prioritize innovation and investments in our energy economy to help grow Hoosier jobs, strengthen national security, and lower energy costs.

"We know that the economy is strong, that unemployment is at a 50-year low, that wages are rising, that people are optimistic about the future -- and yet still people have a difficult time making ends meet -- why is that? Well, the cost of the things we buy oftentimes is too high and there are some responsible public policies that we can put forward to address that," said Senator Young. "Whether it's housing affordability, or health care, or childcare expenses, or higher education expenses, we've been offering solutions in all manner of these things and this energy legislation fits right within that broader theme of affordability."
