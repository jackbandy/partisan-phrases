Young Statement on Paycheck Protection Program Funding Lapse


U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) today issued the following statement regarding funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, which lapsed today:

 

"The Paycheck Protection Program has helped tens of thousands of Hoosier businesses make it through this challenging time and keep their employees on payroll, but there are countless more still in need of assistance. Speaker Nancy Pelosi's refusal to provide additional funding for this bipartisan program is indefensible. I will continue fighting on behalf of Indiana to ensure this program has the funding it needs to protect Hoosier paychecks," said Senator Young.   

 

Earlier this week, Senator Young announced 23,583 Paycheck Protection Program loans have been approved in Indiana totaling just under $6 billion.
