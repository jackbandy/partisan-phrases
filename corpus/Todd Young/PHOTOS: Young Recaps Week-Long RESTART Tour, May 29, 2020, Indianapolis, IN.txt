PHOTOS: Young Recaps Week-Long RESTART Tour


U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) today concluded his week-long RESTART Tour after meeting with job-creators in eight Indiana cities. Senator Young visited small businesses across the state to discuss the RESTART Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Young and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) to improve the Paycheck Protection Program and provide additional assistance to the businesses hardest-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

"From Catablu Restaurant in Fort Wayne to Arni's Market Square in Lafayette, I had the opportunity to hear from small businesses in all corners of the state this week about the challenges they are facing and how our RESTART Act can help get them back on their feet," said Senator Young. "As the Senate continues debating the next phase of coronavirus relief, I will work to ensure our bill moves forward to help jump-start our hardest-hit businesses for the remainder of 2020." 

Senator Young visited Fort Wayne, South Bend, Valparaiso, Evansville, New Albany, Terre Haute, Lafayette, and Carmel. Photos from each event are included below.
