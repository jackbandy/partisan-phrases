Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, you guys are so weak that you won't even  vote to release the files. It is 11:20 p.m. in the middle of the night,  and once again, you are trying to jam your dark agenda through Congress  in the dark of night.

It makes me wonder: Have you even read this bill? I mean, really,  because this bill rescinds $9 billion for international aid, public  health, and public media. It will make America less safe. It will  undermine our national security. It will threaten lives across the  world and kill children.

On top of that, it undermines our Constitution, the power of the  people, the power of the purse, and the separation of powers in our  Constitution, as Russell Vought, OMB, and the architects of Project  2025 are trying to use this rescission bill to undermine the power of  Congress.

That is why we will vote ``no,'' a ``hell no'' to the blatant power  grab that it represents in the face of the chaotic and corrupt  administration and Congress that is stealing from our people.
