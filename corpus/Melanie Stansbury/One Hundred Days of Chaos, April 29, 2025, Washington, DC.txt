One Hundred Days of Chaos, Dysfunction, and Attacks

Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 100th day of this  administration. One hundred days of chaos, dysfunction, and attacks.  Attacks on our democracy, our communities, and our environment,  rollback protections for climate and clean energy, for our air, land,  water, and wildlife.

Here just 1 week after the 55th anniversary of Earth Day, my  colleagues across the aisle are putting forth a set of resolutions to  gut protections for clean air and public lands across the West, while  they prepare a reconciliation package next week that would open our  public lands to oil and gas drilling, selling them to the lowest  bidder, and repealing historic investments in climate and clean energy.

To think that just 55 years ago, a historic bipartisan people's  movement led the United States in leading the world to protect our air,  land, and water. We are here today to say we are not going back and we  will continue to fight for our planet and our communities.
