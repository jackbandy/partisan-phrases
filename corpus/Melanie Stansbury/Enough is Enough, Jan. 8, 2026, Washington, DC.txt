Enough is Enough

Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the House floor with a  heavy heart for the family and the community of Renee Nicole Good.

My heart is heavy and not just because of the unabashed and violent  killing that happened last night by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, but  because I am also sad for our country, to see the Vice President of the  United States and officials impugn a young woman who leaves behind her  community and an orphaned child.

This is not our country. Shame on you. To those of you who are  continuing to provide cover for this lawless, unconstitutional,  abusive, and violent administration, shame on you.

I will be joining to file Articles of Impeachment against Secretary  Noem. Enough is enough.
