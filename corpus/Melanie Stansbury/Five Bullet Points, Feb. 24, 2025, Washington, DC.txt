Five Bullet Points


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, Federal employees found themselves  targeted yesterday by yet another reckless scare tactic by Elon Musk.  As they were asked for five bullet points to demonstrate what they  accomplished last week, a failure to comply would result in their  termination by resignation according to a tweet by Elon Musk.

Hours later, Trump officials in the same administration told their  staff not to respond. In solidarity, let me say what my five bullets  for the week are: I fought to defend the Constitution and the rule of  law. I fought back against these reckless assaults on our people. I  heard the heartbreaking stories of how they are impacting New Mexico. I  met with Tribal leaders, Federal employees, and hundreds of New  Mexicans. I headed back here to D.C. to take back the fight because we  will not stop this fight.

We will not allow this chaos, this incompetence, and this lawlessness  to go unchecked. I want all Americans to hear me: We will fight back.
