Holding This Administration to Account

Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump says that he isn't sure if  he needs to uphold the Constitution. It is clear to all of us from his  attacks on the courts, the rule of law, our democratic institutions,  our civil and legal rights, an open and free press, the dismantling of  Federal agencies, and attacks on our communities that, indeed, he does  not know what his constitutional duties are.

I have to say, Mr. Speaker, we are a nation of laws, a nation  governed by a Constitution of the people and by the people. Donald  Trump and his administration are not above the law. We will hold them  to account, and that is why we are here every day fighting back,  pushing back, and defending our democracy and the rights of the  American people.
