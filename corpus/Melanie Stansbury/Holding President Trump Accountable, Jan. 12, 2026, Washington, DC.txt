Holding President Trump Accountable


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, the American people want to know why the  President of the United States and the Department of Justice are going  after the Chairman of the Federal Reserve before they go after  coconspirators in the Epstein case.

Mr. Speaker, the American people want to know why Donald Trump is  using their taxpayer dollars to invade foreign countries and threaten  our allies, but claims to not have enough money to fund American  healthcare.

Mr. Speaker, the American people want to know why the President and  Vice President are giving cover for lawless shootings by Federal agents  while using political excuses to withhold funding for our communities,  for public safety, housing, childcare, and food.

Mr. Speaker, the American people didn't ask for this. They asked for  safe communities to ensure they can live their lives with dignity and  opportunity and to leave a country their children can be proud of.

Mr. Speaker, this is not that. We will continue to fight and hold  this President accountable.
