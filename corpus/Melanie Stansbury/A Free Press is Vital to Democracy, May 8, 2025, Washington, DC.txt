A Free Press is Vital to Democracy

Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, in Donald Trump's America, not even  Elmo is safe because over the last 100 days, we have seen an  unprecedented attack on the media, and especially our public media.

Let me say this: The freedom of the press and freedom of speech are  not a privilege. They are enshrined in the United States Constitution,  vital to our democracy and to accountability.

However, we have seen attack after attack, threats on the media and  communications companies, outlets replaced in the Pentagon, an order  attacking PBS and NPR just this very week, and an attempt to throw the  AP out of the White House for daring to tell the truth.

These attacks are not just an outrage, they are an attack on our  freedom, our democracy, and our rights as Americans, which is why I  rise today to stand for and fight for a free and fair press, because it  is vital to our democracy.
