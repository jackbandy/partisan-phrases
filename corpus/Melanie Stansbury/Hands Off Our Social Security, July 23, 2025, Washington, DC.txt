Hands Off Our Social Security


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694191/hands-off-our-social-security


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, we are here today to say hands off our  Social Security because Social Security is not a luxury. It is not a  handout. It is a sacred trust, a promise that we make to Americans that  the hard-earned money that they pay into the system will be there when  they need it--our seniors, our children who have lost a parent, people  in our communities who live with disabilities.

It is the lifeline that sustains our communities, our seniors. It is  a promise that they can live their lives with dignity.

I am here today with my dear colleague, Congressman   John Larson, to  not only say hands off our Social Security but also to introduce a bill  with that name.

This bill will protect Social Security from an administration that is  trying to systematically dismantle it. It will protect benefits. It  will stop the privatization of benefits. It will stop staffing cuts and  closures, protect privacy and data, and protect the proud men and women  who go to work every day to serve our seniors at the Social Security  Administration.

Mr. Speaker, these are the American people's benefits, and we are  fighting to ensure that not only are they here today and tomorrow but  for future generations to come.

That is why I am so proud to be in this fight with my dear colleague,  the man, the legend, the Congressman who has fought for Social Security  for so many years, Ranking Member   John Larson of Connecticut.

Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud and honored to be in the  fight with the ranking member and, more importantly, to be in the fight  for America and for our veterans, seniors, and children.

Let's do this, America. Let's protect Social Security.
