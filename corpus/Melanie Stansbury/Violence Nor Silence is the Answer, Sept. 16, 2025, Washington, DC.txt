Violence Nor Silence is the Answer

Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, violence is never the answer, but neither  is silence.

We must reject political violence in all of its forms and push back  against all who would seek to stoke further violence, division, and  fear amongst us. In fact, the very foundation of our democracy is built  on the idea that the voices of our people are our most powerful tool,  exercised at the ballot box, the debate podium, and in our communities.  That is how we come together as a nation to form a more perfect Union.

Indeed, the very concept of democracy was forged in that crucible,  that a government by the people and for the people is exercised through  the fellowship of debate.

Let us join in that fellowship to see our fellow Americans as  brothers and sisters, as neighbors and friends, even when we disagree.  Yet, let this not become a moment to silence debate or silence dissent  or silence the truth or those of conscience who work to hold our  leaders accountable and right the wrongs of an unjust world. That is  how history will remember us: those who stood, those who spoke, and  those who fought to protect our democracy and bend the arc of history  toward justice.
