Venezuela

Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, do you recall just a week and a half ago  when the President of the United States stood in front of the American  people and said that he conducted an unauthorized military invasion of  Venezuela to save American lives from drugs, but then a few days later  told us it was actually about the oil?

Well, if we needed any confirmation that it was not about the drugs  and not about saving American lives, look no further than the fact that  last night the White House announced that they would cut millions of  dollars from substance abuse and addiction recovery programs that save  lives in America every single day.

In Donald Trump's America, down is up and up is down, and they will  lie to your face every single day if they think it will get them what  they want. That is why we are in the fight to stop unauthorized wars,  to stop the daily assault on our communities, and to restore the  America that we know and to save American lives.
