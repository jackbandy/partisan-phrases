Stealing Our Public Lands


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692773/stealing-our-public-lands


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, Republicans in the Senate are trying to  steal our public lands.

Unsatisfied with stealing our healthcare and food out of the mouths  of millions of children, they are now coming for our public lands,  lands we fish, hunt, and camp on, lands that have been sacred to our  Tribes since time immemorial, lands that are integral to our  communities and our land grants, lands that have nurtured us and make  us who we are as Americans.

We are here to say ``no.'' This is a fight we can and must win.

To every American out there listening, call your Senator. We must  save our public lands.
