Defund Ice


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, it is beyond time to defund ICE. It is  beyond time to stop the violence. It is beyond time to stop the  unfettered use of force against our communities and to stop the lawless  violation of human and civil rights. It is beyond time, Mr. Speaker, to  stop the rot from the top, which has turned this agency into a rogue  and lawless force that is terrorizing our communities.

This week, the House will consider funding for DHS and give even more  funding to ICE.

Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker: I am not only a no, I am a hell no.

From unleashing violence in Minneapolis to dog whistles from the  White House, I have received countless calls from New Mexicans calling  for an end to this violence because we cannot and we will not allow ICE  to tear our country apart. We refuse to allow this administration to  terrorize this country, and that is why I will be damned if we give one  more dollar to that rogue organization, Mr. Speaker. That is why I will  vote ``no,'' and that is why we must defund ICE.
