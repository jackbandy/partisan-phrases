Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we debate the NDAA to  highlight the important wins for New Mexico, even as we are  investigating reports of unlawful strikes in the Caribbean.

I applaud the bipartisan work that produced some major wins for my  district and for New Mexico, including a long-overdue 3.8 percent pay  raise for all military personnel, authorization of funding for Kirtland  Air Force Base, and language which I am most grateful for to hold the  Department of Defense accountable for cleaning up munitions and  unexploded ordnance on Tribal lands, including in Isleta Pueblo.

It also authorizes funding to stand with our allies in Europe against  Russian aggression and strengthens our critical partnerships with  allies in the Indo-Pacific.

While I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the great  work in achieving these wins, we will continue to hold this  administration accountable.
