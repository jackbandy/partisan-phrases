Greenland is Not for Sale

Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, you know you have lost in 2026 when  Republicans in the United States House of Representatives are openly  talking about impeaching the President of the United States if he  invades Greenland, as one was quoted today in the press.

Let us be clear. Mr. President, Greenland is not for sale. Greenland  is not for war. Greenland is not to be invaded. Greenland is for the  Greenlandic people and our NATO allies, and we in the House of  Representatives stand with our allies.

You have been duly warned, Mr. President. The American people want  the Epstein files, not Greenland. If you violate the law and one of our  longest standing allyships on the planet, there will be consequences.  It is long overdue.
