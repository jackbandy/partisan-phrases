Skinny Budget for 2026

Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, a few days ago Donald Trump unveiled his  so-called skinny budget for fiscal year 2026. This budget is only  skinny on the cuts that it would cut for the American people, $163  billion for vital programs that serve our communities, Tribal programs,  housing, healthcare, opioid reduction, and addiction recovery programs.

This is on top of the catastrophic attacks of DOGE on veterans,  teachers, Social Security, and vital programs, and on top of the attack  the GOP and Trump's reconciliation tax plan would have on Medicaid and  food assistance.

Why? To give permanent tax breaks to billionaires.

What is the GOP's response this week? They are going to try and pass  a bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on the week  that we recognize Cinco De Mayo.

This is the GOP's plan. This is the GOP's response, and this is  Donald Trump's America.
