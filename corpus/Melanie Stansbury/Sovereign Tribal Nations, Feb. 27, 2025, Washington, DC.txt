Sovereign Tribal Nations


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, as you know, there are hundreds of  sovereign Tribal nations across the United States. Since this great  Nation's founding, the United States has signed hundreds of treaties  with Tribal nations and passed hundreds of laws reaffirming Tribal  sovereignty, self-determination, and U.S. commitments to indigenous  communities.

However, over the last month, we have seen and heard from Tribes all  over the country whose Federal funds have been frozen and their  programs impacted by mass firings, including at Indian Health Service,  BIA and BIE, including in my district at SIPI and at Haskell's College  where faculty and students have been devastated by mass firings.

That is why yesterday myself, the New Mexico delegation, and 111  Members of Congress sent a letter to the administration calling on them  to halt and reverse these harmful cuts to Tribal programs.

These programs are vital to Indian Country and part of the United  States' solemn Tribal trust and treaty responsibilities. Our sovereign  Tribal nations depend on these programs, and we must protect them.
