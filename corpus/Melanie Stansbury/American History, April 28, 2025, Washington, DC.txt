Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, Black history is American history,  indigenous history is American history, Latino history is American  history, and women and LGBTQ+ history is American history.

We will not be silenced.

No illegal or unconscionable executive orders can erase American  history. No firing of generals or Federal workers, no banning of books  or threats to schools, no purge of websites or removal of artifacts  from the Smithsonian or any other institution, and certainly no change  to our national holidays will erase American history because the people  of this country will not be silenced.

We will not allow this President to turn back the clock to take away  American rights. We will keep speaking, we will keep marching, and we  will keep fighting to protect our democracy because this is our  country, and we are not going back.
