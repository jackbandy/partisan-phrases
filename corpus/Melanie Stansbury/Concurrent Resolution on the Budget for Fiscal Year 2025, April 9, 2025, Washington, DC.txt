Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, the amount of gaslighting in this Chamber  this afternoon has been absolutely stunning, truly, as I sat here this  afternoon.

What the GOP is doing is they are introducing a budget resolution  that takes the worst of the House and the worst of the Senate and puts  it in one big, beautiful bill that is going to blow a hole through the  national debt. It will do that by raising the debt ceiling by $4  trillion, cutting $1.5 trillion in vital programs, giving $7 trillion  in permanent tax breaks to billionaires, and raising the debt by $37  trillion over the next 30 years.

How are Republicans going to pay for it? On the backs of the American  people with cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, housing, school meals,  clean energy, and selling your public lands.

Mr. Speaker, the craziest thing is the majority said that Republicans  wouldn't vote for it if it would raise the debt and the debt ceiling,  and here they are.

Bravo to my friends. My Republican colleagues are blowing a hole  through the debt ceiling, and we will vote ``no.''
