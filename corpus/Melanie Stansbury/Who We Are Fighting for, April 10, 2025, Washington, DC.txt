Who We Are Fighting for

Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I will take a moment today to share a  story of why we are fighting and who we are fighting for.

Every day this administration claims they are trying to make America  healthy again, and yet everything they are doing seems to indicate that  they are trying to make us sicker again. They have fired 10,000 HHS  health professionals. On this floor this week, the GOP passed a  reconciliation package that would cut Medicaid by billions of dollars.

Every day my constituents ask how can this cruel agenda continue?  Yesterday, I met with Rochelle Tittmann, a mom of four, who was  diagnosed with cancer when she was 29 weeks pregnant 8 years ago. By  the grace of God, her family, and the medical advancements made  possible by the HHS, by the National Institutes of Health, by the CDC,  she is here today, and her youngest daughter, Rae, is in the second  grade.

These are the people we are fighting for. This is why we are fighting  back, and this is why we oppose this cruel agenda.
