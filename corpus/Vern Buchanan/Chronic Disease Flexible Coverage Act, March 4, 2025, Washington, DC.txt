Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership,  as well. I rise today in strong support of my bill, the Chronic Disease  Flexible Coverage Act.

This important legislation will expand treatment options for  Americans living with chronic diseases provided through their  employer's healthcare coverage. My bill allows employers to offer  predeductibility on 14 different chronic diseases, especially for those  who are on high deductible health plans.

With 6 in 10 Americans living with at least one chronic disease, it  is clear to me that we need to have many more options. The cost for  chronic diseases in the American economy is enormous, accounting for  over $1 trillion a year, if you can imagine that. Chronic disease also  accounts for the overwhelming percentages of preventable deaths in the  United States. I believe this initiative will improve patients' health,  also reducing costly hospitalizations.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Congressman Panetta, for his  leadership and friendship. I really appreciate his working with me on  this. I also thank Leader Scalise and Whip Emmer for bringing this to  the floor today.

I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill to help give  Americans the tools they need for a longer, healthier, and happier  life.
