Hospital Inpatient Services Modernization Act


Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on  this topic. It has been key to what we have accomplished today.

I rise today in strong support of my bill, the Hospital Inpatient  Services Modernization Act, which would allow hospitals to treat  Medicare patients safely at home.

During the pandemic, CMS established the hospital at home waiver to  provide hospitals with the flexibility to care for patients from the  comfort and convenience of their homes.

The hospital at home program has been very successful, being treated  in many homes across the country. It has also made a big difference in  reducing the risk of infections and falls.

I am thrilled to say that my bill extends the successful hospital at  home program for an additional 5 years. I know a lot of people being in  Florida where their parents will talk about the importance of if they  could stay at home, and I know this is critical.

An extension of this program would ensure more than 200 hospitals  across 34 States--including 20 hospitals in Florida--can continue to  provide quality care to patients at home. More than 140 leading  healthcare organizations, including hospitals, healthcare providers,  and patients support this legislation.

I thank Mr. Smucker, Mr. Evans, and Ms. Moore for their friendship  and bipartisanship on this bill. I thank Leader Scalise and Whip Emmer  for bringing this to the floor tonight. I urge my colleagues to support  the hospital at home program extension for hospitals, providers, and  patients.
