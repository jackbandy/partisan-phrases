Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of outstanding  school employees in Florida's 16th Congressional District.

School employees work tirelessly because they understand that their  efforts are not just about fulfilling a job description, but about  shaping the future.

They deserve recognition because they are the architects of  knowledge, the mentors of tomorrow's leaders, and the unsung heroes who  work behind the scenes to ensure that every child has the opportunity  to thrive.

Eleven years ago, I established the Congressional Education Awards  program with the aim of providing special acknowledgment to  administrators, educators, and support staff within Florida's 16th  Congressional District for their outstanding achievements in both  teaching and inspiring students.
