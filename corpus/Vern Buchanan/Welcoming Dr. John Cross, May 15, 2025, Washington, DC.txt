Welcoming Dr. John Cross


Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Dr. John Cross, who  just delivered this morning's opening prayer.

John is the senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Sarasota and has  been the pastor for many, many years. John committed his life to Christ  in his childhood and ultimately decided to pursue a career in the  ministry.

He is a proud graduate of Mercy University and Southwestern Baptist  Theological Seminary, where he earned his master of divinity degree and  his doctor of ministry.

His leadership has extended beyond the local church, having served as  the president of the Florida Baptist Convention Pastors' Conference and  president of the Florida Baptist State Convention.

John is married to Dawn, and together they have been blessed with 5  children, 3 sons-in-law, a daughter-in-law, and 10 grandkids.

I deeply value his faith leadership in my life, my family's life, and  our community. I am grateful for his presence here today.
