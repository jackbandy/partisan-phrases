Recognizing Florida's 16th Congressional District Fire and Rescue Ems Awards Recipients


Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize fire, rescue and  EMS personnel who have provided distinguished service to the people of  Florida's 16th Congressional District.

First responders, fire departments and emergency medical service  teams are summoned on short notice to serve their respective  communities. Often, they arrive at scenes of great adversity and  trauma, to which they reliably bring strength and composure. These  brave men and women spend hundreds of hours in training so that they  are prepared when they get ``the call.''

Thirteen years ago, I established the 16th District Congressional  Fire and Rescue and EMS Awards to honor officers, departments, and  units for outstanding achievement.

On behalf of the people of Florida's 16th District, it is my  privilege to congratulate and include in the Record the following  honorees, who were selected this year by an independent committee  comprised of a cross section of current and retired fire and rescue  personnel living in the district:
