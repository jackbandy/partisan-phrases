Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  my friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa.

Doug was a steadfast champion of rural California and for the issues  that matter most to millions of Americans across the West, starting in  the California legislature to the Halls of Congress.

He fought for water storage and forest management. He fought for  energy abundance. He fought for the farmer. He fought for common sense.

I had the privilege of serving alongside him on the Committee for  Transportation and Infrastructure and as a fellow member of the Western  Caucus during his time as chairman. He would always greet me with a big  smile by the nickname ``The Fongressman.''

Over the years, I was fortunate to be mentored by Doug. He was a  great role model and friend. His guidance, leadership, and example left  a lasting impact on me and on so many others who had the honor of  working with him.

Doug will be remembered for his deep love for his family, his faith  and core principles, his unwavering dedication to his community, his  humility, and his enduring legacy as a leader and lawmaker.

I am personally grateful for his mentorship and know he will be  profoundly missed by all who knew him.

I certainly will vow to honor Doug's memory by continuing to champion  the values that we both share that unite California's Central Valley to  the rural communities like Doug's in northern California.

I will continue fighting for rural priorities in Congress just as  Doug did.

Amanda and I are praying for his wife, Jill; his family and loved  ones; and his staff during this difficult time. His absence leaves a  void that will never truly be filled.
