Mr. FETTERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to welcome the Ecumenical  Patriarch of Constantinople, His All Holiness Bartholomew, to the  United States.

Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is the longest serving Archbishop of  Constantinople in the two millennia history of Christianity. As the  highest spiritual authority for nearly 300 million Eastern Orthodox  Christians, he has cosponsored international peace conferences;  convened Christian, Muslim, and Jewish leaders to promote cooperation  and mutual understanding; and advanced the cause of religious freedom  around the world.

Environmental stewardship has been a consistent theme of His All  Holiness's ministry. In honor of this commitment, Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew was awarded the prestigious Templeton Prize.

I am proud to join faith leaders from across Pennsylvania in  welcoming His All Holiness to the United States and extend my heartfelt  congratulations on this momentous achievement.
