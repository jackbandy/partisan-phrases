Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an  extraordinary American and proud constituent, Mr. Lewis M. Unterman,  who will reach the remarkable milestone of 100 years young on November  7, 2025. Born in New York on November 7, 1925, Mr. Unterman represents  a generation of Americans whose courage, resilience, and unwavering  commitment to freedom helped shape the course of history. At the age of  18, in the midst of World War II, Lewis answered the call to serve his  country. On September 8, 1944, he enlisted in the United States Navy,  where he served honorably as a Seaman First Class.

During his military service, Lewis demonstrated exceptional bravery  and dedication. His valor was recognized through the awarding of  multiple service decorations, including the Combat Action Ribbon, the  American Theater Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Medal, the Philippine  Liberation Ribbon, and the Victory Medal. These honors reflect his  direct contribution to the global fight for peace and liberty during  one of the most defining conflicts of the 20th century.

Following his military service, Lewis continued to embody the values  of duty, service, and community. He now resides in Beverly Hills,  Florida, where he remains an active and respected member of VFW Post  10087, continuing to advocate for his fellow veterans and keep the  memory of their sacrifices alive.

Lewis and his beloved wife, Ellie, are shining examples of American  patriotism and community spirit. Together, they have left an indelible  mark on those around them, reminding us all of the strength and  integrity that have long defined the American character.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Florida's 12th Congressional District and  the United States House of Representatives, I am proud to honor Mr.  Lewis M. Unterman for his lifetime of service and sacrifice. I extend  my heartfelt congratulations on his upcoming 100th birthday and offer  best wishes for continued health, happiness, and the gratitude of a  grateful Nation. May his legacy continue to inspire future generations.
