Recognizing Jeanne White

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Jeanne White has made through her work with K-9  Partners for Patriots. After retiring from a successful career, Jeanne  completed a two-year apprentice trainer program. She currently serves  as Director of K9 Acquisition and a Certified Dog Trainer with more  than 20 years' experience at K-9 Partners for Patriots. Jeanne's  dedication to matching Veterans with the perfect rescue dog goes far  beyond expectations. She has an encyclopedic understanding of dogs and  their behaviors and serves multiple roles from training to K9  evaluations and acquisitions. She is also the liaison with Rescues;  Animal Societies; and Animal Control agencies throughout the greater  Tampa Bay metro area. Jeanne places dogs into temporary care at foster  homes and follows them all the way through until she is able to  schedule a meet-and-greet with a Veteran she feels would be the right  match for the dog. Once a match is made and the dog goes home with  their Veteran, Jeanne remains a constant source of support--always just  a phone call away--even during late nights and weekends. She never lets  anyone feel alone or without help.

It is clear Jeanne White has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
