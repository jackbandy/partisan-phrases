Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Judy Salvador has made through her work with  Metropolitan Ministries. Judy has been a dedicated volunteer at  Metropolitan Ministries since 2016. Monday and Friday mornings at the  Metro Welcome Center are lively and welcoming, thanks to this  remarkable woman. She greets both new and returning volunteers with  enthusiasm, ensuring newcomers feel comfortable and understand the  importance of their roles. Her humor, empathy, and dedication ensure  smooth operations across all areas, from kitchen prep to client  shopping in the metro market. She welcomes everyone--volunteers,  clients, residents, and community members--with warmth, compassion, and  genuine joy in service. Judy is always ready to tackle any task that  needs attention. Metropolitan Ministries relies heavily on her to keep  Volunteer Services running smoothly, not just during the holidays but  all year round. She embodies the four key values of Metro's culture,  including: Character, Chemistry, Competency, and Calling.

It is clear Judy Salvador has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
