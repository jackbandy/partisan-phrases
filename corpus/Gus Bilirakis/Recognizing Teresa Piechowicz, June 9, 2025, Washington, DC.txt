Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Teresa Piechowicz has made to our community as a  volunteer with the Hernando County Family YMCA. The Hernando County  Family YMCA is more than just a place--it's a community, a support  system, and a beacon of hope for so many. None of that would be  possible without dedicated volunteers, like Teresa Piechowicz. Her  unwavering commitment, boundless energy, and compassionate spirit make  her an invaluable part of the YMCA family. Teresa's impact can be felt  in every corner of the organization. She is involved in nearly every  event hosted--always the first to arrive and the last to leave. Whether  she's assisting with youth programs, supporting fundraising  initiatives, or simply offering a warm smile to a member in need,  Teresa gives selflessly--never asking for recognition, but always  making a difference. Her enthusiasm is contagious, inspiring both staff  and fellow volunteers. She has a unique ability to lift others up,  ensuring that every person who walks through our doors feels welcomed  and supported. Her kindness is not just in her words but in her  actions--consistently stepping in wherever she is needed without  hesitation. Without individuals like Teresa, the impact of the YMCA in  Hernando County would not be what it is today. She represents the very  best of what it means to serve others.

It is clear Teresa Piechowicz has made a profoundly positive impact  on our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive  to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
