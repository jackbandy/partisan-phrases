Recognizing John Wajdowicz


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that John Wajdowicz has made through his work at The  Pasco County Sheriff's Citizen Service Unit (CSU). A truly dedicated  public servant, John always carries himself with professionalism and is  quick to offer a helping hand to anybody who needs one. John has been  volunteering with the Pasco Sheriff's Office since 2021. He usually  volunteers at least three days a week, as well as most special events  that the CSU is asked to help out with. John is relied upon throughout  the year to train new CSU members. During the year 2024, John provided  the agency and his community with 1,320.25 volunteer hours. John has  been instrumental in updating forms and practices within the CSU. His  input has been especially helpful in the creation of an electronic  Daily Activity Report, which captures trackable information pertaining  to the calls-for-service handled by CSU Volunteers. John is a  tremendous asset to the CSU, Pasco Sheriff's Office, and the citizens  of Pasco County. His hard work and selflessness is deserving of  recognition, although that is not why he volunteers his time to help  others. John exemplifies what it means to be a hero.

It is clear John Wajdowicz has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
