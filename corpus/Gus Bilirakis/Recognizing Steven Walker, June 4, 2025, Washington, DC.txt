Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Steven Walker has made to the community through his  work at CREST in Lecanto. Steven created a food drive as a class  project to help local Veterans. This food drive was used to educate the  students about the struggling Veterans in the community and to teach  about the importance of service to others. This project has also opened  their hearts to lend a helping hand to others in need. The students  look forward to this food drive every year and have such pride in  participating. The students also speak around the town to spread the  word about the food drive and garner support. For students struggling  with physical and or mental health limitations, this program has been  an invaluable tool for teaching about citizenship.

It is clear Steven Walker has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
