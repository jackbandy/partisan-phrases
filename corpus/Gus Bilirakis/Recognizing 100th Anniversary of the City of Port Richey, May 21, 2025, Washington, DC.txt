Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate  the 100th Anniversary of the City of Port Richey, Florida. Founded by  Aaron Richey in 1883 and officially incorporated in 1925 along the  beautiful shores of the Pithlachascotee River--known locally as the  Cotee River--Port Richey has grown from a small riverside community  into a city rich in heritage, resilience, and charm. Over the past  century, Port Richey has served as a gateway to Florida's Nature Coast,  offering a unique blend of coastal beauty, community spirit, and small- town values.

The city's early founders envisioned a place where families could  thrive, businesses could grow, and the natural environment could be  cherished. Their vision remains alive today in the city's commitment to  protecting its waterways, enhancing quality of life, and fostering a  welcoming atmosphere for residents and visitors alike. From its early  days as a fishing and boating hub to its present role as a vibrant city  with a growing economy and engaged citizenry, Port Richey has held  tightly to its roots while embracing the promise of the future. Its  waterfront parks, thriving local businesses, and close-knit  neighborhoods speak to a community that values tradition,  collaboration, and progress.

Throughout its history, Port Richey has overcome challenges with  strength and unity, guided by civic leaders and everyday citizens  committed to building a better tomorrow. The city's ongoing  revitalization efforts, including enhancements to its historic  waterfront district, reflect a forward-looking vision rooted in pride  and perseverance. As we mark this centennial milestone, we celebrate  not just 100 years of incorporation, but 100 years of stories of  families who built their lives here, of leaders who shaped the city's  path, and of a community that has remained true to its values across  generations. Let this occasion be a time of reflection and renewed  purpose. The City of Port Richey stands as a testament to what can be  accomplished through community spirit, hard work, and enduring hope.

Again, I am proud to honor the City of Port Richey on its 100th  Anniversary, and I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this  remarkable city, its past achievements, and its bright future. Here's  to the next 100 years of Port Richey.
