Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Tommy Baker has made through his work with NAMI  Hernando. Tommy works as the Operations Manager of Meares Plumbing and  Electrical and former Board President of NAMI Hernando. He has been a  pillar of leadership and unwavering support for mental health in our  community. Tommy's impact reaches far beyond boardroom decisions. Tommy  brings integrity, dedication, and a true sense of responsibility to  every aspect of his volunteer work. As Board President, Tommy played a  pivotal role in strengthening NAMI Hernando's foundation, guiding  strategic growth, and supporting long-term sustainability. His  leadership helped expand outreach efforts and foster new collaborations  that increased access to mental health education and support. Tommy's  commitment to advocacy inspired the creation of the annual Strike Out  Stigma fundraiser, an event that continues to unite the community in  support of mental wellness. Building on its success, he spearheaded the  launch of Reconstructing Hope--a nonprofit initiative that brought  together businesses in the construction industry to raise funds for  multiple local  nonprofits, including NAMI Hernando. He has consistently gone above and  beyond--whether offering professional expertise, mobilizing support  through Meares Plumbing, or showing up as a visible advocate for mental  health awareness. His quiet leadership, humility, and spirit of service  have made a lastIng impression on all who work with him.

It is clear Tommy Baker has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
