Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Shawn Woodruff has made through her work at the  Nature Coast Outreach Center. Shawn is a shining example of grassroots  impact and unwavering compassion. This nonprofit organization has  become a vital support system in our community, meeting both practical  needs and offering emotional encouragement to those who are struggling.  Each Friday, the Center provides a freshly cooked meal to anyone in  need--offering not just food, but also kindness, dignity, and a sense  of belonging. For many, this meal is the highlight of their week--a  safe and welcoming space where they feel seen and cared for. In  addition to their weekly meal program, the Center runs a robust food  distribution service to combat food insecurity. Volunteers deliver bags  of groceries directly to targeted areas of need throughout the  community, ensuring that no one is left behind. They also host a large- scale monthly food distribution event in partnership with Grace World  Outreach Church through their Compassion Food Outreach program-- providing generous bags of groceries to hundreds of families. The  outreach doesn't stop at food. The team also helps furnish homes with  donated items such as furniture, clothing, and household necessities-- empowering individuals and families to start over after experiencing  homelessness, crisis, or hardship. These efforts help transform empty  houses into warm, livable homes filled with hope. They also provide  essential supplies for those currently experiencing homelessness,  including tents, food, and ongoing support, helping meet urgent needs.  What truly sets the Nature Coast Outreach Center apart is the heart  behind the mission. No one is paid--this life-changing work is powered  entirely by a group of selfless, committed volunteers who give their  time, energy, and love every single week. Their unwavering dedication  is a beautiful example of community in action and the power of people  coming together for a greater purpose. At the center of it all is Shawn  Woodruff, a humble and passionate leader whose tireless efforts and  deep compassion inspire everyone around her. She coordinates logistics,  builds relationships, and ensures every person served is treated with  dignity and grace. Her vision has created a ripple effect of kindness  that continues to grow. Nature Coast Outreach Center may not seek the  spotlight, but their impact is undeniable. They are transforming lives,  restoring hope, and strengthening our community--one act of kindness at  a time. They are truly heroes among us.

It is clear Shawn Woodruff has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
