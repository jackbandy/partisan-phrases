Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the  City of Brooksville as it commemorates the 170th anniversary of its  founding. This significant milestone offers an opportunity to reflect  upon the city's rich history, enduring spirit, and the generations of  citizens who have shaped Brooksville into the vibrant community it is  today. For 170 years, Brooksville has stood as a testament to  resilience, civic pride, and a deep respect for tradition, while  continually embracing progress and growth. From its earliest days to  the present, the city has served as a place where neighbors support one  another, local institutions thrive, and a strong sense of community  binds residents together.

Brooksville's history is reflected not only in its historic landmarks  and longstanding neighborhoods, but also in the character of its  people--those who have worked to build local businesses, serve in  public office, educate future generations, and contribute to the  cultural and economic vitality of the region. The city's commitment to  preserving its heritage while preparing for the future is a model of  responsible and thoughtful community development. As Brooksville  celebrates its 170th anniversary, it is fitting to recognize the  contributions of its past and present residents, civic leaders,  educators, first responders, and volunteers whose dedication has  ensured the city's continued success. Their collective efforts have  strengthened Brooksville and positioned it for continued prosperity in  the years ahead. I extend my sincere congratulations to the City of  Brooksville and its residents on this historic occasion. I commend them  for 170 years of achievement and wish them continued growth, unity, and  success for generations to come.
