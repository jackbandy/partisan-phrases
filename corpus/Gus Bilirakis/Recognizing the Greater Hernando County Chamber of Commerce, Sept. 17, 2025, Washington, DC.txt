Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the  Greater Hernando County Chamber of Commerce on the occasion of its  100th anniversary--a remarkable milestone that reflects a century of  steadfast service, economic leadership, and community commitment.  Chambers of commerce are foundational institutIons within our  communities. They promote economic vitality, advocate for local  businesses, and offer critical resources such as training, marketing,  and networking. The Greater Hernando County Chamber of Commerce  embodies these principles and has served as a vital engine of  prosperity for generations.

The Chamber traces its origins to 1925, when local leaders first  organized a community chamber under the guidance of Frederick  Williamson, its inaugural president. Despite the challenges of the  Great Depression, the Chamber persevered and experienced a revival in  1938, led by visionary banker Alfred McKethan--a pivotal figure in  Hernando County's economic history. As the county grew rapidly in the  latter half of the 20th century, particularly with the development of  new communities like Spring Hill, the business landscape became  increasingly diverse and fragmented. In a decisive moment of unity and  forward-thinking, leaders Morris Porton, Steve Emerson, and Vince Vanni  worked to consolidate the business community. Their efforts culminated  in the formal establishment of the Greater Hernando County Chamber of  Commerce on December 22, 1992.

Over the past 100 years, the Chamber has evolved and expanded to meet  the changing needs of Hernando County's business community. Guided by  its Pillars of Success--Advocacy, Marketing, Networking, and Training-- the Chamber has become the largest and oldest business organization in  Hernando County. Its influence has been recognized across the region,  including by the Tampa Bay Business Journal, which named it one of the  largest chambers in the Tampa Bay area. The Chamber represents a broad  and diverse membership spanning vital sectors such as professional  services, construction and trades, real estate, healthcare, finance,  education, retail, hospitality, transportation, manufacturing, and  nonprofit organizations. It also leads impactful programs, including  Leadership Hernando, a premier leadership development initiative that  has graduated over 525 community leaders since its inception in 1992.  The Chamber's enduring commitment to economic development,  collaboration, and community enrichment has played an essential role in  shaping Hernando County into the thriving place it is today.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the  Greater Hernando County Chamber of Commerce on its centennial  anniversary. May its legacy of service continue to strengthen our  communities for generations to come.
