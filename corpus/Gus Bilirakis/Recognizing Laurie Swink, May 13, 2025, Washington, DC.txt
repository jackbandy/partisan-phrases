Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Laurie Swink has made to our community through her  work with Selah Freedom. Laurie's passion, tireless efforts, and  unwavering commitment to fighting human trafficking have not only  impacted the lives of thousands but have sparked systemic change across  the Nation. With over 7,000 survivors of human trafficking having found  hope, healing, and a new chance at life through Selah Freedom's  programs, Laurie's legacy continues to shape a future where survivors  are empowered and human trafficking is eradicated. Laurie Swink co- founded Selah Freedom in 2011, with a clear mission to address the  growing crisis of human trafficking and to restore freedom and dignity  to those trapped in it. Since then, her leadership has been a catalyst  for change, and her vision for Selah Freedom has transformed the  organization into a national leader in anti-trafficking efforts. Laurie  has worked tirelessly to create programs that provide more than just  temporary relief; she's built a holistic, long-term framework that  addresses the multifaceted needs of survivors. Under Laurie's  leadership, Selah Freedom provides survivors with safe housing, trauma- informed counseling, legal advocacy, life skills training, job  readiness programs, and educational opportunities. This comprehensive  support system has allowed victims to heal, regain independence, and  lead successful lives beyond the trauma of trafficking. The impact  Laurie has made is visible not only in the numbers but in the  individual success stories of survivors who are now thriving--getting  jobs, going to school, and, in many cases, becoming advocates  themselves. Laurie is a compassionate leader who connects with  survivors on a personal level, understanding their unique challenges  and walking alongside them every step of the way. Laurie's deep empathy  and ability to listen, care, and offer practical solutions have  empowered survivors to overcome the seemingly insurmountable obstacles  they face. Laurie has become a powerful voice in the fight against  human trafficking, using her platform to raise awareness, educate  communities, and advocate for change at the policy level. Laurie has  worked with law enforcement, legislators, and local leaders to  strengthen laws, increase resources for trafficking victims, and ensure  that survivors have the support they need to rebuild their lives. She  has played a key role in transforming how society understands and  addresses human trafficking, ensuring that the issue is no longer  hidden or overlooked.

It is clear Laurie Swink has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
