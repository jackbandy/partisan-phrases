Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise today to  recognize Ms. Stephanie Wilson for her service at Withlacoochee River  Electric Cooperative (WREC) and her remarkable role in the Light Up  Navajo Project. In May, a courageous team of 16 WREC employees traveled  over 1,800 miles to the remote, rugged terrains of Arizona and New  Mexico, where they spent two weeks installing vital electrical  infrastructure for Navajo families who have lived without power for  generations. Their efforts brought light, safety, and hope to  communities long overlooked, allowing children to study after dark,  families to preserve food, and elders to live with greater comfort.  Despite daunting challenges and limited equipment, the WREC team  completed a demanding project in just eight days--far ahead of  expectations--demonstrating professionalism, humility, and unwavering  commitment to this life-changing mission.

The impact of WREC's work goes far beyond electricity; it represents  a bridge to connection, opportunity, and the return of future  generations to their ancestral homes. The emotional moment when power  was turned on for the impacted families--bringing tears of joy and  renewed hope--is a testament to the profound difference this project  made. WREC's participation in the ``Light Up Navajo'' initiative  reflects not only their technical expertise but also their heart and  respect for the people they serve. Their dedication has energized ten  homesteads and countless lives, creating a legacy of service that  embodies the true spirit of cooperative values. The WREC team's journey  inspires us all, proving that with compassion and teamwork, even the  most daunting challenges can be overcome to light up lives and  communities. I commend the entire team for their efforts on this  worthwhile endeavor and for their ongoing service to our local  community.
