Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Ralph and Stephanie Stevens have made to our  community as volunteers with Hope Services. Ralph and Stephanie have  gone above and beyond to support Hope Services as part of the  organization's Dream Team. They are always committed to helping others  and are a wealth of support to those in need. They give generously of  their time, talents and treasure. Their kindness, generosity, and  tireless efforts have made a lasting difference with the clients we  serve and their families.

It is clear Ralph and Stephanie Stevens have made a profoundly  positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for their service.  May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and  humility.
