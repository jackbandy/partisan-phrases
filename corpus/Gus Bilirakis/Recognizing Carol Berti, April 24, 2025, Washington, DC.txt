Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Carol Berti has made on through her work with Oasis  Pregnancy Centers. Carol is a rare gem in the volunteer world;  dedication is her middle name. For 16 years, Carol has served Oasis  with warmth, compassion, and dedication to the families of Oasis. Carol  was an integral part of the start-up of Oasis in 2009 and continues to  be a cornerstone of the ministry at the Land O' Lakes center. Her  unwavering desire to be a light to each woman who walks through the  door of Oasis is a shining example of her obedience to Christ and His  call on her life. Carol helps vet new volunteers and works with Center  Directors to find the right fit for each volunteer and for Oasis. Carol  is an inspiration to the staff and the team she serves with.  Additionally, Carol has served for years as a Sunday School teacher  each week and Poll Captain of elections in her area. She truly is a  Hero in the community.

It is clear Carol Berti has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
