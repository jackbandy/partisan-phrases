Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Sue Simone has made to our community through her  volunteerism at HPH Hospice. HPH Hospice services Hernando, Citrus, and  Pasco Counties. In 2022, Sue joined the HPH Hospice Foundation as a  founding member of the Women of Giving (WOG). She played a crucial role  on the Steering Committee, helping to define the WOG's operating  structure, roles, mission, and vision. Together, the members aimed to  create a significant pool of funds to support the Foundation's various  charitable programs, all under the guiding principle of ``Igniting Love  and Spreading Hope.'' In addition to her committee work, Sue also  became a trained Ambassador for the Foundation. Over the years, WOG has  achieved remarkable fundraising milestones: In its first year, 20  members raised $15,675.00. In the second year, 47 members raised  $40,845. In the third year, despite a smaller membership of 44, they  raised $51,082.57. At the beginning of this year, the Lightning Hockey  Team awarded the WOG a $50,000.00 Hero's Award. Each year, during the  annual meeting, funds are donated throughout the Foundation's programs,  which include: Charity Care, Adult and Child Bereavement Counseling, a  camp for kids ages 6 to 17 that teaches them to manage grief and  reassures them they are not alone in their loss, Building a Children's  Bereavement Center, Circle of Hope in Pasco County, and renovations in  Citrus and Hernando counties. Sue has also contributed to the Valor and  Legacy program in a variety of meaningful ways.

It is clear Sue Simone has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
