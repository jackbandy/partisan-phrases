Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Lori Ventura has made through her work with  the CARES Senior Clinic. Lori serves as Healthcare Ambassador for the  CARES Senior Health Clinic. Lori helps coordinate the care for 1,200  patients, including frail, disabled, low income & homeless clients. She  helps coordinate treatments and community resources to aide in the  health and wellbeing of all in the community. She has helped save the  lives of countless individuals.

It is clear Lori Ventura has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
