Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Cheryl Dillow has made through her work with the  CARES Senior Clinic. Cheryl is the check out clerk at the clinic.  Speedy in her typing, proficient with patient checkout and efficient at  scheduling imaging and Dermatology referrals. Cheryl is a vital part of  the team. She is always available to assist the patients and co-workers  whenever needed. The clinic would not run smoothly without her diligent  efforts.

It is clear Cheryl Dillow has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
