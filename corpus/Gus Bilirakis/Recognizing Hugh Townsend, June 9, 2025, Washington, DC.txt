Recognizing Hugh Townsend

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Mr. Hugh Townsend has made as a volunteer with the  Board of Hunter's Ridge Homeowner's Association. Over the past 30  years, Hugh has worked tirelessly on the Board, mostly serving as  President. When safety concerns arose about people walking on the  street, he successfully fought for the installation of sidewalks at no  cost to our HOA. He negotiated the development of a front entrance  monument to maintain the community's visibility. Hugh consistently  attends meetings to keep us updated on new laws and changes affecting  his community. He pursued certification as a Homeowner Board member  before it was required by the state. Regardless of the issue, he  remains positive and works towards reasonable resolutions, even while  facing medical challenges. Beyond his own community, Hugh volunteers  extensively. His roles include Vice Chair of the Penny for Pasco  Oversight Committee for Education, Field Training Officer with the  Pasco Sheriff's Office Citizens Service Unit, Board member of the  Council of Neighborhood Associations, Eagle Scout Review member, Greek  Orthodox Youth Association leader, Juvenile Justice Advisory Board  member, and more. He has served in various capacities to improve Pasco  County, demonstrating his commitment to volunteerism and community  service.

It is clear Hugh Townsend has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
