Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Ms. Jennifer Mankotya has made to our community in  the aftermath of Hurricane Milton. In addition to providing countless  hours of direct support to neighbors and flood victims, she helped  coordinate the collection and distribution of emergency supplies, meals  and donated services to help those who needed help. A truly selfless  leader, Ms. Mankotya was a strong advocate for bringing in government  and non-profit resources to aid in the recovery process.

It is clear that Jennifer Mankotya has made a profoundly positive  impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all  strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
