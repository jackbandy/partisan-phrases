Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Daniel Flores has made to our community through his  work with New Beginnings Youth Shelter, which serves homeless kids aged  10-17 who are between foster homes; abandoned, or homeless. The whole  team jumps in to take care of the kids who have no one else looking out  for them. They teach kids structure, respect, understanding and so much  more in a loving environment. The team really cares, and each member is  deeply invested in the kids' long-term success.

It is clear Daniel Flores has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
