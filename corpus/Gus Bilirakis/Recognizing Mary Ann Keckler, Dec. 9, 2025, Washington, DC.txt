Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary  life and tireless service of Mary Ann Keckler, a remarkable advocate  for her fellow veterans and their families. Hernando County, and indeed  all of Florida, were fortunate to benefit from her decades of selfless  dedication. Mary Ann served as Disabled American Veterans (DAV)  Commander for Hernando County No. 67, and from 2018 to 2019, she held  the position of State DAV Commander. Her commitment extended to the  national level, serving on the National DAV Executive Committee from  2023 to 2024. In recognition of her exceptional volunteer efforts, she  was named National DAV Volunteer of the Year in 2014.

For more than 25 years, Mary Ann devoted her time to the James A.  Haley Veterans' Hospital (JAHVH), logging over 11,000 volunteer hours.  She played a pivotal role in the creation of both Fisher House I and  II, providing families of hospitalized veterans a place to stay during  long-term care. She was also instrumental in founding the monthly  Operation Helping Hand dinners at JAHVH SCI, ensuring that veterans and  their families received nourishment, fellowship, and support.

Beyond her service, Mary Ann was a loving mother and grandmother, a  loyal friend, and a fierce advocate for those in need. Her legacy is  one of compassion, leadership, and unwavering commitment. Through her  tireless work, countless veterans and their families have been  uplifted, comforted, and empowered. Her life reminds us all of the  importance of standing alongside those who have sacrificed so much for  our country.

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Mary Ann Keckler for her  extraordinary service. She leaves behind a legacy that will continue to  impact veterans and our community for generations. May her memory be  eternal.
