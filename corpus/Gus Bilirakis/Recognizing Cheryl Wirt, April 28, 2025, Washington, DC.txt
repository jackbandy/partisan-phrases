Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Cheryl Wirt has made to our community through her  volunteer work at Veterans Elementary School. Cheryl comes to volunteer  at the school almost every day. She has a big heart and a passion for  helping students and staff. Cheryl is very involved with the community  group that heads up all fundraising for the school. She helps with  ideas, calls, and follow-through with anything that needs to be done.  She also spends time with the students in the ``Pop up Shop'' each  Friday morning and provides extra supervision in the cafeteria at  lunchtime. She also, recently re-vamped the School Events Parent  Information Board which has all of our events and fundraisers on it for  the families to see as they come onto campus. Cheryl asks daily what  she can do to help and never stops until she exceeds expectations.

It is clear Cheryl Wirt has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
