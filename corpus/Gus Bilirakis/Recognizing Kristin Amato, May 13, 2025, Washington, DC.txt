Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Kristin Amato has made through her work with the  CARES Senior Clinic. Kristin has over 24 years in nursing experience.  She has worked in ER department's, home health, orthopedics and will be  a nurse practitioner in June 2026. She uses her time and talents to  help patients in need.

It is clear Kristin Amato has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
