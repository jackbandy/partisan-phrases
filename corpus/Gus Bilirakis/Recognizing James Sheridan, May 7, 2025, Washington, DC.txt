Recognizing James Sheridan


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that James ``Jay'' Sheridan has made through his work  with the Greater Tampa Bay Area Council of Scouting America. Jay  Sheridan is currently a Scoutmaster of Troop 148 and the outdoor  program Chair for the Greater Tampa Bay Area Council. He volunteers for  scouts at least 40 weekends a year. During those weekends, he could be  leading his troop camping, helping with a training event, running a  target range, cooking in the kitchen or helping with camp maintenance.  He oversees all of the outdoor program committees such as camping,  target sports and climbing. Jay is responsible for reestablishing the  resident camp program for the council which includes driving out to  camp on Christmas Day with his family to prepare for winter camp. Jay  is a steadfast proponent for getting youth outdoors. He was part of the  council COVID response committee which helped keep youth Scouting  during the pandemic and is currently chairing the committee for the  whole-council camporee this coming year.

It is clear James Sheridan has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
