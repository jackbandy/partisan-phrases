Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Danielle Bierman has made through her work with the  Pasco County Human Services Team. The Pasco County Human Services Team  has proven itself to be a cornerstone of resilience, innovation, and  unwavering commitment to the community. Amidst the devastating impacts  of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, they emerged as an indispensable  force, transforming challenges into triumphs and ensuring no resident  was left behind. The team managed and helped coordinate efforts for  shelters that housed 485 residents. When Hurricane Milton struck  shortly thereafter, the team rose to even greater heights, coordinating  shelters for 5,800 individuals and 1,315 animals--an extraordinary feat  of operational precision and compassion. Despite personal hardships,  including one case manager losing her home while another lost her  rental property, the team prioritized the welfare of the community,  working tirelessly to ensure safety and stability for all. Post-storm,  the team was responsible for helping shelter residents whose homes were  no longer safe, find appropriate alternatives for housing. Their  dedication shone through in rapid response efforts. In the days  immediately following Hurricane Helene, 49 residents received critical  assessments and essential resources. After Hurricane Milton, they  worked with 225 displaced individuals who remained in shelters,  demonstrating their unparalleled ability to adapt and respond under  pressure. The team leveraged the Human Services Needs app to streamline  disaster case management, supporting 1,351 residents. Their follow-up  system, in partnership with other agencies, ensured personalized  service for every individual. This innovative approach epitomized their  ability to harness technology and partnerships for meaningful impact.  Beyond immediate relief, the team worked with individuals and families  who would require long-term recovery efforts. For approximately 150  permanently displaced residents, they implemented a housing eligibility  process, with the intent of ensuring fair and transparent allocation of  resources. By securing placements at facilities like Pasco Hope, the  team supported individuals and families along a pathway to rebuild  their lives. Between September 28 and October 18, 2024, the team  managed an overwhelming volume of call--1,194 through their direct line  and another 1,214 through work phones. Yet every call was met with  care, professionalism, and actionable solutions, reflecting the team's  deep commitment to being a lifeline for the community. The Pasco County  Human Services Team exemplifies what it means to serve with excellence,  compassion, and innovation. Their remarkable achievements during  Hurricane Helene and Milton, coupled with their dedication to long-term  recovery and cutting-edge approaches to disaster management, have left  an indelible mark on Pasco County.

It is clear Danielle Bierman has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community with his work as part of the Pasco County Human Services  Team, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to serve our  communities with the same dedication and humility.
