Recognizing Alyssa Reas


Mr. BILIRAKIS. I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Alyssa Reas has made through her volunteerism at  Gulf Highlands Elementary School. Alyssa stepped onto the campus with  big plans to support students. She has seen the value that peer mentors  have made in student lives and is determined to help cultivate success  on the campus. She has been working diligently to match big brothers  and big sisters with students on campus, with 10 success stories to  date. It is exciting for students to have someone from their community  encouraging them in their educational journey.

It is clear Alyssa Reas has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
