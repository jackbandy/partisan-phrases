Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Charles Anderson has made through his work with  United Way of Pasco County. Charles W. Anderson, recently retired  January 2025 as President & CEO of United Way of Pasco County (UWPC).  He has made a profound and lasting impact on the organization and the  community it serves. Since assuming leadership in January 2019, Charles  transformed UWPC into a more dynamic, responsive, and impactful  organization, nearly doubling annual fundraising to $2.8 million by  2023 and expanding its focus from three to eight critical areas of  community needs. Under Charles's visionary guidance, UWPC rose to the  challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic with swift aid innovative action.  He launched Operation Feed Pasco, which not only supported 19 local  restaurants but also provided over 237,000 meals to individuals and  families in need. The program mobilized $2.4 million and delivered  vital services to shelters, food ministries, and elder care centers  during one of the community's most vulnerable times. Charles also  pioneered the Fighting Human Trafficking (FHT) Program, positioning  UWPC as one of only four United Way organizations globally offering  direct services to human trafficking survivors. This program is the  only one in Florida with state funding to provide emergency hotel stays  and housing for survivors of human trafficking state-wide. Through his  strategic advocacy, he secured over $2 million in funding from the  Florida Legislature and the Department of Justice, significantly  amplifying the program's reach and capacity. Financial stewardship and  ethical governance flourished under his leadership, with UWPC earning  the highest 4-star rating from Charity Navigator for four consecutive  years and maintaining a remarkably low 6.5 percent overhead. Charles  built strong partnerships with local, state, and federal leaders,  ensuring UWPC played a key role in disaster response and community  resilience efforts, including managing FEMA allocations and emergency  shelter coordination. Beyond programmatic and financial  accomplishments, Charles leaves a cultural legacy of collaboration,  compassion, and forward-thinking leadership. He empowered staff and  volunteers to innovate and excel, instilled a strong sense of mission  throughout the organization, and strengthened the relationship between  UWPC and its many partner agencies. Charles retired 2 months ago to  spend more time with his family, and he leaves behind a stronger, more  resilient UWPC prepared to meet future challenges.

It is clear Charles Anderson has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
