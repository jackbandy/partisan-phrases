Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Pastor Kenny Buzzie of Life Style Church has made to  our community in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton. In addition to  providing countless hours of direct support to neighbors and flood  victims, he helped coordinate the collection and distribution of  emergency supplies, meals and donated services to help those who needed  help. He and his wife also provided cash assistance to victims of  Hurricane Milton in Lacoochee, Trilby, Ridge Manor area. A truly  selfless leader, Pastor Buzzie was a strong advocate for bringing in  government and non-profit resources to aid in the recovery process.

It is clear that Pastor Kenny Buzzie has made a profoundly positive  impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all  strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
