Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Pricilla Cruz-Seado has made to our community  through her work with New Beginnings Youth Shelter, which serves  homeless kids aged 10 to 17 who are between foster homes, abandoned, or  homeless. The whole team jumps in to take care of the kids that have no  one else looking out for them. They teach kids structure, respect,  understanding and so much more in a loving environment. The team really  cares, and each member is deeply invested in the kids' long-term  success.

It is clear Pricilla Cruz-Seado has made a profoundly positive impact  on our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive  to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
