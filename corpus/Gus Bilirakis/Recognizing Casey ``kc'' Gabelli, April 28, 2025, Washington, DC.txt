Mr. BILIRAKIS. I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Casey ``KC'' Gabelli has made to our community in  the aftermath of Hurricane Milton. In addition to providing countless  hours of direct support to neighbors and flood victims, Casey helped  coordinate the collection and distribution of emergency supplies, meals  and donated services to help those who needed help. A truly selfless  leader, Casey was a strong advocate for bringing in government and non- profit resources to aid in the recovery process.

It is clear that Casey ``KC'' Gabelli has made a profoundly positive  impact on our community, and I am grateful for Casey's service. May we  all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and  humility.
