Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Tami Gaston has made through her work with  Cryoeeze22. Tami is dedicated, driven and determined to provide our  nation's heroes: military, Veterans, law enforcement and first  responders with scientific holistic options to treat an array of  conditions, including: PTSD, Suicide Prevention, inflammation, and many  more. Mrs. Gaston tirelessly works to raise awareness about the options  available as well as delivering the treatments often beyond regular  hours. Mrs. Gaston is the foundation of this non-profit. Additionally,  after hurricanes Helene and Milton, Mrs. Gaston and her family  organized donations of food, clothing, and other necessities to help  rebuild our community while still caring for our nation's heroes. Mrs.  Gaston is that rare human being who is dedicated to helping humanity.

It is clear Tami Gaston has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
