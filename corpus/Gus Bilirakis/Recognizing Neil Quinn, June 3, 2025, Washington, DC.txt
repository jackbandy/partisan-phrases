Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Mr. Neil Quinn has made to our community through his  work as an exceptional volunteer for Habitat for Humanity of Citrus  County for the past five years. In 2024 alone, this retired electrical  engineer volunteered nearly 400 hours across our construction sites and  ReStores. Mr. Quinn's impact is profoundly felt by the partner families  working toward homeownership. On construction sites, he shares his  expertise by teaching them essential home building and maintenance  skills. His mentorship empowers these families with practical knowledge  and fosters a sense of ownership of their future homes. Beyond  construction, Mr. Quinn repairs and revitalizes electrical appliances  at the organization's ReStores. By increasing the inventory of  resellable goods, he directly helps generate funds that enable the  construction of more affordable homes in our community. Neil is the  epitome of a team player, consistently willing to contribute his time  and talents wherever needed. His dedication and positive attitude are  respected by fellow volunteers, Habitat staff, and the partner families  he supports. Neil Quinn's commitment embodies the spirit of Habitat for  Humanity, making a tangible difference in the lives of families  striving for safe, stable, and affordable housing in Citrus County.

It is clear that Neil Quinn has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and  I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to serve our  communities with the same dedication and humility.
