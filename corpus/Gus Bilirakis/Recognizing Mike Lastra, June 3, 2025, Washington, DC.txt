Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Mr. Mike Lastra has made to our community in the  aftermath of Hurricane Milton. In addition to providing countless hours  of direct support to neighbors and flood victims, he helped coordinate  the collection and distribution of emergency supplies, meals and  donated services to help those who needed help. A truly selfless  leader, Mr. Lastra was a strong advocate for bringing in government and  non-profit resources to aid in the recovery process.

It is clear Mike Lastra has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
