Recognizing Jenna Cousins


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Jenna Cousins has made through her volunteerism at  Gulf Highlands Elementary School. Jenna supports the school in so many  ways. She is at every School Advisory Council (SAC) meeting, supports  all extra-curricular events, and consistently pitches in whenever  needed. The students know her and look forward to seeing her around  campus.

It is clear Jenna Cousins has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
