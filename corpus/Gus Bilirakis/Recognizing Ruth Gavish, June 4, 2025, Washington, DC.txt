Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Ms. Ruth Gavish has made to our community in the  aftermath of Hurricane Milton. In addition to providing countless hours  of direct support to neighbors and flood victims, she helped coordinate  the collection and distribution of emergency supplies, meals and  donated services to help those who needed help. A truly selfless  leader, Ms. Gavish was a strong advocate for bringing in government and  non-profit resources to aid in the recovery process.

It is clear that Ruth Gavish has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
