SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal       Trade Commission.

(2) Consent; digital forgery; identifiable individual;       intimate visual depiction.--The terms ``consent'', ``digital       forgery'', ``identifiable individual'', ``intimate visual       depiction'', and ``minor'' have the meaning given such terms       in section 223(h) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47       U.S.C. 223), as added by section 2.

(3) Covered platform.--

(A) In general.--The term ``covered platform'' means a       website, online service, online application, or mobile       application--

(i) that serves the public; and

(ii)(I) that primarily provides a forum for user-generated       content, including messages, videos, images, games, and audio       files; or

(II) for which it is in the regular course of trade or       business of the website, online service, online application,       or mobile application to publish, curate, host, or make       available content of nonconsensual intimate visual       depictions.

(II) for which any chat, comment, or interactive       functionality is incidental to, directly related to, or       dependent on the provision of the content described in       subclause (I).       SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Act, or an amendment made by this       Act, is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, the       remaining provisions of this Act and the amendments made by       this Act shall not be affected.

I rise today in strong support of S. 146, the TAKE IT DOWN Act by  Senator Ted Cruz. The bill addresses a serious gap in our current law,  a loophole that came to light in my own district.

I had a meeting on this particular issue with the sheriff in Pasco  County, Florida, Sheriff Nocco, and then I also talked to Senator Cruz  about one of his constituents. This is how we get things done. The best  ideas come from the people, and this is very necessary.

A teacher in my district used AI to create explicit content of his  students incorporating real images of his students taken from a  yearbook. Under current law, only the use of the actual photos is  illegal, the AI-generated, sexually explicit content is not.

Because of this gap, law enforcement was unable to fully charge this  particular individual, this sick individual, in my opinion, for the  scope of the images in his possession. Had this bill been in effect,  his actions would have been criminalized in full.

As technology evolves, so must our laws. We need to keep pace, there  is no question. We must. We must continue working hand in hand with our  law enforcement partners to stay ahead of these emerging threats and  safeguard our most vulnerable.

I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of S. 146. The  House sponsor is the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Salazar). She is a  great friend of mine. Let's get this done. We need to be protecting our  children.

Mr. BILIRAKIS.  Salazar), the House sponsor of this  particular bill, who is my good friend and a very effective Member of  Congress.

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the President of the United States for shedding  light on this particular bill at the state of the Union. I thank our  great First Lady as well for her support on this particular bill.

I thank Representatives Dean and Dingell, and, of course,  Representative Salazar who was also the main sponsor of the bill in the  House. I thank Senator Cruz who worked so very hard to get this done.

This is a bipartisan accomplishment, and we will protect our kids if  we pass this particular bill. It will go to the President once we pass  this bill. Let's get it done. Let's pass it unanimously.

Mr. Speaker, again, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
