Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise today to  recognize the life and service of Mr. Henry ``Floyd'' Wells who will  celebrate his 105th birthday this month--a milestone few ever reach. I  join his family, friends, and this grateful nation in celebrating not  only the years he has lived, but the legacy he has built through  courage, service, and unwavering patriotism. On June 9, 1944--his 24th  birthday--Floyd stepped onto a beach in Normandy, France, carrying only  a .45 pistol and a sawed-off shotgun. He was one of nearly 133,000  Allied troops who took part in the D-Day invasion. That historic day  changed the course of World War II and, ultimately, the course of world  history. But behind that massive operation were brave individuals like  Floyd--young Americans from small towns like Wauchula, Florida--who  answered the call to serve without hesitation. Mr. Wells' bravery, and  the bravery of all who fought beside him, helped secure the freedom we  enjoy today. He was part of a generation that stared down tyranny,  defended liberty, and rebuilt a shattered world. And for that, we are  eternally grateful. Floyd's service didn't end when the war did. He  came home, built a life, raised a family, and continued to live with  honor, humility, and strength. His son, Mike, speaks with great pride  about the man he is, and that pride is deeply deserved.

It is clear that Mr. Henry ``Floyd'' Wells represents the very best  of America--commitment, sacrifice, and love of country. I am proud to  represent a district that includes heroes, like him. May we never  forget that freedom is never free--and that behind every American flag  is the story of someone, like Floyd, who defended it. I wish a happy  105th birthday to Mr. Wells. May God bless him and his family, and may  He continue to bless the United States of America.
