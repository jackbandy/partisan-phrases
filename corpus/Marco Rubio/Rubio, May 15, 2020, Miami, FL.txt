Rubio, Mast, & Rooney Joint Statement on Army Corps Decision That Will Delay Critical Everglades Restoration Project


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Representatives Brian Mast (R-FL) and Francis Rooney (R-FL) issued the following joint statement regarding a decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that will delay critical work on the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) Storage Reservoir:

"President Trump and the Florida Congressional delegation have strongly and consistently supported Everglades restoration. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection and The South Florida Water Management District, under the leadership of Governor Ron DeSantis, have accelerated their work on the vital Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) Storage Reservoir.

 "However, the Army Corps' bureaucracy has proven an impediment to this vision shared by the President, Congress, and the State of Florida, by incorrectly interpreting the law and insisting that the EAA requires a "new start' designation. Through the 2018 Water Resources Development Act, Congress was crystal clear that the EAA reservoir is a part of the Central Everglades Planning Project, and does not require a "new start' designation. The Army Corps is ignoring Congressional intent, which will delay construction of the project by at least a year.

"We will continue to do everything in our power to force the Army Corps to follow Congress' directive that the EAA Reservoir be completed ASAP. Anything less is an affront to the vision and great work laid out by the Trump Administration to finish projects ahead of schedule and under budget, and to our shared goal of protecting and restoring our state's most precious natural treasure."
