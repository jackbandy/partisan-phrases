ICYMI: Rubio on America's Newsroom


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined America's Newsroom on Fox News to discuss the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). See below for highlights and watch the full interview here.

On extending and reforming the Paycheck Protection Program: "There is clearly a need for businesses to have more time to use their PPP money to rehire people because they're facing restrictions. The other thing I've said is that part of what we calculate as payroll should be the cost of protecting those workers, like buying personal protective equipment that they are going to need -- not just to meet local mandates, but also to be able to keep your employees safe." On reauthorizing FISA: "I personally don't like to see FISA used as leverage.  FISA is important for disrupting terrorist plots, for the potential that there is some American citizen that has been radicalized and is actively coordinating with a terrorist organization. We need to know what they're up to and there has to be a process to get access to that." On releasing conversations between Flynn and the FBI: "We have reached the point now where this has become such a part of the political narrative that you could argue that not releasing them would be more harmful than positive." On the abuse of the FISA process in the Flynn investigation: "The issue here is not that the process itself is problematic, but that it was abused.  They misled the FISA court in order to get their hands on the warrant. So the issue here is not the process but the way the process was abused. All processes can be abused, and so the question is can we do something to tighten and prevent those abuses."
