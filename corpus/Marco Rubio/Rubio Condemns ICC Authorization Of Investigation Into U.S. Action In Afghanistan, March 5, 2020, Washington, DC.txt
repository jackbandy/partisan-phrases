Rubio Condemns ICC Authorization Of Investigation Into U.S. Action In Afghanistan


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement following The International Criminal Court's (ICC) authorization of an investigation into U.S. action in Afghanistan:

"The ICC is making a mockery out of international justice. It is outrageous that the ICC would designate any resources to investigate United States personnel in Afghanistan as evil regimes and non-state actors commit atrocities around the globe. I am confident the United States will take all appropriate actions to protect Americans who serve honorably in defense of our country and our values."

Rubio is a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
