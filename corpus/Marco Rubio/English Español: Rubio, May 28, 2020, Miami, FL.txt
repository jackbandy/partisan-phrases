English/Espa√±ol: Rubio, Heinrich Statement On USCIS Resuming Naturalization Ceremonies


U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) resuming naturalization ceremonies under the guidance and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Senators Rubio and Heinrich sent a bipartisan letter to USCIS last week calling on the agency to safely resume naturalization ceremonies and to implement alternative oath-taking methods that comply with public health guidance. 

"We are pleased USCIS heeded our call to safely resume naturalization ceremonies to allow eligible immigrants to become U.S. citizens," the senators said. "Our immigrant communities have helped write the economic, social, and cultural story of America. We urge USCIS to continue working with all individuals faced with rescheduling such an important moment as they complete their journey to become citizens."
