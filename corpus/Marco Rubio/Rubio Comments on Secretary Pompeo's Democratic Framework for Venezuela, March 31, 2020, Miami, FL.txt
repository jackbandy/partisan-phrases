Rubio Comments on Secretary Pompeo's Democratic Framework for Venezuela


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo unveiled a "Democratic Framework for Venezuela": "The current crisis in Venezuela isn't a conflict between two legitimate political factions," Rubio said. "It is a struggle between an organized crime ring run by Nicol치s Maduro and a legitimate and democratically elected National Assembly led by Interim President Juan Guaid칩." 

"Secretary Pompeo is right to recognize a peaceful return to democracy led by a broadly acceptable transitional government as the ideal path forward," Rubio continued. "And such an effort would require the support and participation of the military and key leaders representing a cross section of political views. But it will fail if it sidelines Juan Guaid칩 and the legitimately elected National Assembly he leads. Or if it includes Nicol치s Maduro and certain members of the mafia he controls."

Rubio is the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and Global Women's Issues.
