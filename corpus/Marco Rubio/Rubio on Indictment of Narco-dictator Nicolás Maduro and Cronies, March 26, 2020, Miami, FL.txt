Rubio on Indictment of Narco-dictator Nicolás Maduro and Cronies


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement after Attorney General William Barr, U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the Southern District of Florida, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman of the Southern District of New York, and Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division formally indicted Venezuelan narco-dictator Nicolás Maduro and members of his inner circle for crimes ranging from money laundering and corruption to conspiring with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)--a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization-- to transport cocaine into the United States and American communities:  

"For far too long, Maduro's criminal enterprise has illegally enriched itself through corruption, drug trade, and terrorism. Today's indictment against Nicolás Maduro and senior members of his regime is an unprecedented step to hold accountable many thugs who have turned a once democratic nation into a narco-state," Rubio said. "The Venezuelan nationals indicted by the Justice Department have promoted narco-terrorism and illicit drug trade in our hemisphere, threatening the security of America and our allies in the region. The United States will not stop until justice for these crimes prevails." 

Rubio is the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and Global Women's Issues.
