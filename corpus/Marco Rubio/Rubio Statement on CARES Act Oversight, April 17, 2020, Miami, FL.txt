Rubio Statement on CARES Act Oversight


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, released the following statement after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) of the Senate Banking Committee would lead and coordinate the Senate's oversight of the historic CARES Act while working closely with the chairs of other committees of jurisdiction. "I am proud of the bipartisan work I spearheaded to create the Paycheck Protection Program and provide a much needed lifeline to our small businesses, which will be critical to restarting our economy," Chairman Rubio said. "Every federal program, especially new programs of this magnitude, requires oversight. For the past three weeks, the Senate Small Business Committee has worked with the SBA, Treasury, and lending institutions across the country to implement the PPP. We will continue to conduct oversight even as we fight to restart this program that has provided a lifeline to more than a million small businesses in just two weeks."
