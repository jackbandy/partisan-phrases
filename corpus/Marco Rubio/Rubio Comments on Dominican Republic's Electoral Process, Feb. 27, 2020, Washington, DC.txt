Rubio Comments on Dominican Republic's Electoral Process


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement after the suspension of municipal elections in the Dominican Republic due to a failure in the automated voting systems:

"The recent protests in the Dominican Republic and by the diaspora in Florida demonstrate the commitment of the Dominican people of preserving and defending their democracy. Following the events in the recent municipal elections on February 16, 2019, it's essential that the right to free and fair elections on the island be guaranteed. Therefore, it is important that democratic nations in the region support the Organization of American States' (OAS) decision to lead an audit of the automated voting systems. At a crucial moment in the Dominican Republic's future, I urge leaders in the country to preserve the democratic constitution."

Rubio is the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and Global Women's Issues.
