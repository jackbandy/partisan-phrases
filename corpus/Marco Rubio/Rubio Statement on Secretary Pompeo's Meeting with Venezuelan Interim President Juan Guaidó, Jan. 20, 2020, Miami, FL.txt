Rubio Statement on Secretary Pompeo's Meeting with Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guaidó


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Bogotá, Colombia to meet with Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guaidó and address the Third Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial: "This month, the international community witnessed and condemned the Maduro regime's escalation of violence against members of the democratically-elected National Assembly and Interim President Juan Guaidó. Secretary Pompeo's meeting with Guaidó will reaffirm our nation's unwavering support for the restoration of democratic order to a nation that has been destroyed by a narco-terrorist regime. As Maduro and his thugs continue to offer a safe-haven to Iran-backed Hezbollah sympathizers and members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), and the Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA), the U.S. must redouble its counterterrorism efforts against a growing threat, which I've reiterated poses a direct threat to our national security interests and the peace and stability of our regional allies."      Rubio is the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and Global Women's Issues.
