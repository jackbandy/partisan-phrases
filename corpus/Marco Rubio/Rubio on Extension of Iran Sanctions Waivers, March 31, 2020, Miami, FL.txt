Rubio on Extension of Iran Sanctions Waivers


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement after the Trump Administration announced it will extend sanctions waivers on Iran's civil nuclear program:

"The recent decision to once again renew sanctions waivers related to Iran's civil nuclear program is disappointing," Rubio said. "As Iran continues to violate its commitments, the U.S. should ensure that the regime in Tehran does not receive any support for its nuclear program from Russia, China, and other foreign countries. It is time for the Administration to end these waivers and continue maximum pressure against the Iranian regime." 

Rubio is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
