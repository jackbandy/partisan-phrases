Rubio Statement on Signing of Phase One China Deal


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) released a statement with regard to the signing of the phase one deal with China. Rubio is Cochair of the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) and a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

"President Trump deserves credit for tackling the defining geopolitical issue of this century. However, one trade deal alone will not solve the critical structural imbalances between the U.S. and China," Rubio said. "Finding a peaceful and workable path forward for our two nations will require us to increase our national strength. That is why I am wholly committed to furthering our national development through a new American industrial policy compatible with and complementary to our free market system."
