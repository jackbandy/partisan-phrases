Letter to President Donald Trump - Rubio Leads Call for More Action on American Hostages in Iran


Dear Mr. President:  We write to you with concern regarding American hostages in Iran, including former FBI agent Bob Levinson, the longest-held hostage in U.S. history. As tensions remain high with the terror-sponsoring regime in Tehran, we ask that you ensure the release of American citizens held in Iran, including Bob Levinson, Siamak and Baquer Namazi, and others, remain a priority for your administration. It is important for the U.S. government to do everything in its ability to fully support these American families and to help bring their loved ones home.  In November 2019, Iranian leadership acknowledged, for the first time, that Bob has an "ongoing case" before the Revolutionary Court in Tehran. However, further information has yet to be provided on his whereabouts and other details concerning his status. While you continue to assess U.S. policy towards Iran, we urge you to use the full weight of the U.S. government, and other international channels, to ensure the release of hostages remains a top priority. We also encourage you to apply maximum pressure on the Iranian regime until all American hostages are freed.    We appreciate your commitment and the efforts of your administration to bring home these American citizens and reunite them with their families. Bob cannot be left behind. It is time that he and all other American hostages are brought home. Thank you for your attention to this timely matter.   Sincerely,
