Rubio Comments on Decision to Conduct Anti-Drug Operations Off the Coast of Venezuela


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement after the Trump Administration announced "Enhanced Counter-Narcotic Operations" off the coast of Venezuela and in the Caribbean: "Today's announcement brings welcome military, intelligence, and law enforcement attention to the illicit trafficking of narcotics in our hemisphere that is directly responsible for killing Americans and destabilizing our region. This action should be of serious concern to Venezuelan dictator Nicol√°s Maduro and senior members of his regime, who were recently indicted for crimes including drug trafficking, corruption, and money laundering," Rubio said. "It's essential we continue all efforts to deny the Venezuelan narco-regime of financial support until democratic order and rule of law are restored."  Rubio is the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and Global Women's Issues.
