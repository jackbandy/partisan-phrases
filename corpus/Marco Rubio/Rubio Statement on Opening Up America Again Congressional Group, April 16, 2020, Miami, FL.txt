Rubio Statement on Opening Up America Again Congressional Group


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) released the following statement after  President Donald Trump selected him to serve on  the Opening Up America Again Congressional Group: "I am proud of the bipartisan work I spearheaded to create the Paycheck Protection Program and provide a much needed lifeline to our small businesses, which will be critical to restarting our economy," Chairman Rubio said. "It is unsustainable to keep our economy ground to a halt, but we cannot flip a switch and expect things to magically return to normal. Restarting the greatest economy in the world will require a methodical, comprehensive approach that takes into account public health and safety conditions across the country. We will only have one shot to get this right."
