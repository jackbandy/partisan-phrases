Rubio Statement on U.S. Funding to World Health Organization


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement after President Trump announced his Administration will withhold funds to the World Health Organization (WHO). Rubio previously called for a review of U.S. funding to the WHO as well as accountability for WHO's leadership, including Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, after its mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that started in Wuhan, China.

"The Chinese Communist Party used the WHO to mislead the world," Rubio said. "The organization's leadership is either complicit or dangerously incompetent. I will work with the Trump Administration to ensure the WHO is independent and has not been compromised by the CCP before we continue our current funding."

Rubio is a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the Senate Committee on Appropriations.
