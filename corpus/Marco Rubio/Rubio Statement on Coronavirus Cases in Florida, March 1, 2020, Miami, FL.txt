Rubio Statement on Coronavirus Cases in Florida


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) released the following statement after two individuals in Florida, including a resident of Manatee County and a resident of Hillsborough County, tested presumptively positive for the coronavirus:

"The health and safety of every Floridian, especially the elderly and those with compromised immune systems, remain my highest priority. I will continue to work with the Trump Administration and Governor DeSantis to ensure our State has the resources and information it needs. I am working with my colleagues in Congress on a funding package to ensure Florida has every available federal resource to respond to the coronavirus, and I look forward to its swift passage in the coming weeks."
