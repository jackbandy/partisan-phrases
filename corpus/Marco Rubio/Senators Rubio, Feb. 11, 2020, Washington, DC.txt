Senators Rubio, Klobuchar, and Representative Dunn Applaud Signing of their Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act into Law


U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) applauded the signing of their bipartisan Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act (S.153) into law, which will assist veterans re-entering the workforce by directing the National Science Foundation to encourage veterans to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent on December 19, 2019, and passed the House of Representatives unanimously by voice vote on January 27, 2020. Representative Neal Dunn, M.D. (R-FL), who introduced the companion bill in the House of Representatives, joined Rubio and Klobuchar in applauding the bill being signed into law.

"I thank my colleagues in the Senate and House for unanimously supporting this bipartisan effort to ensure our nation's veterans have the skills and opportunities to succeed in STEM careers, and I applaud President Trump for signing it into law," Rubio said. "Veterans who are returning to civilian life are uniquely qualified to excel in STEM roles, and the 21st century workforce will be dominated by these jobs. This bipartisan bill will ensure the skills our veterans attain during their service to our nation are put to good use for decades to come as they successfully transition back to civilian life.""Our servicemembers come from all different professions to serve our nation -- and they bring with them a wealth of experience when they return to civilian life. Now that the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act has been signed into law, we can provide veterans with the tools to secure well-paying jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math through STEM career training. Our bipartisan legislation will not only help veterans to succeed, but also enable employers to better meet their hiring needs and strengthen our economy and our nation," Klobuchar said.
