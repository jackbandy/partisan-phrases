Letter to President Donald Trump - Senator Rick Scott, Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Jenniffer González-Colón Urge President Trump to Approve Puerto Rico's Disaster Declaration Following Devastating Earthquakes


Dear Mr. President:

 

During the last few weeks, Puerto Rico has suffered a series of intensifying earth tremors that peaked yesterday and early this morning with an earthquake that has caused casualties and significant damages to structures in the southern region of the Island. Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vázquez has made the request for a disaster declaration.

 

We write in support of the Governor's request and urge that you instruct the different agencies of the executive branch, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and all others with jurisdiction and capabilities to promptly provide the necessary support. The localities that are grappling with the effects of the earth tremors are smaller municipalities that do not have the necessary resources to handle the situation alone, and the Puerto Rico local agencies are taxed to their limits by their fiscal condition and the continuing larger recovery effort.

 

It will be of great relief to the people of Puerto Rico to have the disaster support of the White House. We thank you for your consideration.
