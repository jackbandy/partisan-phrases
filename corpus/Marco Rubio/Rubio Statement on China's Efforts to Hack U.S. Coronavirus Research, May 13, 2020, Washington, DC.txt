Rubio Statement on China's Efforts to Hack U.S. Coronavirus Research


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) released a statement following reports that China has increased efforts and launched cyberattacks to steal U.S. research related to COVID-19.  "Even amidst the coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese government and Communist Party's efforts to steal intellectual property and trade secrets from American companies remains an ongoing threat," Rubio said. "Adjusting to the new reality caused by the pandemic, Beijing has shifted its recruitment efforts for the Thousand Talents Program online, and it has increased efforts to hack U.S. medical research institutes for COVID-19 information. Policymakers at every level of the U.S. government, as well as the private sector, must be clear-eyed about this threat and work diligently to protect against it." Rubio is a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.
