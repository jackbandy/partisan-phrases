Rubio Statement on NAS Pensacola Terrorist Shooting


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) released a statement after Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray held a virtual press conference announcing updates in the criminal investigation of the December 6, 2019 shooting at the Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida which killed three U.S. Service members and wounded eight other Americans. "I thank the FBI and DOJ for working tirelessly to ensure the safety of all Americans following the terrorist attack at NAS Pensacola late last year," Rubio said. "While no action can bring back the heroes who tragically lost their lives, we can commit ourselves to ensuring that reforms are put in place to prevent an attack like this from happening in the future. The FBI's dedicated efforts to uncover previously unknown evidence indicates this terrorist was radicalized over a period of years -- dating back prior to his arrival in the United States. I look forward to working to implement the findings from DoD's Vetting and Security Review team to increase vetting procedures for all future international military students."
