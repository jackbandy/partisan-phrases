"I'm Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, and I'm also the Chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee.  "And every week we announce a Senate Small Business of the Week. "This week, our Small Business of the Week is No Limits Cafe of Middletown, New Jersey.  "They opened in February, and their employees are largely adults with intellectual disabilities.  "And when the crisis hit - like most businesses - they were forced to close and to lay off all of their employees.  "But then they were able to get a Paycheck Protection Program loan. And they rehired all of their employees.  "And they're weathering the storm now through take-out, and by helping their customers.  "And for that, we're grateful. You are an example to the country.  "Thank you for everything you're doing.  "No Limits Cafe, you are the Senate Small Business of the Week." As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Senator Rubio continues the tradition of honoring America's small businesses and entrepreneurs. The Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship oversees proposed legislation on matters relating to the Small Business Administration and investigates all problems relating to America's small businesses.
