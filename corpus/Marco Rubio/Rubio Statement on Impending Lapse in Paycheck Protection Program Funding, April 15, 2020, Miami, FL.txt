Rubio Statement on Impending Lapse in Paycheck Protection Program Funding


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, released the following statement before the impending lapse in funding for the U.S. Small Business Administration's $349 billion Paycheck Protection Program, which gives forgivable loans to small businesses impacted by COVID-19.    "It is inexcusable that the Paycheck Protection Program will grind to a halt tonight," Chairman Rubio said.  "In less than two weeks, the PPP helped over 1 million small businesses receive forgivable loans. Now, millions of small businesses are in limbo because Democrats refused to put aside partisan politics and fund this bipartisan program. I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass a clean funding bill for PPP tomorrow."
