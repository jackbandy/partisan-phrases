Rubio Statement on Planned Parenthood Improperly Receiving PPP Loans


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, released a statement regarding reports that thirty-seven Planned Parenthood affiliates applied for and improperly received a total of $80 million in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).

"There is no ambiguity in the legislation that passed or public record around its passage that organizations such as Planned Parenthood, whose parent organization has close to half a billion dollars in assets, is not eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program," Chairman Rubio said. "Those funds must be returned immediately. Furthermore, the SBA should open an investigation into how these loans were made in clear violation of the applicable affiliation rules and if Planned Parenthood, the banks, or staff at the SBA knowingly violated the law all appropriate legal options should be pursued."
