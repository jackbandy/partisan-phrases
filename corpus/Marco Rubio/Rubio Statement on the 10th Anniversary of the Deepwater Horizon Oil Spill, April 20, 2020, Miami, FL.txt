Rubio Statement on the 10th Anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) released the following statement on the 10th anniversary of the tragic Deepwater Horizon explosion that took the lives of 11 men and led to this nation's largest oil spill:

"A decade ago, the explosion from the Deepwater Horizon Macondo oil well caused the largest oil spill in our history, devastating the Florida and Gulf Coast economy. The 87-day discharge wreaked havoc on our environment and communities and tragically claimed the lives of 11 crew members. As we reflect on the tenth anniversary of this catastrophe, we must remember the families and friends who lost a loved one.

"Occurring at the height of our state's busiest tourism season, the economic disaster that ensued from the spill plagued communities long after the 4.9 million barrels of oil stopped flowing into the Gulf. Small businesses had to lay off employees, and many in the tourism and fishing industries were forced to close. The Florida economy suffered on both of our coasts. While the location of the well was off of Louisiana's coast, these impacts highlight the need to prevent drilling closer to our waters.

"Florida's communities do not have the certainty of an extended Eastern Gulf of Mexico moratorium that they deserve. I will continue to fight for our communities, and I remain committed to ensuring the moratorium on oil and gas drilling is extended past 2022."
