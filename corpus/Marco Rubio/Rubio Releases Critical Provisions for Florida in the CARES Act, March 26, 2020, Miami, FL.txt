Rubio Releases Critical Provisions for Florida in the CARES Act


U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) released a list of provisions in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act that will be critical to the State of Florida during the coronavirus pandemic. These critical provisions include Rubio's bipartisan Keeping American Workers Paid and Employed Act, a small business emergency economic relief plan that provides more than $377 billion for small businesses to meet their payroll and expenses, and receive education and assistance throughout the coronavirus pandemic. Rubio applauded the passage of the CARES Act in the Senate last night by a vote of 96 to 0. "Communities across Florida and our nation are reeling from this unprecedented crisis, and last night the Senate acted on an unprecedented response to provide relief to Americans, small businesses, and our economy," Rubio said. "Our bipartisan small business package, which was included, will provide emergency relief so that millions of American workers can keep their jobs and millions of small businesses can stay open. As our nation works to contain the spread of the coronavirus, I remain in close contact with the Trump Administration and Governor DeSantis to ensure that Florida has the resources it needs during this public health crisis."

For the vast majority of Americans, no action on their part will be required in order to receive a rebate check as the IRS will use a taxpayer's 2019 tax return if filed, or in the alternative their 2018 return.This includes many low-income individuals who file a tax return in order to take advantage of the refundable Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC).

The provision also temporarily removes the taxable income limitation to allow an NOL to fully offset income.Accelerates the ability of companies to recover those Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credits, permitting companies to claim a refund now and obtain additional cash flow during the COVID-19 emergency.
