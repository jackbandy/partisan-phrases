Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate  the 50th anniversary of the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation, an  organization that has made a profound and enduring impact on  communities in Pennsylvania and across our Nation.

The Foundation carries forward the extraordinary legacy of Dr. Philip  Jaisohn. He was a visionary leader, physician, journalist, educator,  and the first Korean-born naturalized citizen of the United States. Dr.  Jaisohn dedicated his life to strengthening democracy, expanding  opportunity, and advancing the ideals of freedom and human dignity.

Since its founding in 1975, the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation  has served as a beacon of cross-cultural connection and advancement.  Through its programs, scholarships, lectures, and partnerships, the  Foundation has enabled countless young people to develop the  leadership, knowledge, and character needed to build bridges across  cultures and to contribute meaningfully to both the United States and  the Korean-American community.

In doing so, the Foundation exemplifies the best of our national  values: tolerance, opportunity, service. and hope. Its enduring  commitment reaffirms that freedom and democracy flourish when  individuals are empowered, informed, and engaged in their communities.

For fifty years, the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation has honored  those ideals through its comprehensive service to the community. Its  mission is clear and powerful: ``to promote and fulfill Dr. Philip  Jaisohn's ideals of humanity through a broad range of medical and  health care, senior employment training, and social services along with  educational and cultural programs for the enrichment of the  community.'' This mission comes to life every day through compassionate  care, civic engagement, cultural preservation, and programs that  empower individuals and families to thrive.

Through health care access, senior workforce development,  scholarships, educational initiatives, and community programs, the  Foundation has served as a bridge between cultures and a beacon of  hope. It has strengthened the Korean American community while enriching  the social, civic, and cultural fabric of our Commonwealth and our  Nation.

As the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation marks fifty years of  leadership, service, and impact, we honor its board members, staff,  volunteers, supporters, and everyone who has worked to carry forward  Dr. Jaisohn's vision. Their dedication ensures that his legacy not only  endures but continues to shape future generations.

Mr. Speaker, I offer my congratulations and deepest gratitude. May  the next fifty years be marked by continued growth, service, and  achievement. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending heartfelt  congratulations to the faculty, staff, and volunteers as they celebrate  this extraordinary milestone and continue their inspiring journey into  the next century of learning, leadership, and community.
