Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an exceptional  individual from my district, Lieutenant William Moffett of the  Buckingham Township Police Department. Today, I proudly commend him on  his well-earned retirement, following decades of committed service to  the people of Bucks County.

Lieutenant Moffett's distinguished career in public service began in  1981, when he served as an EMT with the Bucks County Rescue Squad and  Bensalem Rescue Squad. Two years later, he joined the Bucks County  Department of Communications as a Police, Fire, and EMS dispatcher,  demonstrating his deep commitment to public safety.

In 1987, Lieutenant Moffett transitioned to a career in law  enforcement as a Deputy Sheriff with the Bucks County's Sheriff's  Department. Then, in 1990, he joined the Buckingham Township Police  Department, where he would serve for the next 35 years.

He began his service as an Officer and quickly distinguished himself  through exceptional dedication and leadership. Throughout his tenure,  he earned multiple promotions, rising through the ranks of Officer,  Corporal, Sergeant, and ultimately Lieutenant. In each role, Lieutenant  Moffett brought integrity and professionalism.

Notably, Lieutenant Moffett played a major role in implementing a new  record management system, obtaining body-worn and in-car dash cameras,  and acquiring taser devices for the department. His efforts helped to  modernize the force and enhance public safety.

Beyond these contributions, he has shared his vast experiences and  leadership abilities with generations of the department's officers.  Above all, Lieutenant Moffett's pride in serving the residents of Bucks  County was always evident--so much so that this legacy continues, with  all three of his sons now serving as police officers in communities  across the county.

After a long and honorable career in law enforcement, Lieutenant  Moffett looks forward to a well-deserved retirement.

Mr. Speaker, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Lieutenant  William Moffett on his retirement and thank him for 44 years of  distinguished service to the citizens of Bucks County. His leadership  and dedication will leave a lasting mark on the community he so  faithfully served.
