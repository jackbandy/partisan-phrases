Protect America's Workforce Act


Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2550,  bipartisan legislation to restore collective bargaining rights for  hundreds of thousands of unionized Federal employees.

This legislation reaffirms a core principle: A government that serves  the people must also respect the rights of those who serve within it.

Federal employees work tirelessly every day, often behind the scenes.  They process Social Security benefits, safeguard our food and water,  care for our veterans, and respond whenever a disaster strikes. Their  work is essential, and its impact reaches every community across this  Nation.

Mr. Speaker, by restoring their collective bargaining rights, we  strengthen a system that keeps government effective, stable, and  responsive, all without compromising security or mission readiness.

Reinstating these rights is not a concession. It is a commitment, a  commitment to treat federal workers with dignity, to reinforce a  resilient public service, and to honor the commitment of the men and  women who show up for the American people every single day.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank my  friend and colleague from Maine, Jared Golden, for his partnership,  and, more importantly, for his courage in advancing this initiative.
