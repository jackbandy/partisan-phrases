Recognizing the Life of Krista Wynne Moore


Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of an extraordinary constituent and community member, Krista  Wynne Moore, of Oaks, Pennsylvania, who passed away peacefully on March  13, 2025, at the age of 48. Krista was a woman whose warmth,  leadership, and unwavering compassion profoundly impacted all who knew  her, and her legacy will continue to inspire our community for years to  come.

Krista's academic and professional journey was marked by dedication  and excellence. She graduated with honors from Temple University and  was selected for the prestigious Johnson & Johnson Financial Leadership  Development Program. Her commitment to helping colleagues reach their  fullest potential earned her the respect and admiration of her peers,  and many of these professional relationships evolved into lifelong  friendships that will endure in her memory.

Beyond her professional accomplishments, Krista was known for her  kindness, generosity, and deep love for all living creatures. She was  an avid animal lover, and her compassion extended far beyond her own  pets. Krista carried an emergency kit in her car, always prepared to  offer care to any animal in need. Her deep empathy for animals was  matched only by her unwavering dedication to helping others. Krista's  compassion reflected her core values: to always act with care and  humanity, to always lift others up.

In her personal life, Krista was a loving and assertive individual  whose vibrant spirit and infectious laughter brought joy to every room  she entered. Whether through her mentorship or her personal  relationships, Krista taught all those around her how to live with  purpose, to approach challenges with resilience and compassion, and to  uplift others in the process. She was a dedicated wife, daughter,  sister, stepmother, and friend, and her legacy lives on in the hearts  of all who were fortunate enough to know her.

As we reflect on Krista's life, we recognize the profound impact she  had on her community. From her work with colleagues to her commitment  to helping animals and the countless friendships she fostered, Krista's  influence will continue to resonate. Her leadership, compassion, and  generosity have left an indelible mark, and it is a legacy we will  carry forward with pride.

Krista's life was a testament to what it means to live with purpose,  passion, and an unwavering commitment to the well-being of others. Her  spirit of kindness and leadership will live on through the many lives  she touched, and today, we honor her memory and celebrate the  remarkable legacy she leaves behind.

May we all strive to embody the same compassion and commitment to  lifting others up that Krista demonstrated throughout her life. She  will be dearly missed.
