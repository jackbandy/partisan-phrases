Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and commend Mayor  Joe Taylor of Langhorne Borough, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a devoted  public servant whose life's work reflects unwavering commitment,  integrity, and the highest ideals of civic leadership.

Since making Langhorne Borough his home in 2010, Mayor Taylor has  never simply lived in the community--he has poured his heart into it.  Over twelve years as Mayor, he has provided thoughtful, measured, and  dependable leadership. He has been a steady hand through times of  growth and challenge, always guided by what is best for the families  and officials who rely on Borough government each day. His strong  support for the Langhorne Borough Police Department, his responsiveness  to residents, and his collaborative approach to governing have made a  lasting and positive impact on the borough he loves.

Mayor Taylor's distinguished tenure in elected office is only one  chapter of a lifetime spent protecting and serving others. In 1972, he  answered the call to join the Langhorne Fire Department, beginning a  fifty-year journey of volunteer fire service that continues to this  day. Over those five decades, he has served in numerous vital  capacities including Firefighter, Chief, and currently Deputy Chief.  Today, he continues his active service, contributing as a member of the  Apparatus Committee, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and Vice  President of the Langhorne Firemen's Relief Association, all while  still responding to emergency calls and supporting daily operations.

Mr. Speaker, the measure of a true leader is not found in titles  alone, but in the lives improved because they cared. Mayor Taylor has  responded to emergencies in the middle of the night, helped families in  their moments of greatest need, and ensured that Langhorne's government  remained responsive, compassionate, and responsible. His legacy is  built on countless acts of service which are many unseen, but all  deeply felt.

Today, we express gratitude not only for his public accomplishments,  but also for the humility, kindness, and character that have defined  his service. He has lived a life that reflects a simple but powerful  principle: when you love your community, you show up. And Joe Taylor  has always shown up.

On behalf of Pennsylvania's 1st District and the United States House  of Representatives, I express my deepest appreciation to Mayor Joe  Taylor for his service, his patriotism, and his enduring love of  community.

I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Mayor Joe Taylor for his  exemplary leadership and for more than fifty years of dedicated  service to the people of Langhorne Borough and the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania. We extend our best wishes to him and his family as they  embark on this next chapter, knowing that his impact will continue to  shape Langhorne for generations to come.
