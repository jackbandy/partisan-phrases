Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  extraordinary woman, a true pillar of our community, whose life has  been defined by service, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to  others--Diane Reitz.

Even as she wages a courageous battle against stage IV pancreatic  cancer, Diane continues to give of herself--to her family, her  neighbors, her country, and, above all, to the veterans of Bucks County  and Southeast Pennsylvania. She is not simply enduring--she is  inspiring.

Diane was born in Philadelphia but found her true home in Levittown,  where she has lived for 64 years on the very same street--Rocky Pool  Lane. It was there that she grew up, raised a family, and built a life  of meaning and service. She graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School  and went on to become a registered nurse, earning degrees from  Philadelphia University and Gwynedd Mercy University. But while her  education equipped her with knowledge, it was her heart that made her a  healer.

For 56 years, Diane has been the devoted wife of Ronald ``Ron''  Reitz, an Army veteran and longtime barber. Together, they raised two  children, Cheryl and Joan, who, in turn, blessed them with five  grandchildren: Emma, Anne, Raegan, Kassidy, and Quinn. But Diane's  sense of duty has never stopped at her own front door.

Service is not just something Diane does--it is the essence of who  she is. A pillar of our community, she has led Girl Scout troops,  inspired others as a Zumba instructor, and spearheaded efforts that  have uplifted countless lives. She raised over $50,000 for the American  Heart Association's ``Go Red for Women'' campaign, ensuring critical  support for those in need. She has honored our nation's heroes by  organizing reunions for the 75th Ranger Regiment and playing a key role  in the 50th Anniversary commemoration of the end of the Vietnam war,  ensuring their sacrifices are never forgotten.

But Diane's impact is more than the sum of her efforts--it is felt in  the lives she touches. She offers belonging to the overlooked, purpose  to the uncertain, and hope to those in need. She steps forward when  others step back, embodying the very spirit of service and reminding us  all what it truly means to give of oneself.

Yet, it is her work with our veterans that stands as the most  profound expression of her dedication. Recognizing the crisis of  veteran suicide, Diane took action. She joined forces with Vietnam war  hero Captain David A. Christian to establish Victor Six Health and  Fitness, an innovative program designed to combat the mental and  emotional struggles afflicting so many of our returning servicemembers.

Drawing upon groundbreaking research from institutions such as Johns  Hopkins, the Cleveland Clinic, and Mount Sinai Hospital, Diane  developed a 12-week program focused on the critical link between  physical fitness and cognitive health. The impact has been  extraordinary: veterans struggling with Post-Traumatic Stress Injury  (PTSI) have not only regained their strength but have rebuilt their  lives--finding employment, reconnecting with their families, and  reclaiming their sense of purpose. And perhaps most notably, since its  inception, not a single veteran who has completed the Victor Six  program has taken their own life. Veterans travel hours each way to  participate in Diane's program, not simply because of the results, but  because they know that behind it stands a woman who believes in them,  fights for them, and refuses to give up on them.

Her work has been recognized with commendations from the United  States Army and the United States Marine Corps, but her greatest honor  is reflected in the lives she has transformed. I have seen firsthand  the strength and camaraderie her program fosters--veterans standing  shoulder to shoulder, forging a path forward with renewed hope and  dignity.

Mr. Speaker, Diane Reitz embodies the highest ideals of duty, honor,  and country. Her story is a powerful reminder that one person, armed  with conviction and compassion, can change the world.
