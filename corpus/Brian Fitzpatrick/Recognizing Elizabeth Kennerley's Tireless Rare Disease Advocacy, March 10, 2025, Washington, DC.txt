Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  extraordinary constituent from my district, Elizabeth Kennerley. As a  rare disease patient, advocate, and unwavering supporter of inclusive  healthcare, Liz has devoted her life to making a meaningful impact on  her community and those affected by rare diseases. She continues to  inspire those around her, with her astounding selflessness and  resilience.

Liz's journey is one that few can imagine. As someone who lives with  the burden of a rare disease, Liz has not only used her personal  journey to advocate for others but has also dedicated herself to  advocating on Capitol Hill for those living with rare diseases. She is  also a dedicated member of the Rare Disease Diversity Coalition (RDDC),  where she works to ensure that the needs of rare disease patients are  heard. Liz's work with the RDDC has been instrumental in promoting  inclusivity in healthcare policy.

The RDDC proudly awarded Liz this year's RISE Award, as she  consistently embodies the very essence of what RISE stands for  Resilience, Inspiration, Strength, and Empowerment.

As Liz would say, ``being a patient with a rare disease is the  hardest job in the world,'' a sentiment that highlights the incredible  challenges and resilience required to live with a rare disease. Through  her unwavering dedication, Liz ensures that the voices of rare disease  patients are heard. We thank her for her dedicated service to our  community.
