Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor a  dedicated constituent Mr. Joseph Bongarzone, a distinguished Letter  Carrier with the United States Postal Service, retiring after a 37-year  career dedicated to serving the community of Hatboro, Pennsylvania.

Joseph embarked on his journey with the United States Postal Service  on February 14, 1987, beginning as a clerk in Southampton,  Pennsylvania. After nearly a year of service in that role, he  transitioned to the Hatboro facility, where he would remain for the  rest of his career, steadfastly delivering mail and upholding the  principles of dedication, diligence, and service.

Coming from a family with a deep-rooted tradition in the Postal  Service, Joseph was honored to follow in the footsteps of his father,  Joseph, and his two brothers, Paul and Jeff. His career was defined by  an unwavering commitment to his duties, demonstrating an exemplary work  ethic that inspired colleagues and endeared him to the residents he  served. Regardless of inclement weather or personal hardship, Joseph's  dedication never faltered--his presence was a certainty, ensuring that  his community received their mail with the efficiency and reliability  that only a true public servant could provide.

In recognition of his outstanding service and commitment to safety,  Joseph was honored with the prestigious Million Mile Award from the  United States Postal Service--a testament to his exceptional record of  accident-free performance and dedication to excellence. This honor is  reserved for those who have exemplified the highest standards of  professionalism and care in their service.

As Joseph officially retired on February 28, 2025, we take this  moment to extend our deepest gratitude for his decades of dedication  and service to the people of Hatboro. His legacy stands as a shining  example of what it means to be a committed public servant, and his  contributions to the United States Postal Service will not be  forgotten.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the  remarkable career of Joseph Bongarzone and wishing him a fulfilling and  well-deserved retirement. May his legacy of integrity, commitment, and  service continue to inspire future generations of postal workers.
