Industrial Hemp in Kentucky


Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address an issue very near and dear  to my heart--industrial hemp.

As Kentucky's Commissioner of Agriculture, I led the charge to make  Kentucky the very first State to legally grow hemp. Fast forward to  today, hemp is a major crop for our Kentucky farmers, and nearly every  farmer I know who grew hemp last year was a former tobacco farmer.

Hemp is doing exactly today what I predicted in 2015. It has become  an alternative crop to tobacco for Kentucky farmers.

The Senate recently added language to a continuing resolution that  would put our Kentucky hemp farmers out of business. I will be working  to add language to the continuing resolution next week to fix it. I  certainly hope all my colleagues will join with me in supporting this  language to help our Kentucky farmers as well as the hundreds of jobs  that have been created because of industrial hemp in Kentucky.
