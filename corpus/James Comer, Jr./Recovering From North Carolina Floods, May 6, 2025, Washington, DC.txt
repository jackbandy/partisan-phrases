Recovering From North Carolina Floods

Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, many parts of Kentucky are just now  recovering from a devastating flood that we saw a few weeks ago. I  thank the first responders who were first on the scene, and thank our  utility crews who worked day and night to restore utilities.

I want to let the families who lost everything know that if there is  anything my office can do to be of any assistance, don't hesitate to  reach out. President Trump has signed a declaration for individual  assistance. FEMA should be on the ground, working with families to try  to help identify any type of assistance that the families in need can  qualify for, and I encourage FEMA to continue to work with the local  governments to ensure that the heavy burden of debris removal is  reimbursed by the Federal Government. That is something that my office  will continue to ensure to see that it happens.

We have had devastating floods. The government's responsibility is to  help those in need, and that is what we expect to do. Mr. Speaker, I  just wanted to make that point loud and clear and hope that we can  continue to work through the recovery phase.
