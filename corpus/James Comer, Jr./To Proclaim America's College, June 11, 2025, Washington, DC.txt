To Proclaim America's College


Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce that America has a  new baseball team, and that baseball team is the Murray State Racers  located in Murray, Kentucky.

Murray State is a real-life Cinderella story. Murray State was the  number four seed after winning the Missouri Valley Conference. They  played in the Oxford Regional where, of course, Ole Miss is, and they  beat Ole Miss twice and Georgia Tech once to advance to the Super  Regional. Then Murray State did what every blue-blooded Kentucky  Wildcat fan could only dream of, they beat Duke. They didn't just beat  Duke on their home field once, they beat Duke twice to advance to Omaha  to the College World Series.

This is a historic achievement for a small school. Murray State  defied the odds in the era of NIL and big contracts and players getting  paid. This is a group of baseball players that want to play ball. They  play hard every game. They weren't highly recruited, and they win.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Coach Skirka and the Murray State Racers  and the entire Murray, Kentucky, community.
