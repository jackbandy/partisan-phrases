Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2225) to permit a registered investment company to omit  certain fees from the calculation of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses,  and for other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2225

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Small Business       Investor Capital Act''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO ACQUIRED FUND FEES AND EXPENSES                     REPORTING ON INVESTMENT COMPANY REGISTRATION                     STATEMENTS.

(b) Excluding Business Development Companies From Acquired       Fund Fees and Expenses.--A registered investment company may,       on any investment company registration statement filed       pursuant to section 8(b) of the Investment Company Act of       1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-8(b)), omit from the calculation of       Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses those fees and expenses that       the investment company incurred indirectly as a result of       investment in shares of one or more Acquired Funds that is a       business development company.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2225, the Access to  Small Business Investor Capital Act. I thank Congressman Sherman and  the bipartisan cosponsors for their work on this bill.

This is a narrowly tailored fix to a longstanding problem that is  hurting business development companies, or BDCs, which Congress  originally created to help small and midsized businesses access  capital.

Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the SEC rule called Acquired Fund Fees  and Expenses, or AFFE, requires funds that invest in BDCs to count the  BDC internal expenses as part of their own expense ratio. The result is  a higher reported cost, even though those fees aren't actually paid by  the investor.

This has led many funds to avoid BDCs altogether, and it has kept  BDCs out of key investment indexes. That means fewer dollars flowing to  small businesses on Main Street.

H.R. 2225 fixes this. It allows funds to exclude expenses related to  BDCs from their AFFE calculation, while still disclosing their  investment in BDCs. This improves both accuracy and transparency. This  is a smart and bipartisan solution that removes an intended barrier to  capital formation without reducing investor protections.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, in closing, this is a smart and bipartisan  solution that removes an unintended barrier to capital formation  without reducing investor protections.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2225, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
