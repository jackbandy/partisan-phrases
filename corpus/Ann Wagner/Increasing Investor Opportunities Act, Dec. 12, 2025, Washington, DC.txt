Increasing Investor Opportunities Act


Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chair, I would like to share the preliminary  estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on H.R. 3383, the  INVEST Act.

CBO has previously estimated the direct spending and revenue effects,  on a preliminary or final basis, for each section of the Rules version  of H.R. 3383. CBO and JCT estimate that H.R. 1013 (Retirement Fairness  for Charities and Educational Institutions Act of 2025), whose language  is mirrored in section 202 of H.R. 3383, would not impact direct  spending over the 2026 to 2035 period but would affect the revenues and  deficit by an insignificant amount over that same period. For every  other bill that has been compiled into H.R. 3383, CBO estimates that  there would not be any direct spending or revenue effects over the 2026  to 2035 period.

On a preliminary basis, CBO estimates that the combined bill has no  direct spending effects and would impact the revenues and deficit by an  insignificant amount over the 2026 to 2035 period.
