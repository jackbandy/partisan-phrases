Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1469, the Senior Security Act.  I thank my colleague, Representative Gottheimer, for his work on this  vital piece of bipartisan legislation that will strengthen protections  for senior investors. I am proud to be the co-lead of this bill.

Fraud and exploitation jeopardize the integrity of our capital  markets. When this illicit activity specifically targets senior  investors, it poses an even graver threat, impacting those who often  rely most on their investments.

According to the FBI, in 2023, senior investors fell victim to scams  and fraud totaling over $3.4 billion in losses, an increase of  approximately 11 percent from the year prior.

The Senior Security Act is designed to reinforce and enhance our  safeguards protecting senior investors from financial fraud and abuse.

H.R. 1469 creates the senior investor task force within the  Securities and Exchange Commission which is tasked with reporting on  industry trends and challenges impacting investors over the age of 65.  The task force will also make recommendations for changes to existing  legislation and regulations to address the unique issues faced by our  senior investors.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1469 has received strong bipartisan support in the  past, passing by suspension in the last three Congresses. It remains a  commonsense solution to ensure that senior investors receive adequate  protection against fraud and exploitation.

Again, I thank Mr. Gottheimer for his work on this bill and his  partnership on other efforts to protect senior investors, including my  Financial Exploitation Prevention Act.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1469.
