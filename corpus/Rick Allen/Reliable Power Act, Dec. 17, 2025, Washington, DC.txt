Reliable Power Act

Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3616, the Reliable Power  Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor.

My home State of Georgia has been named the number one State to do  business in for 12 consecutive years, making it a popular destination  for new manufacturing facilities and data centers. While I join  Georgians in welcoming these economic drivers to our State, it also  presents increased demand for our grid that we must address.

We know electricity demand is expected to grow significantly over the  next several years, which means this body has a duty to ensure our  constituents have a dependable grid that meets the needs of hardworking  families.

Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, both the Obama and Biden-Harris  administrations were guilty of using the EPA to promote radical policy  designed to drive out baseload generation in favor of wind and solar,  which simply cannot assure adequate grid reliability. It increases the  risk of rolling blackouts.

H.R. 3616 will correct that very problem by improving Federal  rulemaking to ensure that future regulations impacting power generation  will not harm electricity reliability, especially in already vulnerable  regions.

Under this bill, if FERC finds that a proposed rule will have a  significant impact on reliability, the rule cannot be finalized. That  is about as commonsense as it gets.

Mr. Speaker, the United States has an abundant energy supply. The  question we must ask ourselves is not if we  have enough energy resources but can we produce energy at the necessary  levels to meet the growing demand? The Reliable Power Act will help us  do just that, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 3616.
