Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Augusta radio  host Austin Rhodes on the recent announcement that he will be inducted  into the Georgia Radio Hall of Fame.

For over 30 years, Austin has been a consistent and dependable voice  as the host of the ``Austin Rhodes Show'' on WGAC, making it one of  Georgia's longest running weekday drive-time talk shows.

Nearly 3 years ago, I stood before this body to recognize Austin's  30th year anniversary in broadcasting, and it is my honor to stand here  once again to mark yet another achievement in his long career.

During my time in Congress, I have had the pleasure of joining  Austin's  show on many occasions to discuss key issues impacting our Nation and  the CSRA. I will always appreciate Austin's flexibility, willingness to  have important conversations, and most of all his ability to tell it  like he sees it.

I congratulate Austin on this well-deserved honor. I have no doubt  that he will continue to be our afternoon voice on the airways for many  years to come.
