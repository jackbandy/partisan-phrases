Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Latta for yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3668, the Improving  Interagency Coordination for Pipeline Reviews Act offered by Chairman  Hudson.

My Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues and I have been hard at  work this year, crafting commonsense legislative solutions to improve  our burdensome Federal permitting process. The bill before us today is  just one example.

Due to unclear review processes and a lack of coordination amongst  government agencies, pipeline infrastructure approvals in this country  have been significantly delayed in many cases, often resulting in  insufficient infrastructure to transport our clean natural gas.

The result is an electric grid that is less reliable and increased  utility prices for hardworking Americans. While natural gas demand is  expected to reach an all-time high, accounting for more than 40 percent  of electric generation in the U.S. next year, this is clearly a  pressing issue that must be addressed immediately. H.R. 3668 is the  answer.

This legislation bolsters FERC's rule as the lead agency in the  natural gas pipeline review process, empowering them to oversee  communication between agencies and streamline pipeline reviews and  approvals so Americans can access the energy they need on a daily  basis.

Mr. Speaker, the build-out of interstate natural gas pipeline  infrastructure is essential to ensuring domestic energy can be  transported efficiently and meet growing electricity demands. H.R. 3668  should be an easy ``yes'' vote for Members on both sides of the aisle.
