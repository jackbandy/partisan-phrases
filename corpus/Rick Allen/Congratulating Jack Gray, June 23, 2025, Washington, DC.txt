Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my constituent,  Jack Gray, upon his acceptance to the United States Merchant Marine  Academy.

As a future midshipman, he will be joining the ranks of the world's  most elite naval force, guided by the motto: ``Acta Non Verba''

The service and sacrifice of America's military personnel have  safeguarded our Nation since its inception, defending our way of life  from Lexington to Normandy.

A vital part of our Nation's maritime operations, the Merchant  Marines' duties are dynamic, transporting cargo and passengers during  peacetime and serving as an auxiliary to the United States Navy during  times of war.

I was glad to sponsor Jack's nomination, as his dynamism reflects the  mission of the branch which he will soon serve. I am confident that his  talents will distinguish him among his peers during his time at the  Academy and thereafter.

I congratulate Jack. I know that he will make this Nation proud.
