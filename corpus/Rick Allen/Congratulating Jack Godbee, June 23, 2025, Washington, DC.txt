Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my constituent,  Jack Godbee, upon his acceptance to the United States Naval Academy.

As a future midshipman, he will be joining the ranks of the world's  most elite naval force, guided by the motto: ``Semper Fortis''

The service and sacrifice of America's military personnel have  safeguarded our Nation since its inception, defending our way of life  from Lexington to Normandy.

And throughout our history, American servicemembers have demonstrated  tremendous courage and strength, beating back tyranny to the ends of  the earth.

I was glad to sponsor Jack's nomination, and I am confident that his  talents will distinguish him among his peers during his time at the  Academy and thereafter.

I congratulate Jack. I know that he will make this Nation proud.
