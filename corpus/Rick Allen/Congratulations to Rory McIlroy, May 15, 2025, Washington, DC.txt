Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to offer my sincerest  congratulations to the 2025 Masters champion, Rory McIlroy.

Since 1934, amidst blooming azaleas, towering pines, and flowering  dogwoods, the first full week of April brings the world's greatest  golfers to my hometown of Augusta, Georgia, to experience sport's most  unique and rewarding challenge: the Masters golf tournament, the first  major of the year.

As golf fans know, the iconic green jacket never comes easily, but  for Rory McIlroy, his years-long quest for glory at Augusta was far  more than just a victory. In clinching the green jacket, Rory snapped  an 11-year major championship drought and completed the long-awaited  career grand slam, joining just five other prestigious players in doing  so. Augusta made history as one of the greatest moments in golf.

Mr. Speaker, Rory made a comment at the trophy presentation that I  think exemplifies this country. He said to his daughter, Poppy, ``Never  give up on your dreams. Keep coming back, keep working hard. If you put  your mind to it, you can do anything.'' What an example to the next  generation of athletes, leaders, and to the American people.

Congratulations, Rory. It is championship week again in the world of  golf, and we are pulling for him to achieve the season's grand slam  now.
