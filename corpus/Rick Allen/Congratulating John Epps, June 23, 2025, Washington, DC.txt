Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my constituent,  John Epps, upon his acceptance to the United States Air Force Academy.

As a future cadet, he will be joining the ranks of the world's most  fearsome fighting force, the United States Air Force.

Guided by the motto ``Aim High. . . . Fly-Fight-Win'' the U.S. Air  Force is the world's preeminent force in air, space, and cyberspace.

Throughout our history, American Airmen have demonstrated tremendous  courage and strength, beating back tyranny to the ends of the earth.

I was honored to sponsor John's nomination, and I am confident that  his talents will distinguish him among his peers both during his time  at Air Force Academy and thereafter.

I congratulate John. I know that he will make this Nation proud.
