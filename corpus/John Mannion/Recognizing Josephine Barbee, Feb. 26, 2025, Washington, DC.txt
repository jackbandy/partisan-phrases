Mr. MANNION. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Josephine Barbee,  mother of UAW International Representative Mark Barbee, who resides in  my district in Syracuse, NY.

Born on July 23, 1939, Josephine Barbee was a devoted mother and a  true pioneer in early childhood education and community service. Along  with her brother, Dr. Bishop Leonard R. Williams--pastor of Zion  Holiness Church and Bishop of the Great Lakes District--she played a  critical role in designing,  producing, and implementing vital community programs across Newark, New  Jersey.

Her work included the creation of summer programs, lunch initiatives,  and a food bank that have helped meet the needs of families and  children in underserved communities, ensuring they had access to  essential resources during difficult times.

Josephine Barbee also founded the M.E. Stith Daycare Center at Zion  Holiness Church, named in honor of her aunt. This daycare center became  a cornerstone of early childhood development in Newark, serving as a  nurturing and educational environment for generations of young  children.

Her commitment to increasing community access to vital services  continued throughout her career with the Essex County Division of  Welfare, where she worked to improve socio-economic conditions in the  community. Even after her official retirement in 1985 she continued to  support youth programs that still serve the greater Newark community  today.

While Josephine Barbee passed away on February 1, 2025, her legacy is  carried on by her son, Mark Barbee, who shares his mother's commitment  to serving others, ensuring that her profound impact remains alive and  well in the lives of those she touched. We are fortunate that Mark  continues to carry the torch she lit in my hometown of Syracuse, NY.
