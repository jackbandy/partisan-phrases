Protect America's Workforce Act

Mr. MANNION. Mr. Speaker, as our government employees had their  rights violated and were treated poorly, spending is up.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Protect America's Workforce  Act. I am a proud cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation to restore  collective bargaining rights to hundreds of thousands of Federal  workers.

I was raised in Syracuse, New York, in a union household. My mother  was a proud CWA member at New York Telephone, and my father a proud  union member at New York Central Railroad. I also served as the  president of a 400 member teachers' association union representing  teachers, nurses, school psychologists, and social workers.

Those who have a union worker in their family understand the  guarantee that comes with the union card: fair pay, solid benefits, a  secure retirement, and a real path to the middle class.

The indiscriminate stripping of collective bargaining rights through  executive action was an illegal gray area if not outright unlawful.

This legislation ends that ambiguity. It should never have been a  partisan issue.

Mr. MANNION. I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for working together toward this meaningful solution. My father  always said that a job is more than a paycheck. It is about dignity.  All work is dignified when providing for your family.

Mr. Speaker, the Protect America's Workforce Act lives up to those  ideals. Behind every family's American Dream is a good job and often a  good union job.
