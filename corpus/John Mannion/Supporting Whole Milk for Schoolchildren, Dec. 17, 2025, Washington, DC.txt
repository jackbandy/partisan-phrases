Supporting Whole Milk for Schoolchildren

Mr. MANNION. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation that  promotes the health and well-being of America's schoolchildren, while  strengthening American agriculture, including the world-class dairy  products and family farms across Central New York and the Mohawk  Valley. That legislation, Mr. Speaker, is the Whole Milk for Healthy  Kids Act.

Earlier this week, the House passed this bill with overwhelming  bipartisan support, a clear sign that commonsense policy can still  bring Democrats and Republicans together.

This bipartisan bill that I proudly cosponsored does something simple  and practical. It gives schools the flexibility to serve nutritious  milk options, while supporting local dairy farmers.

Since whole milk was removed from school cafeterias, milk consumption  has dropped sharply. Kids aren't meeting recommended daily intake, and  that matters for their health and their focus. Speaking as a former  teacher for nearly three decades, it matters for their academic  success.

Mr. Speaker, notably, this bill doesn't mandate changes. It simply  restores choice. Kids can't learn on empty stomachs. This is the right  policy for our schools, for our farmers, and for our country. I thank  my colleagues for supporting it.
