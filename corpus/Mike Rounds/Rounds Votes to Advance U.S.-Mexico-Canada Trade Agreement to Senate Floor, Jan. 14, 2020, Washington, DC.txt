Rounds Votes to Advance U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement to Senate Floor


U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, today voted to advance the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement to the Senate floor. The USMCA will replace the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.

 

"I voted in our EPW Committee to bring the USMCA to the Senate floor for a vote, so we can get this important trade agreement enacted quickly," said Rounds. "For too long, South Dakota producers have been at the tip of the spear in trade negotiations. The USMCA will give our producers and manufacturers greater opportunities to sell their products in Mexico and Canada, two of our closest allies and top trading partners. Ratifying USMCA will also provide us with some leverage as we seek to finish trade deals with other countries around the world. I look forward to bringing the USMCA to the Senate floor for a vote as soon as possible."

 

The EPW Committee is one of seven Senate committees responsible for reviewing the USMCA before sending it to the full Senate floor.
