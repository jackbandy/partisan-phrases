Lennox High School Student Receives Fully Qualified Offer of Appointment to U.S. Naval Academy


U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) today announced that Madeline Loewe, a student at Lennox High School, has received a fully qualified offer of appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA). Madeline is the daughter of Matthew and Paula Loewe of Lennox, SD.

 

"Congratulations to Madeline on receiving an offer of appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy," said Rounds. "Madeline's application to my office really stood out, and I was proud to nominate her as my principal nominee to the Naval Academy. She had previously attended the USNA Summer STEM camp and the Naval Academy Summer Seminar, where she made the decision that USNA is where she wanted to go after high school graduation. She has worked hard to meet the strict requirements our nation's service academies expect from prospective students--she holds leadership positions in FFA, 4-H and her school newspaper, all while taking AP courses, running cross country, playing in her high school band and jazz band and volunteering in her community. We wish Madeline all the best at the Naval Academy!"

 

"Attending the Naval Academy has been a goal of mine since I was in eighth grade, and I feel honored and privileged to have received my appointment," said Loewe. "This opportunity to experience a world-class education and serve my country is second to none. I am incredibly excited to begin my future on this path."

 

Each year, Sen. Rounds is able to nominate a select group of eligible students from South Dakota to attend our nation's four service academies: The U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, U.S. Military Academy at West Point and the U.S. Naval Academy.
