Sioux Falls Student Receives Offer of Appointment to U.S. Air Force Academy


U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) today announced that O'Gorman High School student Zachary Curd has received a fully qualified offer of appointment to the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA). Curd is the son of Dr. Blake and Debbie Curd of Sioux Falls, SD. He was nominated to the Air Force Academy by Rounds.

"Congratulations to Zach on receiving an offer of appointment to the Air Force Academy," said Rounds. "Zach has a love of flying that will serve him well at the Air Force Academy. He's a Civil Air Patrol Cadet and already has his private pilot's license. Both of his parents are veterans of the Air Force, and Zach has a desire to continue his family's tradition of service to our country. I wish him all the best."

"I am equally humbled and honored to have received an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy," said Curd. "I believe with such a great opportunity comes an even greater responsibility. I am eternally thankful to my family, to Senator Rounds, and to the United States of America for placing said responsibility in my hands. I look forward to joining The Long Blue Line and to serving this great nation."

Each year, Sen. Rounds is able to nominate a select group of eligible students from South Dakota to attend our nation's four service academies: The U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, U.S. Military Academy at West Point and the U.S. Naval Academy.
