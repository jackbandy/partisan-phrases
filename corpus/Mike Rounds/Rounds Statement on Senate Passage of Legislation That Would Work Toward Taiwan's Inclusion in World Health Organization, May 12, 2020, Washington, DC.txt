Rounds Statement on Senate Passage of Legislation That Would Work Toward Taiwan's Inclusion in World Health Organization


U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) issued the following statement after the Senate passed S. 249, legislation he cosponsored that calls for the Secretary of State to develop a strategy for Taiwan to regain observer status in the World Health Organization:

"With each passing day, we learn more about China's failure to alert the world to the seriousness of COVID-19. Meanwhile, Taiwan has been a reliable partner in the global fight against the pandemic. I'm pleased the Senate passed our legislation to allow Taiwan to regain its observer status with the World Health Organization."
