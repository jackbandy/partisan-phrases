Rounds Supports COVID-19 Legislation that Provides Immediate Relief for South Dakota Families


U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) today issued the following statement after voting in favor of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Included in this legislation are provisions which provide tax credits for paid sick, family and medical leave as well as provisions that address insurance for individuals unemployed as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

"This bill, which was negotiated between House Democrats and the Trump administration, is far from perfect. However, as we seek to address our country's urgent needs in the wake of COVID-19's spread, I believe it does more good than bad. Most importantly, it will deliver immediate relief to South Dakota families and workers and provide free COVID-19 testing kits that will help us track and stop its spread.

"While the COVID-19 crisis is unlike any other we've seen in modern times, American resilience remains strong. We settled the West, put a man on the moon and won two World Wars. There's no challenge we can't overcome when we put our minds to it.   

"We continue to work on additional measures to address the effects of COVID-19, including legislation to provide economic relief.  Every family and business, both ag and non-ag, has been impacted by the spread of COVID-19. We must continue to work together, in a bipartisan manner, to find timely, targeted solutions that keep South Dakotans healthy and help struggling businesses across the state."
