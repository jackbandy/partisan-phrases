Delegation Applauds SBA Approval of Economic Injury Disaster Loan Funding for South Dakota


U.S. Representative Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) and U.S. Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) today applauded the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) for granting South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem's request to activate the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Earlier this week in response to the governor's request, the delegation sent a letter urging SBA to activate the EIDL program for South Dakota's small businesses.

"During uncertain times, South Dakota's small businesses need all options on the table," said Johnson. "I'm grateful the SBA prioritized Governor Noem's request to expedite this emergency funding. South Dakota's state and federal delegation will continue to work together to curb the impact on our communities."

"Many small businesses in our state, who only a few weeks ago were having one of their best years ever, are now struggling to keep their doors open because of this pandemic." said Thune. "I'm glad SBA granted Governor Noem's request to activate the EIDL program so that these businesses--the heartbeat of many communities in our state -- can make it through this and get back on their feet once this storm has been weathered."

"Like all sectors of our economy right now, South Dakota's small businesses are in dire need of assistance as they deal with the impact of COVID-19," said Rounds. "I'm glad to see the Small Business Administration approve South Dakota's request to activate the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program. This will help provide immediate relief and keep our businesses afloat during this difficult time."
