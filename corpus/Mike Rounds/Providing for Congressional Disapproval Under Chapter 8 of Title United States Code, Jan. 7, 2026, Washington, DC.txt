Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 86. This  resolution would repeal the Environmental Protection Agency's approval  of South Dakota's Regional Haze Implementation Plan.

South Dakota has made substantial progress toward meeting EPA's  ambitious 2064 visibility goals and has determined that no additional  emissions goals are needed to make reasonable progress.

Overturning EPA's approval would force the State to adopt unnecessary  pollution control measures, despite clear evidence that they would not  meaningfully improve visibility. These requirements would impose  significant costs on South Dakota communities and businesses for little  to no environmental benefit, essentially burning money without  improving outcomes.

This CRA ignores the fact that South Dakota's emission sources have a  minimal impact on visibility in nearby class I areas. In recent years,  the primary driver of visibility impairment has been wildfire smoke  from Canada and the western United States, not in-State emissions. This  resolution substitutes Washington mandates for State-level expertise,  dictating decisions on a State the sponsors do not represent and  unnecessarily constraining South Dakota's economy.

For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against this  resolution.                                Vote on Motion

Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that the previously  scheduled rollcall vote occur immediately.
