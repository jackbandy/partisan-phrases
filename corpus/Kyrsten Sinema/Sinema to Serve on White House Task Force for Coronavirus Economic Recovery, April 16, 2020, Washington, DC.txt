Sinema to Serve on White House Task Force for Coronavirus Economic Recovery


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema will serve on the White House task force focused on economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The task force is comprised of a bipartisan group of Senators and members of the House of Representatives, and will provide counsel to the administration on the re-opening of American businesses and employers. "I will work with anyone to support Arizona's state and local leaders, ensure our communities adhere to scientific best practices to address our current health emergency, and provide employers the resources to quickly recover and get Americans back to work once the immediate crisis has passed," said Sinema.

Sinema's highest priority is keeping Arizonans healthy, safe, and economically secure. Throughout the coronavirus outbreak, Sinema has worked across the aisle and with local communities to ensure Arizonans have up-to-date, accurate information.  Sinema has been holding regular calls with Arizona mayors and county leaders, non-profit leaders, small business owners, and first responders about the coronavirus. Sinema helped secure a number of priorities in the sweeping coronavirus-response CARES Act law, including a $150 billion relief fund for state, local, and Tribal governments, $55 billion more in investments in hospitals and health care workers, and an increase in unemployment benefits. Sinema also led the Arizona Congressional delegation in urging the President to grant a Major Disaster Declaration for Arizona, allowing Arizona to access more public safety resources to combat the coronavirus outbreak.
