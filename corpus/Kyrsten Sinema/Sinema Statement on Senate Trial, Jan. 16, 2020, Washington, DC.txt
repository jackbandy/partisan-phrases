Sinema Statement on Senate Trial


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema released the following statement ahead of the Senate trial:

"Today, my Senate colleagues and I will swear to "do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws.' The Senate has a job to do that demands our serious, careful consideration of the facts--free from partisanship or political soundbites. Arizonans deserve no less. I will treat this process with the gravity and impartiality that our oaths demand and will not comment on the proceedings or facts until the trial concludes." Article I, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states: The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. The text of the Senators' oath is stated in Rule XXV of the Senate Rules in Impeachment Trials: "I solemnly swear (or affirm) that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of ____, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: so help me God."
