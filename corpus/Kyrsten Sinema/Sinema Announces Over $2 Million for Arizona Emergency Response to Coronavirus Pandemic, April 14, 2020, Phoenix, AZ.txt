Sinema Announces Over $2 Million for Arizona Emergency Response to Coronavirus Pandemic


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema announced that Arizona is receiving an additional $2.06 million in federal emergency management funding to help combat the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). "Today's funding will strengthen Arizona's coronavirus response to help us fight the outbreak and save lives," said Sinema. The additional $2.06 million announced today stems from a provision of the CARES Act to provide $100 million for Emergency Management Performance coronavirus supplemental grants for all fifty states. Sinema--a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)--recently led the Arizona delegation's request for a Major Disaster Declaration, which allows Arizona to receive the needed response resources to reduce the risk of overwhelming the state's hospitals and health care industry. Sinema helped secure a number of priorities in the sweeping coronavirus-response CARES Act law, including a $150 billion relief fund for state, local, and Tribal governments, $55 billion more in investments in hospitals and health care workers, and an increase in unemployment benefits. Sinema recently wrote a column in the Arizona Republic stressing what else must be included in the next Congressional coronavirus-relief bill.
