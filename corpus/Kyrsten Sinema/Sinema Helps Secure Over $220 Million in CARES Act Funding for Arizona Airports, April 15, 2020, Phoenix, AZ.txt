Sinema Helps Secure Over $220 Million in CARES Act Funding for Arizona Airports


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema helped secure over $220 million in federal funding for Arizona airports from the bipartisan CARES Act. This grant announcement follows Sinema's work to ensure massive investment in Arizona's airports--which have been particularly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic--among other top Arizona priorities. "Today's funding will save thousands of Arizona jobs, helping stabilize Arizona's economy while we fight the coronavirus pandemic," said Sinema. During CARES Act negotiations, Sinema helped ensure Arizona received its share of the federal government's coronavirus relief effort for Arizona employers and taxpayers. The Sinema-shaped CARES Act helped save hundreds of thousands of aviation industry jobs.  In addition to the near $225 million granted to Arizona airports, Sinema also helped secure a number of priorities in the sweeping coronavirus-response CARES Act, including a $150 billion relief fund for state, local, and Tribal governments, $55 billion more in investments in hospitals and health care workers, and an increase in unemployment benefits. Sinema recently wrote a column in the Arizona Republic stressing what else must be included in the next Congressional coronavirus-relief bill.
