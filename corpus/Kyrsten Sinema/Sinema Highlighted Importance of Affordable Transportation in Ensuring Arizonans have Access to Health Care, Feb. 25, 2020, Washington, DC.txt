Sinema Highlighted Importance of Affordable Transportation in Ensuring Arizonans have Access to Health Care


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema today in a Senate Banking Committee hearing highlighted the importance of public transportation in ensuring Arizonans have access to affordable health care. "Having a great doctor doesn't matter if you can't get to your appointment. Good public transit can make it easier for Arizonans of all ages and from all corners of our state to see a doctor and access essential health and wellness services," said Sinema. In today's Senate Banking Committee hearing, Sinema questioned transportation officials about how to strengthen and expand transit programs to help ensure all Arizonans have access to quality health care. Sinema also discussed the public-private partnerships that helped build the Tempe Streetcar in Arizona. Sinema asked officials how Congress can encourage similar public-private partnerships to support infrastructure growth.
