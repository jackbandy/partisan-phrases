Sinema Ranked Most Bipartisan Senate Democrat


The independent Lugar Center and Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy named Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema the most bipartisan Senate Democrat and the fifth most bipartisan Senator during the first session of the 116th Congress in the new Bipartisan Index. "Working across the aisle is how I get things done for Arizona. As our state battles the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, I remain committed to working with anyone to ensure the health of all Arizonans, safely re-open our economy, and get Arizonans back to work," said Sinema. Sinema is the only Democrat in the top 10 of most bipartisan Senators in today's rankings. Sinema also ranked as one of the most bipartisan U.S. House members during the 115th and 114th Congress by the Lugar Center's Bipartisan Index.  The Bipartisan index is a non-partisan tool that measures the degree to which U.S. Senators and U.S. Representatives work across party lines every Congress. The Lugar Center is a non-profit organization that is named for and started by former Republican U.S. Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana.
