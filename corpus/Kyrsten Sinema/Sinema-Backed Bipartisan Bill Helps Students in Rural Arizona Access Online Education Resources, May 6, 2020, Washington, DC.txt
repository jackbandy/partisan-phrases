Sinema-Backed Bipartisan Bill Helps Students in Rural Arizona Access Online Education Resources


Arizona senior Senator Krysten Sinema cosponsored the bipartisan Keeping Critical Connections Act--legislation that helps small broadband companies provide critical connectivity for students and families to continue their education during the coronavirus pandemic. "Expanding broadband for rural communities ensures every Arizona student gets equal access to their education during the coronavirus pandemic," said Sinema. The Keeping Critical Connections Act appropriates $2 billion for a "Keeping Critical Connections" fund at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), allowing small broadband providers--those with fewer than 250,000 customers--to be compensated for providing free or discounted broadband services during the pandemic for low-income families and students. The Sinema-backed bipartisan legislation would help provide critical broadband services to rural communities during the COVID-19 national emergency. According to the FCC, over 20 million Americans lack access to quality internet at home, including as many as 12 million children. This includes tribal communities, where 36% of households lack access to broadband.  Internet access is a necessity during this crisis, and the Sinema-backed bipartisan bill ensures that Arizonans in rural areas have equal access to education and communication networks throughout this national emergency.
