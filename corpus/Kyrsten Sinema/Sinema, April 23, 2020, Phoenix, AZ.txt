Sinema, Southern Arizona Leadership Council Discuss Coronavirus Relief and Health of Arizona's Economy


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema held a call with Southern Arizona business leaders with the Southern Arizona Leadership Council to discuss her efforts to keep Arizonans safe and protect Arizona's economy.  "I'm continuing to hear directly from Arizona's local leaders to help shape federal coronavirus response efforts, keep Arizonans safe, and save Arizona jobs," said Sinema. Sinema has been holding regular calls with Arizona mayors and county officials, non-profit leaders, small business owners, and first responders about the coronavirus and related relief efforts. Last week, Sinema announced she will serve on the White House task force focused on economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The task force is comprised of a bipartisan group of Senators and members of the House of Representatives, and will provide counsel to the administration on the re-opening of American businesses and employers. In the recent Senate-passed coronavirus package, Sinema helped secure $310 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, $60 billion for smaller, disadvantaged businesses, $60 billion for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and grants, $75 billion for health care providers, and $25 billion for testing, including $11 billion directly to states. Sinema also helped secure a number of priorities in the sweeping coronavirus-response CARES Act law, including a $150 billion relief fund for state, local, and Tribal governments, $55 billion more in investments in hospitals and health care workers, and an increase in unemployment benefits. Sinema also recently wrote an op-ed outlining Arizona needs she is working to include in the next coronavirus-response legislation.
