Senate Committee Passes Sinema-Backed Bill Establishing Arizona Cybersecurity Coordinator


The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee passed the Cybersecurity State Coordinator Act--a bipartisan bill supported by Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema that establishes a cybersecurity state coordinator in Arizona to prepare, manage, and respond to cybersecurity threats. "Arizona leads the way in innovation and we must prepare for risks from technology developments. Establishing a state cybersecurity coordinator will keep Arizonans safe from cyber-attacks and ensure our economy can continue to thrive," said Sinema, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The Sinema-backed Cybersecurity State Coordinator Act requires the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to fund and establish State Cybersecurity Coordinators to increase awareness, prepare for, and respond to cyber incidents. The Department of Homeland Security supports Sinema's Cybersecurity State Coordinator Act and the city of Phoenix has underscored the need for a cybersecurity state coordinator in Arizona.
