Letter to Hon. Charles Schumer, Senate Minority Leader and Hon. Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader - Sinema Advocates for Increased Coronavirus Resources for Tribal Water and Sanitation Projects


Dear Leaders Schumer and McConnell:

Native American tribes in Arizona and throughout the country urgently need improved access to drinking water and sanitation facilities. An estimated 130,000 homes on tribal reservations lack access to running water and adequate sanitation. This deficiency makes tribal residents more susceptible to COVID-19 and other illnesses due to their inability to take basic preventative measures like handwashing. Tribal communities will continue to be disproportionately affected by illnesses like COVID-19 if drinking water and sanitation deficiencies are not addressed.

Challenges faced by the Navajo Nation demonstrate and highlight my concerns regarding tribal drinking water and sanitation deficiencies. The Navajo Nation, where 30 percent of the reservation population lacks access to running water, has one of the highest rates of COVID-19 infections per capita when compared to states throughout the country. It is unacceptable that tribal communities face increased risks related to COVID-19 and other illnesses because of their inability to access running water and adequate sanitation.

As the Senate considers additional legislation to address COVID-19, I urge you to support funding for drinking water and sanitation projects for tribal communities. Specifically, I urge you to consider providing an additional $985 million in funding for the Indian Health Service's Sanitation Facilities Construction Program to address drinking water and sanitation deficiencies on tribal reservations.

Thank you for considering this request and your leadership in these difficult times. I look forward to working with you to protect the health and safety of all Americans.
