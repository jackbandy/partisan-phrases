Sinema Tours Flagstaff Medical Center, Highlights Work Making Health Care More Affordable


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema visited the Flagstaff Medical Center to hear directly from the organization's leaders and medical personnel and discuss her work making health care more affordable and accessible for Arizonans. "I'm proud to partner with the dedicated team at Flagstaff Medical Center to make health care more affordable and accessible for Arizona," said Sinema. Sinema highlighted her proposal that successfully repealed the misguided and unnecessary Health Insurance, Medical Device, and Cadillac Taxes. These taxes raised health care costs and placed a burden on Arizona families, small business owners, and seniors. Sinema is taking that same approach to slow the rise of health care premiums, make prescription drugs more affordable, and close the health care provider shortage across Arizona, especially in rural and tribal communities.
