Sinema Statement on the Passage of the U.S-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema released the following statement on the passage of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement: "Cross-border trade means more Arizona jobs, a stronger economy, and greater opportunity for Arizona families. I'm proud to have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, and I am glad the Senate approved this critical agreement with bipartisan support." "The Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry applauds the U.S. Senate and Sen. Sinema for today's bipartisan vote to adopt the USMCA. No state is better positioned for growth under USMCA than Arizona, which already can attribute 228,000 jobs to trade with Canada and Mexico. Arizona's job creators thank Sen. Sinema for her ongoing work to strengthen Arizona and the country's relationship with these two friends, allies, and trade partners. Her vote to support USMCA, as well as her recent successful effort to reauthorize for seven years the Ex-Im Bank, is deeply appreciated by the many Arizona businesses whose continued success depends on their ability to reach customers and supply chains beyond our borders," said Glenn Hamer, president and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement is an agreement to modernize the 25-year-old NAFTA by the governments of the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Sinema worked with stakeholders in Arizona and colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance the trade agreement. Sinema also supported the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement in the Senate Commerce Committee.
