Sinema-Backed Bill Signed into Law Protects Seniors from Illegal Robocalls


The bipartisan TRACED Act, legislation backed by Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema that cracks down on illegal robocalls and holds perpetrators accountable, was signed into law. "Our bipartisan law protects all Arizonans, especially seniors, from scams and harassment by ensuring robocallers are held accountable," said Sinema, a member of the Senate Commerce and Aging Committees. As one report estimated, 42 percent of all calls will be spam calls by early 2019, a 12 percent increase from last year. The TRACED Act gives regulators more time to find scammers, increases penalties for those who are caught, promotes adoption of call authentication and blocking technology, and brings relevant federal agencies and state attorneys general together to address impediments to criminal prosecution of robocallers who intentionally flout laws.
