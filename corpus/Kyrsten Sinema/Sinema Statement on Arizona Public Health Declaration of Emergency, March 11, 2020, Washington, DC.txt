Sinema Statement on Arizona Public Health Declaration of Emergency


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema released the following statement on Arizona's public health Declaration of Emergency: "Today's declaration is a procedural tool allowing our state to access more public safety resources; Arizonans should not be alarmed and rather should continue using best practices for personal health. I will continue working across the aisle and with local communities to ensure Arizonans have up-to-date, accurate information." Today, Sinema released a video for Arizonans about coronavirus resources they can trust. Sinema has also added a resources page to her website, www.sinema.senate.gov, for Arizonans looking for the latest information on coronavirus.
