Following Sinema's Urging, New National Housing Assistance Website Launched to Help Arizona Renters, Homeowners


Following calls from Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) partnered together to launch a new website to help Arizona renters and homeowners learn more about all the resources and assistance available to them during the coronavirus pandemic. The website details new housing-related policies, benefits, and protections established under the CARES Act.  "The launch of a housing assistance website will help Arizonans access critical housing resources and relief options available during the coronavirus," said Sinema.  In April, Sinema joined a group of her Senate colleagues and called for a single website to help Arizona renters and homeowners find relief and resources. Previously, each federal agency maintained their own individual resource websites, forcing people to navigate multiple pages to find information about the protections and benefits they need. This new website consolidates information about CARES Act programs, including mortgage relief, protections for renters, resources for additional help, and information on how to avoid coronavirus-related scams. It also provides search tools for homeowners to help determine if their mortgage is federally backed, and for renters to find out if their rental unit is federally financed.  The website will be continuously updated to reflect the most recent information and to help answer frequently asked questions.
