Sinema Backs Bipartisan Bill Supporting Arizona Caregivers


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema cosponsored the bipartisan Credit for Caring Act--legislation that provides a tax credit to Arizona caregivers, covering the costs associated with caregiving. "Caregiving is a full time job, and we must support Arizona families looking after their loved ones," said Sinema. The bipartisan Credit for Caring Act allows any caregiver for an individual who has certified physical or cognitive needs to receive a tax credit of up to $3,000 to cover 30% of all caregiving expenses. Arizona has an increasing aging population, with the number of unpaid caregivers expected to grow. AARP estimates more than 800,000 caregivers in Arizona, and that family caregivers spend on average 20% of their income on caring for a dependent adult.
