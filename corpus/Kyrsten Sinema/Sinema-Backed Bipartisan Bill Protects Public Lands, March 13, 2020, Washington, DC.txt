Sinema-Backed Bipartisan Bill Protects Public Lands, Addresses Federal Agency Backlogs


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema cosponsored the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act--landmark legislation providing permanent and full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and addressing the maintenance backlog in Arizona's national parks and other land management agencies. The Sinema-backed Great American Outdoors Act addresses over $507 million in deferred maintenance needs in Arizona and provides full, permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Arizona has received $250 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to protect lands like the Grand Canyon and Saguaro National Park and ensure recreation access for hunting, fishing, and other outdoor activities. "Protecting Arizona's public lands strengthens our outdoor recreation industry, boosting opportunities for Arizona businesses and creating good-paying jobs," said Sinema.   The American Outdoors Act combines the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act, which provides mandatory funding for the National Park Service to address the deferred maintenance backlog, and the bipartisan Land and Water Conservation Fund Permanent Funding Act, which provides permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Sinema is a cosponsor of both the Restore Our Parks Act and the Land and Water Conservation Fund Permanent Funding Act.
