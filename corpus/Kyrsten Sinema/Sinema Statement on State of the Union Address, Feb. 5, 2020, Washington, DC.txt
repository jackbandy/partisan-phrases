Sinema Statement on State of the Union Address


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema released the following statement on the State of the Union address: "There is much more that binds Americans, and Arizonans, together than what pulls us apart. Focusing on our common values instead of our differences is how Senator Cassidy and I introduced the first-of-its-kind bipartisan parental leave bill, and I welcome the president's support of this critical legislation. We must continue coming together and work to expand job opportunities, keep our communities safe, ensure veterans get the care they've earned, and make health care more affordable for everyone. As always, I'll work with anyone to get things done and deliver for everyday Arizona families."
