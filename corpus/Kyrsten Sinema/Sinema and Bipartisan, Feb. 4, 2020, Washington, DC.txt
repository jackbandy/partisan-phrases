Sinema and Bipartisan, Bicameral Group of Lawmakers Launch 'Personalized Medicine Caucus'


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema launched the bipartisan, bicameral Personalized Medicine Caucus to raise awareness of the benefits of targeted, personalized health care for patients. Sinema chairs the Caucus with Republican Senator Tim Scott (S.C.), Republican Congressman Tom Emmer (MN), and Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell (CA). "Raising awareness of the benefits of personalized medicine helps detect and prevent diseases, while making health care more affordable and accessible for Arizona families," said Sinema, co-chair of the Bipartisan Personalized Medicine Caucus. Personalized medicine is an innovative new field where physicians use diagnostic tests to identify specific biological markers to determine the most effective treatments, representing a shift away from a one-size-fits-all approach to health care. Focusing on prevention efforts will make health care more affordable for all Arizonans. The Personalized Medicine Caucus is the first dedicated caucus focused on raising awareness amongst policymakers, shaping legislation, and organizing briefings where researchers, the FDA, and innovators can present to Congressional staffers about the benefits of personalized medicine.
