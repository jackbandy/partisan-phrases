Sinema Hosts Call with Inter-Tribal Council of Arizona to Discuss Impact of the Coronavirus Outbreak in Tribal Communities


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema hosted a call with Tribal leaders from the Inter-Tribal Council of Arizona to discuss the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in tribal communities and the need for the federal government to work with Tribes to help stop the spread of COVID-19. "Tribal communities across Arizona are experiencing dangerous outbreaks of the coronavirus pandemic. Federal leaders must work with Tribes to ensure they have the health resources and economic support needed to fight the coronavirus outbreak consistent with the federal government's trust and responsibilities and respect for Tribal sovereignty," said Sinema. Sinema, along with a bipartisan and bicameral group of lawmakers, urged the administration to swiftly implement the bipartisan CARES Act law and ensure resources are deployed quickly to support tribal communities in Arizona. Sinema also asked the administration to make a stronger effort in consulting with Tribal Nations in order to truly reduce the spread of coronavirus throughout Arizona. The U.S. Senate unanimously approved the Sinema-shaped legislative package that included robust support of $10 billion in Tribal government services and programs, including $2 billion for the Indian Health Services, to ensure Native communities across Arizona get the health care and resources they need. Sinema has a resources page on her website, www.sinema.senate.gov/corona, for Arizonans looking for updated information in English and Spanish on the coronavirus. The U.S. Department of Treasury and Indian Affairs are seeking input from Tribes on developing how the Coronavirus Relief Fund will be allocated to tribal governments.
