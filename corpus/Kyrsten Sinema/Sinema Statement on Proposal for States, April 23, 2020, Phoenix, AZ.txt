Sinema Statement on Proposal for States, Local Governments to Declare Bankruptcy


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema released the following statement on a proposal for states and local governments to declare bankruptcy: "Partisan politics in Washington shouldn't put responsible states like Arizona - or our cities, towns, or counties that operate on shoestring budgets - at risk of bankruptcy. Declaring bankruptcy would mean cuts to firefighters, police, health services, and job and business opportunities. We have bipartisan support in the Senate for revenue-replacement to keep our states, counties, and cities strong and thriving."
