Sinema Meets with Salt River Project Leaders to Discuss Arizona's Energy and Water Future


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema met with Salt River Project leaders to discuss boosting Arizona's energy opportunities and securing Arizona's water future. "Securing our water and energy future fuels jobs, expands opportunity for Arizonans, and boosts our state's economic strength," said Sinema. Sinema, who supports bringing clean energy and jobs to Arizona, recently introduced the Solar Energy Research and Development Act--legislation that helps Arizona's government, universities, and companies develop solar technology. Sinema is also a cosponsor of the bipartisan Renewable Energy Extension Act, which saves Arizona homeowners money and fuels jobs in the state's fast-growing solar industry. During her time in the U.S. Senate, Sinema has worked to advance commonsense solutions to secure Arizona's water future. Last year, Sinema introduced the DRIP Act, which equips communities in Arizona, and across the country, to address drought conditions and strengthen water supplies. Additionally, Sinema helped get the Drought Contingency Plan across the finish line in the Senate. Sinema also cosponsored the bipartisan Drought Resiliency and Water Supply Infrastructure Act, which allows Arizona cities, tribes, and water providers access to critical funding to secure the state's water future.
