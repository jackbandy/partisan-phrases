Sinema Statement on Coronavirus Data


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema released the following statement: "The Governor's choice to disregard the science that should be the basis of Arizona public health policies - and the White House's guidelines for re-opening - is concerning and disappointing. I'm grateful that Arizona State University and the University of Arizona will continue this work, and I plan to rely on their findings and conclusions in my work to keep Arizonans healthy, safe, and economically secure."
