Sinema Meets with Mohave Health Coalition to Address Rural Health Challenges


Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema met with the Mohave Health Coalition to address health challenges in northern Arizona, including the area's provider shortage. "We're partnering with the Mohave Health Coalition to make health care more affordable and ensure every Arizonan has access to affordable healthcare," said Sinema. Sinema's roundtable focused on identifying solutions to health care concerns and challenges in rural Arizona. Mohave County is experiencing shortages in primary physicians, mental health providers, and nurses. According to data shared by the Mohave Health Coalition primary care physicians see an average of 2,111 patients per year, an increase of 5.87% from 2018. The current ratio of patients to mental health providers in Mohave County is 1,477 to 1. Sinema and the Mohave Health Coalition discussed potential solutions to improve community access to care by addressing concerns with Medicare/Medicaid payments and federal funding to rural communities. Addressing the provider shortage to make health care more affordable and accessible in Arizona is a primary goal for Sinema. Sinema is a cosponsor of the bipartisan Resident Physician Shortage Act, which increases the number of medical training positions in underserved communities.
