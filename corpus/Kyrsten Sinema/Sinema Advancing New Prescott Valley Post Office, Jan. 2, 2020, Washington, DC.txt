Sinema Advancing New Prescott Valley Post Office


The U.S. Postal Service followed the recommendation of Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema and announced they would study the need for a new Prescott Valley Post Office and how best to meet the postal needs of Prescott Valley residents. This follows Sinema's letter urging USPS take action to service the growing population in Prescott Valley. "Prescott Valley is rapidly growing and the community needs a Post Office that can properly serve the region. I'm glad the U.S. Postal Service agreed to my request and is developing a strategy that will protect and enhance postal services for Arizonans in Prescott Valley," said Sinema. Since 1985, when the Prescott Valley Post Office moved into its present location, Prescott Valley's population has grown from less than 6,000 to nearly 50,000. Prescott Valley's population growth has overwhelmed its current Post Office, and residents no longer have convenient access to postal services.
