Key Committee Approves Sinema-Backed Bill Helping Native American Veterans Access Earned Benefits


Bipartisan legislation cosponsored by Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema passed the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. The VA Tribal Advisory Committee Act improves services for Native American veterans and strengthens VA engagement with tribal communities. "Strengthening the voices of Native American veterans will improve communication between the VA and Tribal governments and ensure Native American veterans receive the benefits they've earned," said Sinema, a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. The VA Tribal Advisory Committee Act establishes a VA Advisory Committee on Tribal and Indian Affairs. The Committee will facilitate communication and understanding between the VA and Tribal governments to better address the challenges and support the needs of Native American veterans accessing VA services. The Committee will be comprised of a representative from each of the 12 regions of the Indian Health Service and three at-large Native American members. At least half of the Committee members must be veterans. The Committee will facilitate communication between the VA and Tribal governments, advise the VA Secretary and provide guidance on Tribal and Indian Affairs, and provide recommendations to Congress to improve Native American veterans' access to VA health care and benefits.
