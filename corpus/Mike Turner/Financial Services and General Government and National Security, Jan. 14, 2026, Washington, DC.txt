Financial Services and General Government and National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. TURNER of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this  appropriations bill, and I support that this bill invests in the  National Endowment for Democracy.

During my time in Congress, I have worked very closely with the  National Endowment for Democracy's executive director, Damon Wilson,  who is a great leader in democratic efforts throughout the world, and I  can attest to the important work done under his leadership.

The National Endowment for Democracy is a critical tool for ensuring  that prodemocracy movements have the resources they need to counter  authoritarianism and confront human rights abuses. Countries such as  Ukraine, Bosnia, and Georgia face constant pressure and interference  from Russia, and the National Endowment for Democracy is on the front  lines of efforts to ensure democracy and Western values prevail.

Additionally, the National Endowment for Democracy does important  work to counter hostile, authoritarian regimes like the Chinese  Communist Party and the Iranian regime. It is important for us to  support this American institution and organization, which is based here  in Washington, D.C., that defends our interests around the world in  some of the most challenging environments.

Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this American-first  legislation.
