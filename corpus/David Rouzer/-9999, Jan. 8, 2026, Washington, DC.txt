Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, boy, do I have many stories that I could tell, but I  will not. No one cared more for the people of California and for  America than Doug. As a fourth-generation rice farmer, he was the true  embodiment of the steward of the land and a great steward of common  sense, too, I might add.

He understood the needs of rural America and had such a genuine  desire to serve the people who lived there. Doug and I worked closely  on many issues, but one of my fondest memories was hosting him in North  Carolina for an agriculture roundtable. He engaged with my  constituents, speaking their language, and truly listening to their  concerns.

Doug LaMalfa stood tall, both literally and figuratively, for the  people who feed this country. To know Doug was an honor and a  privilege. His absence will have a profound void in this Chamber. This  body and the Nation will miss him deeply.

Mr. Speaker, my prayers are with his wife, Jill; his children; his  grandchildren; the entire LaMalfa family, including his great staff. I  thank them for sharing him with us in service to our country.
