Federal Recognition for Lumbee Tribe


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698409/federal-recognition-for-lumbee-tribe


Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, today marks a monumental day for the  Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, the effects of which will transcend  generations. The Lumbee have fought tirelessly for decades to achieve  full recognition by the U.S. Congress. Today, that day has arrived.

The Lumbee Fairness Act, which I offered as an amendment to the  National Defense Authorization Act, will soon head to the President's  desk, as part of the annual defense bill, for his signature, providing  full Federal recognition. This is a historic milestone, decades in the  making, and a moment of celebration for a community that has never  wavered in its resolve.

This amazing achievement would not have been possible without the  steadfast leadership of Chairman John Lowery and generations of Lumbee.  Their voice has been heard, and their commitment and perseverance have  brought us to this historic moment.

I commend and thank President Trump for his tremendous support, as  well as our current Senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, former Senators  Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr, and my many colleagues here in the  House who continually supported this effort.

Madam Speaker, I thank them all, for the Lumbee are a great and  honorable people who deserve Federal recognition with all the rights  and benefits that come with it.
