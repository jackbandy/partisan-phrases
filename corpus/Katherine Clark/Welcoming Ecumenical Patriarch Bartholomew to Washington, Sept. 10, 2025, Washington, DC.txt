Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to warmly  welcome the spiritual head of the Eastern Orthodox Church, His All- Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, to Washington, D.C.

The longest-serving Archbishop of Constantinople in the history of  Christianity, the Ecumenical Patriarch will arrive in the United States  this month to receive the distinguished Templeton Prize. This  prestigious award will be presented in recognition of his ``pioneering  efforts to bridge scientific and spiritual understandings of humanity's  relationship with the natural world, bringing together people of  different faiths to heed a call for stewardship of creation.''

Guiding the world's 300 million Eastern Orthodox Christians since his  election in 1991, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has been a powerful  voice for our common responsibilities to one another--our shared  obligation to defend the freedom, dignity, and wellbeing of our  neighbors and of future generations.

I am especially grateful for the impact his leadership has had on  Orthodox Christians across the United States, particularly the more  than 600 families at St. Demetrios Church in Weston, Massachusetts. For  decades, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has had the deepest respect  of the American people and of this institution--an abiding admiration  reflected in Congress' decision to award him the Congressional Gold  Medal in 1997.

Today, the Ecumenical Patriarch continues to bring together people of  all faiths in the pursuit of peace, mutual respect, and a future more  worthy of our children. I join my colleagues in commending his  invaluable work, and I proudly join my Orthodox constituents in  welcoming him back to the United States.
