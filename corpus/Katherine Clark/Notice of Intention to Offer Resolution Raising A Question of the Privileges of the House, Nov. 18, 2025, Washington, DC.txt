Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.

Mr. Speaker, today, we have finally taken a vote that recognizes the  need for the survivors and victims of Jeffrey Epstein to have justice  and transparency. Not minutes later, the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Norman) is filing yet another partisan resolution.

I ask all of my colleagues to support this motion to refer this to  the Ethics Committee.

The previous question was ordered.

Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
