Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families

Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I recently heard from a mom  in Massachusetts. I will call her Rachel.

Rachel's son was born 3 months early and then spent 2 years in the  hospital. He is finally home, but he needs a ventilator and a feeding  tube. Still, his mom says he is the happiest little 3-year-old in town.

They have been through a lot, but they are able to get by--unless  this Republican budget becomes law.

Medicaid pays for the daily care this little boy needs to survive.  Rachel wrote: ``We are terrified about what losing Medicaid support  would mean for our family.''

Moms have enough to deal with. Let's leave their healthcare alone.
