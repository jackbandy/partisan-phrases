Peters, Stabenow Announce $5.6 Million for Saginaw Transit Authority Regional Services Through the CARES Act


U.S. Senators Gary Peters (MI) and Debbie Stabenow (MI) today announced that the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) is providing the Saginaw Transit Authority Regional Services (STARS) a $5.6 million grant. Peters and Stabenow helped secure this funding as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The funds will help ensure that STARS will remain operational during the Coronavirus pandemic.

"While the Coronavirus has upended our daily lives, Michiganders still rely on public transit -- whether it be for getting to work or buying essentials like groceries and medicine," said Senator Peters, a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. "These funds will help ensure transportation services can continue supporting critical functions in Saginaw."

"Families and essential workers in Saginaw rely on public transportation to get them to and from the grocery store, pharmacy, and work," said Senator Stabenow. "This funding will support the Saginaw Transit Authority Regional Services so it can continue to provide safe and reliable transportation during the COVID-19 crisis."
