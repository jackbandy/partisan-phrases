Letter to Peter Gaynor, Administrator of FEMA - Stabenow, Peters Back Whitmer's Call to Waive Cost-Sharing Requirements for Federal Assistance to Battle Coronavirus


Dear Administrator Gaynor:

 

We write in support of Governor Whitmer's request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) waive all cost-share requirements for assistance, under President Trump's Major Disaster Declaration (4494-DR) for the State of Michigan on March 27, 2020 in response to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID--19) pandemic.

 

FEMA is currently authorized to increase the federal cost-share to 100 percent for emergency work, including Direct Federal Assistance. With over 30,000 cases in Michigan, the unprecedented nature of the necessary COVID-19 response stretches beyond the capability of the State of Michigan and warrants the full resources and support of the federal government.

 

As of April 15, 2020, the State Emergency Operations Center has expended more than $234 million to prevent, contain, and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary estimates suggest state revenues could be reduced as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic by $3 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2020 and another $4 billion in FY 2021. This represents about 15% of annual state revenue sources, without federal funds. 

 

The people of the State of Michigan are resilient, and we commend the work of federal, state, and local officials to provide assistance. We urge you to swiftly accept the Governor's request to increase the federal cost-share to 100%, so the residents and business owners in these communities can have the resources they need to address this pandemic. Thank you for your consideration of our request.
