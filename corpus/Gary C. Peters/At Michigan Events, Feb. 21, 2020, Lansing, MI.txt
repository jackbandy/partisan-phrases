At Michigan Events, Peters Discusses Efforts to Expand Apprenticeship Opportunities


U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) made stops in Saginaw, Coopersville and Lansing over the past week to discuss his efforts to expand apprenticeship opportunities for Michiganders. Peters spoke and met with veterans, career and technical education (CTE) specialists and UA local chapter members about the importance of skilled trades to Michigan's future and how to ensure students and apprentices can access the training needed for successful careers.

Peters has championed numerous efforts to help more Michiganders gain the skills needed to fill good-paying jobs. Most recently, the Senate unanimously passed Peters' bipartisan legislation in December to expand apprenticeship opportunities for veterans. The Support for Veterans in Effective Apprenticeships Act would increase veterans' access to financial assistance they can use in connection with an apprenticeship program. In Michigan alone, only a few hundred of the 1,000 registered apprenticeships listed as active by the Department of Labor (DOL) have been approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Peters also authored provisions to expand school counselor training and awareness of career and technical education opportunities that were signed into law by President Trump in 2018.
