Peters Reiterates Call for Aid to Michigan, Cash-Strapped Communities Following McConnell Suggesting States Declare Bankruptcy


U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, today released the following statement reiterating his call for the Senate to pass aid for Michigan and financially strapped communities hit hard by Coronavirus. Peters has repeatedly pressed for action to support states and local communities, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said states should instead be allowed to declare bankruptcy.

"Senator McConnell's comments were not only wrong, but reckless. Michigan and communities across our state have been devastated by this health and economic crisis and are facing dire financial challenges through no fault of their own. If McConnell got his way, this could have a crippling impact for Michigan, potentially forcing our state and communities to cut vital services and harming families and workers, including firefighters, law enforcement and health professionals.

"Michiganders expect us to partner together to provide critical relief, and I will continue working in a bipartisan manner to ensure our state and communities across Michigan have the resources needed to stay afloat and emerge from this unprecedented crisis."
