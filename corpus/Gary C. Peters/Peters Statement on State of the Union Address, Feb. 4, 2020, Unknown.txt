Peters Statement on State of the Union Address


"There is a lot more we can do to help working families in Michigan and across the country. I hope that we can find common ground and make progress on issues important to Michiganders: lowering prescription drug costs and expanding skills training and apprenticeship programs. We should build on some of the successful career and technical education programs in Michigan -- like in Saginaw where Rick Burmeister, President of the Saginaw Intermediate School District board -- is working with educators to ensure students get the training needed to pursue successful careers. We should also focus on efforts to protect the Great Lakes and our drinking water, repair our crumbling infrastructure and effectively secure our borders."
