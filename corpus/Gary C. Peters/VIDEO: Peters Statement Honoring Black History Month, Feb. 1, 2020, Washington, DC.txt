VIDEO: Peters Statement Honoring Black History Month


U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) released the following statement recognizing Black History Month:

"As communities in Michigan and across the nation commemorate Black History Month, we celebrate the generations of African American leaders whose contributions helped unlock technological advancements, enrich our culture, promote a more just world and defend our freedoms. Through their remarkable achievements, these men and women have had an immeasurable impact on our state and country.

"This Black History Month, it is important that we not only honor their legacies but recommit to working together to forge a more inclusive society. Whether it's access to the ballot box -- social and environmental justice -- expanding access to quality education, skilled trade opportunities and apprenticeship programs to get good-paying jobs or ensuring health care is more affordable, we must all work together to build an environment, where every American has an opportunity to fulfill their dreams."
