Peters, Stabenow Announce $11.5 Million in Federal Grants for Kalamazoo, Berrien County Transit Services


U.S. Senators Gary Peters (MI) and Debbie Stabenow (MI) today announced that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is providing Kalamazoo's Central County Transportation Authority (Metro) a $9.1 million grant and Benton Harbor-Saint Joseph's Twin Cities Area Transportation Authority (TCATA) in Berrien County a $2.4 million grant. Peters and Stabenow helped secure this funding as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The funds will help ensure that these transit services will remain operational during the Coronavirus pandemic.

"From our dedicated frontline workers to seniors in need of critical supplies and medicine, Michiganders are still relying on public transit during this pandemic," said Senator Peters, a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. "This funding will ensure that critical transportation services in Kalamazoo and Berrien counties can continue running during this unprecedented crisis. I'm going to continue working to ensure that Michigan not only has the resources needed to get through this pandemic, but also that essential workers receive the compensation they've earned for putting their health at risk."

"The leadership and workers of Twin Cities Area Transportation Authority and Central County Transportation Authority work hard to make sure that people can get to their jobs, doctor appointments, and grocery stores," said Senator Stabenow. "This funding will make sure that they're able to continue to provide these vital services for their communities during this pandemic."
