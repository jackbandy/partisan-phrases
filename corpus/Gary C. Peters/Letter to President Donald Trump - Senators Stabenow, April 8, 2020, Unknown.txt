Letter to President Donald Trump - Senators Stabenow, Peters Call for Action to Prevent Counterfeiting, Price Gouging of Medical Supplies Amid COVID-19 Pandemic


Dear President Trump:

We write today to bring your attention to the serious impact that price gouging, as well asfraudulent and counterfeit goods, are having on our country's ability to treat patients and combatthe spread of the COVID-19. We urge you to swiftly exercise the authorities at your disposal toimprove distribution channels, prevent fraud, and better protect patients, health care providers,first responders, critical infrastructure workers, and all Americans.Every day, profiteers and scam artists are taking advantage of desperate buyers and theunprecedented demand for personal protective equipment by charging obscene prices and sellingcounterfeit or fraudulent goods. Local and state governments, health care providers, firstresponders, and affected critical industries are scrambling to find new or additional sources ofthis equipment and, even worse, competing against each other for dwindling supplies.When those buyers, struggling to replace their diminishing stocks, are forced to turn tointernational suppliers outside their accustomed channels and dubious third-party brokers,Americans are less safe. When health care providers pay outrageous, marked-up prices forpersonal protective equipment, only to discover that they purchased counterfeit items, thoseproviders cannot safely and effectively do their jobs.We implore you to exercise the strong manufacturing and supply channel oversight needed tokeep profiteers and counterfeiters from taking advantage of vulnerable Americans. In addition toimproving the integrity and oversight of personal protective equipment distribution to free thenational supply chain of counterfeit items, we also urge you to protect Americans by directingnational law enforcement and regulatory agencies to swiftly investigate allegations ofcounterfeiting and price-gouging. 2Your executive orders of March 18 and March 23, 2020 delegated authority to a number ofexecutive branch officials to take actions to prevent hoarding and to determine the "propernationwide priorities and allocation of all health and medical resources, including controlling thedistribution of such materials [Â…] in the civilian market." The voluntary support from industryand manufacturers that your administration has largely relied upon thus far is an important initialstep, and we are heartened by American businesses that are stepping up and working to meet thechallenge. However, in this crisis, volunteerism can neither equal nor replace a comprehensive,efficient, and nationwide strategy designed to ensure that quality medical supplies are producedand effectively distributed to areas of critical need.We, therefore, respectfully urge that you develop a response that strategically manufactures,allocates, and distributes medical supplies so as to prevent the introduction of counterfeit orfraudulent personal protective equipment into the supply chain, prevent profiteering and pricegouging, and ensure that our local, state, and federal governments are all working together tofight the pandemic, rather than being forced into competing with one another for critical medicalsupplies.

Sincerely,
