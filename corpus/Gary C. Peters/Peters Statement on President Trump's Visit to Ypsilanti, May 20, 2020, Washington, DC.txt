Peters Statement on President Trump's Visit to Ypsilanti


"I'm proud that Michigan autoworkers are making the personal protection equipment and medical supplies that are saving lives. Michigan's workers and engineers are the most talented in the world and they have stepped up to help ensure we can get through this public health and economic crisis. As we work to reopen our economy, I'm going to continue focusing on ensuring that workers have the protection they need and the confidence that their working environments are safe.

"We must also ensure that the auto industry -- including both manufacturers and suppliers -- has the support they need to reopen and succeed. I've been very concerned that auto suppliers that have been reopening and lack capital to restart quickly have been unsuccessful in receiving money from the CARES Act. I urge the Trump Administration to work with Congress on this important effort.

"As Michigan faces unprecedented challenges from the pandemic and now with catastrophic flooding in mid-Michigan, I hope the President will commit to helping ensure our state receives the federal support it needs."
