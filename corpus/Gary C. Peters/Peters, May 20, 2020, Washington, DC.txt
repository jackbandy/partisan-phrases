Peters, Stabenow Announce Over $3 Million in Funding for Bay Metro Transit


U.S. Senators Gary Peters (MI) and Debbie Stabenow (MI) today announced that Bay Metro Transit will receive a $3,800,000 grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Peters and Stabenow helped secure this funding as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The funds will be used to continue transit service in the Bay County area during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"From our dedicated frontline workers to seniors in need of critical supplies and medicine, Michiganders are still relying on public transit during this pandemic," said Senator Peters, a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. "This funding will ensure that critical transportation services throughout Bay County can continue running during this unprecedented crisis. I'm going to continue working to ensure that Michigan not only has the resources needed to get through this pandemic, but also that essential workers receive the compensation they've earned for putting their health at risk."

"The leadership and workers of Bay Metro Transit work hard to make sure that people can get to their jobs, doctor appointments, and grocery stores," said Senator Stabenow. "This funding will make sure that they're able to continue to provide these vital services for essential workers during this pandemic."
