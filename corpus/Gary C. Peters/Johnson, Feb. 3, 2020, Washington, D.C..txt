Johnson, Peters Introduce Bill to Reauthorize and Improve Motorcyclist Advisory Council


U.S. Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) along with Senator Gary Peters (D-Mich.) introduced the Motorcyclist Advisory Council Reauthorization Act today. The bill would reauthorize the Motorcyclist Advisory Council (MAC) at the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for six years. The bill would make important changes to MAC to ensure that a diverse set of stakeholders from the motorcycle community are represented and that DOT closely reviews recommendations coming out of MAC.

MAC is responsible for providing road safety recommendations, on issues ranging from construction to new transportation technologies, to DOT from a motorcycle perspective. Text of the bill Sens. Johnson and Peters introduced can be found here. A companion bill was introduced in the House by Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) in November 2019.

"Wisconsin has a rich history with motorcycles and we know it's crucial to get input from the motorcycle community about how to keep roads safe and enjoyable for all," said Sen. Johnson. "Government needs to be responsive, efficient and effective. Making sure motorcyclists have a voice and a seat at the table is beneficial for everyone."

"There's no better way to see all that Michigan has to offer than by riding a motorcycle," said Sen. Peters, co-chair of the bipartisan Senate Motorcycle Caucus. "As a motorcycle owner and rider, I'm proud to introduce bipartisan legislation to better give riders and manufacturers a voice on decisions impacting them."

In the 115th Congress, Sen. Johnson was the lead author of a resolution to promote awareness of the profiling of motorcycle riders. The resolution passed the Senate unanimously in December 2018.
