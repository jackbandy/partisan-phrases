Peters Helps Senate Pass Coronavirus Funding for Michigan, Convenes Hearing on Federal Response


Today, U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, helped the Senate pass a bipartisan funding bill to address Coronavirus--including over $14.5 million in resources for Michigan--and convened a committee hearing on the response to outbreak.

The funding that passed today -- which was welcomed by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer -- includes $14.5 million for Michigan and priorities raised directly to Peters by Michigan officials, including personal protective equipment like masks, gloves and vaccines and reimbursing state and local governments for detection and prevention efforts. Peters pushed for these priorities after convening a call with public health officials and hospitals from across Michigan on preventing the spread of Coronavirus within the state. This morning's hearing in the Homeland Security Committee assessed the response to the Coronavirus outbreak and ongoing efforts to contain the virus by federal health and homeland security officials.

"The Coronavirus is a threat we must be prepared to address, and that's why I fought to secure needed federal resources for Michigan," said Senator Peters. "This is a good first step, and as we move forward I will press the Administration to ensure that the federal response to this outbreak is well-coordinated and effective and that Michigan communities and health officials have sufficient resources."
