Peters Statement on the Recent Events Following the Death of George Floyd


Following the unconscionable death of George Floyd and after speaking with Michigan community and faith leaders and law enforcement officials, U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) released the following statement:

"In the aftermath of George Floyd's death -- something that never should have happened -- it is the responsibility of each of us to acknowledge that too many Americans -- especially African Americans -- are dying senselessly, and we must come together to stop it.

"More than ever, now is the time for us to unite as a country to encourage understanding and compassion for our fellow Americans. Now is the time for us to walk in another's shoes and acknowledge the experiences that have shaped their views.

"I believe we can do so respectfully and peacefully. People have a fundamental right to peacefully protest, and we have seen Michiganders and Americans across the country do so. But we also have seen rioting, destruction and violence that is tearing the very fabric of our communities. That does not advance the fight for equality or justice. We are in an incredibly challenging and divided moment, but I believe we have an opportunity to come together and make meaningful reforms. We must act now to address the root causes of inequities and reform our criminal justice system so it works for every American -- no matter who you are or where you live. We must also address the lack of trust between law enforcement and the communities they are sworn to protect. It is up to each of us to contribute to a more equal and just future that lives up to the ideals on which our nation was founded."
