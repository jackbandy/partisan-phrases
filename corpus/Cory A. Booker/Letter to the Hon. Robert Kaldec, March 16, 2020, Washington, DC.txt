Letter to the Hon. Robert Kaldec, Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response for the Dept. of Health and Human Services - Members of New Jersey Delegation Call for the Federal Gov't to Send NJ Medical Supplies to Combat COVID-19


We write in support of New Jersey's request for supplies from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). New Jersey's presumptive positive case count continues to rise, stressing the health care system in our state. Additionally, New Jersey's proximity to New York City and Philadelphia creates a unique situation of overlap for our health systems. Because of this, Governor Phil Murphy requested a list of supplies from the SNS to ensure that New Jersey has the necessary medical equipment to support the state's COVID-19 response.

As of March 13, New Jersey had received a fraction of what was requested. Below is a list of supplies received and attached is a comprehensive list of requested supplies.

-N95 Respirators: 84,578 (requested 2,880,000)-Face/Surgical Masks: 201,479 (requested 864,000)-Face Shields: 38,365 (requested 864,000)-Surgical Gowns: 31,280 (requested 864,000)-Coveralls: 160 (requested 864,000)-Gloves: 111,378 (requested 2,880,000)

As evidenced by the more comprehensive list attached, New Jersey still has not received any antiviral drugs, respiratory supplies, or ventilators. Please answer the following questions regarding supplies requested from the SNS:

1. When can states expect to receive their requested supplies from the SNS? Specifically, when will New Jersey receive its requested supplies from the SNS?2. The SNS released twenty-five percent to on a pro rata basis last week, is the Administration replenishing the SNS as it pulls from the reserve?3. Is the Administration planning to use the Defense Production Act in order to force industry to expand production and supply these resources?

While our Governor, Mayors, and County Executives are doing everything they can to limit exposure, New Jersey's proximity to major metropolitan areas and the frequency of movement of people between the tristate area not only put the state in harm's way, but also make the state uniquely positioned to deal with this ongoing outbreak.
