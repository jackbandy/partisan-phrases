Booker Welcomes CDC's Release of Racial COVID-19 Data


U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) issued the below statement following news that the Centers for Disease Control had released data on the racial and ethnic breakdown of COVID-19 cases. Booker, along with Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) had been pushing for such detailed information, writing a letter to the Health and Human Services Department late last month and introducing a bill earlier this week to require such data collection.

"This is a welcome step that will help us better allocate resources and information, and better understand the health disparities entwined with COVID-19, so we can act to end them," Booker said. "The story of communities of color bearing the brunt of public suffering is a tragically familiar one in our nation's history. I sincerely hope that when this crisis is behind us, we will all expand our moral imagination to act with greater urgency in addressing the systemic, deep-rooted, and structural inequities that underpin these racial health disparities."
