Booker Statement on U.S. Killing of Iranian Leader


U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and among the first to speak out on this attack in Iraq, issued an additional formal statement following U.S. air strikes last night that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani:

"Make no mistake -- Qasem Soleimani was a ruthless, evil leader who had orchestrated countless attacks that have cost American lives. Today, many questions remain and must be answered on the intelligence reports that led to this action, what steps were undertaken to prepare our personnel and partners in the region, and the consequences of an escalatory attack with no clear endgame.

This President has no long-term strategy for dealing with Iran, bringing stability to the Middle East, or avoiding military conflict with Iran. The reality is that Americans are evacuating from cities across the region because this morning Americans at home and abroad are at risk from Iran's potential retaliatory actions. Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee must be briefed on the extent of Iran's capabilities across the region, plans to keep our embassies, troops and personnel safe in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and the Gulf, and diplomatic engagement with our allies and partners.

 

Congress needs answers to these very real concerns and the most critical priority now is ensuring the safety and security of American diplomats, troops, and civilians in the region and at home on U.S. soil."
