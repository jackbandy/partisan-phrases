Norcross, Pallone, Malinowski Lead NJ Delegation in Bipartisan Call to Expand Coronavirus Testing in New Jersey


U.S. Congressmen Donald Norcross (NJ-01), Frank Pallone (NJ-06) and Tom Malinowski (NJ-07) led the New Jersey delegation in sending a letter to President Donald Trump requesting additional federal funding to expand coronavirus testing, surveillance and contact tracing in New Jersey.

The lawmakers called for prioritization of hotspots like New Jersey and the utilization of mobile testing to expand testing access. The Members also asked the President to reconsider Governor Murphy's application for an additional federal testing site in South Jersey.

"Greater federal support is necessary to ensure New Jersey's coronavirus (COVID-19) testing capabilities are able to adequately manage the large -- and still growing -- demand. Without additional resources, New Jersey is unable to further mitigate the spread of this disease nor move toward implementing serological testing in order to identify individuals who may have potential immunity to COVID-19," the letter states.

"Without more widely available testing, we are unable to fully understand the prevalence of the disease across the state, especially in our more remote counties," the letter continued. "A higher volume of testing kits along with greater utilization of mobile testing at community sites can improve accessibility across the state and help expand testing to asymptomatic residents."

Currently, there are two federally-supported testing sites in New Jersey at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel and at the Bergen New Bridge Medical Center in Paramus.

Norcross, Pallone and Malinowski were joined by other members of the delegation, including U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker, and Reps. Andy Kim (NJ-03), Chris Smith (NJ-04), Josh Gottheimer (NJ-05), Albio Sires (NJ-08), Bill Pascrell (NJ-09), Donald M. Payne, Jr. (NJ-10), Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) and Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11).
