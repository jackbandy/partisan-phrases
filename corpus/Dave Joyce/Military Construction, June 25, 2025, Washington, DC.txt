Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, as the designee of Mr. Mast, I have an  amendment at the desk.

Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast), the true sponsor of this amendment who has just  arrived to state his position.

Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, what else can I say after hearing  the true story of a true American hero and why it should be important  for all people--Floridians, every veteran--to be able to access  cannabis if, in fact, it is necessary and prescribed by a doctor and if  it helps them treat whatever they have come home with?

My father was wounded and left for dead in World War II, and he came  home. I know what it takes for these people and the hurt that they have  gone through on behalf of our country. They deserve every option  available to bring them back to what they were before they left on our  behalf.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
