Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Mercer  County Pennsylvania as they commemorate their 225th Anniversary. It is  with immense pride that we acknowledge 225 years of history, community,  and resilience. This milestone is not simply a measure of time, but a  testament to the unwavering determination, grit, and ingenuity of the  individuals who have molded this county into the exceptional place it  is today.

From its founding in 1800, Mercer County has stood as a pillar of  strength and community. What began as a frontier settlement has grown  into a thriving region rich in culture, industry, and opportunity. Over  the centuries, this county has been home to hardworking farmers,  entrepreneurs, educators, and service members--all of whom have played  a role in shaping its legacy.

We remember the early settlers who shaped life in this land, facing  hardships with unwavering determination. We honor the industries that  have driven our economy forward, from steel and manufacturing to  agriculture and small businesses. We celebrate our schools, where  generations of students have been educated and prepared for bright  futures. And we take pride in our local traditions, events, and  landmarks that make Mercer County a place like no other.

To the families who have lived here for generations, and to those who  have chosen to make Mercer County their home more recently, I thank  them for being part of this incredible journey. Their dedication,  kindness, and commitment to this community are what make it truly  special.

So, as we celebrate this historic anniversary, let us not only honor  our past but also embrace the opportunities ahead. Let us work together  to ensure that Mercer County continues to be a place of growth, unity,  and prosperity for generations to come.
