Recognizing Phil and Laurie Davis As A Community Champion in Pennsylvania-16


Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Phil and Laurie Davis for their extraordinary service to the  veteran community of Crawford County and the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania.

Phil Davis proudly served in the United States Army from January 21,  1970, to December 3, 1971. He deployed to Vietnam from January to  October 1971, serving his country during one of the most challenging  periods in our Nation's history.

On November 28, 1988, the Veterans of the Vietnam War, Post 52 was  established in Meadville, Pennsylvania. Phil was among the founding  members who helped launch the post and shape its mission of supporting  veterans in need. When the National Organization later went bankrupt  and closed, Post 52 refused to let its mission end. In 2019, the post  reorganized, completed all necessary work to become an independent  501(c)(19) organization, and expanded membership eligibility to  veterans of all eras, ensuring that no veteran seeking help would be  turned away. This decision dramatically increased the number of  veterans they have been able to serve.

It was at Post 52 that Phil and Laurie met, forming a partnership  rooted in service and compassion. They were married in 1995, and  together they have dedicated decades to supporting their fellow  veterans. Phil has served as Commander of Post 52 many times over the  years, and has held the position continuously since 2020. Laurie has  long served as the Quartermaster, ensuring that the post remains  organized, responsive, and financially sound. Their leadership has been  essential to sustaining the post's mission and expanding its impact.

Phil and Laurie's commitment goes far beyond titles. They provide  Walmart gift cards and gas cards to the Crawford County Veterans  Service office so that any veteran who walks in without food,  resources, or fuel can receive immediate assistance. Their generosity  has provided critical support to veterans in crisis and has exemplified  the values of honor, service, and community.

Phil and Laurie Davis represent the very best of what it means to  serve. Their decades of dedication have strengthened our community and  improved the lives of countless veterans and their families. It is my  honor to extend deep appreciation and recognition for their unwavering  commitment to those who have worn our Nation's uniform.
