Saluting the Service of Lieutenant Brian M. Frick


Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to present a  Congressional Veterans Commendation to Lieutenant Brian M. Frick, U.S.  Navy, for his exemplary service. His unwavering commitment to our  Nation and his efforts to improve his community have made lasting,  positive impacts on countless lives.

LT Frick served honorably in the U.S. Navy as a member of the  operational team. During his eight years in the Submarine Service, he  held key roles as a lead sonar operator/technician, sonar watch  supervisor, and sonar supervisor. Throughout his service, LT Frick  earned numerous awards and accolades, including the Navy Achievement  Medal for his exceptional submarine tracking abilities and technical  expertise.

After leaving the Navy, LT Frick pursued higher education at the  University of Texas at San Antonio, earning a degree in Criminal  Justice with a minor in Sociology. He continued his dedication to  public service by beginning his civilian career with the Texas  Department of Public Safety (DPS).

At DPS, LT Frick worked with the Highway Patrol and served as a K-9  handler before joining the Criminal Investigations Division (CID) as a  Narcotics Agent in Amarillo, Harlingen, and Brownsville, Texas, where  he focused on Border and Drug Interdiction issues. Later, as a Senior  Agent in Amarillo, he mentored new agents in surveillance techniques,  conducted criminal investigations, and drafted search warrants. He now  leads the CID Training Unit, supervising eight Training Agents/ Coordinators.

I am honored to join LT Frick's friends and family in celebrating his  years of dedicated service and sacrifice. I applaud his work and wish  him success and safety as he continues to serve our community with  pride and honor.
