Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr Speaker, I am proud to honor Commander Jon  Lux, U.S. Navy, Retired, with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.  Commander Lux's commitment, strength, and leadership reflects the very  best of Texas.

Commander Lux's distinguished naval career spanned over 2 decades.  After being commissioned as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy, he served as a  Surface Warfare Officer on multiple sea tours, primarily in the Middle  East. His assignments also include serving as Commander, Mine Warfare  Command and Commander, Mine Countermeasures Squadron Three, as well as  Executive Officer of Naval Station Ingleside, Texas.

Following his military service, Commander Lux continued to  demonstrate his dedication to his community. He has served on the Cedar  Park City Council, the Cedar Park Tourism and Advisory Board, and the  Planning and Zoning Committee. Additionally, he is a member of the  Board of Directors for the Williamson County Appraisal Board, where he  also chaired the Bond Oversight Committee. Driven by a passion for  service, Commander Lux was a founding member of American Legion Post  911 in Cedar Park, raising funds for the Gold Star Monument and  supporting Boys and Girls State programs. Commander Lux is a devoted  husband to his wife, Michelle, and a proud father to their two  children.

I commend Commander Lux's dedication to his community and our Nation.  I join his colleagues, family, and friends, in honoring his career,  saluting his commitment to public service, and celebrating his  outstanding achievements.
