Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I salute the life and legacy of 1st  Lieutenant Charles W. ``Woody'' McCook, a World War II hero and devoted  patriot, who joined the angels in July of 1948. His courage, sacrifice,  and unwavering sense of duty exemplify the very best of the American  spirit. Though decades have passed since his final mission, his story  continues to inspire all who cherish freedom and understand the cost of  preserving it.

Affectionately known as ``Woody'' to his loved ones and fellow  service members, Lt. McCook served as the pilot of a B-25C Mitchell  aircraft during the Second World War. Answering his Nation's call, he  bravely flew into the dangerous jungles of Japanese-occupied Burma, now  known as Myanmar. His missions were perilous, often requiring low- altitude attacks and precise coordination in an environment where  survival was never guaranteed.

For 82 years, Lt. McCook was listed as Missing in Action. Thanks to  the tireless efforts of military recovery teams, his remains have  finally returned home to Georgetown, Texas, where his family and  community, after decades of unanswered questions, can now lay him to  rest with the honor and dignity he earned.

Lt. McCook's service reminds us that freedom is not free. It is  secured through the bravery of those willing to give everything in its  defense. His return brings long-awaited closure to his family and a  renewed appreciation from his country. As we mourn the passing of Lt.  McCook, his presence was a blessing to all who knew him. The positive  impact he had on the lives of others will live on and remain forever in  our hearts.
