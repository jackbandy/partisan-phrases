Congratulating Larry Haskell on His Retirement


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693542/congratulating-larry-haskell-on-his-retirement


Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor  Larry Haskell, Spokane County Prosecuting Attorney, who recently  announced his retirement after more than a decade of dedicated service.

Larry's career is a testament to true public service. Before serving  as a prosecutor, he was a B-1 and B-52 pilot in the U.S. Air Force and  a lieutenant colonel who answered the call to duty after 9/11, serving  bravely in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.

After retiring from the military in 2005, Larry returned to Spokane  to continue his work in the prosecuting attorney's office, where he was  elected in 2014 and has since dedicated himself to justice in our  community.

Over the years, Larry has tackled some of the toughest cases--murder,  assaults, gun crimes, gangs, witness intimidation--always with  integrity and unwavering commitment to public service.

Larry once said that being elected to his office was one of the  greatest honors of his life, and it is clear he poured his heart and  soul into this work. He also showed wisdom and humility, knowing when  it is time to pass the torch.

As Larry steps into retirement, I thank him for his courage,  dedication, and service, both in uniform and in the courtroom. Spokane  County and our entire region owe Larry Haskell a debt of gratitude.

I congratulate Larry on a job well done and wish him all the best in  his next chapter.                        Firefighters Run Toward Danger

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart not  just to speak but to mourn, to honor, and to demand that we never grow  numb to the unimaginable loss suffered by those who dedicate their  lives to protecting ours.

Every day, nearly 1 million volunteer and career firefighters across  our country suit up, knowing they may not return home. They run toward  danger when many others run away.

They give up holidays, time with their children, and nights of sleep  so we can live safely.

Today, I rise to honor three of them, three men from the Coeur  d'Alene Fire Department and Kootenai County Fire & Rescue who answered  the call of duty and paid the price for their courage in an act of  senseless and evil violence.

Mr. Speaker, Battalion Chiefs John Morrison and Frank Harwood were  not only respected leaders in the fire service, they were pillars of  the Coeur d'Alene community. They were proud husbands, fathers, and  friends. They were the kind of men who showed up before anyone asked,  who did the work no one saw, and who led not with titles but with  strength and humility.

Gabe Eckert, president of Local 710, recalled his last memory with  John Morrison. They were just two men on the patio, quietly drinking  beers and talking about their dads.

That is who these men were, constantly striving to serve the public  and the people closest to them. We lost more than firefighters. We lost  role models.

Engineer David Tysdal was also critically injured in the attack. He  has now endured three major surgeries. By God's grace, he is steadily  recovering. If he is listening today, we encourage David to stay  strong. He carries the prayers of gratitude of a nation with him.

Mr. Speaker, this violence was not just a tragedy. It was an outrage.  An attack on these men was an attack on the very fabric of our  community. That anyone would target them with such brutality should  chill us to the bone.

The deaths of John Morrison and Frank Harwood and the injury of David  Tysdal are a devastating reminder of the cost of service.

To the loved ones mourning these brave men, no words will ever be  enough. May they find comfort in knowing their courage echoes far  beyond Coeur d'Alene.
