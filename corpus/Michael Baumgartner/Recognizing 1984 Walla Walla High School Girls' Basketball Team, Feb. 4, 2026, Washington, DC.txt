Recognizing 1984 Walla Walla High School Girls' Basketball Team


Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 1984  Walla Walla High School girls' basketball team and to celebrate the  long-overdue recognition of their State championship victory.

The 1979 and 1984 Walla Walla High girls' teams remain the only State  basketball champions in Wa-Hi history. Yet, for more than four decades,  the 1984 champions have had no victory cup to mark their achievement.

What began as a casual conversation last spring has turned into the  long-awaited correction of that injustice. This Saturday, after 42  years, the 1984 team will finally be recognized with a ceremony and the  presentation of a specially made championship trophy.

These remarkable women represent the best of our communities:  perseverance, teamwork, and pride that will stand the test of time.  Now, finally, they will have a victory cup to recognize their  significant achievement.

Mr. Speaker, I would also like to give a shout-out to the Walla Walla  Union-Bulletin for covering this story. It is a reminder that while we  can sometimes be frustrated with the way media covers things  politically, we always appreciate a local news source for these types  of stories.        Recognizing Driver and Lindsey Families of Pend Oreille County

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Driver  and Lindsey families of Pend Oreille County, whose century-long story  tells the very best of rural America: perseverance, hard work, and  renewal.

Their history stretches from a hand-built homestead in the 1920s,  through decades of loss and reclamation, to today's 800-acre hay  operation that continues to be an anchor in their community.

This year marks three remarkable milestones: 100 years since the  original home was built, 80 years since the farm was reclaimed, and 20  years since the current operation began.

The Driver and Lindsey families embody stewardship and resilience.  They have tilled the same soil for generations, adapting through  challenge and change, ensuring this family legacy. Pictured to the  right of me today is one of the fifth generation of the Driver family,  and we know that he has much to look forward to as he builds his  community on this wonderful family farm.

Celebrating 145th Anniversary of Spokane Tribe of Indians

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 145th  anniversary of the Spokane Tribe of Indians, a proud milestone honoring  one of eastern Washington's oldest and most resilient communities.

The Spokane Tribe recently hosted its 1881 Powwow near Wellpinit,  bringing together families, dancers, and community members to mark this  anniversary with song, dance, and fellowship. The day was filled with  vibrant drumming, traditional ceremonies, and shared meals that  reflected the enduring spirit of the Tribe.

As the American flag and the Spokane Tribe flag flew side by side,  this celebration stood as a powerful symbol of unity, resilience, and  the living heritage that continues to enrich the inland northwest.

Mr. Speaker, I am not a Native Tribal member myself, but growing up  in eastern Washington, I did have time to spend playing basketball with  the Nez Perce Tribe of Indians in Lapwai, close to my family home. On  several occasions, I was able to join and observe powwows.

Mr. Speaker, if anyone in Congress or watching at home has not had  the opportunity to attend a powwow, it truly is one of the best  celebrations of our shared culture and history. It is something that  all Americans should attempt to do as we celebrate our 250th  anniversary.

I close by again congratulating the Spokane Tribe of Indians on their  leadership, tradition, and community pride.
