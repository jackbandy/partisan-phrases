Focusing on Results


Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, we are nearing 1 week since the end of  the needless, 43-day-long Democrat government shutdown. That shutdown  was a monumental waste of time that hurt a lot of people across the  country.

I am grateful that the families in eastern Washington can now breathe  easier knowing their paychecks, benefits, and livelihoods are no longer  being used as political bargaining chips.

The House passed three appropriations bills providing full-year  funding for agriculture, the FDA, military construction, and the  legislative branch.

I am especially proud that three priorities I fought for were  included in the agriculture appropriations bill: $1 million for  Washington State University's ARS building project, $2 million for NEW  Health's Chewelah expansion and regional workforce center, and $1  million for TriState Health's Family Medicine Residency program.

These are meaningful wins for eastern Washington families and our  rural economy.

Our budget also delivered more than $13 million for Fairchild Air  Force Base, strengthening mission support and fueling operations to  keep our Nation secure. Had the vote gone differently and the Democrats  succeeded in pandering to their radical base, we might still be in a  government shutdown and these critical victories for eastern Washington  and the Nation might never have happened.

Mr. Speaker, I am glad we are getting back to what matters:  delivering results for the people we serve.                     Honoring Vietnam Veteran John Gilman

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, few moments as a Member of Congress are  more meaningful than helping a hero receive long-overdue recognition.  Recently, my office had the privilege of assisting Vietnam veteran John  Gilman in securing the Silver Star Medal he earned more than 50 years  ago, an honor long delayed but deeply deserved.

On Veterans Day, I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Gilman at the  Heroes Awards night in Spokane. The event,  hosted by Heroes Homestead, was a remarkable celebration of service,  honoring not only those who wore the uniform but those who continue to  serve our communities today.

Surrounded by his family, friends, and fellow veterans, Mr. Gilman  finally received the medal that reflected his courage and selflessness  in Vietnam.

Mr. Gilman of Airway Heights served valiantly in the American  Division during the 1969 Tet Offensive. Amid intense combat near Phuoc  Hoa, South Vietnam, his company was ordered to relieve a friendly unit  under fire. Though wounded in action, Mr. Gilman refused to fall back.  He steadfastly manned his M60 machine gun and continued providing  suppressive fire, even while receiving medical treatment. Thanks to his  courage under fire, his unit closed with and ultimately destroyed the  insurgent force. For these extraordinary acts, the Army approved Mr.  Gilman for his Silver Star. Yet despite that honor, he was never  officially presented the award.

Earlier this year, Mr. Gilman contacted my office. Through the  persistent efforts of my staff working hand in hand with Army Personnel  Command, we confirmed that his Silver Star had been authorized decades  ago but never delivered.

Last Tuesday night, more than 50 years after his acts of valor,  Brigadier General Paul Sellars, Commanding General of the Washington  Army National Guard, had the honor of presenting the Silver Star to Mr.  Gilman.

The Silver Star is the Army's third-highest award for gallantry in  combat, given only to those who display extraordinary heroism under  fire.

Mr. Gilman's story is a powerful reminder of the courage that defines  our veterans and our Nation's sacred duty to ensure their service is  never forgotten.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate John Gilman and thank him for his  bravery, his sacrifice, and his continued example to us all. As we  approach America's 250th birthday, let us honor veterans like John  Gilman not only with medals but through our daily commitment to live up  to the freedom they fought to defend.
