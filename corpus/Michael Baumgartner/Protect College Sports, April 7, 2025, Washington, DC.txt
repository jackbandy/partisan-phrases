Protect College Sports

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, tonight is the NCAA championship, but  the magic of March Madness is gone. Every number one seed has made the  Final Four. There are no upsets, no Cinderellas, just bigger brands  with bigger budgets. Why? It is because college sports is on a downward  trajectory, and the magic of what used to make it special is gone.

Now the House v. NCAA settlement will unleash even more chaos with no  plan to protect small schools, Olympic sports, or competitive balance.  That is why tonight I am introducing the Restore College Sports Act. It  replaces the NCAA with a new entity under Presidential authority to  regulate public college sports as a public good. It fixes the NIL  transfer process to eliminate chaos, and it equally shares revenue  across all sports and all schools to increase opportunities in Olympic  sports and create competitive balance.

Mr. Speaker, indeed, tonight is a big moment with the Restore College  Sports Act.
