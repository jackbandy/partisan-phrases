Taking An Important Step for Rural America


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692323/taking-an-important-step-for-rural-america


Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the One Big  Beautiful Bill Act and its impact on rural communities.

The House took an important step for rural America by passing the One  Big Beautiful Bill Act. For communities across eastern Washington, the  relief cannot come soon enough.

For years, rural communities with large amounts of Federal land faced  a structural disadvantage. They can't collect property taxes on those  lands, yet they are still expected to keep schools open, maintain  roads, and provide public safety. The Forest Service manages millions  of acres in our region, but it is our local government that is left  holding the bag.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act helps fix that broken system. It  restores stable, reliable funding to rural counties that host Federal  forests by reauthorizing the Secure Rural Schools program through  fiscal year 2026.

That means that our county commissioners and local leaders can plan  with confidence, knowing that the Federal Government will keep its  promise to pay predictable-share forest revenues to the school  districts that I represent.

I have heard directly from our county leaders in Asotin, Ferry, Pend  Oreille, Stevens, and Walla Walla Counties. The uncertainty is real.  Some are facing a 40 percent cut. This puts rural services and teaching  jobs at risk.

Fortunately, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act delivers the kind of  support that they need and deserve.

Now, it is time for the Senate to act. Let's get it to the  President's desk and deliver for rural America. Our communities have  waited long enough.                  Celebrating U.S. Army's 250th Anniversary

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say happy birthday to  the U.S. Army.

On June 14, we will celebrate a remarkable milestone: the 250th  birthday of the United States Army. For 2\1/2\ centuries, the Army has  stood as a pillar of strength, sacrifice, and service. From the  earliest days of our Nation's founding to today's complex challenges,  Army soldiers have defended our freedoms, upheld our values, and  protected the American people with unwavering courage.

This historic anniversary reminds us of the countless sacrifices made  by generations of men and women in uniform, those who have answered the  call to serve, often at great personal cost.

On this special occasion, we honor their legacy of dedication and  resilience that continues to inspire all of us. To the brave soldiers,  past and present, I thank them for their service.

Happy 250th birthday, U.S. Army.                        Congratulating Dr. Anjan Bose

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, as a proud alumnus of Washington State  University, I rise today to celebrate a tremendous achievement that  brings national recognition to our State and to one of our leading  institutions of higher learning.

Please join me in congratulating Regents Professor Anjan Bose of WSU  for receiving the prestigious IEEE Power and Energy Society's Lifetime  Achievement Award.

This is one of the highest honors in the field and a testament to Dr.  Bose's groundbreaking work in power grid automation, control, and  education. His research not only shaped the future of global energy  systems but has also inspired and educated generations of engineers in  eastern Washington and beyond.

We are fortunate to have such world-class expertise in our region,  and this award is a proud moment for WSU and our entire State.

I congratulate Dr. Bose. As always, Go Cougs.
