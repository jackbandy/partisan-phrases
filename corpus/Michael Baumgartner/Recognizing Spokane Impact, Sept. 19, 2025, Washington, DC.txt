Recognizing Spokane Impact


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695809/recognizing-spokane-impact


Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize an inspiring  moment in our community, the Spokane Impact's first home match this  past Saturday at the HUB Sports Center in Liberty Lake.

The Spokane Impact is one of the founding teams of the Inspire Soccer  League, the first-ever national soccer league created specifically for  athletes with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

Launched by Project Inspire, this league is about more than just  soccer. It is about bringing people together from all walks of life and  making sure that everyone has a chance to experience the joy and  connection of sports.

Too often, athletes with special needs are left without access to the  kinds of opportunities so many take for granted, which is real teams,  real competition, and real crowds cheering them on.

This is an exciting new effort. There is so much going on with soccer  in Spokane and across the country with the launch of our USL team and  the coming World Cup. I am so proud that this has taken place.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to give a special shout-out to the team's  manager, Anna McCoy, who is doing a wonderful job in her new role.
