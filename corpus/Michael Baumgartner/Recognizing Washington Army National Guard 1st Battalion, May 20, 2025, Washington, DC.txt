Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to mark Memorial Day, a  time to honor those who gave their lives in defense of our country, I  rise today to recognize the enduring service and sacrifice of the  Washington Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 161st Infantry  Regiment.

For nearly 90 years, this unit has called the city of Spokane home.  Once stationed downtown, it now stands watch near the banks of the  Spokane  River at the Readiness Center next to the Spokane Falls Community  College. Yet, its role has never changed: to stand ready in defense of  our Nation and in service to our State.

The 161st Infantry carries a storied legacy. They fought with honor  in the Philippine Insurrection, stood guard along the southern border  during the Pancho Villa raids, and served in France during World War I.  These citizen soldiers served with distinction across the Pacific in  World War II, and deployed multiple times as part of the 81st Brigade  Combat Team during the global war on terrorism. Their battle streamers  reflect the best of American valor and commitment.

Yet, just as importantly, they have answered the call at home,  mobilizing in the face of wildfires; floods; snowstorms, and most  recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. When Washingtonians needed their help,  the Guard was there.

These are our neighbors, our coworkers, and our sons and daughters.  For generations, they have trained and deployed from Spokane, not just  for war but for peace, safety, and recovery.

On this Memorial Day, we thank them. We remember those who laid down  their lives in uniform, and we honor the Spokane Readiness Center as a  pillar of strength in both our Nation's defense and our local  community.

May their legacy never be forgotten, and may our gratitude be as  enduring as their service.              Honoring the Holstine Family and Heroes Homestead

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Heroes  Homestead, a grassroots nonprofit founded by marine veteran Andrew  Holstine and his wife, Danielle.

My family and I recently participated in their annual 5K walk in  Spokane. This wasn't only a walk; it was a community coming together to  honor service, support healing, and walk alongside veteran families who  have borne the burden of war long after coming home.

Andrew served in the Marines and survived a tragic Osprey crash in  2000 that claimed the lives of 19 fellow marines, including his best  friends. The invisible wounds he carried didn't just affect him, but  they impacted his whole family. After years of struggle, the Holstines  left everything behind to create something new: a place for veterans  and their families to heal together.

Heroes Homestead was born from that journey. The 5K and the community  fair was part of a growing movement to restore purpose, connection, and  joy to those who have served and those who stood by those who have  served.

They have a national vision: healing centers near every U.S. military  hub.

Mr. Speaker, I commend the Holstines and all who participated in the  5K. This is what serving veterans looks like.
