Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the PARTNER Act, a  forward-looking measure that strengthens America's ties with the  international organizations shaping the global order at a moment when  international competition is sharper than ever.

This legislation gives our Nation the ability to fully engage with  influential regional and international bodies such as the Association  of Southeast Asian Nations, the European Organization for Nuclear  Research, the Pacific Islands Forum, the Caribbean Community, and the  African Union by extending to them the same diplomatic privileges  afforded under the International Organizations Immunities Act.

In doing so, we signal not only respect for their importance but also  our determination to work alongside them as equal partners in tackling  shared challenges.

From advancing security and prosperity to fostering innovation and  confronting global health threats, these organizations are central to  addressing pressing issues that do not stop at our borders.

If the United States is to lead effectively in this century, we  cannot remain on the sidelines. We must be present in the rooms where  decisions are being made, ready to cooperate and ready to lead. This  bill ensures our diplomats and institutions are equipped to do exactly  that.

I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the PARTNER Act  and reaffirming America's commitment to principled and enduring  international leadership.

Mr. BAUMGARTNER.

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. I have no more speakers, Mr. Speaker, and I continue  to reserve the balance of my time until the gentleman yields back his  time.

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Representative  Castro and Representative Kim, for introducing this important bill. I  urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
