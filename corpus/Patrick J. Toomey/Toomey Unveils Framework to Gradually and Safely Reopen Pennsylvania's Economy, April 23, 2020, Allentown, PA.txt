Toomey Unveils Framework to Gradually and Safely Reopen Pennsylvania's Economy


Today, U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), a member of President Trump's bipartisan "Opening Up America Again Congressional Group," released a conceptual framework for gradually and safely reopening Pennsylvania's economy.

Senator Toomey's #PAStartsUpSafely framework provides for a three-phase, county-based approach to reopening Pennsylvania's economy.

"Last night Governor Wolf made public his framework for gradually reopening the state economy beginning on May 8th," said Senator Toomey. "Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, my staff and I have had regular contact with the Governor and his team about several issues, including how we begin the process of returning to normal life.

"The Governor's proposal represents progress and it shares many similarities with my own plan. However, our plans do have several differences; my plan allows for the following:

-With Pennsylvania's health care systems not being overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients, most of state should resume some level of economic activity immediately-Provides counties with the flexibility to account for isolated statistical anomalies-Allows doctors and hospitals to resume elective procedures immediately - provided safety benchmarks are met-Expanded and improved testing for at-risk health care workers, including those in nursing homes

"No one plan will account for all the variables that we must address to open Pennsylvania in a gradual and safe manner. I look forward to working with the Wolf administration on addressing these challenges."
