Toomey Statement on Commerce's Refusal to Release 232 Study


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement regarding Department of Commerce's failure and refusal to follow the law and release its section 232 "national security" study on imported automobiles to Congress:

"By refusing to make public the statutorily-required report on automobile tariffs, the Department of Commerce is willfully violating federal law," said Senator Toomey. "This is unacceptable, and my staff and I are evaluating the potential for corrective action to compel the rightful release of this report."

As part of the appropriations package that Congress approved and the president signed into law at the end of last year, Commerce was required to release the section 232 study on imported automobiles by Sunday, January 19, 2020.
