Toomey Statement on COVID-19


Pennsylvanians should take COVID-19 seriously and follow guidelines from public health officials to maintain social distance and stay healthy. Federal lawmakers in both parties are working together to address the crisis, and have already passed two bipartisan measures to expand testing capacity, slow the spread of the virus, and provide some peace of mind to displaced workers. In the coming days, I will review closely details of any broader stimulus legislation or economic measure meant to alleviate the epidemic's financial burden on American families, workers, and employers both small and large.
