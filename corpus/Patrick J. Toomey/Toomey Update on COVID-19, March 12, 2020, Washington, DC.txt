Toomey Update on COVID-19


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement regarding his office procedures in light of the developing COVID-19 situation:

"The COVID-19 virus poses a significant threat to public health. The Senate Sergeant at Arms made the tough, but right, decision to close Senate offices to the public. Out of an abundance of caution, most of my Washington D.C. staff will telework beginning tomorrow. My seven state offices will remain open, for the time being, but will not be accepting walk-in visitors or participating in large, public events.

"I will continue my efforts to help Pennsylvania hospitals, health care providers, and state and local officials expand our testing capacity and address other concerns. The state, Montgomery County, and Philadelphia governments have taken prudent steps that I hope will limit community spread.

"I urge all Pennsylvanians to follow the advice of the experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: wash your hands often, avoid close contact with people who are sick, stay home if you are sick, if you cough or sneeze, cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or the inside of your elbow, wear a facemask if you are sick or taking care of a sick person, and clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily."
