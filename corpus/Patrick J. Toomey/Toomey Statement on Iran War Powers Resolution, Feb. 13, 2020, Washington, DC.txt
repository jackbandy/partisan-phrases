Toomey Statement on Iran War Powers Resolution


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement after voting against the Iran War Powers Resolution:

"Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world. President Trump was right to take decisive action recently to hold Iran accountable and restore deterrence, the result of which has led to a de-escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran. As we are not currently engaged in hostilities with Iran, the War Powers Resolution is both unnecessary and unhelpful. Further, its enactment would limit the president's ability as commander-in-chief to defend our troops and diplomats abroad as necessary."
