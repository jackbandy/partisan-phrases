Toomey Statement on Trump's 2021 Budget Proposal


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) released the following statement regarding President Trump's 2021 budget proposal:

"Our government is on an unsustainable spending path. Since 2014, overall spending has increased by nearly a trillion dollars and our big entitlement programs remain on a crash course with insolvency. For that reason, I appreciate that President Trump's proposal includes $4.6 trillion in savings over the next decade. With unemployment at near historic lows, the president is right to slow the growth rates of, and tighten eligibility requirements for, the various welfare programs. Furthermore, the entire 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act should be made permanent in order to continue fueling a booming economy. The president's budget takes a constructive step in that direction.

"The most important responsibility for a president is to keep the American people safe. Continuing efforts to rebuild the military and increase security at the southern border are necessary parts of accomplishing this.

"Finally, this budget proposal serves only to outline the priorities of the administration and does not carry the weight of law. The ultimate responsibility for passing a budget and funding the government rests with Congress."
