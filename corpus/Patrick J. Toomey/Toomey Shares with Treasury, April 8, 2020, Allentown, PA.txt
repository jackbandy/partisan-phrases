Toomey Shares with Treasury, SBA Ideas to Improve Paycheck Protection Program


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) is sharing with the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Small Business Administration (SBA) improvements and concerns he has heard about the Paycheck Protection Program from Pennsylvanians.

In a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza, Senator Toomey said:

"I first want to thank you both and your staff for your tireless effort under difficult circumstances. Over the past several days, I have been in constant communication with banks, credit unions, and potential borrowers from Pennsylvania to receive direct feedback about the program's performance. As can be expected with the launch of a massive new program, Pennsylvania lenders have raised critical issues about the PPP."

The concerns relayed to Treasury and the SBA relate to technological issues, difficulties for lenders to serve every eligible customer, confusion about required documentation, the speedy release of Economic Injury Disaster Loans, and other issues.
