Toomey, Van Hollen Issue Statement on Beijing's Action to Tighten Grip on Hong Kong


U.S. Senators Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) issued the following statement on the Chinese Communist Party advancing a new "national security" law for Hong Kong:

"The authoritarian steps taken by the Chinese Communist Party serve one purpose: to extinguish the autonomy and freedoms of Hongkongers.

"The United States stands with the people of Hong Kong who are fighting for their basic rights, including economic freedom, a vibrant free press, an independent judiciary, and a representative system of government. The administration should use its existing sanction power to punish those directly undermining Hong Kong's freedoms. And when the Senate returns to Washington next week, we intend to push forward with our bipartisan bill to require stronger penalties on the perpetrators of these abuses and the financial institutions that enable them."

Senators Toomey and Van Hollen recently introduced the Hong Kong Autonomy Act - bipartisan legislation to help defend Hong Kong against increasingly brazen interference from the Chinese Communist Party.
