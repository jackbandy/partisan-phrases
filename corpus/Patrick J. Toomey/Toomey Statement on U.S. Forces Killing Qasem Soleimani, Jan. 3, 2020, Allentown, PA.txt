Toomey Statement on U.S. Forces Killing Qasem Soleimani


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement in reaction to American forces killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization:

"Qasem Soleimani was responsible for the murder of hundreds of Americans. The world is a better place now that he is dead. Every American should be grateful to our armed forces who carried out this strike with incredible skill and precision. The Trump administration was right to restore deterrence against Iran."
