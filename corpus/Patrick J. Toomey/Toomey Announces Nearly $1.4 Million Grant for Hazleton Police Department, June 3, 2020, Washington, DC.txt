Toomey Announces Nearly $1.4 Million Grant for Hazleton Police Department


Today, U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) announced the Hazleton Police Department has been awarded nearly $1.4 million through the U.S. Department of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Hiring Program. The awarded funds will be used to hire four additional officers.

"Law enforcement agencies across the country are facing unprecedented challenges in the face of lawless rioting and looting," said Senator Toomey. "Pennsylvania's law enforcement officers are hardworking and honorable individuals who deserve our support and gratitude. The funds awarded by the U.S. Department of Justice allow the Hazleton Police Department to bolster its force by hiring four additional officers. I was happy to write a letter in support of the Hazleton Police Department's application for these funds and thank Attorney General Barr for providing this grant."

The COPS Hiring Program awards funds to local law enforcement agencies to help with reducing crime and advancing public safety through community policing.
