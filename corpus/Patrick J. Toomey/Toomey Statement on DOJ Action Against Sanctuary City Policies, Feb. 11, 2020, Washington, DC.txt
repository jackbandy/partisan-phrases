Toomey Statement on DOJ Action Against Sanctuary City Policies


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement after U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr announced the Department of Justice is stepping up its fight against sanctuary city policies:

"For the past five years, I have fought to end sanctuary city policies that endanger the public. The fact is that these policies, like the ones in Philadelphia, San Francisco, and other areas across the country, make it harder to keep dangerous criminals off the streets. President Trump was right to shine a light on the threat sanctuary city policies pose as part of his State of the Union address and I wholeheartedly applaud Attorney General Barr and the Department of Justice for taking further legal actions to combat them. It's past time for Congress to do its part and pass my Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities legislation, which would help put an end to sanctuary city policies."
