Toomey Roundtable Focuses on Strategies to Safely Reopen Economy


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care, convened a virtual roundtable today focusing on the issue of safely reopening the American economy.

"Massive government spending is no substitute for an economy. In fact, all of government necessarily depends on having an economy," said Senator Toomey during the virtual roundtable. "And so, endless government spending is just not sustainable. And that brings us to why we're here today. The purpose of this roundtable is to discuss the importance of, and strategies for, reopening the American economy in a gradual, safe manner that emphasizes protection for the truly vulnerable populations."

Senator Toomey was joined by his colleagues Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio). An expert panel provided opinions and answered questions from the senators. Members of that panel were:
