Toomey Statement on Coronavirus Developments


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement on reports of coronavirus cases in Pennsylvania and his ongoing work to increase testing capacity:

"I wish a speedy recovery to those who have contracted the coronavirus and I thank the health care professionals working to make sure this happens. I urge Pennsylvanians to follow the CDC's recommendations on how to reduce the spread of any virus, whether it be the flu or the coronavirus. That means washing your hands regularly, avoid touching your face, and stay away from school or work if you show symptoms.

"Congress has approved more than $8 billion in funding to respond to the coronavirus in the United States. The administration has also taken steps to facilitate more testing. My staff and I have been working continuously to help Pennsylvania hospitals obtain from the FDA, NIH, CMS, and the CDC all the materials they need to develop and administer tests to Pennsylvanians."
