Toomey Statement on Senate Impeachment Trial


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement regarding the opening of the Senate's impeachment trial of President Trump.

"The impeachment of any president is an extraordinary event and I take my role in the Senate process very seriously," said Senator Toomey. "The Senate should conduct a fair trial consistent with past precedent. We will allow House managers to make their case, the President's lawyers to make their defense, and senators to pose questions. At the conclusion of these presentations, the Senate can then decide what, if any, further steps are necessary."
