Toomey Announces $250,000 Grant for Johnstown Police Department


Today, U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) announced the Johnstown Police Department has been awarded $250,000 through the U.S. Department of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Hiring Program. The awarded funds will be used to hire two additional officers.

"Law enforcement agencies across the country are facing unprecedented challenges in the face of lawless rioting and looting," said Senator Toomey. "Pennsylvania's law enforcement officers are hardworking and honorable individuals who deserve our support and gratitude. The funds awarded by the U.S. Department of Justice allow the Johnstown Police Department to bolster its force by hiring two additional officers. I was happy to write a letter in support of the Johnstown Police Department's application for these funds and thank Attorney General Barr for providing this grant."

The COPS Hiring Program awards funds to local law enforcement agencies to help with reducing crime and advancing public safety through community policing.
