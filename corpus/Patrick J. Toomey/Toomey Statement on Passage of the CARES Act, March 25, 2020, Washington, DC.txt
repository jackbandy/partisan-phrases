Toomey Statement on Passage of the CARES Act


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement regarding Senate passage of the CARES Act - phase three of the congressional response to the coronavirus crisis:

"A lethal pathogen has invaded our country, killing hundreds and making tens of thousands ill. In an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus, employers across the country, including in Pennsylvania, have been forced to close. Our economy is shutting down and millions of Americans are unable to work, travel, or simply enjoy common aspects of life.

"For financially-stressed families and workers who are furloughed or laid off, the CARES Act delivers direct payments and expanded unemployment benefits. The CARES Act aims to keep this economic contraction from becoming a full-blown depression through crucial lending programs for businesses - small and large - so they can survive an extended period with little or no revenue.

"This bill will also help America forcefully combat this unprecedented public health crisis. It gives billions of dollars in aid for hospitals treating the sick, researchers developing a vaccine, and healthcare workers and first responders on the front line of this fight.

"The CARES Act is far from perfect. Unfortunately, it contains policies that waste taxpayer money and others that create unhelpful incentives. Nevertheless, this bill will do much more good than harm. This crisis demands this action and the Senate delivered. I hope the House moves quickly to pass it and send it to the President for his signature."
