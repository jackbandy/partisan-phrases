U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) announced today that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is making over $3 million available to Pennsylvania to assist in efforts to combat COVID-19.

The CARES Act authorized an additional $100 million to FEMA's Emergency Management Performance Grant Program (EMPG). Through this grant program, FEMA will award funding to support planning and operational readiness for COVID-19 preparedness and response; development of tools and strategies for prevention, preparedness, and response; and ongoing communication and coordination among federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial partners throughout the response.
