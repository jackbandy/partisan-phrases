Toomey Statement on Coronavirus and Supplemental Funding


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement on the coronavirus and the supplemental funding measure:

"Expanding our capacity to test for the coronavirus on a large scale is my priority right now. I have been in contact with the FDA, CMS, and the CDC in order to ensure that Pennsylvania's hospitals are able to administer all the coronavirus tests that Pennsylvanians need.

"Congress is very likely to approve supplemental funding this week to provide states, local governments, and health care professionals the resources needed to respond to the virus. I intend to support this measure."
