Toomey Endorses "Masks4All" Movement in Fight Against COVID-19


As the fight to combat COVID-19 continues, U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) is urging Pennsylvanians to cover their mouths and noses when they must venture out of their homes.

In a video Senator Toomey posted to social media last night, Senator Toomey detailed his support for the"Masks4All" movement.

"I would encourage people to make sure if you're going outside, cover up. Cover your nose and mouth. My mask will keep someone else safe and their mask will keep me safe. I'm not suggesting that this is any kind of guarantee and it probably doesn't have tremendous value for the person wearing the mask. But it probably does significantly reduce the risk that people could inadvertently transmit it."

Senator Toomey also notes that people should follow Governor Wolf's order of staying home as much as possible and that N95 masks should be reserved for health care workers and emergency responders. Finally, Senator Toomey stresses that wearing a homemade mask or facial cover when you venture out is not about protecting yourself, rather it is about protecting those around you.
