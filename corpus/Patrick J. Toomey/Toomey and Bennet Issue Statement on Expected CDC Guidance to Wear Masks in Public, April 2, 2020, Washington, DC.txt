Toomey and Bennet Issue Statement on Expected CDC Guidance to Wear Masks in Public


U.S. Senators Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) issued the following statement on the news that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) is expected to update its guidance to encourage Americans to wear cloth masks in public:

"The CDC is right to clarify its guidance to encourage Americans to wear cloth masks when they must venture out of their homes, even if they are not exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19. We appreciate the President, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield, and his team at the CDC working with us on this issue.

"Wearing a cloth mask is not a substitute for staying home and regularly washing our hands, but it is an important complement. By wearing a cloth mask when in public, we will limit transmission of the virus, which can be spread through saliva emitted via cough, sneeze, or even when speaking and breathing. Put simply, my mask protects you, and your mask protects me.

"To be clear, N95 or surgical masks should be reserved for front-line health care workers. We implore all Americans, when you leave your house, cover up with a cloth mask or any sort of facial barrier like a scarf or a bandanna."
