Toomey Statement on Vote Opposing USMCA


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement following his vote in opposition to the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA):

"For the first time in American history, we're enacting a trade agreement that restricts free trade and reduces economic growth. Unlike its predecessor NAFTA, USMCA contains many protectionist provisions that are designed to reduce the exchange of goods between the United States and Mexico. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, USMCA raises tariffs, which are taxes, by $3 billion. This means higher prices - particularly on automobiles - for American consumers. Outside of a few necessary modernizations and modest market access improvements for Pennsylvania's dairy farmers, USMCA is a step backwards and I could not support its passage."

Last month, Senator Toomey laid out his concerns about USMCA in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal
