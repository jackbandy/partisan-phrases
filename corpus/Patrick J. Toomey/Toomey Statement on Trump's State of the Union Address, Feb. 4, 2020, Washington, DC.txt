Toomey Statement on Trump's State of the Union Address


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement in reaction to President Trump's State of the Union address:

"President Trump's State of the Union address highlighted the great strides our nation has made over the past three years and set an optimistic and ambitious agenda for the future.

"The economy is the best it has been in my adult life. President Trump deserves a lot of credit for advancing pro-growth policies that have led to near record low unemployment, bigger paychecks for blue-collar workers, and U.S. companies bringing $1 trillion back from overseas.

"For five years, I have fought to end dangerous sanctuary city policies. I appreciate that President Trump continues to make our work to accomplish this a priority. Congress should pass my Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities legislation to help put an end to sanctuary city policies once and for all.

"President Trump was also right to discuss the need to expand school choice. Every child in our country deserves a high-quality education, regardless of zip code or income level. Right now, the school choice movement is facing unprecedented opposition in Pennsylvania. I'm glad Stephanie and Janiyah Davis from Philadelphia were in the chamber tonight to put a face to the problems facing Pennsylvania families who want to escape failing schools.

"Finally, President Trump has inarguably made our country safer. The administration deserves praise for taking out two of the world's most dangerous terrorists and holding Iran to account for its hostile actions."
