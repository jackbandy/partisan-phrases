Toomey Statement on CMS's New Optional Medicaid Block Grant Proposal


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) released the following statement on the new flexibilities granted to states through the Healthy Adult Opportunity policy from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS):

"Medicaid is growing at a rate that far outpaces our economy. The program consumes nearly 30 percent of state budgets. The Trump administration's proposal to give states more flexibility is a step in the right direction, but significant work remains to make this safety net program fiscally sustainable."
