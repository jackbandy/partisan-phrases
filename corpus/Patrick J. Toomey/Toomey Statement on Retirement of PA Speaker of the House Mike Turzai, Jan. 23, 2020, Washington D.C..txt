Toomey Statement on Retirement of PA Speaker of the House Mike Turzai


U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement regarding Pennsylvania Speaker of the House Mike Turzai's decision to retire:

"Speaker Mike Turzai served his district and the commonwealth with distinction and integrity for nearly two decades. Mike's dogged support for Pennsylvania's burgeoning energy sector has helped grow our state economy and created good paying jobs for thousands of people. Further, his work on the Educational Improvement Tax Credit has led to millions of dollars in scholarships for lower-income children so they are able to attend the school of their choice. I thank Mike for his service to Pennsylvania and wish him and his family nothing but the best."
