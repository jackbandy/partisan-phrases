Unesco


Mr. WELCH. Mr. President, of all the uninformed, ill-conceived, and  self-inflicted errors of this administration, the just-announced  decision to withdraw from UNESCO stands out.

The justification given by the State Department spokeswoman was a  recitation of outdated, vague, and inaccurate criticisms of an  organization that has seen dramatic reforms over the past 7 years under  the outstanding leadership of Director General Audrey Azoulay. Since  her initial appointment in 2017, Director General Azoulay has made  numerous trips to Washington to meet with leaders in the Congress and  the administration. I have heard consistently positive reactions to her  leadership of UNESCO by Republicans and Democrats alike, including  regarding UNESCO's efforts to address anti-semitism.

Given Director General Azoulay's success in focusing UNESCO on its  mission of promoting international cooperation and peace in a manner  consistent with democratic values and human rights and dignity, one can  only conclude that the administration officials behind this short- sighted decision never bothered to do their homework--or they were  guided purely by Project 2025's mindless opposition to multilateralism,  regardless of the facts. As far as I am aware, they did not bother to  consult anyone in Congress, including those who have regularly engaged  with Director General Azoulay and her professional staff.

Most Republicans and Democrats have long recognized that it is far  better for the United States to be in the room, rather than remain  outside and cede our influence to those who don't share our interests  or values. The Chinese Government is looking for any opportunity to  expand its influence in the United Nations, and UNESCO is no exception.  We rejoined UNESCO in 2023 after a 5-year absence, and now, we are  withdrawing again. It sends a terrible message that the United States  can no longer be counted on. It is a message the Chinese will applaud.
