Mr. WELCH. Mr. President, I join with Vermonters in celebrating the  exceptional Vermont athletes who represented the United States at the  2026 Winter Olympic Games. Our State's athletes competed with great  distinction, earning seven medals. The State of Vermont has a proud  tradition of producing world-class athletes, and the 2026 Games were a  powerful testament to that legacy.

Athletes with Vermont roots and connections won seven medals at the  games, representing more than 20 percent of all medals earned by Team  USA. Vermont's contribution to American Olympic success this year was  historic by any measure.

Across alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, and freestyle  disciplines, Vermont athletes competed at the highest level and  delivered performances that will be remembered for years to come. These  achievements did not happen overnight. They are the result of years of  rigorous training, personal sacrifice, and an unrelenting commitment to  excellence--supported by the world-class coaches and ski schools and  training programs that Vermont has long been proud to call its own.

I congratulate Ben Ogden, Ryan Cochran-Siegle, Mac Forehand, Jessie  Diggins, Paula Moltzan, and Mikaela Shiffrin for medaling. I also  applaud Julia Kern, Jess Perlmutter, Jack Young, Sean Doherty, Margie  Freed, Maxime Germain, Olivia Giaccio, Deedra Irwin, Lauren Jortberg,  and Nina O'Brien for competing and making Vermont proud.

The Winter Games are a reminder of why our winter sports and outdoor  recreation communities are so vital to the identity and economy of our  State. Vermont's ski areas, trails, and training programs are not only  excellent athletic institutions, but they are also the reason  generations of young Vermonters have grown up with a love of the  outdoors.

We are deeply proud of all our Vermont athletes have achieved, and we  wish them continued success as they pursue the next chapters of their  athletic careers and beyond. Their accomplishments will inspire young  skiers and outdoor enthusiasts across Vermont for generations to come  and serve as a lasting reminder of what is possible when talent and the  spirit of the Green Mountains come together on the world's greatest  stage.
