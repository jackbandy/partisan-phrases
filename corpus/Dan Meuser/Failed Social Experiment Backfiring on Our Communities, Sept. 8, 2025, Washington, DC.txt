Failed Social Experiment Backfiring on Our Communities


Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise today in regard to the latest  stabbing on the Charlotte Area Transit System of Iryna Zarutska. It is  just the latest awful example of what has gone wrong with our criminal  justice system.

Mr. Speaker, today, I felt compelled to tell my daughters to be  careful.

This suspect had been arrested 14 times, including for violent  offenses. Despite this record, mental health issues, and skipping bond,  a Democrat judge--happened to be Democrat--released him back into the  streets after his arrest in January.

Police do their jobs, but ideological prosecutors and judges refuse  to do theirs.

This is not justice. It is a failed social experiment backfiring on  our communities. We see it time and time again.

In D.C., police recently arrested a carjacking suspect who laughed in  their faces saying: I have been in the D.C. jail six times for this  warrant. I will be out tomorrow because the victims never show up. That  is the mentality of this broken system, and it emboldens criminals.

President Trump is proving there is another way, using all the  resources available to protect innocent people.

Mr. Speaker, we need to support these efforts. We need to bring law  and order to our streets. The American people deserve protection, not  excuses.
