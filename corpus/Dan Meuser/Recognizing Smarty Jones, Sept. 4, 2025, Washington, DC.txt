Recognizing Smarty Jones

Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, although I am originally from Babylon, New  York, like a few in the gallery today, Pennsylvania is home to a  champion horse known as Smarty Jones.

I rise today to celebrate one of the great horses our Commonwealth  has ever produced. Born and bred at Roy and Patricia Chapman's Someday  Farm in Chester County, Smarty Jones was not just a racehorse. He was a  Pennsylvania champion horse.

In 2004, he captivated the Nation, winning the Kentucky Derby and the  Preakness Stakes, and coming within a single length of the Triple Crown  at the Belmont Stakes.

Last month, Smarty Jones was inducted into the National Museum of  Racing Hall of Fame.

Today, thanks to Rodney and Sharon Eckenrode, he continues to stand  at Equistar Training and Breeding Center in Lebanon County.

I look forward to visiting Smarty this weekend for an event my good  friend Chairman G.T. Thompson is hosting.

Smarty's story is proof that when you are Pennsylvania-bred, you are  built to win.
