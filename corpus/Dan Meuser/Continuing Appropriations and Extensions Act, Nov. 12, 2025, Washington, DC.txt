Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Cole for his leadership.

Mr. Speaker, if this were a library, we would have the fiction side  over there and the nonfiction side over here. The only thing that is  not fiction, however, is their consistent criticism of the healthcare  system known as ObamaCare that they created. That is what this fight  seems to be about, and that is the one end of things that is truthful.

Today, Mr. Speaker, after 6 weeks of lots of pain and no gain, they  are going to vote again to keep the government closed. They are going  to vote again--they are whipping their votes--so they would not be  paying Federal workers and won't be funding essential programs like  SNAP and undoing the chaos at our airports.

I spent the last 43 days in my district talking with these groups,  talking with SNAP, talking with Head Start, seeing their pain,  realizing it, understanding it. Some of my colleagues did the same,  but, shockingly, they are still going to vote to keep the government  closed and keep this funding from being delivered.

It is time to fix the damage that Democrats have caused. With this  vote tonight, Republicans will restore SNAP payments and get TSA, air  traffic controllers, and Federal workers paid.

Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the additional  time.

You know what, Mr. Speaker, yesterday was Veterans Day. Veterans  didn't fight for the red. They didn't fight for the blue. They fought  for the red, white, and blue. Maybe tonight we can follow their  example.
