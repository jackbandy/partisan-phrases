Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank our chairman, Chairman Williams, for  his continued leadership.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my colleague, Democratic Member  Mrs. McIver, in support of my bill, H.R. 1804, the 7(a) Loan Agent  Oversight Act, which provides the Small Business Administration with  the oversight capabilities to monitor its flagship loan program  responsibly. This bipartisan legislation requires the SBA Office of  Credit Risk Management to report on fraudulent loans made by a loan  agent as well as the overall default rate on loans issued by those  agents.

Loan agents are often the middlemen between the SBA, a 7(a) lender,  and a small business. This legislation is necessary due to the  increased role of loan agents in facilitating 7(a) loans to American  small businesses.

The SBA inspector general reported that nearly one out of every seven  loans involved a loan agent. Unfortunately, the inspector general also  noted that there has been over $335 million in documented loan agent  fraud. This, of course, needs to be corrected and changed, Mr. Speaker.

Additionally, my legislation requires the SBA to submit their  findings to Congress, which allows us to conduct proper oversight of  the 7(a) loan program, ensuring it remains a successful public-private  partnership that helps small businesses thrive.

Though Administrator Loeffler is bringing a lot to this office and  has reined in the Biden administration's weakening, frankly, of  underwriting  standards in the 7(a) program, this bill advances good governance  policies that will protect taxpayer dollars and uphold the program's  record of success well beyond the next 4 years.

Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of my bill.
