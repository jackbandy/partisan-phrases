Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman McClain for her  leadership.

Mr. Speaker, during President Trump's first term, we had progrowth  policies, a progrowth economy, and tax revenue growth. Even after  COVID, the Biden administration accelerated the deficit with unchecked  spending, causing the deficit to double, which increased service on the  debt from $400 billion in 2019 to nearly $1 trillion last year. That is  why this package takes steps to rein in irresponsible agencies. Some  have been taken over by ideologues doing things that are simply not in  the interest of the American people.

Maybe USAID has done some good things, but they have also done many  things that were totally inappropriate. Agencies like this need to be  defunded or reformed. The American people aren't going to put up with  it anymore.

To that end, why is the government still funding public television  and radio when most people have hundreds of channels to get their news  and information from and when these stations are some of the most  partisan stations out there? Can you imagine, as was stated earlier, if  a conservative station was funded? The left would have screamed,  vilified, and exterminated it a long while ago.

Mr. Speaker, let's pass this rescissions package, codify President  Trump's spending reductions into law, and save our country along the  way.
