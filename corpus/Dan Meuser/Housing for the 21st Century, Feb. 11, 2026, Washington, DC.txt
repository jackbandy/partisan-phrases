Housing for the 21st Century

Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Housing for the  21st Century Act, introduced by Chairman Hill and Subcommittee on  Housing and Insurance Chairman Flood, which passed the House with  overwhelming bipartisan support.

Housing affordability is a supply problem, and for too long, Federal  policy has made it slow and expensive to build new homes.

President Trump and Secretary Scott Turner advanced housing reforms  that  cut blue tape, expanded supply, lowered the price of lumber, and  brought mortgage rates below 6 percent.

This legislation builds on that progress by removing Federal barriers  so homes can be built faster and economically at scale without new  Federal spending.

Today, it can cost over $100,000 before a shovel ever hits the dirt  to build a new home, and builders often cannot build a home for less  than $250,000. This bill modernizes housing laws, improves coordination  between HUD and USDA, expands manufactured housing in rural  communities, reduces barriers for veterans, and increases access to  small-dollar mortgages.

Mr. Speaker, I was very pleased to support this important  legislation.
