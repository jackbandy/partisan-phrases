Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for his  leadership.

Mr. Speaker, in order for us to deliver one big, beautiful  reconciliation bill, one that extends the provisions of the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act, reins in regulations of wasteful spending, unleashes  American energy, secures the border, curbs inflation, and restores  American growth and competitiveness, we first must pass the budget  resolution.

This resolution, Mr. Speaker, is no more than a bridge to  reconciliation and to the golden era of the American economy. Frankly,  what that bridge is made of really makes no difference, so long as we  cross it. Delaying this vote in a symbolic protest only weakens our  ability to act.

Every day we wait, we put our economy, our national security, and our  momentum at risk.

The American people voted for bold action, Mr. Speaker, and President  Trump and we in Congress intend to deliver.

The reconciliation process begins with this resolution. Let's not  protest the bridge that gets us there. Let's cross it and achieve the  results the American people expect from the Republican majority.

Let's pass this and deliver a new golden age in America.
