Never Forget September 11

Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, on this solemn anniversary, we reaffirm our  vow to never forget September 11. That morning began like any other. I  had just dropped my daughter off at school on a clear, beautiful day  across the northeast.

Within hours, our lives were forever changed as we watched in horror  as planes struck the Twin Towers, learned of the attack on the  Pentagon, and witnessed the extraordinary heroism in Shanksville, where  ordinary Americans made the ultimate sacrifice to prevent another  attack.

In the days that followed, I traveled to Ground Zero, delivering  mobility equipment requested by the NYPD--not for the injured, but for  those first responders who had been on their feet for days.

Yet even in that moment of national grief, I will always remember the  New York streets lined with Americans cheering for first responders and  standing together in renewed patriotism.

In President Lincoln's timeless words: ``We . . . resolve that these  dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation, under God, shall  have a new birth of freedom . . .''

May our Nation always endure, producing patriots like the late  Charlie Kirk whose legacy reminds us that America will thrive and never  perish from the Earth.
