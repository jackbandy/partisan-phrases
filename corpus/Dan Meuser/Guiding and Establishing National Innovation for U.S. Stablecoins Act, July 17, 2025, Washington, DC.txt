Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act


Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 1582,  the GENIUS Act. I thank the chairman of our full Financial Services  Committee, Chairman Hill, for his leadership; Chairman Steil for his  great work; Whip Emmer, and so many in our committee and our colleagues  in the Senate for their work on this legislation.

I also recognize President Trump's administration, crypto czar David  Sacks, and SEC Chair Paul Atkins for  their efforts to reverse the Biden-era irrational opposition and  misguided regulations that we lived with for 4 years toward innovation  and now we are setting America back on a progrowth America First  course.

Mr. Speaker, the Senate's legislation built on 2 years of groundwork  by the House, crafting a framework for stablecoins that protects  consumers, the dollar, and unleashes private-sector innovation. This  bill achieves three goals. It supports the dollar's role as the world's  reserve currency. It provides a private-sector alternative to a  government-run digital dollar which is very important, and it  modernizes payments to reduce costs and expand access. This is smart,  forward-looking policy.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it.
