Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the remarkable  life and service of Richard ``Dick'' Young, a lifelong member of the  Lancaster, New York community, who recently passed away at the age of  94.

Dick was a proud graduate of Lancaster High School, Class of 1948,  where he served as class president and remained dedicated to keeping  his classmates connected for decades. In fact, those remaining from his  class gathered in 2023 to celebrate their 75th reunion--an  extraordinary milestone.

Following graduation, Dick answered the call to serve his country by  joining the United States Navy. From 1948 to 1949, he served aboard the  USS Buck 761 Destroyer, supporting efforts during the Chinese  Revolution. After his initial service, he enrolled at Marietta College,  but when the Korean War broke out, he was called back to duty--this  time serving as a ship-fitter on the USS Marsh DE699 from 1950 to 1952.  In recognition of his dedicated service, Dick was honored in 2019  through the Honor Flight to Washington.

Dick returned home to join the family business. His father, Lester  Young, had founded the Young Fire Equipment Corporation in 1944, and by  the time Dick completed his military service, he was destined to lead  the company. As President, he relocated it to 204 Cemetery Road in  Lancaster, where his Navy-honed skills and forward-thinking mindset  revolutionized the fire apparatus industry. He designed firetrucks that  were decades ahead of their time--earning a reputation for building the  ``Cadillac of Firetrucks.''

Though Young Fire closed in 1991, Dick's passion for innovation never  waned. In 1993, he launched the Performance Advantage Company in  Lancaster, which continues to design and distribute tool and equipment  mounting solutions for the fire service, military, and other industries  in over 38 countries.

In 2007, Dick established the Greater Lancaster Museum of  Firefighting, located next to his business. The museum showcases  historic firefighting artifacts, including those from local departments  and even pieces from the 9/11 Towers. It stands as a tribute to  volunteerism, which Dick regarded as the backbone of strong  communities. He often said, ``Communities cannot function without the  selfless sacrifices that volunteers contribute. We've got to encourage  more volunteers.''

Dick also served his community as an elected member of the Lancaster  Village Board, where he played a key role in uniting the Village and  Town to address critical infrastructure needs, including improvements  to the sewer system.

Mr. Speaker, Dick Young leaves behind a legacy of service,  innovation, and unwavering dedication to his community and country. His  accomplishments, generosity, and leadership set a gold standard that  will continue to inspire generations to come. May he rest in peace.
