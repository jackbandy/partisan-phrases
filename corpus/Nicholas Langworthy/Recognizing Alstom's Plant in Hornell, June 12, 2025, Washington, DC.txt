Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a major  milestone for American manufacturing for New York's southern tier.

Alstom, a global leader in smart and sustainable mobility, has opened  its new, cutting-edge plant 4 facility in Hornell, New York.

This 135,000-square-foot expansion brings stainless steel railcar  body production back to the United States, strengthening our domestic  supply chain, and reaffirming Hornell's position as the Nation's  premier center for passenger train manufacturing.

Plant 4 isn't just a facility. It is a symbol of what investment in  American industry looks like. It will retain 390 good-paying jobs  locally and create 258 new ones for families across my district.

These are high-quality, high-tech jobs that provide economic  stability and opportunity for the hardworking people of the southern  tier.

Production will soon begin on 200 multilevel commuter railcars for  Chicago's Metra system, proof that what is built in Hornell rolls  across the Nation.

This project is a powerful example of how we strengthen our economy  by investing in our communities, empowering our workforce, and leading  the way in advanced manufacturing.

I commend Alstom for their continued commitment to Hornell and thank  the skilled men and women who are driving this legacy forward.
