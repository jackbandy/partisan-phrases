Recognizing Randy Moje


Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary dedication and service of Randy Moje, who has devoted 50  years to serving the Town of Pendleton and the Wendelville Volunteer  Fire Company. A second-generation firefighter, Randy has held numerous  leadership positions, including Chief, and has consistently  demonstrated commitment to public safety and the growth of the  Wendelville Volunteer Fire Company.

Randy has been a leader in Fire Prevention, spending many hours with  the Fire Prevention trailer educating the community, and has been an  essential contributor to fundraising events such as chowder-making,  lobster dinners, and the Farmers Breakfast. His dedication extends to  supporting both the operational and social functions that sustain the  Wendelville Volunteer Fire Company.

Randy's experience, leadership, and willingness to serve in any  capacity have inspired generations of firefighters and strengthened the  company's presence in the community.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the United States House of Representatives  join me in honoring Randy Moje for his remarkable 50 years of service  and in wishing him continued success and fulfillment in his ongoing  commitment to the community.
