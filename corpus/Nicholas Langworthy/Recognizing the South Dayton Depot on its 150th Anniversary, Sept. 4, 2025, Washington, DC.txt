Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable  landmark of our history from my hometown of South Dayton. For 150  years, the South Dayton Depot has been a center of connection, culture,  and community spirit. Since its founding in 1875, the South Dayton  Depot has welcomed generations of travelers and neighbors, serving  first as a vital hub for freight and passenger service, and now as a  museum where history is preserved for generations to come.

The South Dayton Depot has not only preserved our community's  railroad heritage, but has also become a gathering place where  neighbors connect and visitors experience the rich story of our region.  From its role in major motion pictures like The Natural and Planes,  Trains and Automobiles, to its continued service through the Movie and  Rail Museum, the South Dayton Depot stands as a living link between our  past and present.

On September 6, 2025, the Village of South Dayton will celebrate the  South Dayton Depot's 150th anniversary with a community celebration  that honors both its historic legacy and its enduring role as the heart  of the village. Thanks to the dedication of local leaders,  volunteers, and preservation groups, the South Dayton Depot continues  to thrive as a source of pride for the entire region.

I ask that the United States House of Representatives join me in  honoring the enduring legacy of the South Dayton Depot and congratulate  them on this important milestone.
