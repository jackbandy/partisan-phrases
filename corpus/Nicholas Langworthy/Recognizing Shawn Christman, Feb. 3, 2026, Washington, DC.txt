Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary dedication and service of Shawn Christman, who has  devoted 25 years to serving the Town of Pendleton and the Wendelville  Volunteer Fire Company. Over the course of his career, Shawn has served  as President and two-time Chief, holding many officer positions while  providing guidance and training to new and current firefighters.

Shawn is a certified State Fire Instructor and has also led community  initiatives, including the Santa Run for Christmas and the Lancaster  Christmas Parade, helping the Wendelville Volunteer Fire Company  achieve  three Overall Championships. He has been instrumental in combining his  leadership with technical expertise to support both the company and the  community.

Shawn's leadership and guidance have strengthened the Wendelville  Volunteer Fire Company and its connection to the community.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the United States House of Representatives  join me in honoring Shawn Christman for his remarkable 25 years of  service and in wishing him continued success and fulfillment in his  ongoing commitment to the community.
