Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate  a proud rural fire department in my district, the Kennedy Fire  Department, which is proudly marking its 100th year of service to its  community and surrounding areas.

Since 1925, the Kennedy Fire Department has stood as a symbol of  courage, commitment, and community. For a full century, generations of  volunteers have answered the call, not for accolades or attention, but  out of a deep and abiding duty to protect their neighbors.

This is a department that doesn't just show up, they step up. Whether  it is a fire within their own town or a neighboring community in need,  Kennedy's volunteers have never hesitated to offer support through  mutual aid. When disaster strikes and the stakes are high, these men  and women grab their gear and get moving, facing flames, chaos, and the  unknown with unshakable resolve.

Their station, nestled on Dailey Hill Road, is home to a well- equipped fleet that reflects their forward-looking mindset. From modern  engines and tankers to EMS response vehicles, Kennedy has made the  investments needed to stay ready, and it shows.

They are more than just emergency responders. They are leaders,  mentors, and hometown heroes. The department is deeply woven into the  fabric of the Kennedy community--organizing events, hosting parades,  educating the public, and building the kind of trust that only comes  from a hundred years of walking the walk.

As the Representative for New York's 23rd District, it is my honor to  recognize this incredible milestone and to thank every past and present  member of the Kennedy Fire Department for their service. Their legacy  is not only one of bravery, but one of relentless dedication to the  people they serve.
