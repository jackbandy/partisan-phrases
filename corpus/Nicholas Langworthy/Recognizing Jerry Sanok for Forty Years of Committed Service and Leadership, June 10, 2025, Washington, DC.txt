Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, for over 40 years, Jerry Sanok has been  a cornerstone of the Republican Party--a principled leader whose  honesty, strategic mind, and dedication have earned him respect across  Alden and beyond. It is only fitting that his hometown now honors a  lifetime of unwavering service.

On June 11th, Jerry will receive the Honorary Lifetime Chairman  Award, and I'm proud to stand with the Alden Republican Committee in  recognizing this well-earned distinction. As Chairman, Jerry has led  winning campaigns, mentored future leaders, and built coalitions that  have delivered victory at every level--from Town Hall to Capitol Hill.  His political instincts are unmatched, and his advice has shaped the  success of candidates and party leaders across New York.

What defines Jerry most, however, is his unwavering loyalty and deep  patriotism. For over four decades, he has worked tirelessly to make his  community, his state, and his country stronger for the generations to  come. In every season--in challenge and in triumph--he has stood firm  in his convictions and committed to the conservative values that unite  us.

It is with great pride and deep gratitude that I join the Alden  Republican Committee in honoring Gerald J. Sanok--for a lifetime of  leadership, patriotism, and service to the Republican cause.
