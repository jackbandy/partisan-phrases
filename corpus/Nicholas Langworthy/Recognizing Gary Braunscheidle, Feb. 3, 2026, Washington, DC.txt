Recognizing Gary Braunscheidle


Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary dedication and service of Gary Braunscheidle, who has  devoted 62 years to serving the Town of Pendleton and the Wendelville  Volunteer Fire Company. Over the course of his long and distinguished  career, Gary has responded to over 200 emergencies in the past year  alone, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to public safety.

Gary has held multiple roles within the company, including Assistant  Chief and company mechanic, and has been a cornerstone of the social  and fundraising efforts that support the Wendelville Volunteer Fire  Company. He has played a vital role in events such as making chowder,  managing the kitchen for the Gun Raffle, assisting with Fire  Prevention, and supporting Company Field Days and the Harvest Moon 5K.

Gary's guidance, leadership, and readiness to help in any capacity  have made him an indispensable member of the Wendelville Volunteer Fire  Company.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the United States House of Representatives  join me in honoring Gary Braunscheidle for his remarkable 62 years of  service and in wishing him continued success and fulfillment in his  ongoing commitment to the community.
