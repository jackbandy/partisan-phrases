Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary dedication and service of Doreen Neilson, who has devoted  60 years to serving the Town of Pendleton and the Wendelville Fire  Company Ladies Auxiliary. Over the course of her long and distinguished  career, Doreen has held numerous leadership and administrative roles,  providing unwavering support to both the firefighters and the  community.

Together with her husband Victor, she helped establish and run the  famous Fish and Chips at the Annual Wendelville Field Days and has  contributed to countless social and fundraising activities that sustain  the Wendelville Volunteer Fire Company. Her dedication has ensured that  the Ladies Auxiliary remains a vital part of the organization and the  community.

Doreen's leadership, experience, and commitment have served as an  example for all members of the Wendelville Volunteer Fire Company and  the broader community.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the United States House of Representatives  join me in honoring Doreen Neilson for her remarkable 60 years of  service and in wishing her continued success and fulfillment in her  ongoing commitment to the community.
