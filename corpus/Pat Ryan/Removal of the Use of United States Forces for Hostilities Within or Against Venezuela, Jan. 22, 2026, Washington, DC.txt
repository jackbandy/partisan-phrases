Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time.

Mr. Speaker, we face a fundamental question here: Who makes the  decision to send our most precious resource, our young men and women in  uniform, into harm's way? Is it a five-time draft dodger who has called  them suckers and losers, or is it the American people with us as their  voices?

Mr. Speaker, I was on the receiving end of this same chicken-hawk bs  for 27 months in combat in Iraq, and I don't need to be lectured by my  colleagues. We all know how that went: thousands of American lives  lost; trillions of dollars spent not on one, but two forever wars over  the last 20-plus years that we should not have started in the first  place; and, most importantly, no honest conversation with the American  people about what would be required, what blood and treasure would be  spilled halfway across the world.

Now, we are seeing it all play out again. History doesn't repeat, but  it certainly rhymes. We in this room had the Secretary of Defense and  the Secretary of State come to Congress before the end of this calendar  year and blatantly lie to our faces and, more importantly, lie to the  American people. Why? Because they know it isn't right or popular.

The last thing, Mr. Speaker, the American people want is another  regime change war, a forever war for oil. I urge my colleagues to  support this resolution and to not repeat history.
