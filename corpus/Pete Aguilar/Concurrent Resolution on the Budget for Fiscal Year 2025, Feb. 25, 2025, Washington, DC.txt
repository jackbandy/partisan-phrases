Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025

Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in  opposition to this Republican budget.

House Democrats came to Congress ready to work with our Republican  colleagues to lower the cost of eggs, take on price gouging, expand the  child tax credit, build more housing, and put the pocketbooks of  working families first. This is what the American people told us was  their top priority, and these are the issues that drive our Caucus.

Instead, Madam Chair, they have turned their attention to the only  policy priority that they really care about: ensuring billionaires pay  less.

My constituents can't afford eggs at the local grocery store while my  Republican colleagues are fighting amongst themselves about who to hand  out tax breaks to, corporations or individuals.

Tesla pays $0 in Federal taxes while teachers and firefighters in San  Bernardino are paying more than their fair share.

Here is the reality, Madam Chair: My Republican colleagues are going  to take away healthcare for more than 10 million Californians to pay  for tax cuts for billionaires.

This is not going to make the cost of eggs cheaper or housing less  expensive, but it is going to put children and seniors who need  healthcare at risk.

House Democrats believe that the people who work for a living ought  to get a little breathing room, and the wealthy and well connected  shouldn't get special treatment.

The Republican budget is not good for the economy. It is not good for  the country. It is a betrayal of the middle class. I urge a ``no''  vote.
