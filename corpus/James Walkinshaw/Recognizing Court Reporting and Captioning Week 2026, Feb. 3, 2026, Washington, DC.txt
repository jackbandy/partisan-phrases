Recognizing Court Reporting and Captioning Week 2026


Mr. WALKINSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the  National Court Reporters Association's 2026 Court Reporting and  Captioning Week, observed each February to honor the dedicated  professionals who preserve accurate and impartial records of court  proceedings across our Nation.

Court reporters and captioners are essential to the fair  administration of justice. By creating precise and impartial records of  court proceedings, they safeguard due process, protect the rights of  individuals, and ensure that judicial decisions are grounded in a  complete and reliable record. Their work is foundational to  accountability, transparency, and public confidence in our courts.

Court Reporting and Captioning Week highlights both the technical  skills required in this profession and its importance to public  protection and the rule of law. Court reporters and captioners serve  throughout our justice system, ensuring that proceedings at all levels  are accurately recorded and accessible for future use.

Beyond their technical expertise, court reporters and captioners play  a critical role in expanding access to justice and ensuring equity  within our legal system. Court reporters and captioners help ensure  meaningful participation for individuals who are deaf or hard of  hearing and support broader public access to court proceedings and  civic processes.

I am also proud that the National Court Reporters Association is  headquartered in Reston, Virginia, within Virginia's 11th Congressional  District. Their presence in our community reflects the important role  this profession plays in strengthening access to justice nationwide.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing Court  Reporting and Captioning Week and in thanking these professionals for  their indispensable service to our court system and the rule of law.
