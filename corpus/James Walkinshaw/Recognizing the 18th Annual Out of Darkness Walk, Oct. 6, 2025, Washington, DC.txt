Mr. WALKINSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Northern  Virginia community that came together this past weekend for the  American Foundation for Suicide Prevention's Out of the Darkness  Fairfax Walk at the Mosaic District.

This annual event brings hope and healing to families across our  region, offering space for remembrance, resilience, and collective  action to end the tragedy of suicide.

Organized by the National Capital Area chapter of AFSP, the Fairfax  Walk has become one of the most visible demonstrations of solidarity in  the fight for mental health awareness and suicide prevention. Each  year, survivors of loss, advocates, mental health professionals, and  neighbors walk side by side to honor loved ones and to break the stigma  that has for too long silenced conversations about mental health. The  impact of this work cannot be overstated: in Virginia, more lives are  lost to suicide each year than to car accidents, and the need for  accessible, compassionate support is urgent.

Thanks to the dedication of volunteers, community partners, and  sponsors, this year's Fairfax Walk has raised over $125,000 to support  prevention programs, research, advocacy, and resources for those in  crisis. Local partners including Leidos, Intact, SPAN, Interstate,  Wellsourced, Dutyfirst, Columbia Mental Health, Embark Behavioral  Health, Bechtel, and the County of Fairfax joined AFSP in providing  resources and encouragement to those walking this past Saturday.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Virginia's 11th Congressional District, I  ask you to join me in extending my gratitude to the American Foundation  for Suicide Prevention National Capital Area chapter for their  leadership, and to every participant who walked Out of the Darkness in  Fairfax. Their commitment ensures that no one has to struggle alone,  and that our community continues to move toward light, compassion, and  healing.
