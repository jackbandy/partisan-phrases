Protect America's Workforce Act

Mr. WALKINSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Protect  America's Workforce Act.

In my community, Mr. Speaker, public service is a way of life. More  than 80,000 of my neighbors work directly for the Federal Government.  These civil servants protect our national security, care for our  veterans, process Social Security claims, advance medical research, and  respond when disaster strikes.

They have also been on the front lines of President Trump and Russ  Vought's Project 2025-inspired efforts to ``traumatize'' the Federal  workforce.

Stripping collective bargaining rights is a direct assault on our  nonpartisan civil service. This bill says: Not on our watch. That is  why I signed the discharge petition on my first day in office.

This bill restores basic rights for Federal employees, defends the  merit-based civil service, and honors the spirit of public service that  defines my community and communities across the country.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
