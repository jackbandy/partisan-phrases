Epstein Files Transparency Act

Mr. WALKINSHAW. Mr. Speaker, for years, we have watched dangerous  conspiracies like Pizzagate and QAnon shape our political landscape.  They helped fuel the rise of President Trump and were built on baseless  claims about secret pedophile rings, while the real documented case of  child sex trafficking involving Jeffrey Epstein remains shrouded in  secrecy because President Trump refuses to release the files.

Mr. Speaker, what is President Trump hiding? Why won't he release the  files? The House finally has the opportunity to act. Release the files,  and let the American people see the truth.
