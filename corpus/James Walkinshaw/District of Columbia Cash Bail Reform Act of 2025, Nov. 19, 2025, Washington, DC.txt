Mr. WALKINSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5214, which  erodes the self-governance of the District of Columbia.

Mr. Speaker, 2 months ago, I was a local government official not far  from here, in Fairfax County. In the 6 years I spent in that role, I  learned that the people best positioned to make decisions about the  local policies in their local communities are local leaders after  listening to that local community.

My colleagues across the aisle who are advocating for these bills,  with due respect, know very little about the District of Columbia, know  very little outside of perhaps their walk from their apartment in Navy  Yard to this Capitol complex. They don't know the history,  neighborhoods, communities, and challenges that folks in the District  are facing.

While my colleagues espouse the virtues of self-governance, they  simultaneously advocate for bills like this that strip self-governance  from 700,000 Americans.

In 1973, Congress passed the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to  grant the inhabitants of the District powers of local self-government.  This bill is just one of many in this House that erodes those powers to  help President Trump consolidate power over our Nation's Capital.

Meanwhile, the American people are confronting crisis after crisis  that demands action from this Congress. Our national economy is  struggling under President Trump's leadership. Tariffs are driving up  prices. Looming healthcare cuts are about to result in skyrocketing  premiums for Americans across the Nation.

In the midst of this, how does the majority choose to spend its time?  It is spending its time by meddling in D.C.'s local affairs and further  disenfranchising 700,000 taxpaying Americans.

I strongly oppose this bill and encourage my colleagues to vote  ``no.''
