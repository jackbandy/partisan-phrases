Mr. WALKINSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise with profound gratitude and  humility as I begin my service on behalf of Virginia's 11th District.

As a lifelong Northern Virginian, I am honored by the trust my  community has placed in me. I am deeply grateful to my wife, Yvette,  and our son, Mateo, whose love and patience sustain me. This moment  belongs to them as much as it does to me.

I am also honored to follow in the footsteps of my dear friend and  mentor, Congressman Gerry Connolly, a singular figure in Virginia and  in this body, who showed us what principled leadership looks like. His  legacy will guide me every day.

With that gratitude, Mr. Speaker, comes responsibility to speak  honestly about the challenges my community faces. In Virginia, we are  on the leading edge of President Trump's economy. In my district,  everyone knows someone who has lost their job due to the agenda coming  from the White House and too often from this Chamber. If we do not  change course, what is true in Northern Virginia today will soon be  true in every district in this Nation. Families everywhere will know  someone who has lost their job because of the DOGE cuts, the tariffs,  the budget bill, or our failure to address the rising costs on  everything from groceries to rent to prescription drugs.

This week, Mr. Speaker, the people of Virginia sent a clear message:  They want pragmatic solutions. They want a government that works for  everyone. They want us to tackle the high cost of living, housing, and  health care, to confront climate change, to honor the public servants,  our Federal employees, who keep our government running.

Mr. Speaker, I am humbled by the trust my constituents have placed in  me. I will carry their hopes and their voices into this Chamber every  day. I will never forget where I came from, and I will never  stop working for a government that reflects the best of who we are.  Together, Mr. Speaker, I believe we can build that future.
