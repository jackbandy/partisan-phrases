Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of my staff  members, Anthony Uribe, who is being recognized by the Sacramento Metro  Chamber of Commerce as a Young Professional of the Year.

Anthony joined my staff in 2018, when he was a senior at Sacramento  State, as an intern. He came on as a staff assistant and has been  working his way up. Anthony has shown grit and perseverance,  representing the Sacramento communities of North Sacramento, Del Paso  Heights, and Natomas. He is a great extension of what we do.

Anthony is innovative. One of the best Anthony stories is that, as a  staff assistant, you have to pick the Member of Congress up early in  the morning  sometimes. Because I am on the West Coast, that is a 4 a.m. pickup  call. One morning, he may have overslept his alarm clock there, so he  got there and said: I will get you to the airport, Mr. Congressman.

For those in Sacramento County, he got me from Elk Grove to the  airport in 10 minutes flat. Maybe there was a little bit of speeding  there.

I congratulate Anthony. I wish I was there with him for the awards  ceremony. It is a well-deserved award.
