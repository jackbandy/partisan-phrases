Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Fair Oaks on their  130th Anniversary. Originally founded as an agricultural colony, Fair  Oaks has grown into an area of deep cultural history and a strong sense  of community.

The land in Fair Oaks was part of the original 1844 Mexican Land  Grant, Rancho San Juan, and was advertised as a new paradise waiting  for farmers looking to make a comfortable living. Even though founding  residents experienced hardships like the Great Depression, World War  II, and a devastating freeze that wiped out many citrus crops, the area  continued to thrive and develop.

As Fair Oaks grew, so too did its industry and commerce. The  completion of the Folsom and Nimbus dams, and arrival of Aerojet  signaled a new page in Fair Oaks' history. Fair Oaks is a booming town  that continues to change with its fast-growing population.

It is with great appreciation to the Fair Oaks Historical Society  that the founding and legacy of Fair Oaks has continued to be preserved  and honored. On this day, the Society celebrates their 50th Anniversary  alongside Fair Oaks' 130th Anniversary.

I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing this day as Fair  Oaks' 130th Anniversary and commend this community's beautiful history.
