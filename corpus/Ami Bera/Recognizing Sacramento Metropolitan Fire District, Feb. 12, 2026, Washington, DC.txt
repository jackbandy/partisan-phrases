Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Sacramento  Metropolitan Fire District, which recently celebrated its 25th  anniversary, serving communities in Sacramento and Placer Counties.

On December 1, 2000, the American River Fire District and the  Sacramento County Fire Protection District reorganized to form what we  now know as Metro Fire, uniting 16 fire agencies into one force  dedicated to protecting our communities.

Today, Metro Fire serves more than 720,000 people across 359 square  miles. With 41 fire stations and more than 700 dedicated members, they  stand ready around the clock to respond to fires, rescues, medical  emergencies, and more to save lives and protect property.

Their mission says it best: ``professional and compassionate  protection,  education, and service to the community.'' That commitment isn't just  words. It is how they show up every day, often on the hardest day of  someone else's life.

That teamwork and pride show up in every setting. Last year, Station  26 took first place in the inaugural HERO Act Chili Cookoff that my  office hosted at the California State Fair. I was proud to visit the  station to present ribbons to Captain Adam Huckaby and Firefighter  Taylor Edwards.

As we celebrate this milestone, we also have a responsibility to  support the men and women who support all of us, especially when it  comes to their mental health. That is why I am continuing to push for  passage of my bipartisan HERO Act to extend access to mental health and  support for our brave first responders.
