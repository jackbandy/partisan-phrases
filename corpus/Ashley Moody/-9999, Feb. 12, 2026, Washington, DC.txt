Mrs. MOODY. As the newest, most junior Member from the great State-- the free State of Florida, I rise today--as well as the proud  granddaughter of a World War II Army veteran--and I rise today to  congratulate Mr. Duane Brewton of Cantonment, FL, on the extraordinary  occasion of his 109th birthday celebrated on February 5, 2026.

Mr. Brewton is Florida's oldest living World War II veteran and among  the oldest surviving veterans of the Second World War in the United  States. He is a proud member of what history rightly calls the  ``Greatest Generation''--ordinary Americans who answered the call, did  extraordinary things, and helped save the world.

They did not do it for recognition. They did not ask for praise. They  simply did their duty. Honoring their service while they are still with  us is both a privilege and a responsibility.

When his country called, Duane Brewton answered. He served from 1944  to 1945 as a private in the U.S. Army during the Second World War. He  was stationed in Vire, France, where he was wounded in the line of duty  and later returned home.

For his sacrifice, he was awarded the Purple Heart, a lasting  testament to his courage, humility, and devotion to freedom. The world  owes a debt to Mr. Brewton and to his generation that can never be  repaid.

Born and raised in Pensacola, FL, Mr. Brewton returned home after the  war. He raised a family and devoted his life to faith, service, and  community.

A devout Christian, he lived his values daily and by example. His  daughters recall that throughout their childhood, their father rose  every single morning at 4 a.m. to study the Bible and pray, an enduring  memory that shaped their lives and reflected the quiet strength of his  character.

That faith extended far beyond his home. Mr. Brewton was a founder of  the Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, a church that continues  to serve his community today.

Through his life, he set a shining example--before his children, his  family, all who knew him, and to us--of what it means to honor God and  country.

May we all strive to live with the same humility, discipline, and  integrity that he has shown for more than a century--109 years, to be  exact.

In recent years, Mr. Brewton has resided in an assisted living  community where he is deeply loved by residents and staff alike. I am  told that they are all watching today.

On his 109th birthday, it was marked by a joyful celebration of  family, friends, and community members gathering in great numbers.  Surrounded by his two daughters and loved ones, the occasion was  fittingly warm and celebratory--centered, as it should be, on a man  whose life had meant so much to so many.

Florida is the proud home to more than 1.4 million veterans. Florida  is also home to the second largest number of living World War II  veterans, a distinction we hold with deep gratitude and respect.

We honor their service, we cherish their presence and recognize our  responsibility to preserve their stories and sacrifices.

Mr. Brewton embodies the very best of Florida and, indeed, the very  best of America: faith, family, humility, duty, and service. His life  stands as a living reminder of the generation that answered the call,  endured unimaginable hardship, and secured liberty for generations that  they would never meet.

On behalf of the people of Florida and a grateful nation, I  congratulate Mr. Duane Brewton on his 109th birthday, thank him for his  extraordinary service, and wish him another joyous year surrounded by  faith, family, and the enduring appreciation of a nation forever  indebted to him.
