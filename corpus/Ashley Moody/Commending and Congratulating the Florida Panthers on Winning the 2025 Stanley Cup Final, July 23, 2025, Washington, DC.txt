Commending and Congratulating the Florida Panthers on Winning the 2025 Stanley Cup Final


Mrs. MOODY. Mr. President, today I rise to announce a resolution  commending and congratulating the Florida Panthers on winning the 2025  Stanley Cup Final.

Last month, our State--the great State of Florida--along with loyal  fans nationwide, came together to cheer on the Florida Panthers as they  fought hard to secure a victory and bring home the cup to Florida.

And they cemented their place as back-to-back champions. This  incredible effort marks the second cup won  by the Panthers in franchise history, and our Sunshine State is so very  proud.

The whole Panthers' roster obviously contributed to this win, but we  wanted to thank the staff and the coaches and all of those who  supported the team on and off the ice. This success could not have been  achieved without everybody who contributed.

We watched that team compete with resilience and grit to keep the  Stanley Cup where it belongs, which is, of course, in the great free  State of Florida. Our entire South Florida community celebrates with  the entire State, who all kept faith in this team. Everyone's  encouragement throughout the season ensured our Panthers were ready to  bring home the championship when the time came. The win was well  deserved, and it was a great end to an amazing year.

So with that, I thank the Presiding Officer for accommodating my  request to pass a resolution on behalf of the Florida Panthers.

Res. 333, which is  at the desk.
