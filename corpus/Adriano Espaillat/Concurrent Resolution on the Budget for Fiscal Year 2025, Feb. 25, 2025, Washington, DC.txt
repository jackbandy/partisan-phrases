Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Chair, very often, we take very serious votes on  this floor, but this vote is a deadly serious vote. This is a vote  about life and death.

I represent just slightly over 780,000 constituents. Out of those  780,000 constituents, 524,000 of them are Medicaid recipients, and over  100,000 of them are Medicare recipients, so over 600,000 of the 780,000  constituents who I represent receive either Medicaid or Medicare. In  addition to that, there are 263,000 households that receive food  stamps.

This bill would put their lives and health in danger, Madam Chair.  This is about life and death.

As the Republican majority proposes to cut Medicaid across this  country to give a massive $4.5 trillion, with a capital T, trillion- dollar cut in taxes to the very rich, who would that go to? Fifty  percent of that will go to the shareholders. Forty-four percent of that  tax cut will go to high-end executives.

The fat cat executives are going to get this money, and working-class  and even middle-class people are going to get stiffed with the cuts.

This is about life and death. It is not a simple piece of legislation  that we will pass. There are diabetics who will see the price of  insulin go up. There are people with renal problems and cardiovascular  problems.

Madam Chair, this is about life and death. Vote ``no'' on this bill.
