Recognizing Carter Bisig

Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Carter Bisig.

Carter is a junior at Wilmington High School in Wilmington, Ohio, and  has earned the Eagle Scout Award, the highest possible achievement in  the Boy Scout community.

To earn an Eagle Scout Award, Carter had to obtain 21 merit badges  showcasing the skills he learned as a Scout and his commitment to the  community. Thanks to the invaluable lessons taught to Scouts, Carter  has become an expert in first aid, camping, fitness, communication, and  citizenship.

Throughout our Nation's history, the Boy Scouts have played an  invaluable role in teaching young people hands-on skills that make them  better citizens and stewards of their communities. America is blessed  to have an organization dedicated to helping our children become the  best versions of themselves.

Southern Ohio is so proud of Carter's accomplishment and happy to  call him one of our own. Since the Eagle Scout Award was first  introduced in 1912, only about 4 percent of Boy Scouts have earned the  award, making this achievement nothing short of extraordinary.

I look forward to seeing how Carter can continue to create positive  change in Ohio's Second Congressional District.

I would also like to recognize Carter's parents and Scout leaders for  their role in this process. Without them, this achievement would not  have been possible.

I congratulate Carter.
