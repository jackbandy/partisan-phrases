Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment, which  would require the Appalachian Regional Commission to conduct the study  on the inclusion of low Earth orbit satellites to be used for economic  development.

The United States should be encouraging and embracing new  technological advances that help bridge the broadband gap across rural  regions, ensuring all Americans are connected to the modern economy.

Many towns and communities within my district in southern Ohio still  lack access to broadband, which, frankly, is unacceptable. Without  reliable internet access, students face challenges in completing  homework, patients can't receive telehealth services, businesses are  less incentivized to invest in their communities, and people can't work  from home.

My amendment, which is included in this en bloc, will help show that  low Earth orbit satellites have the capabilities to provide adequate  broadband access to communities and create economic development within  the Appalachian region.

As a co-chair of the Rural Broadband Caucus, I am committed to  connecting folks as quickly as possible whether that be through fiber,  wireless service, or satellites.

Congress should be implementing a technologically neutral broadband  approach and the inclusion of this new technology will provide  additional avenues to provide broadband to people in my district and  across the Appalachian region and finally give them access to the  modern economy.
