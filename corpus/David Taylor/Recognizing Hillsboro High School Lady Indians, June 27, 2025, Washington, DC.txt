Recognizing Hillsboro High School Lady Indians


Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Hillsboro High  School Lady Indians softball team.

The Lady Indians had a historic season this year that saw them  achieve over 20 wins and secure the Division 4 regional championship  for the first time in 23 years, finishing the year as State runner-up.

Teamwork propelled them to great achievements as the Lady Indians  consistently had great performances on the mound and in the batter's  box.

Along the way, the Lady Indians were supported by a dedicated fan  base of parents and alumni that fueled their desire for victory.  Without the fan support and the support of their coaches, none of this  would have been possible.

I will always be grateful for the parents and coaches that pour so  much of themselves into our student athletes. The great achievements of  the Lady Indians belong to them as much as they belong to the players.

Mr. Speaker, all of southern Ohio is proud of our Lady Indians'  accomplishments, and I look forward to another great season next year.
