Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the selfless acts  of service done by Diana Lawrence and the Troop Box Ministry to bless  our Nation's servicemembers.

It all began nearly a quarter century ago in the garage of the  Lawrences' residence in Hamersville, Ohio. One of Diana's family  members was serving faithfully in the military in Afghanistan, and she  sent a care package overseas to show support.

An idea was born, and soon, students from Milford Schools and  volunteers from all over town joined Diana's mission. Her operation  expanded to two sheds in her backyard, where volunteers collected the  names and addresses of troops, assembled donated items in the care  packages, and sent them on their way overseas. Each box included a  Gideon Bible, a deck of cards, as well as toothbrushes, shampoo,  personal hygiene tools, and snacks.

Troop Box Ministry started receiving special requests from soldiers,  and soon, they were knitting wool helmet liners and collecting cans of  spray for the bottoms of combat boots to give servicemembers a better  grip on slippery terrain.

Over the next 23 years, Diana and her volunteers sent an estimated  10,000 packages to American troops serving all over the Middle East and  beyond. As a result, Diana and her family-style operation found their  way into southern Ohio's history books as service leaders with a  purpose.
