Madison Wasmer Earns Eagle Scout Award


Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Madison Wasmer.

Madison is a junior at Jackson High School and has recently earned  the Eagle Scout Award, becoming the first female in Jackson County to  earn this distinction. To achieve this, Madison obtained 21 merit  badges, showcasing fundamental skills she learned as a Scout and  commitment to her community.

Madison is a true leader who has served on her school's student  council, engaged in local cleanup initiatives, and assisted special  needs students.

A member of Troop 7056, Madison embodied the spirit of the Scouts,  which is to make ethical and moral choices that contribute to the well- being of society, ultimately fostering civic engagement and love of  community.

Southern Ohio is proud of Madison's accomplishments, and we are happy  to call her one of our own. I look forward to seeing how she continues  to create positive change in Ohio's Second Congressional District.

Mr. Speaker, I also recognize Madison's grandmother and her  Scoutmaster, Ryan Pelliter, for their role in this process. Without  them, this achievement would not have been possible. I congratulate  Madison.
