Recognizing Garrett Stanfield

Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Garrett  Stanfield.

Garrett is from Manchester, Ohio, and won the Young Cattleman of the  Year Award at the Ohio Cattlemen's Association annual meeting and  awards banquet this past February. This award recognizes individuals or  couples who show leadership and have been successful in the beef  operation industry.

Garrett has demonstrated this through his graduation from the Ohio  State University's animal science program and his work to effectively  use genetic and reproductive science on the farm. Garrett is a lifelong  cattleman. He was raised on Stanfield Farms, which has been operated  for generations by the Stanfield family in southern Ohio.

America's cattlemen, farmers, and ranchers are the backbone of our  country. It is a great honor to advocate for them in Congress, and it  is my sincere hope that we can pass a full farm bill on their behalf.

Currently working with Trans Ova Genetics on innovative breeding  processes, Garrett will participate in the  upcoming National Cattlemen's Beef Association's Young Cattlemen's  Conference as the representative from Ohio Cattlemen's Association.

Madam Speaker, Ohio is so proud of Garrett and thankful for all that  he does and that his fellow farmers do for America.
