Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Luke Jennings.

Luke is from Felicity, Ohio, and was elected to serve as the national  secretary of the Future Farmers of America.

Farming is in Luke's blood, as he has raised livestock, shown pigs  and cattle, and his family owns and operates Windy Ridge Acres, a beef  cow operation. As the Representative of an agriculture-focused  district, I understand how important family farms are. It is my honor  to advocate on their behalf in Congress.

The FFA plays a critical role in equipping our young people with the  tools they need to successfully lead the next generation of American  farming. Farmers across the United States and my district have  benefited from the FFA's commitment to advancing agriculture education  through their comprehensive learning model.

Luke earned his national secretary position after serving as the  Felicity-Franklin chapter officer and Ohio State officer for 2 years.

In addition to his service in the FFA, Luke is currently pursuing a  degree in agriscience education at the Ohio State University.

I would also like to recognize Luke's mom, Holly, who is a longtime  FFA adviser.

Luke, the whole Jennings family, and the farmers across America  represent the best of this country. I congratulate and thank Luke for  all he does.
