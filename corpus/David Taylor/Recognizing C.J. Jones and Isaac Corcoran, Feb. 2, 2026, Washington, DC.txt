Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize C.J. Jones and  Isaac Corcoran of the Ross County Junior Fair Board.

C.J. and Isaac had a desire to help address hunger needs in their  community and decided to participate in the Fight the Hunger, Stock the  Trailer program, run by Farm Credit Mid-America and Rural 1st.

This program challenges junior fair boards to collect as many pounds  of food as possible to donate to local organizations, addressing food  insecurity in our communities.

C.J. and Isaac set an ambitious goal of collecting 100,000 pounds of  food throughout Ross County. While many questioned whether this goal  was achievable, C.J. and Isaac ultimately went above and beyond,  leading Ross County to break their previous record of food collected.  They collected 122,640 pounds of food last year, which is 92,000 pounds  more than what was collected in 2024.

Efforts from youth like C.J. and Isaac will ensure that fewer  Buckeyes will go hungry. Their actions show just what can be achieved  when Ohioans set their minds to a common goal to look out for the needs  of others.
