Recognizing Kenley Juillerat


Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kenley Juillerat.  Kenley is a member of the Premier Showmen 4-H Club in Hillsboro, Ohio.

For her 4-H project, Kenley gave back to veterans by thanking them  for their service with stars, stripes, and smiles buckets. With help  from her community, she assembled goodie buckets to disperse to  veterans in her area.

Included were cards that thanked them for their service. Freedom has  never been free, and our brave servicemen and -women and their families  sacrifice so much to keep us safe. It is great to see heroes being  recognized, and it is my honor to advocate on their behalf in Congress.

Outstanding operations like 4-H teach our young people the values of  patriotism and hard work. Programs just like this one represent the  best America has to offer, and it is great to see them focusing their  efforts on honoring our Nation's heroes.

I and all of southern Ohio are proud of Kenley.

I congratulate Kenley.
