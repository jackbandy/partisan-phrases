Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Katie Ankrom.

Katie is a junior at Portsmouth City Schools and a member of the Lady  Trojans softball team and recently recorded her 300th career strikeout.

In the 2024-2025 season, Katie pitched over 136 innings and recorded  145 strikeouts. In addition to her success on the mound, Katie has been  effective at the plate over the course of her career. She boasts a .332  on-base percentage and has driven in over 40 runs.

Beyond her success on the softball field, Katie is also a member of  the Lady Trojans volleyball team. In 2024, she was named first team  all-conference as she logged 42 kills. Katie's athletic achievement  reflects her God-given talents and all the hard work she has put into  improving her craft.

Youth sports have played an important role in the history of our  Nation. They teach young people how to be hardworking, detail-oriented,  and resilient. Katie's experience as a team leader has prepared her to  be a leader in life, and I am excited to see what she accomplishes  beyond high school.

All of southern Ohio is proud of Katie's accomplishments. If she has  any tips for me before I play in the upcoming Congressional Baseball  Game, I will gladly take them.
