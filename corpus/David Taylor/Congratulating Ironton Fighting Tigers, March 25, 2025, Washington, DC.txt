Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Ironton  Fighting Tigers for winning their first football State championship in  35 years.

With an incredibly strong work ethic and a commitment to excellence,  the Ironton High School football team spent all season training and  working together with one goal in mind: the State title.

In the championship game, senior Shaun Terry led his team to victory  with 300 all-purpose yards, including 148 receiving yards and three  touchdowns. This championship win is evidence of a season full of hard  work, dedication, and commitment to excellence.

Since the school's last title in 1989, the Ironton Fighting Tigers  have appeared in six State title games in pursuit of a win, which made  bringing home this year's trophy even sweeter.

Head Coach Trevon Pendleton and his staff poured their knowledge and  experience into eager players all season long, guiding them and pushing  them toward excellence on and off the field.

I also recognize each parent who supported their players and  encouraged them to work hard. I congratulate each player for their  hard-earned victory and new State title.

Congratulations. Go Fighting Tigers.
