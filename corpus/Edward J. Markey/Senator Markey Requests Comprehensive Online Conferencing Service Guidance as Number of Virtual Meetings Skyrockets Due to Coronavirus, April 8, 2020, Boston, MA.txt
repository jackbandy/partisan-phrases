Senator Markey Requests Comprehensive Online Conferencing Service Guidance as Number of Virtual Meetings Skyrockets Due to Coronavirus


As countless Americans turn Zoom into a verb, Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass), a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, today urged the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue comprehensive guidelines for companies that provide online conferencing services. He also called for a set of best practices for users that will help protect online safety and privacy during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond. Millions of Americans have become dependent on online conferencing services for work, school, and contact with loved ones. A growing number of incidents over the past several weeks have revealed that these technologies may expose their users to significant cybersecurity and privacy risks.

 

"As Americans' reliance on online conferencing grows, individuals are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks and inappropriate access of their personal data," the Senator writes in his letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simmons and the other Commissioners. "Although much of the recent reporting has focused on Zoom due to its growing user base, and I would urge the FTC to conduct a thorough investigation into Zoom, it is clear that no platform is immune from risks. Other services, including Cisco Webex, Microsoft Teams, and Slack have all previously had security flaws exposed, raising the need for the FTC to issue guidance generally "to help businesses understand their responsibilities and comply with the law,' particularly during this pandemic."
