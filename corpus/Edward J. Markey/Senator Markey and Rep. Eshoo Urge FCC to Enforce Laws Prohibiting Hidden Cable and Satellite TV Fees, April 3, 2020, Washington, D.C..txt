Senator Markey and Rep. Eshoo Urge FCC to Enforce Laws Prohibiting Hidden Cable and Satellite TV Fees


Washington (April 3, 2020) -- Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Congresswoman Anna G. Eshoo (CA-18) today wrote to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to urge it to vigorously enforce important, pro-consumer provisions in the Television Viewer Protection Act that will address the lack of transparency and unfairness of certain billing practices in the pay-TV market. Effective June 2020, the new law will require cable and satellite TV providers to disclose all fees before consumers sign up for service, allow cancellations within 24 hours without penalty, and charge consumers only for equipment that they actually use.

 

"Consumers deserve price transparency, a right to change their mind without exorbitant penalties, and the knowledge that they will only be charged for services and equipment they actually use," write Senator Markey and Congresswoman Eshoo in their letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and members of the Commission. "Federal law now provides these assurances, and we appreciate the Commission executing the will of the U.S. Congress to promote this critical consumer protection statute."
