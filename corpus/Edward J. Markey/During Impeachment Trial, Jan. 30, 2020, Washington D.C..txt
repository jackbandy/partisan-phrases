During Impeachment Trial, Senator Markey Asks What Options Remain for Congress if Trump Is Acquitted and Then Invites Interference in Future U.S. Elections


Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) asked his second question during the question and answer period of the U.S. Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, focusing on what options Congress has to address interference in U.S. elections if Donald Trump is acquitted of the pending charges against him. Yesterday, the Trump legal team argued that President Trump's solicitation of foreign interference in our election to benefit himself politically was legal and appropriate. 

Senators Markey's question:

"It has recently been reported that the Russians have hacked the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, presumably, looking for information on Hunter Biden. Our intelligence community has warned us that the Russian will be interfering in the 2020 election. If Donald Trump is acquitted of these pending charges, but is later found to have invited Russian or other foreign interference in our 2020 election, what recourse will there be for Congress under the Dershowitz standard for impeachment, which requires a president to have committed a statutory crime?" 

The House Managers responded:

"Senator, absolutely no recourse. No recourse whatsoeverÂ…That is a recipe for a president who is above the law."

"Bottom line, President Trump and his lawyers believe nothing is impeachable," said Senator Markey in separate comments. "House Managers are arguing the need to protect our democracy while Trump's lawyers are arguing the need to create a dictatorship. Trump's lawyer's want to end presidential accountability as we know it, leaving Congress will virtually no options for ensuring that future presidents don't undermine our free and fair elections without impunity."
