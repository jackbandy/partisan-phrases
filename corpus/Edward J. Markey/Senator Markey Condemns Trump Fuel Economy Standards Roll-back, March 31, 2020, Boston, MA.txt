Senator Markey Condemns Trump Fuel Economy Standards Roll-back


Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) released the following statement today blasting the Trump administration's final rule to drastically weaken the fuel economy emissions standards for the nation's cars and pickup trucks. The final rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will require American cars, pickup trucks and SUVs to improve average fuel efficiency by a mere 1.5 percent per year between model years 2021 and 2026, compared to a nearly five percent annual increase put in place under the Obama administration and the 2.4 percent annual increase that automakers project they will accomplish without any regulations. The Obama administration's historic 54.5 mpg standard was partially enabled by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which included fuel economy standards co-authored by Senator Markey when he was in the House of Representatives.

 

"As the nation combats one crisis devastating our health and economy, Trump is committed to worsening another crisis devastating our climate and air quality. This dirty cars rule will result in vehicles that are more polluting, more expensive, and less safe," said Senator Markey, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. "As we learn about how coronavirus is more deadly to people with existing lung conditions, it is especially appalling that Trump would decide to issue a rule now that will result in more dirty air pollution. Even during this health and economic emergency, the rollback of the clean vehicles standards shows that the Trump administration will never waiver from its top priority: boosting Big Oil."

 

The fuel economy emissions standards put in place by the Obama administration were projected to save nearly 2.5 million barrels of oil a day by 2030, as well as save consumers over $1 trillion and reduce global warming pollution by six billion metric tons.
