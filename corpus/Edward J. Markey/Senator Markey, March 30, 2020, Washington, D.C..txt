Senator Markey, Colleagues Introduce Legislation to Push for a Stop to Electric and Gas Disconnections, Reconnection Fees, Late Fees, and Rate Hikes During Coronavirus Crisis


Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) today was joined by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) in introducing a bill that sets the sense of Congress that states and utilities should issue a moratorium on gas and electric service disconnections, late fees, reconnection fees, rate hikes, and other penalties for all consumers as a result of the ongoing national emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. States have the primary authority to govern electric and gas rates, and many have still not ordered utilities to take this vital action, leaving millions vulnerable during the ongoing economic crisis. 

 

"As bills come due, unemployment rates spike, and businesses shutter in Massachusetts and across the country, families are struggling to keep on their electricity, heat, stoves, and hot water," said Senator Markey, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. "This is a national life-or-death emergency, and every single state and utility must take action now to keep people healthy at home and keep their lights on."
