Senator Markey Calls for Clear Guidance from Trump Administration on Retail, Consumer Food Handling During Coronavirus Pandemic


Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) is calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue and promote clear guidance for workers in the retail food industry and their customers during the coronavirus health emergency. To date, both agencies have provided only limited guidance. For retail food workers, FDA guidance recommends certain hygiene practices and social distancing where practicable, but also states that social distancing will not always be possible.  The guidance ultimately leaves decisions on the feasibility of worker protections to retail food establishments themselves. For consumers, the CDC guidance merely reiterates frequent-hand-washing recommendations and states "because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging." In his letter, Senator Markey asks for the agencies to provide clearer guidance for workers in the retail food industry and consumers on how to protect themselves and others from the coronavirus.

 

"During this public health crisis, the CDC and FDA must take more aggressive action to protect workers in the retail food industry and consumers," writes Senator Markey in his letter to CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield and FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn. "Your agencies must ensure that all guidance is comprehensive, easy to find, and protects both workers and consumers."
