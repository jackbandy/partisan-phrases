Senators Markey, Murkowski, Warren, Sullivan Call on Senate Leadership to Support Fishing and Seafood Industry in Coronavirus Response


Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) today were joined by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) in leading a letter to Senate leadership calling for urgent support for the fishing industry as it endures severe economic hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

Given the vast amount of domestic seafood that is enjoyed in restaurants and exported to international markets, the closure of these markets from the COVID-19 pandemic has caused fishermen and seafood processors to face uniquely drastic economic impacts. As part of the urgently needed support, the letter highlights a variety of ways Congress can help the industry, including: establishing federal procurement programs for U.S. seafood products, federal fisheries disaster assistance funding, and the inclusion of support mechanisms for vessel loan payments assistance in any economy-wide coronavirus response package.
