Senator Markey: We Need to Account for All Frontline Workers, Provide Adequate Personal Protective Equipment to Stop Spread of Coronavirus


As frontline workers across the country protest unsafe working conditions and the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) today called on the Trump administration to protect all frontline workers by ensuring they have adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) appropriate for the tasks they undertake. In a letter sent today to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Senator Markey argues that frontline workers -- those who provide an essential or key public service -- are critical in grocery stores, restaurants, delivery services, mass transportation, sanitation, prisons, utilities, security, and emergency response, among other sectors of the economy and need PPE such as masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer. Because these jobs put them in close contact with others, these workers are at higher risk for coronavirus infection. Senator Markey is calling on the Trump administration to take into account all of these workers when estimating the needs for personal protective equipment, as well as to provide workers guidance on how to best protect themselves. Senator Markey sent his letter as the Department of Health and Human Services reports that the Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies such as respirator masks, gloves, gowns, and other equipment is nearly depleted.

 

"Workers should not need to risk their lives providing essential services," writes Senator Markey in his letter to FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor. "The federal government must ensure that all frontline workers are valued and protected. In many cases, corporations continue to put profit over worker safety."
