Senator Markey Introduces Sweeping "New Deal for New Americans" Act to Welcome and Support Immigrants and Refugees


Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) today introduced the New Deal for New Americans Act, legislation that promotes immigrant and refugee inclusion, as well as coordinates the efforts of federal, state, and local governments to support the social, economic, and civic integration of immigrants and refugees. As President Donald Trump uses executive orders, guidance, rulemaking, and informal directives to demonize immigrants and refugees the New Deal for New Americans reflects a proactive, affirmative vision for our nation in which the federal government commits significant resources to support immigrants and refugees. Representatives Grace Meng (NY-06), Jesús García (IL-04), and Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) have previously introduced legislation in the House of Representatives.

 

"We know immigrant families want the opportunity to contribute to their communities and to provide for themselves and their loved ones," said Senator Markey. "The New Deal for New Americans Act provides that opportunity -- not just to survive in the United States, but to fully thrive. This legislation is a clear vision of what a humane and welcoming immigration system looks like, which includes providing comprehensive support for legal, economic, and language needs. I am proud to introduce this legislation that reflects the values of a nation built by immigrants."

Establish a National Office of New Americans in the Executive Office of the White House to promote and support immigrant and refugee inclusion, as well as coordinate efforts of federal, state, and local governments to support social, economic, and civic integration of immigrants and refugeesEstablish a Federal Initiative on New Americans to coordinate a federal response to issues that affect the lives of new immigrants and refugees, and the communities in which they resideCreate a Legal Services and Immigration Assistance Grant Program to support organizations that provide direct assistance to those in need of immigration screening; know-your-rights education; assistance in applying for citizenship, lawful permanent resident status, or other legal status; or seeking relief from a removal orderCreate an English as a Gateway to Integration Program for organizations that teach English or help individuals earn a GED or prepare for naturalizationCreate a Workforce Development Grant Program to ensure that immigrant and refugee adults have equitable access to workforce programs that help equip them with occupational skills needed to secure or advance in employmentPromote civic engagement through automatic voter registration of newly naturalized individualsBolster family reunification by reducing (from 21 years old to 18 years old) the age at which citizens can petition for eligible family members to receive an immigrant visaIncrease refugee admissions to at least 110,000 per fiscal yearAmend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to no longer allow for the deportation of an individual deemed a public charge
