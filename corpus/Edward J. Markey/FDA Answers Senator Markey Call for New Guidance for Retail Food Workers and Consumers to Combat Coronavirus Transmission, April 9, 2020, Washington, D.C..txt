FDA Answers Senator Markey Call for New Guidance for Retail Food Workers and Consumers to Combat Coronavirus Transmission


Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) today applauded the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for issuing guidance for retail food workers and their customers regarding ways to protect themselves and prevent the spread of coronavirus. Senator Markey previously called on the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue and promote clear guidance for workers in the retail food industry and their customers during this public health emergency.

 

"We must continue to practice social distancing, but we also need best practices for grocery stores and food delivery to prevent the spread of coronavirus," said Senator Markey. "This overdue new guidance is an improvement from the minimal information FDA and CDC previously provided, but the Trump administration must do more to promote these resources to employers, employees, and consumers, and must ensure businesses are implementing these worker protections. Our frontline workers at grocery stores and in the retail food industry are making it possible for families and businesses to survive this pandemic, and we owe it to them to provide the resources they need to protect their lives and the public's health."
