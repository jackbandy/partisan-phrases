Senator Markey Queries FAA about Local Authority to Test Counter-Drone Technology


Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Security, today sent a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requesting that the agency explain its position on state and local testing of counter-drone technology. The letter follows a hearing in the Security Subcommittee that explored the safety challenges of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), also known as drones. During this hearing, a representative of the FAA maintained that current federal law prevents state and local authorities from testing counter-drone technology, as well as some critical detection tools.

 

In recent years, the proliferation of drone technology has created increasing security risks. The mere sighting of a drone on an airport runway can lead to hours of disrupted travel, while a malicious or negligent actor could cause a drone to strike a plane or other critical infrastructure and produce catastrophic casualties.

 

"The FAA's position on counter-UAS testing is concerning because state and local authorities are now on the front-lines of drone security and have an integral role to play in defending against threats posed by this emerging technology," writes Senators Markey in his letter to FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson. "Consequently, state and local authorities must be able to test counter-UAS technology alongside the FAA or we will likely face delays in the technology's implementation, thus preventing public safety officials from being able to better protect their communities."
