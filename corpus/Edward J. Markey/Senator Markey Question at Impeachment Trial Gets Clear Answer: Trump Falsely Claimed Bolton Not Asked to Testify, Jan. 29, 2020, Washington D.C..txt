Senator Markey Question at Impeachment Trial Gets Clear Answer: Trump Falsely Claimed Bolton Not Asked to Testify


For the second Democratic question posed today during the question and answer period in the U.S. Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) asked of the House Managers: 

 

"On Monday, President Trump tweeted, "The Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify.' So that the record is accurate, did House impeachment investigators ask Mr. Bolton to testify?"

 

The response from the House Managers was clear -- yes, they did:  

 

"Senators, the answer is, yes, of course we asked John Bolton to testify in the House and he refused."  

  

"The answer to my question proves that Donald Trump was lying," said Senator Markey in separate comments. "An impeachment trial without John Bolton's testimony is a cover-up." 

 

On Monday, PolitiFact rated President Trump's tweet: FALSE.
