Why Aren't You Utilizing the Full Defense Production Act? Asks Senator Markey of FEMA


As nurses and doctors in Massachusetts and all across the country are forced to sanitize, re-use, or go without key equipment like respirator masks, today Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) today asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) why it changed its statement regarding the use of the Defense Production Act (DPA) to acquire critically needed coronavirus testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE), and if the White House was responsible for FEMA's about-face. Yesterday, FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor was quoted as saying that the Trump administration would imminently "use the allocation portion of the DPA" for 60,000 coronavirus test kits and would "insert some [DPA] language into these mask contracts we have of 500 million masks."  Then, late yesterday, a FEMA spokesperson stated that "at the last minute" FEMA had been "able to procure the test kits from the private market without evoking [sic] the DPA." In his letter, Senator Markey asks for clarification on the contradictory remarks, as well as if and how FEMA and the Trump administration intend to use the DPA to address the dire shortage of ventilators, test kits, and PPE such as respirators.

 

"It is entirely unclear whether, and if so, how, FEMA and this Administration are intending to use the DPA, even as the chorus of pleas for its invocation from around the country grow louder with each passing day," writes Senator Markey in his letter to FEMA Administrator Gaynor.
