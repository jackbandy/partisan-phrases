Senators Markey and Warren Announce Information, Resources for Massachusetts Small Businesses Impacted by Coronavirus


Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) today announced new resources that will soon be available to Massachusetts small businesses suffering the economic consequences of the coronavirus health emergency. The outbreak of COVID-19 has dealt a severe financial blow to the more than 669,000 small businesses across the Commonwealth. As non-essential businesses throughout the state are forced to cease in person operations, many of these businesses have had to shut their doors, through no fault of their own.

 

"Massachusetts small businesses are fighting for their economic survival as they are forced to close through no fault of their own" said Senator Markey. "The CARES Act provides billions of dollars in important relief to keep small businesses afloat during this crisis, and our offices are here to help owners and workers navigate the federal support available at this time." 

 

"This crisis is putting a ton of pressure on small business owners and their employees," said Senator Warren. "Small businesses in Massachusetts and across the country are going to help get us through this crisis and deliver a stronger recovery, which is why we have been working to get them some relief now."
