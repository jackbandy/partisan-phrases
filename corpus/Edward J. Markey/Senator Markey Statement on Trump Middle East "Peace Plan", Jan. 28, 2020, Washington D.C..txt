Senator Markey Statement on Trump Middle East "Peace Plan"


Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement on President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan. 

 

"I strongly agree with longstanding U.S. bipartisan policy that a true two-state solution is the only viable path to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, ensuring lasting peace, and advancing Israel's long-term security," said Senator Markey. "But without Palestinian involvement, I believe President Trump's so-called "peace plan' is a peace plan in name only. Today's announcement must also not serve as a pretext for further unilateral action by any party that could make peace harder to achieve. What we need today is real diplomacy to bring all parties to the negotiating table for direct talks to both achieve a Palestinian state and protect our ally Israel."
