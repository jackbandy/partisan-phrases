Senators Markey and Warren Release Statement on the Mashpee Wampanoag Reservation


Massachusetts Senators Edward J. Markey and Elizabeth Warren released the following joint statement after the Department of the Interior announced the disestablishment of the Mashpee Wampanoag reservation in Massachusetts.

 

"The Mashpee Wampanoag have a right to their ancestral homeland no matter what craven political games the Trump administration tries to play. Disestablishment of the Mashpee Wampanoag reservation would re-open a shameful and painful chapter of American history of systematically ripping apart tribal lands and breaking the federal government's word. We will not allow the Mashpee Wampanoag to lose their homeland. We will fight this cruel injustice that promises to have ripple effects across Indian Country."
