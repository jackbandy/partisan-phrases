Senators Markey and Warren Call for Public Health, Safety Protections at Weymouth Compressor Construction Site During Coronavirus Emergency


With Massachusetts now considered a national coronavirus "hot spot," Senators Edward J. Markey and Elizabeth Warren today called on Enbridge, Inc., the parent company of the subsidiary that is constructing the Weymouth natural gas compressor station, to provide copies of its pandemic plan and the pandemic plans for all on-site contractors, and to detail the steps the companies are taking to protect the health and safety of workers and the surrounding communities. In their letter, the Senators highlight the risks posed by site workers who are traveling to Weymouth from other projects in others states, as well as the concerns raised by the community about the compressor site's operations during the pandemic, which include allegations that more than 30 employees are working in close proximity at the construction site and lack adequate protective equipment and sanitation supplies. 

 

"Given the highly contagious nature of this disease, public health experts have recommended social distancing measures that keep physical interactions to a minimum -- a near impossibility on a construction site," write Senators Markey and Warren in their letter to Enbridge President and Chief Executive Office Al Monaco. "As Massachusetts continues to operate under a broad stay-at-home order to limit the spread of the coronavirus, we are concerned that ongoing construction could expose work crews and members of the surrounding community to coronavirus-related health and safety risks."
