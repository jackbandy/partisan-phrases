Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability Act


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, schools, libraries, healthcare providers,  and other community anchor institutions need high-capacity broadband  for distance learning, access to information, and telemedicine, but too  often, anchor institutions' need for broadband service are overlooked.  That is why I want to make sure that anchor institutions are included  in the mapping legislation under consideration today. I am pleased that  S. 1822 will enable the Federal Communications Commission to develop  more accurate and more granular broadband maps. However, in  implementing this legislation, the FCC must make sure to include anchor  institutions in its list of serviceable locations so that our broadband  maps accurately cover anchor institutions as well as residences.
