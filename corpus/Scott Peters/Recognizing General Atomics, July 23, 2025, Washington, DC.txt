Recognizing General Atomics

Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize General Atomics, a  world-leading technology company headquartered in the district I  represent, and their historic achievement of completing the ITER  Central Solenoid. This giant custom-designed magnet, 60 feet tall, 14  feet wide, and weighing over 1,000 tons, is the largest pulsed  superconducting electromagnet ever built, and it is a major step in the  long journey toward commercial fusion energy.

General Atomics was one of the early trailblazers of both nuclear  fission and fusion. Under the leadership of their chairman and CEO,  Neal Blue, General Atomics has pioneered many new innovations, from  groundbreaking advances in nuclear technology to remotely operated  aircraft, and electromagnetic systems.

Fusion energy will provide a source of virtually limitless baseload  power and a clean and safe pathway for true energy security. It is no  wonder countries across the globe are racing to achieve fusion first,  and San Diego is leading the way with the leadership of companies like  General Atomics and others.

I look forward to celebrating many more accomplishments with my  friends at General Atomics.
