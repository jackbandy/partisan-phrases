Securing America's Critical Minerals Supply Act


Mr. JAMES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas whose  devastating good looks are only exceeded by his patriotism and sense of  humor.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advance a transformative vision for our  Nation's energy future through my bill, the Securing America's Critical  Minerals Supply Act.

This legislation is a bold and necessary step to ensure that the  United States leads the world in energy innovation, security, and  independence. At a time when global supply chains are increasingly  weaponized and controlled by foreign adversaries, America cannot afford  complacency.

The Securing America's Critical Minerals Supply Act redefines the  term ``critical energy resource'' to provide the Department of Energy  with a clear and unmistakable mandate: Secure the minerals essential to  powering our energy sector and lowering costs for Americans.

This first step ensures the Department remains squarely focused on  protecting and strengthening our Nation's critical energy resources,  while making sure Americans are able to put more money in their  pockets.

Mr. Speaker, this bill could not come at a more important time.  Today, China controls more than 90 percent of global rare earth  refining capacity. Russia maintains roughly 44 percent of the world's  uranium enrichment capacity and supplies a significant share of nuclear  fuel imports to the United States. These are not just economic  statistics; they are strategic vulnerabilities.

If we are serious about an all-of-the-above energy strategy, then we  must secure the minerals that make those technologies possible.

Mr. Speaker, this is where Michigan comes into focus. Michigan's  geology is rich with opportunity. The Upper Peninsula, in particular,  holds significant deposits of copper, nickel, cobalt, and platinum  group metals, minerals essential for defense technologies and next- generation energy systems. For more than a century, the Upper Peninsula  helped power America's industrial rise. Today, it still possesses the  potential to power America's energy future.

Researchers at Western Michigan University are actively working to  map and evaluate Michigan's critical mineral potential, preserving and  analyzing decades of geological data to better understand what  resources lie beneath our soil. Their work demonstrates that Michigan  is not just a part of the conversation. We are the solution, and we  will continue to lead.

Mr. Speaker, strengthening domestic critical mineral production is  not just about national security. It is about economic revival. By  unlocking responsible--responsible--development of critical minerals in  the Upper Peninsula, we can create good-paying jobs, attract investment  back to Michigan, strengthen local supply chains, and bring new life to  communities that have long contributed to America's prosperity.  Boosting domestic mineral production means boosting Michigan's  economy, supporting miners, engineers, small businesses, and families  across our State.

My legislation directs the Department of Energy to conduct ongoing  assessments of supply chain vulnerabilities, develop strategies to  strengthen domestic production, and invest in innovative technologies  that expand American mineral independence. It equips our Nation to  counter anticompetitive tactics and human rights abuses in global  markets while ensuring our own energy systems are resilient, secure,  and self-reliant.

This is about unleashing American energy. This is about reshoring and  reindustrializing American manufacturing. This is about reducing  dependence on foreign dictators and despots. For Michigan, it is about  harnessing the full economic potential of both of our great and strong  peninsulas.

The Securing America's Critical Minerals Supply Act is a cornerstone  for building an energy-independent America, one powered by American  workers, American resources, American ingenuity, and Michigan grit.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  me in unleashing the full potential of America's energy might.
