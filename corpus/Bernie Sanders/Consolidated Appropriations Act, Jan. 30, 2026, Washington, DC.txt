Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4290 and ask  that it be reported by number.

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as part of the so-called Big Beautiful  Bill, President Trump and Republicans threw 15 million Americans off of  Medicaid through massive cuts to that program. At the same time, they  did something even more dangerous. That legislation appropriated $75  billion for ICE over a 4-year period on top of the previously  appropriated 10 billion a year.

When you give ICE that huge amount of money, you are not talking  about an agency for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. You are  talking about a domestic army, which is now terrorizing and killing  people in Minneapolis and other communities around this country. That  must end.

This amendment rescinds the 75 billion appropriation for ICE and  transfers that money to Medicaid. We don't need a domestic army in  America to terrorize people. We need to guarantee healthcare to all  Americans.
