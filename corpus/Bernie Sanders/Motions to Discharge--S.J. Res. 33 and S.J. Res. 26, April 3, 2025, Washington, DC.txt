Motions to Discharge--S.J. Res. 33 and S.J. Res. 26


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689527/motions-to-discharge-sj-res-33-and-sj-res-26


Mr. SANDERS. Pursuant to section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act, I move to discharge the Committee on Foreign Relations from  further consideration of S.J. Res. 33 and S.J. Res. 26 relating to the  disapproval of the proposed foreign military sales to the Government of  Israel of certain defense articles and services.

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by telling the American  people something that they already know, and that is, as a result of  the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, we now have a  corrupt campaign finance system that allows billionaires to buy  elections and to influence major pieces of legislation. That, I think,  is not a secret to the American people.

If you are a Republican and you vote against the Trump-Musk  administration in one way or another, you have got to look over your  shoulder and worry that you are going to get a call from Elon Musk, the  wealthiest man in the world, and he will tell you that if you vote  against what he wants, he will spend unlimited amounts of money to  defeat you in the next election. That is not a great secret. That is  what Musk has been saying publicly.

If you are a Democrat, you have to worry about the billionaires who  fund AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. If you vote  against Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his horrific war  in Gaza, AIPAC will punish you with millions of dollars in  advertisements and other ways to see that you are defeated.

AIPAC's PAC and super PAC spent nearly $127 million combined during  the 2023-2024 election cycle, according to the Federal Election  Commission. And I must confess that AIPAC has been successful. Last  year, they defeated two Members of the U.S. House who opposed providing  military aid to Netanyahu's extremist government.

Now, given all of that, I would hope that Democrats and Republicans  who understand that they were elected to protect the interests of their  constituents, not billionaire campaign contributors, would support the  ending of Citizens United and would move us toward public funding of  elections so billionaires could not continue to control the political  and legislative process.

Further, I would hope that both parties would move to end super PAC  funding in their primaries, keep the super PAC money, Musk money, AIPAC  money out of the Democrat and Republican primaries.

I would hope that that would be the case so that we can, once again,  become a government of the people, by the people, for the people, and  not a government run by the billionaire class.                                    Israel

Mr. President, I trust that every American and certainly every Member  of the Senate understands that Hamas, a terrorist organization, began  this terrible war with its barbaric October 7, 2023, attack on Israel,  which killed 1,200 innocent people and took 250 hostages.

The International Criminal Court was correct in indicting the leaders  of Hamas as war criminals for those atrocities. Clearly, Israel had the  right to defend itself against Hamas.

But most Americans also understand that while Israel had a right to  wage war against Hamas, it did not and does not have the right to wage  war against the entire Palestinian population, and, tragically, that is  exactly what we have seen over the last year and a half.

Let us be clear: Prime Minister Netanyahu's racist and extremist  government has waged an all-out, barbaric war against the Palestinian  people and made life unlivable in Gaza.

Within Gaza's population of just 2.2 million people, more than 50,000  have been killed and more than 113,000 have been injured, 60 percent of  whom are women, children, and elderly people. That is 7.4 percent of  the population of Gaza killed or wounded--7.4 percent in a year and a  half.

If those same percentages were applied to the United States, in terms  of a horrible war where our people were killed or wounded, it would  mean that over 25 million Americans would have been killed or wounded.

In total, since this war began, 15,000 children--children--in Gaza  have been killed, and today there are some 17,000 orphans. But it is  not just the dead and the wounded.

Israel's indiscriminate bombardment has damaged or destroyed two- thirds of all structures in Gaza, including 92 percent of the housing  units--as you can see from this photo. Ain't a whole lot left. I don't  know why they need any more bombs; they basically destroyed the entire  area. Nothing much left to be destroyed.

Almost no part of Gaza has been left unscathed. Most of the  population now is living in tents or other makeshift structures. Most  of the territory's hospitals and primary healthcare facilities have  been bombed, leaving virtually all Gazans without basic medical care at  a time when bombs are flying and people are being wounded, and think  about what that means. I have met repeatedly with doctors, American  doctors and others, who have served in Gaza, and they are treating  hundreds of patients a day without electricity, without anesthesia,  without clean water, including dozens of children arriving with gunshot  wounds to the head. I have seen the photographs and the videos.

Gaza's civilian infrastructure has been totally devastated, including  almost 90 percent of water and sanitation facilities. Most of the roads  in Gaza have been destroyed or made impassable. Gaza's educational  system has been obliterated. Children are not going to school.  According to the World Bank, more than 2,000 educational facilities  ranging from kindergartens to universities have been destroyed.  Hundreds of schools have been bombed, as has every single one of Gaza's  12 universities. There has been no electricity in Gaza for 17 months,  no electricity.

Put simply, Netanyahu and his extremist government have killed or  wounded over 7 percent of Gaza's population and has turned Gaza into a  wasteland unfit for human life. That is what has been going on over the  last year and a half.

In terms of where we are today, right now, the Netanyahu government  broke the cease-fire 2 weeks ago, endangering the well-being of the  remaining hostages held by Hamas.

Further, in the last 2 weeks, they have intensified their assaults  against the Palestinian people. According to UNICEF, since Netanyahu  broke the cease-fire, more than a thousand people have been killed,  including over 300 children, and more than 600 children have been  wounded in the last short period of time.

UNICEF says that most of these children were killed while sheltering  in makeshift tents or damaged homes. Just in the last 24 hours, 97 more  people have been killed in Gaza.

Since Netanyahu broke the cease-fire, even more aid workers, the  people whose job it is to try to help people who have been wounded or  hurt, more aid workers have been killed, putting the total of over  400--400--aid workers have been killed since the war began.

Earlier this week, the United Nations announced that they have  recovered the bodies of 15 emergency aid workers who were killed by  Israeli forces while wearing their emergency responder uniforms and  then dumped into a mass grave in southern Gaza.

They were buried alongside the destroyed emergency vehicles, clearly  marked ambulances, a fire truck, and a U.N. car.

With the resumption of bombing, hundreds of thousands of Gazans are  once again being forcibly displaced by bombing and evacuation orders.

This week, Israeli authorities issued displacement orders for most of  Rafah, where about 150,000 people were estimated to be sheltering.

Think about what all of this means in human terms. Throughout this  war, millions of desperately poor people, the people in Gaza, by and  large, are extremely poor. They have been repeatedly driven from their  homes. They have been forced to pick their way through a demolished  landscape again and again with nothing more than the clothes on their  backs.

Families have been herded into so-called safe zones, only to face  continued bombardment.

The children of Gaza--Mr. President, this is just one picture--have  suffered a level of physical and emotional torture that is almost  beyond comprehension and that will clearly stay with each and every one  of them for the rest of their lives.

These children are hungry. They are thirsty. It is hard to get clean  water. They have been denied healthcare. And they have witnessed the  death of their parents, their family members, their homes, and  virtually everything around them. And they have been picked up and  moved from one place to another. All the while, drones are on top of  them, shooting or photographing what they are doing.

Throughout this war, Israel's restrictions on humanitarian aid have  left hundreds of thousands of people, including tens of thousands of  children, facing malnutrition and starvation--malnutrition and  starvation. Children have literally starved to death while aid just sat  a few miles away, blocked by Israeli forces.

The U.N., the United States, and every aid organization working in  Gaza has been clear throughout this war: Israel's unreasonable and  unnecessary restrictions on humanitarian aid have contributed to  massive death and profound suffering.

But as bad as the last year and a half has been, at least Israel let  some--some, not enough, but some--aid through. But what is happening  right now is unthinkable.

Today, it is 31 days and counting with absolutely no humanitarian aid  getting into Gaza--nothing--no food, no water, no medicine, no fuel for  over a month. That is a clear violation of the Geneva Conventions, the  Foreign Assistance Act, and basic human decency.

It is a war crime. You don't starve children. And it is pushing  things toward an even deeper catastrophe.

Earlier this week, 25 bakeries supported by the World Food Programme  were forced to close because they ran out of flour and cooking gas. The  U.N. is still trying to deliver its remaining stocks of food already in  Gaza but says ``that the situation remains extremely critical since the  cargo closure of the crossings almost a month ago.''

All of this is unconscionable. What we are talking about is a mass  atrocity, and what makes it even worse, and why I am here today and why  I have introduced the resolutions that we will soon be voting on, is  that we, as Americans, are deeply complicit in all that is happening in  Gaza.

This is not some terrible event. This is not an earthquake in  Myanmar. It is not something that we had nothing to do with. We are  deeply complicit in all of this death and suffering.

Last year alone, the United States provided $18 billion in military  aid to Israel and delivered more than 50,000 tons of military  equipment. It is American bombs and American military equipment that  are being used to destroy Gaza, kill 50,000 people, and injure over  110,000 people. We cannot hide from that reality.

If we condone the barbarism that is taking place in Gaza today, we  will have no standing in the world to condemn the horrors and war  crimes that other countries may commit. You are not going to be able to  look at China or Russia or Saudi Arabia or any other country and say:  Look, how terrible. Look at what they are doing to the children, to the  women, to innocent people.

We will have no credibility because they will come back and say:  Really? You are really concerned about what China, Russia, Saudi Arabia  may be doing? Hey, take a look at what you supported in Gaza and the  billions of dollars in aid you gave to Netanyahu's government.

Today is the day to stand up to barbarism in Gaza and to do our best  to prevent future barbaric acts all over the world.

It is no secret to anyone how these U.S. weapons have been used.  Israel has bombed indiscriminately, killing civilians, journalists--a  whole lot of journalists have been killed--paramedics, children, and  humanitarian workers in record numbers. They have used massive 2,000- pound bombs in densely populated Gaza, despite the fact that studies  show that 90 percent of victims of explosive weapons used in a  populated area are civilians. These bombs have a blast radius of more  than 350 meters, yet Israel has dropped them into crowded apartment  buildings, killing hundreds of civilians, to take out a handful of  Hamas fighters.

All of that is illegal and immoral and against American law.

The Foreign Assistance Act, which is what we are talking about today,  and the Arms Export Control Act, what we are talking about today, are  very clear. The United States cannot provide weaponry to countries that  violate internationally recognized human rights or block U.S.  humanitarian aid.

According to the U.N., much of the international community, and every  humanitarian organization on the ground in Gaza, Israel is clearly in  violation of these laws. Under these circumstances, it is illegal for  the U.S. Government to provide Israel with more offensive weaponry. It  is simply against our laws.

Despite all of that, in the last month, the Trump administration has  announced its intention to transfer some $12.5 billion more in  offensive weapons--not defensive weapons, offensive weapons--to  Netanyahu's government, in clear violation of U.S. law. And that is why  we are here today.

Joint resolutions of disapproval--which is what we are dealing with  right now--are Congress's tool to enforce American law. Today, we will  vote on two resolutions to block two of the most egregious of these  Trump administration offensive arms sales, which would provide almost  $9 billion more in heavy bombs and other munitions to Netanyahu,  including more than 35,000--35,000--massive 2,000-pound bombs that have  killed so many civilians.

The first resolution, S.J. Res. 33, would block a sale of over $2  billion for 35,000 MK-84 2,000 bombs and 4,000 I-2000 penetrator  warheads.

The second resolution, S.J. Res. 26, would block almost $7 billion  for 2,800 500-pound bombs, 2,100 small-diameter bombs, and tens of  thousands of JDAM guidance kits.

All of these systems have been linked to dozens of illegal  airstrikes, including on designated humanitarian sites, resulting in  thousands of civilian casualties. These strikes have been painstakingly  documented by human rights monitors. There is no debate.

And none of these systems are defensive. None of them are necessary  to protect Israel from incoming drone or rocket attacks.

For those of my colleagues who may be ambivalent, not quite sure how  they want to vote on these resolutions, let me say a word about how the  Trump administration is ignoring the law in advancing these arms sales  in terms of the process.

Unlike Biden, whose policies on Gaza I strongly opposed--and I stood  right here, at this location, strongly opposing what Biden was doing in  terms of military aid to Israel. But unlike Biden, President Trump is  trying to circumvent Congress with these transfers, ignoring the  Foreign Assistance Act by issuing a bogus emergency declaration--an  emergency declaration to bypass congressional review.

There is no emergency to justify cutting Congress out of the process.  In fact, some of the systems the Trump administration claims are part  of this emergency sale have not yet been produced.

And this is also part of a broader Trump administration effort to cut  Congress out of the arms sales process.

It is no great secret that Congress is way out of touch with where  the American people are on issue after issue--whether it is the  economy, whether it is healthcare, whether it is climate--whatever it  may be. Everybody knows. Congress is way out of touch, and the billions  of dollars that we are providing to the Netanyahu extremist government  is just one more example of how  out of touch we are with the American people.

According to a recent Economist/YouGov poll in March, just 15 percent  of the American people support increasing military aid to Israel--15  percent--while 35 percent support decreasing military aid to Israel or  stopping it entirely.

To my Democratic colleagues, I would mention that in that same poll,  just 8 percent of Democrats support increasing military aid to Israel.  And, I think, as Democrats have held town meetings over the last year,  they have heard from those people. Eight percent of Democrats support  what we are doing now, more military aid for Israel. Forty-seven  percent support decreasing military aid to Israel or stopping it  entirely--8 percent, increasing, Democrats; 47 percent, decreasing  military aid.

Among Republicans, 9 percent are for decreasing military aid and 15  percent for stopping all--24 percent for stopping or decreasing all  military aid.

(Mr. MORENO assumed the Chair.)

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, according to a J Street poll of Jewish  voters in November, 62 percent of American Jews support withholding  ``shipments of offensive weapons like 2,000-pound bombs until Prime  Minister Netanyahu agrees to an American proposal for an immediate  ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for a release of Israeli hostages.'' And  71 percent of Jewish voters support increasing humanitarian aid to the  Palestinians.

Finally, as unbelievably horrific as the situation in Gaza is and has  been for the last year and a half, there is another development that  could make the situation even worse. It is hard to believe. It really  is, but it could. In recent months, President Trump and Israeli  officials have openly talked about forcing out--forcibly expelling--the  2.2 million people who live in Gaza, pushing them out to make way for  what Trump calls a riviera, some billionaire's playground.

Now, I think some people who may be watching this think: This can't  be true. You must be kidding. You must be lying. This is  inconceivable--pushing 2.2 million desperate people out of where they  live to create a playground for billionaires.

But a few years ago, as some may recall, Trump's son-in-law Jared  Kushner said that he felt--Jared Kushner--``Gaza's waterfront property  could be very valuable,'' floating the idea of redeveloping it. I think  that many people at the time thought that was a weird and terrible  joke. But it turns out that his father-in-law, Donald Trump, took it  seriously. Here is what Trump has said repeatedly in recent months:

The U.S. will take over the Gaza strip and we will do a job       with it.

We're going to take over that piece that we're going to       develop it.

I do see a long-term ownership position. . . . Everybody       I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning       that piece of land.

I guess he didn't speak to too many Palestinians who live on that  land.

On Truth Social, Trump wrote:

The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by       Israel at the conclusion of fighting.

What about the Palestinians who have lived in Gaza for their entire  lives? Trump said:

I don't think people should be going back to Gaza . . .       They lived like you're living in hell. Gaza is not a place       for people to be living.

Gaza could become, again, Donald Trump:

The Riviera of the Middle East, this could be something       that could be so [valuable] this could be so magnificent.

Yes, throw 2.2 million people who have suffered incalculably; throw  them out of the land in which they live in order to create a  billionaire's playground.

There is a name and a term for forcibly expelling people from where  they live. It is called ``ethnic cleansing.'' It is illegal. It is a  war crime.

Mr. President, the United States must not continue to be complicit in  the destruction of the Palestinian people. History will not forgive us  for this. The time is long overdue for us to tell the Netanyahu  government that we will not provide more weapons of destruction for  them. Instead, we must demand an immediate cease-fire, surge in  humanitarian aid, the release of the hostages, and the rebuilding of  Gaza for the Palestinian people.

For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote yes on these  two resolutions which would prevent illegal and immoral arms sales to  Netanyahu, would uphold congressional power and the rule of law, and  would protect innocent life.

I will yield to the Senator from Maryland, Senator Van Hollen.

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think Senator Risch and I live in  parallel universes. The universe that I live in is a universe which  says, yes, of course Israel has a right to defend itself against the  horrific Hamas terrorist attack of October 7, 2023. No one debates  that. But Israel did not and does not have the right to go to war  against the entire Palestinian people, in violation of international  and U.S. law.

It doesn't matter in one sense whether you don't care that 50,000  people in Gaza have been killed or 112,000 women--you don't care about  that? Fine. But you should care about American law. What the Foreign  Assistance Act says is that the United States cannot provide military  assistance to a country which is in violation of U.S. and international  law.

When you starve children, you are in violation of international law.

When you have a blockade that does not allow any humanitarian aid to  come into a desperate situation for 31 days, you are in violation of  international law.

When you kill 15,000 children and bring about malnutrition and  starvation for even more, you are in violation of international law.

What is going on right now is not some abstract horror show. We are  complicit. Those are our bombs that have destroyed or damaged 92  percent of the housing in Gaza, our bombs which have destroyed hundreds  and hundreds of schools in Gaza, our bombs which have attacked every  single one of the 12 universities in Gaza.

What we are standing here today discussing is not just Gaza. If the  United States remains complicit in this war, we are telling every other  country in the world that international law and human rights are  meaningless. You could do whatever you want, and no President will ever  be able to condemn any other country for their inhumanity. That is what  is at stake today. Do we try to maintain a shred of moral integrity in  the world or do we simply say to Netanyahu: Here are some more bombs.  Kill some more kids. Kill some more women. Bomb some more hospitals.

Is that what we do?

With that, I would yield to the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Van  Hollen.

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Van Hollen for his  extraordinary efforts today and for over a long period of time standing  up for justice and morality in the Middle East.

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, very briefly, nobody is supporting Hamas.  Hamas is a disgusting terrorist organization that began the war.

Israel had a right to defend itself against Hamas, but it did not  have the right to kill 50,000 Palestinians and wound 112,000, 60  percent of whom are women, children, and the elderly. It did not have a  right to bomb every university in Gaza.
