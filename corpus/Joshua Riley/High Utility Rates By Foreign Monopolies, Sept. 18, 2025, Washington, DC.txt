High Utility Rates By Foreign Monopolies


Mr. RILEY. Mr. Speaker, utility bills are crushing upstate New  Yorkers. I have seniors on fixed incomes who are cutting back on  groceries and working parents who are cutting back on school clothes  for their kids just to keep the lights on.

Now the utility monopolies, which are owned by foreign corporations,  are raising rates again. They are taking more and more money out of our  pockets, and they are sending it to foreign corporations to pad their  profits. They have been getting away with it for years because they  work the refs, hire lobbyists, and grease the politicians with  corporate PAC checks.

When I say that the system is rigged against the working class and in  favor of special interests, this is what I am talking about, and it  ends today. My Keep the Lights Local Act will ban foreign corporations  from owning our utilities.

Upstate New Yorkers, who are already struggling to get by, shouldn't  be forced to pay dividends to corporate executives sitting in board  rooms halfway around the world.

Keep the lights local. We are going to take our power back.
