Mr. DUNN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a truly  outstanding man, a man who served all of the people in Florida  honorably, with wisdom, and admirable class.

My dear friend, John Thrasher, passed away on May 30 at the age of  81.

John Thrasher was a highly decorated soldier, Speaker of the Florida  House, a Florida senator, president of Florida State University, father  of the Florida State University Medical School, and one of the most  gifted men I ever worked with.

Most importantly, he was an honorable man who made it his life's  mission to serve others.

It was he who introduced me to the importance of advocacy in  Washington and in Tallahassee.

He exemplified great leadership and great service to all around him.  He was loved and respected throughout Florida, and everyone will miss  his wisdom and his company.

It was an honor to know John. As people mourn his loss, please keep  his wife, Jean, and their family in your prayers.

May John rest in peace.
