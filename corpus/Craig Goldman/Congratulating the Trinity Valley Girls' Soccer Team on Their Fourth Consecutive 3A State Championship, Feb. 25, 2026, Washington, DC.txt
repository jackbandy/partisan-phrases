Mr. GOLDMAN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to proudly recognize  the Fort Worth Trinity Valley School girls' soccer team for capturing  their fourth consecutive Southwest Preparatory Conference Class 3A  state championship--an outstanding achievement that reflects sustained  excellence and dedication.

The Trinity Valley Trojans secured the title with a commanding 6-0  victory over the Episcopal School of Dallas at Jones Field, completing  an impressive 12-2 season. Freshman Paige Zavaleta and senior Alli  Zavaleta each recorded two goals in the championship match, while  senior Charlotte Goldman opened the scoring and senior Audrey Deem  added the final goal. Goldman, along with seniors Sydney Fewins, Isabel  Gonzalez, and Brown University signee Claire McKnight, were members of  all four championship teams, a truly remarkable accomplishment.

The Trojans were equally dominant on the defensive end, with  goalkeeper Blake Corder posting shutouts in both postseason matches and  anchoring a disciplined and resilient defense throughout the playoffs.

This sustained success is a testament to the leadership of Head Coach  Claire Pearce, a Trinity Valley alum who has guided both the girls'  soccer and field hockey programs to multiple conference championships.  Under her leadership, the program has fostered a culture grounded in  teamwork, accountability, and high character.

The Trinity Valley School's girls' soccer team exemplifies the very  best of high school athletics and brings great pride to their school  and the Fort Worth community. I commend the student-athletes, coaches,  and families for an outstanding season and for upholding a  distinguished tradition of excellence.

On behalf of the 12th Congressional District of Texas, I am proud to  congratulate the Trinity Valley School girls' soccer team on this  incredible state championship victory.
