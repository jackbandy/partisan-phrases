Mr. GOLDMAN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize All  Saints Episcopal School on their state championship win in the Texas  Association of Private and Parochial Schools Division II Football  Championship. This exceptional achievement is a testament to the  discipline, perseverance, and balance these students maintain in their  athletic and academic pursuits.

Throughout the season, the All-Saints football program exemplified  determination, teamwork, and an unwavering commitment to success. Under  the leadership of dedicated coaches and with the steadfast support of  their community, these student athletes secured a historic record- breaking season. Their championship win marked an impressive 28th  consecutive victory, a milestone that reflects strength and consistency  within the program. All Saints players successfully defended their 2024  state championship title, further cementing their legacy of excellence.  I am honored to represent these exceptional students and commend them  for their achievements both academically and athletically.

On behalf of the 12th Congressional District of Texas, I congratulate  the Fort Worth All Saints football team and wish them continued success  in all their future endeavors.
