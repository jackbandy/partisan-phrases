Mr. GOLDMAN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize M.L.  Leddy's boot shop for being included in the New York Times list of the  Top 50 Clothing Stores in the United States. This distinguished honor  reflects the dedication and commitment to tradition that has defined  M.L. Leddy's legacy for generations.

Since 1922, M.L. Leddy's has stood as a symbol of Texas craftsmanship  and authenticity. Situated in the heart of the Fort Worth Stockyards,  the shop stands as a lasting symbol of the area's Western heritage and  strong sense of community. While it's known for its unrivaled custom  boots and saddles, M.L. Leddy's also offers western clothing, hats,  buckles, and accessories. Each piece is crafted with meticulous  attention to detail, a time-honored technique inspired by the store's  namesake. When M.L. Leddy's first began crafting handmade boots and  saddles, he did so with the passion and drive of a young Texan in the  1920s. He and his brothers set out to make the highest quality products  while maintaining a deep commitment to customer service. This milestone  is a testament to the success of their endeavor. As a forth-generation  family business, Leddy's iconic storefront in the Fort Worth Stockyards  is much more than a preferred store, but rather shines as a living  landmark of Fort Worth History.

On behalf of the 12th Congressional District of Texas, I extend my  congratulations to M.L. Leddy's on their outstanding achievement and  wish them continued success in their future endeavors.
