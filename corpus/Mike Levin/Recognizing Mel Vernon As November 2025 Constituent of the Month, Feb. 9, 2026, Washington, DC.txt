Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Mel Vernon as my November  2025 Constituent of the Month.

Mel Vernon is an example of what it looks like to dedicate ourselves  to community engagement and cultural preservation. For more than 15  years, he has worked with teachers and educators across Southern  California to ensure the history of the Luiseno people is not  forgotten. Mel is committed every day to increasing awareness. I'm  proud to support the work of Mel and so many others who serve our  community. It is an honor to recognize his accomplishments and service  thus far.

Mel is a great community leader, author, and musician. His  preservation efforts remind us that, as a community, we benefit from  learning about and celebrating the Indigenous population that has lived  on this land for countless generations. I admire his devotion to  preservation and am grateful we have people like Mel in our district  who are dedicated to educating our communities about the great Luiseno  people.
