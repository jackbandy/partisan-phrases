Recognizing Gladys and Nelson Gonzalez


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690924/recognizing-gladys-and-nelson-gonzalez


Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak for my constituents,  Gladys and Nelson Gonzalez.

Thirty-five years ago, they came to the United States from Colombia  in search of a better life. They tried to file for asylum but received  bad legal advice from a now-disbarred attorney.

Nelson and Gladys Gonzalez raised three daughters in Laguna Niguel,  California, worked hard, paid taxes, and never got so much as a traffic  ticket.

For decades, they checked in with ICE voluntarily and were allowed to  stay in the country, but this past February, while at their ICE  appointment, they were detained, separated, and deported.

Why was a family with no criminal history, no gang affiliation, three  children, and a new grandchild a priority for deportation? We should be  using our resources to remove dangerous individuals, not those  contributing positively to our society and to our economy, not people  like Nelson and Gladys Gonzalez.

I am all for a secure border, but what we are seeing today is not the  America that I know.
