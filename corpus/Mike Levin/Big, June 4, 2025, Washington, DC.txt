Big, Ugly Bill, Clean Energy Tax Credits.


Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the big,  ugly bill, which even Elon Musk has called a ``disgusting  abomination.''

The big, ugly bill undermines the programs millions of Americans rely  on to survive, like healthcare and food assistance. Perhaps less  discussed is that it will increase your energy bills.

Right now, 80 million Americans are struggling to pay their  electricity bills, and according to a recent report in The New York  Times, this bill will make it worse.

The big, ugly bill ends tax credits to promote clean energy and will  increase household energy costs by up to $415 a year.

On top of that, ending the tax credits will lead to thousands of job  losses nationwide, in red States and blue States. This comes as demand  for electricity is surging, driving up costs even more.

Everyone in this body talks a good game about lowering costs; but  when the time came to actually do something about costs, my House  colleagues voted to put Big Oil CEOs over the American people.

I urge my friends in the Senate to fix this mess and actually lower  energy prices for the American people.
