Clean Air Isn't A Partisan Issue


Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support California's right to  clean air. Growing up in southern California in the 1980s, smog alerts  were a regular part of life. A lap around the track at school and your  chest would burn. We can't go back to those days.

When President Richard Nixon signed the Federal Clean Air Act in  1970, California, under Governor Ronald Reagan, was given a waiver,  letting us set stricter air pollution rules than the Federal  Government.

Over the years, Republican and Democratic leaders alike, from  Governors Reagan to Jerry Brown to Arnold Schwarzenegger, stood  together to protect California's right to clean up our air. Now House  Republicans are trying to strip away California's ability to set our  own air pollution standards. So much for State's rights.

After all the progress we have made, they want to turn back the clock  and do the bidding of the big polluters.

Clean air is not a partisan issue. It is a public health issue, and I  will never stop fighting to protect it.
