Trump's One Big, Ugly Bill


Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to Trump's one  big, ugly bill which would cut Medicaid by $715 billion and devastate  access to healthcare for millions of Americans, like Victoria. She is a  young graduate student in the Imperial Valley, a rural and impoverished  region.

She says: ``Medi-Cal is the only way I can access essential  healthcare. It protects me from financial hardship and ensures I can  get the care I need to live and thrive.''

Victoria isn't alone. She speaks for millions who rely on Medicaid  for basic services like birth control and cancer screenings. In fact,  the Congressional Budget Office warns that this bill would cause at  least 13.7 million people to lose coverage.

Mr. Speaker, 42 percent of my constituents depend on Medicaid, and 60  percent of children in the district depend on Medicaid. Republicans are  choosing to strip healthcare from those who need it most to provide tax  cuts to billionaires.

Mr. Speaker, I choose to protect healthcare for working-class  families, and I urge my colleagues to stand with Victoria and protect  Medicaid.
