Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week to  honor the bravery, sacrifice, and service of law enforcement officers  across California's 25th District and our Nation.

I thank every officer in my district, from city departments to county  and Federal agencies, for putting their lives on the line to keep our  communities safe.

On May 2, the 17th Annual Imperial Valley Law Enforcement Memorial  Ceremony brought our community together in El Centro to remember the 49  officers who made the ultimate sacrifice in their service to the  Imperial Valley.

This week, the Riverside County Sheriff's Office held its own  memorial, recommitting to their mission to protect and serve. This is a  sad reminder that each day police and first responders make the  ultimate sacrifice for their communities.

That is why Congress needs to do more to support officers and their  surviving families. We must pass my legislation, the Heroes Lesley  Zerebny and Gilbert Vega First Responders Survivors Support Act, which  increases and improves access to financial and educational benefits for  the families of the fallen or disabled officers.

Let's honor our officers not just with words but with meaningful  actions that support their well-being and their family's well-being and  safety.
