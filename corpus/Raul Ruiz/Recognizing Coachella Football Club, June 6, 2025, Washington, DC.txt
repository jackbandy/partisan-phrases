Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with pride to recognize the  Coachella Football Club, an awesome soccer organization from  California's 25th District that is lifting up young athletes and  inspiring our entire community.

This past year, the Coachella Football Club's Premier team, our semi- pro squad, dominated the field. They were SoCal East season champions  and went undefeated in the divisional playoffs. Coached by Aldo Caro  and Octavio Bustillos, this team played one of their best seasons yet,  and we are so proud of them.

They are not alone. The Coachella Football Club's Academy's 17-and- under boys' team also had a phenomenal run, winning the fall 2024 and  spring 2025 SoCal East championships without a single loss. Thanks to  Coaches Manuel Montano and Carlos Bustillos, they have set the bar for  excellence, teamwork, and sportsmanship.

A special congratulations to Coachella Football Club owner Luis  Bustillos, who founded the team with a vision to help players turn  their dreams into reality. He calls the club a dream factory and  continues to inspire his players to dream big.

I thank every Coachella Football Club player and coach for  representing our district with grit, heart, and pride. Their success  reminds us all what is possible when talent meets dedication.
