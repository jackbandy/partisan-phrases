U.S. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $145,510 in federal funding to help offset the cost of preparing and responding to the coronavirus health crisis. The City of Binghamton received $87,502 and the City of Albany Courthouse received $58,008.

"These critical dollars will help keep the fight against the virus going strong," said Senator Schumer. "New York is the frontline of the COVID-19 battle, and our cities must have the proper support to react, respond, and recover from its devastating effects. I have and will continue to do everything in my power to deliver for New Yorkers in this time of crisis."

"New Yorkers are at the epicenter of COVID-19 and are struggling to meet the financial demands of fighting this health crisis," said Senator Gillibrand. "It is imperative that our cities have the tools and resources necessary to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus. I am proud to have fought to secure this funding, and I will continue to advocate for New Yorkers during this pandemic."
