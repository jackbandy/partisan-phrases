Statement: Gillibrand Votes Against "Shameful' Phase III Coronavirus Package


Addressing her vote against the phase three coronavirus response package put forth by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand released the following statement: 

"Our country is in the midst of an unprecedented public health and economic crisis, and Congress has a duty to provide leadership. Instead of supporting American families, Senator McConnell put forth a stimulus package that bails out corporations and puts powerful moneyed interests ahead of people. I'm proud of my vote against this shameful legislation. I will continue fighting in the Senate to ensure the next stimulus package is fair, equitable, and includes paid sick and family leave for all workers."
