Schumer, Gillibrand announce over $9 million in emergency federal funding for Upstate housing assistance


U.S. Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $9,220,564 in federal funding allocated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This funding was secured under the CARES Act for Tenant-Based Rental Assistance, which funds the HUD Housing Choice Voucher Program. The program supports activities that help or maintain the health and safety of assisted individuals and families. Additionally, the program covers increased subsidy and administrative expenses incurred by public housing authorities (PHAs). 

"Every New Yorker deserves a safe and secure place to call home, and this federal investment I worked tirelessly to negotiate gets us one step closer to that goal," said Senator Schumer. "As New York still reels from the devastating effects of the ongoing pandemic, we need to do all we can to support affordable housing for our most vulnerable residents. I will always fight tooth and nail for resources that keep New Yorkers safe, especially during these challenging times."

"As public health officials continue to urge people across the country to stay home, we need to make sure that we provide the necessary support to vulnerable New Yorkers hit hardest by the economic impacts caused by COVID-19," said Senator Gillibrand. "This funding will help provide New Yorkers with access to safe and affordable housing during these uncertain times. I am proud to have fought to secure this funding allocated in the CARES Act, and I will continue to advocate for New Yorkers during this pandemic."
