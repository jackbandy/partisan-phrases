Senator Gillibrand Statement on Vote to Convict President Trump


Addressing her votes to convict President Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, Senator Gillibrand issued the following statement:

"The Senate failed the American people today. Despite overwhelming evidence that President Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress, Senate Republicans voted to acquit him, putting their personal ambitions and political futures ahead of the Constitution they swore to uphold.

"I voted to convict President Trump because I believe in our democracy and our Constitution. No man or woman is above the law, especially the president.

"History will remember those who stood up for our country and the rule of law, as well as those who were complicit in the degradation of our democracy. I am proud to be the former."
