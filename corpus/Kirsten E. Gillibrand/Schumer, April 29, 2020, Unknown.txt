Schumer, Gillibrand announce over $1.8 million in CARES Act emergency funding for Capital Region health research centers


As part of the Schumer-negotiated CARES Act, which included economic relief for health research centers located in the Capital Region , U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $1,883,663 in federal funding allocated by Health and Human Services (HHS). Specifically, Health Research, Inc. will be receiving $1,770,657 as part of the Coronavirus Hospital Improvement grant, and The Research Foundation for the State University of New York will be receiving $113,006 to support their poison control center.

"As we continue to battle the coronavirus pandemic, it's imperative that our great research institutions get all the federal tools they need to support New York's COVID response," said Senator Schumer. "I'm proud to have secured this vital funding in the CARES Act, that will offset the devastating financial impacts that COVID-19 has had on health research, and allow the Capital Region to upkeep and improve health services to New Yorkers."

"New Yorkers are at the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak and are struggling to meet the financial demands of fighting this health crisis," said Senator Gillibrand. "It is imperative that our cities have the tools and resources necessary to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus. I am proud to have fought to secure this funding to further health research in the Capital Region, and I will continue to advocate for New Yorkers during this pandemic."
