Gillibrand Statement On Republicans Voting To Block Witnesses And Relevant Documents In The Impeachment Trial Of President Trump


U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today released the following statement on Republicans voting to block witnesses and relevant documents in the impeachment trial of President Trump:

"This is a sad day for our democracy and an ominous chapter in our nation's history. Despite pledging to do impartial justice, Republicans conducted a sham trial from the beginning, voting to bar witnesses with first-hand knowledge of the president's crimes, and blocking the admission of relevant documents."

It's clear that Senate Republicans will vote to acquit the president, and in doing so, will excuse proven criminality for political expediency. As we head into an election year, Republicans have declared that President Trump has free rein to pressure foreign governments into investigating his political opponents, even if his actions threaten our national security and the security of our allies. This is an abject failure of congressional oversight and a betrayal of our constitutional duty."
