Schumer, Gillibrand announce over $16.5 million in emergency federal funding for coronavirus testing in Upstate New York


U.S. Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $16,790,380 in federal funding to help health centers in Upstate New York respond to and contain the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, this funding will help health centers purchase, administer, and expand the use of COVID-19 testing. The funding was allocated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through the Expanding Capacity for Coronavirus Testing (ECT) program. 

"Testing is essential to our COVID-19 response and to the successful reopening of the Upstate economy without triggering a second wave of infections," said Senator Schumer. "This funding provides the essential expansion of testing needed to beat back the virus and for life to go back to normal. I am proud to have secured this vital funding for New York and will continue to fight tooth and nail for a fully-funded testing strategy that keeps New Yorkers safe."

"To contain the spread of this disease and safely reopen schools and businesses, we must make COVID-19 testing widely available for all Americans," said Senator Gillibrand. "Our state has faced more cases of COVID-19 than any other state and this critical funding will make testing and treatment more accessible in Upstate New York. As we fight to flatten the curve, I will continue to advocate for the resources needed during this pandemic."
