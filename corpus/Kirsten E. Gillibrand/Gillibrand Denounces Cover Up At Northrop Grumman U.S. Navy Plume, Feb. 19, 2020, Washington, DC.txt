Gillibrand Denounces Cover Up At Northrop Grumman U.S. Navy Plume


In response to a recent report from Newsday detailing the cover up by the U.S. Navy and Northrop Grumman following the known contamination of groundwater by toxic chemicals from their operations, U. S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand released the following statement: 

 "For decades, Northrop Grumman and the U.S. Navy polluted our water and exposed Long Island families to dangerous toxic chemicals. But rather than do anything to fix their mess, Grumman and the U.S. Navy dragged their feet, lied about the danger, and endangered public health and our communities. I am committed to holding the U.S. Navy and Grumman accountable for cleaning up the plume, and will not rest until our families are safe from pollution."
