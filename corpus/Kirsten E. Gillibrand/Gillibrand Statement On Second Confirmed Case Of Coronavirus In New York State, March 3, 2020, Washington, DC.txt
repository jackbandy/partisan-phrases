Gillibrand Statement On Second Confirmed Case Of Coronavirus In New York State


Addressing the announcement of the second confirmed case of coronavirus in New York State, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand released the following statement:

"As multiple cases of coronavirus have now been confirmed in New York, I want to reassure New Yorkers that my office is working to develop and implement a robust and strategic response that keeps them safe.

I am working to increase funding for our response and to ensure that our government has the resources it needs to combat coronavirus. Federal agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services must use their resources to monitor and prevent the spread of coronavirus, distribute tests to every community in the country, and develop and administer a vaccine to every person in America.  

With cases of coronavirus expected to rise, it is essential that New Yorkers have the facts and resources to educate themselves and their families. I urge New Yorkers to follow the advice of health professionals and to visit cdc.gov, nyc.gov/doh and health.ny.gov for more information."
