Gillibrand Statement On HHS Secretary Alex Azar Refusing To Guarantee Coronavirus Vaccine Will Be Affordable For Every American


Addressing Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar's suggestion that a coronavirus vaccine may not be affordable for every American, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand released the following statement:

"Secretary Azar's refusal to guarantee that the coronavirus vaccine will be affordable for every American is outrageous. I voted against Secretary Azar because I was concerned about his coziness with the pharmaceutical industry and his comments have proven my concerns right. Our only focus should be ensuring that every American has access to a vaccine, not whether big pharma stands to make a profit. I will work to ensure that once there is a safe and tested vaccine, it will be widely available for all who need it."
