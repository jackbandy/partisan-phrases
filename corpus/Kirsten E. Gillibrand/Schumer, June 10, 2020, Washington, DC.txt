Schumer, Gillibrand announce over $400 million in federal funding to address housing insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic


U.S. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $400,531,196 in federal funding allocated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the Emergency Solutions Grant-Coronavirus (ESG-CV) program. This second round of ESG funding was secured under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and will be used to mitigate COVID-19's impact on New Yorkers experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness.

"Every New Yorker deserves a safe and secure place to call home, and this federal investment I worked tirelessly to negotiate gets us one step closer to that goal," said Senator Schumer. "As New York still reels from the devastating effects of the ongoing pandemic, we need to do all we can to support affordable housing for our most vulnerable residents.  I will always fight tooth and nail for resources that keep New Yorkers safe, especially during these challenging times."

"The need for secure housing is especially urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic as it threatens the health and economic safety of millions of New Yorkers," said Senator Gillibrand. "This funding will help provide New Yorkers with access to safe housing during these uncertain times by supporting homelessness prevention shelters and service providers. I am proud to have fought to secure this funding allocated in the CARES Act, and I will continue to advocate for New Yorkers during this pandemic."
