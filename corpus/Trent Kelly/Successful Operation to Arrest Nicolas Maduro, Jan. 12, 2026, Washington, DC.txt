Successful Operation to Arrest Nicolas Maduro


Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding to me.

Mr. Speaker, America is safer today. A narcoterrorist and an  illegitimate government leader, Nicolas Maduro, is removed from office  and is awaiting trial in the United States of America.

One of the clearest responsibilities of the President is ensuring  that those who endanger American lives are brought to face justice. He  did just that.

When Nicolas Maduro continued to operate with impunity, President  Trump made the decision to enforce United States law and protect our  national security interests.

Nicolas Maduro was not a legitimate leader. He was an indicted  narcoterrorist who helped turn Venezuela into a hub for drug  trafficking, corruption, and foreign influence that directly threatened  the United States and our allies. For a year, there was bipartisan  agreement on this fact. The difference is President Trump acted.

As Secretary of State Marco Rubio made clear, this was a limited law  enforcement action carried out with precision to enforce U.S. laws and  protect our homeland.

The message is clear: The Western Hemisphere is our home. It cannot  and will not become a safe haven for drug cartels, Iranian proxies, or  hostile actors who seek to undermine our security and poison our  communities.

This action made clear that the United States is serious about  defending our national interests and holding criminals accountable, not  through rhetoric but through results.

I express my deep gratitude to the law enforcement officers,  servicemembers, and intelligence professionals who carried out this  operation. Their discipline and professionalism reflect the highest  standards of our Nation.

I thank President Trump for his actions. He did not escalate a  conflict. He enforced the law.
