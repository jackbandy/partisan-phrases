Klobuchar, Smith, Hagedorn Announce $1 Million for Infrastructure Improvements in Winona


U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith along with Representative Jim Hagedorn (MN-1) announced that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) $1,000,000 in grant funding to improve infrastructure in Winona. The award will allow MnDOT to complete a project on Broadway Street, including reducing the roadway from four lanes to three lanes over 1.9 miles and adding sidewalks and pedestrian ramps to improve safety.

"This funding will help pave the way for improvements in Winona's infrastructure and make our roads and pedestrian byways safer," Klobuchar said. "I am pleased that we were able to secure this critical investment that will improve safety and infrastructure in our state."

"It's critical that Minnesotans' voices are heard in Washington, and that our government puts real dollars behind priorities that make communities work better," Smith said. "I'm glad to see the Department of Transportation investing in Winona's infrastructure. This grant will help make Broadway Street a safer place for pedestrians and drivers alike."

"These infrastructure improvements will help make our southern Minnesota communities safer and improve the standard of living for rural residents," Hagedorn said. "Thanks to Senator Klobuchar and Senator Smith for their bipartisan cooperation in securing these funds."
