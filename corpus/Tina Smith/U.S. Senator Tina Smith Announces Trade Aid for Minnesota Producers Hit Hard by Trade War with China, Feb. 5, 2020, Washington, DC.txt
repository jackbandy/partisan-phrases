U.S. Senator Tina Smith Announces Trade Aid for Minnesota Producers Hit Hard by Trade War with China


U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.)--a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee--announced that this week a third round of Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments will be made to farmers in Minnesota and across the country crippled by the Administration's trade war with China. 

Sen. Smith said that these payments made by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) will support eligible producers participating in the MFP. 

"These payments will help address the economic damage the trade war with China has inflicted on Minnesota farmers and rural communities," said Sen. Smith. "The trade war has not only left our producers without a significant market for their farm products, but also depressed farm prices and left many without any place to store their crops. Fortunately, the recent passage of the bipartisan United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which I supported, will provide important stability and market access for Minnesota producers. Moving forward, I will continue to push the Administration to ensure that China follows through with its recent promises to buy American products."
