Klobuchar, Smith, Stauber Announce $10.5 Million for Infrastructure Improvements at Duluth Seaway Port Authority


U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Tina Smith (D-MN), along with Representative Pete Stauber (R-MN-08), announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded the Duluth Seaway Port Authority $10,500,000 to fund a rail-served warehouse and rehabilitate the wharf's walls.

"Critical investments in our infrastructure serve as a down payment on the long-term economic well-being of our state and country," Klobuchar said. "The Port of Duluth supports industries from agriculture to manufacturing--it's the largest and busiest port on the Great Lakes serving nearly 900 vessels and an average of 35 million short tons of cargo per year. This investment will help support future economic growth in the region."

"This port is vital to the success of our nation's economy, and to the state of Minnesota. The Duluth Seaway Port Authority receiving this important investment signals that the federal government understands that, and I will always advocate to support this critical waterway," Smith said.

"The Port of Duluth is integral to transporting the food, materials, and other vital goods from northern Minnesota to other parts of the world. By investing in this port, we are ensuring reliable operations for years to come, and continued economic prosperity by extension. During my time as a St. Louis County Commissioner, I was appointed to serve on the board of the Port Authority, so I know the economic importance of a viable port and am proud to have helped secure this grant in my current role as Congressman. I thank Secretary Chao for listening and taking action to help Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District," Stauber said.
