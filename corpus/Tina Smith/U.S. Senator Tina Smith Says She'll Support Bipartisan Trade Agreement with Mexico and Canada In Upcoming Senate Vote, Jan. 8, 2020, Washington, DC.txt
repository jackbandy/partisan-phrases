U.S. Senator Tina Smith Says She'll Support Bipartisan Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada In Upcoming Senate Vote


Today, U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.)--a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee--announced that she'll support the bipartisan United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) when it comes up for a vote in the Senate. 

Sen. Smith's announcement comes after she helped secure key improvements to the agreement that strengthen protections for workers and improve access to affordable medicines. The USMCA also includes measures Sen. Smith has been fighting hard for to open new markets for U.S. dairy exports and end unfair Canadian milk pricing rules that hurt U.S. farmers.

"I've long said that I want to vote for a trade agreement that lifts up workers, businesses, agriculture and consumers--and today I'm announcing that I'll vote for the USMCA when it comes before the Senate," said Sen. Smith. "Trade affects almost every aspect of Minnesota's diverse economy. This deal will provide important stability and market access for Minnesota agriculture--particularly dairy farmers--as well as other Minnesota products.

"Just as important, I'm glad to have helped secure key improvements to protect workers and improve the agreement's drug pricing provisions. I hope that the Senate will approve this important trade agreement as soon as possible."
