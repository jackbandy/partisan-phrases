Klobuchar, Smith Announce Funding to Assist Monitor Water Quality Monitoring in Grand Portage


U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith announced $40,000 in grant funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to monitor water quality in Grand Portage. The funds will be used to purchase a vehicle in order to better track human health and water quality on the reservation to ensure that Grand Portage's officials will have consistent, up-to-date, local water quality data available. Reliably gathering and updating this information will help Grand Portage maintain, restore, and improve water quality within the reservation boundaries.

"Investments in clean water serve as a down payment on the long-term well-being of tribal communities and our state," Klobuchar said. "This critical funding will help ensure that Grand Portage can continue to improve and maintain quality water and infrastructure."

"We must protect the waters, the land and the air that we all share," Smith said. "This investment will help improve water quality within reservation boundaries as well as support the health of folks living in Grand Portage. It's so important that the federal government listen to and work with leaders in Indian Country to keep up the momentum to care for our environment in a way that makes sense for all."
