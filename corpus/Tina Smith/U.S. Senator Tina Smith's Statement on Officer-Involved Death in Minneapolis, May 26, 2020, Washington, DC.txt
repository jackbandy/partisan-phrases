U.S. Senator Tina Smith's Statement on Officer-Involved Death in Minneapolis


Today, U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) released the following statement after a video surfaced showing a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, who died soon after. 

"We are once again traumatized by the tragic scene of a black man pleading for his life at the hands of a white police officer. We cannot look away from this injustice and terrible loss of life.

"Mayor Frey and Chief Arradondo have called for an immediate federal investigation. That's the right thing to do. We must learn exactly what happened, secure justice, and hold the people involved accountable. It is in our power to end this pattern of abuse and death against black people. It's our moral responsibility."
