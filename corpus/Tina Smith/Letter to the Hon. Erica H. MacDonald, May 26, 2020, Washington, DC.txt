Letter to the Hon. Erica H. MacDonald, US Attorney and Michael O. Freeman, Hennepin County Attorney - Omar, Klobuchar, Smith, McCollum Call for Accountability for George Floyd's Death


Dear Ms. MacDonald and Mr. Freeman:We write to express our outrage over the death of George Floyd at the hands of the MinneapolisPolice Department on the night of May 25, 2020, and to request that federal, state, and localauthorities undertake a thorough investigation into the events that led to this tragedy. While weunderstand that the facts are still coming to light, and that state and local authorities arereviewing the case, we believe that the seriousness of the incident requires additionalindependent oversight by law enforcement at all levels. We urge you to ensure that all evidenceis quickly secured, including all video footage, and to aggressively pursue justice.According to reports, George Floyd, who police suspected of committing forgery, was unarmedwhile he was handcuffed and appeared to be experiencing medical distress.1 Video evidencefrom the incident shows an officer kneeling on Mr. Floyd¶s neck as he pleaded for his life. Atone point, Floyd can be heard telling police, "I can¶t breathe.´ The video continues to showFloyd stating, "my stomach hurt, my neck hurt, everything hurts.´ Shortly after, Floyd appears tolose consciousness while on the ground. A bystander is heard asking police to check Floyd¶spulse, but the officer did not remove his knee from Floyd¶s neck until the ambulance arrived.Eyewitnesses state that Floyd then appeared motionless before he was put on a stretcher and intoan ambulance. After being transported by ambulance, he was announced dead at HennepinCounty Medical Center, according to police.2Mr. Floyd¶s death appears to be yet another horrifying instance of excessive force leading to thedeath of African Americans across this country. In addition to the obvious state laws that willgovern this case, federal law makes it a crime for a state or local police officer to willfully violate a person¶s constitutional rights, which includes the use of excessive force.3 We also askthat you consider the arresting officer¶s past involvement in any other alleged incidents ofmisconduct.We urge you to conduct a thorough investigation at the federal, state, and local level into whatoccurred and hold all those involved in this incident accountable.
