Letter to the Hon. Jovita Carranza, Admin. of the Small Business Administration - Minnesota Congressional Delegation Urges Small Business Administration to Provide Critical Assistance to Minnesota Businesses in Response to Coronavirus Pandemic


Dear Administrator Carranza:

We write to you in strong support of Minnesota's request for a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) declaration under 13 C.F.R. ยง 123.3 to provide assistance in the form of SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) for Minnesota businesses suffering economic harm as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We urge you to approve a statewide EIDL Declaration to assist the business community throughout our state.  

The COVID-19 pandemic has already had a significant impact on small businesses throughout Minnesota--including those in and associated with the hospitality, educational support, retail, and restaurant industries. The measures necessary to help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 have resulted in canceled events, closures of schools and businesses, and a dramatic decline in revenues in key sectors of our economy.

We have heard directly from Minnesota small business owners about the substantial losses that they are now facing due to the COVID-19 disaster, which is causing extensive economic damage in our state and which necessitates financial assistance from the federal government.

Thank you for your attention to this critical request. We look forward to working with you to protect our small businesses.
