U.S. Senator Tina Smith's Statement on President Trump's State of the Union Address


This evening, U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) released the following statement in response to President Trump's State of the Union Address:

"I thank Duluth Mayor Emily Larson for being my guest at the State of the Union Address. Mayor Larson has been a strong leader on housing and health care, and we have worked together to increase access to affordable housing and make health care, and especially prescription drugs, more affordable.

"The number one issue I hear about from Minnesotans is the high cost of health care, and skyrocketing prescription drug prices. Tonight President Trump talked about bringing health care costs down, but at the same time his administration is fighting in court to repeal the Affordable Care Act, kick people off of health insurance, and take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Minnesotans and Americans want a President committed to putting his words into action, which this President has failed to do when it comes to health care."
