U.S. Senator Tina Smith Continues Fight to Strengthen Workers' Rights and Wages


U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) helped introduce a bill to prohibit states from passing "right-to-work" laws that make it harder for workers to form unions, fight for higher wages and push for better working conditions.

Right now, under "right-to-work" laws, some members are not paying dues despite the fact that they benefit from a union. This is draining key resources used by unions to fight for workers' rights. 

"I believe that workers have a fundamental right to join together for fair wages, benefits and improved working conditions," said Sen. Smith. "But right now, so-called "right-to-work' laws are undermining workers' ability to join together to fight for better pay and working conditions. It's time to lift up workers and their families, and put a stop to unfair "right-to-work' laws once and for all."

The Nationwide Right to Unionize Act is also supported by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawai'i), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).
