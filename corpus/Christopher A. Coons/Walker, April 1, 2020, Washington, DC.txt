Walker, Cleaver, Scott, Coons Call for April to be National Month of Prayer


With COVID-19 modeling showing April will be a potentially devastating month across the nation, U.S. Representatives Mark Walker (R-N.C.) and Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) and U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) today called for our country to come together in non-denominational, private, and voluntary prayer at Noon every day.

"In April, we ask our nation to come together in prayer at Noon each day to help lift up those suffering from COVID-19, protect our health care professionals and first responders, and bring clarity and strength to the Coronavirus Task Force and state public health officials leading our response.

Be it after the shootings at Mother Emanuel church or the horrific attacks on September 11, 2001, in times of tragedy, our country often turns to faith and prayer to unite us in common resolve. With the projected death toll from coronavirus currently estimating at least 100,000 people, we can all do our part -- from social distancing and washing our hands to keeping those on the frontlines of this battle in our prayers each day.
