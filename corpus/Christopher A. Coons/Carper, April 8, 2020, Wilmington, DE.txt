Carper, Coons, Blunt Rochester announce $7 million in CARES Act grants from HUD


Today, U.S. Senators Tom Carper, Chris Coons and Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester (all D-Del.) announced grant awards totaling nearly $7 million from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to Delaware from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. 

These HUD grants are distributed through its Community Development Block Grant, Emergency Solutions Grant, and Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS programs to help Delaware combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  

"This funding is crucial for our most vulnerable populations in Delaware," said Senator Carper. "From providing homeless assistance to helping those who are immunocompromised stay healthy during this pandemic, these grants will help our cities and agencies meet the needs of our neighbors."

"With nearly $7 million in new housing and community development grants, our partners across the state of Delaware can better serve those most in need -- from individuals experiencing homelessness to the immunocompromised," said Senator Coons. "In my role on the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to identify ways the federal government can bolster local efforts as we battle COVID-19."

"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, I've been very concerned about at-risk populations, and in particular, those who are homeless or who are immunocompromised," said Rep. Blunt Rochester. "We will continue our work to ensure that those vulnerable populations can secure the housing they need and deserve during this crisis."

"Each day our partners throughout the Mid-Atlantic are working to overcome the challenges presented by COVID-19," said Joe DeFelice, regional administrator for HUD's Mid-Atlantic region. "The innovation and collaboration have been remarkable--and heartwarming. In Delaware, the Continuum of Care, in collaboration with New Castle County and with assistance from the City of Wilmington, used the County's Community Development Block Grant public service dollars to rent portable toilets and sinks--creating handwashing stations for those who had no place to go once libraries, restaurants and shops were closed to the public. There are so many powerful stories like this one, of neighbors helping neighbors. With this new funding, nearly $7 million in the First State alone, there will be many more opportunities to help those who are and will be in need due to the pandemic. I look forward to the day when this is all behind us, and I can thank all who stepped up face-to-face." 

"This much needed infusion of federal funds will help to mitigate the devastating effects of the COVID-19 crisis on Wilmington's most disadvantaged residents," said Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki. "We will continue to work with our federal delegation and agencies throughout this continuing crisis because we are united in our efforts to ensure that vulnerable City residents are sheltered, fed and safe."
