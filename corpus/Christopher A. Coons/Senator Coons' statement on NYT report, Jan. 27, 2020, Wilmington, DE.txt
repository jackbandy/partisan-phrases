Senator Coons' statement on NYT report, Bolton book


U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees, released the following statement in response to a New York Times report that President Trump's former National Security Advisor, John Bolton, has written in his forthcoming book that President Trump froze military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure Ukraine's President Zelensky to announce an investigation into the Bidens and into whether Ukraine interfered in the 2016 American presidential election. "If the reported description of Ambassador Bolton's upcoming book is accurate, this account provides firsthand, relevant evidence that President Trump committed the abuse of power for which he was impeached by the House. "This report further underlines why my Republican colleagues should be working across the aisle to ensure we hear relevant testimony and receive documents from Ambassador Bolton, along with Mick Mulvaney, Robert Blair, and Michael Duffey, who should testify before the Senate. "Congressman Schiff wisely cautioned all Senators just last week that - eventually - the full truth about the President's actions will come out. It's our duty to ensure the truth comes out before the ongoing impeachment trial concludes."
