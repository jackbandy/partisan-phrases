Sen. Coons "excited about this package and excited to get it out the door'


Today, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) joined CNBC Squawk Box to discuss the deal made early Wednesday between the Senate and the White House on a $2 trillion spending package.  This third COVID-19 response package offers $150 billion in support for states and counties, expanded unemployment insurance, critical resources for hospitals, and increased transparency measures on a $500 billion fund to aid struggling industries.

"It's the moment for us to focus on delivering, you know, personal protective equipment to hospitals and doctors and nurses, delivering test kits, restarting our economy, saving jobs. There are millions of people who are desperate for this assistance," said Senator Coons. "The things that Democrats stood firm for -- expanding unemployment [insurance], helping states and counties, investing in hospitals, transparency on the big fund -- it was worth a day wait. I'm excited about this package and excited to get it out the door."
