Sens. Coons, Rubio introduce bipartisan bill to strengthen U.S.-Israel strategic alliance


U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced the United States-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act of 2020, a bipartisan bill that strengthens the U.S.-Israel strategic alliance by authorizing $3.3 billion in annual security assistance consistent with the U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding and supports Israel's ability to address both conventional and emerging threats. At a moment of great uncertainty in the Middle East, this bill will ensure Israel, our strongest ally in the region, has what it needs to defend itself. "The events of the past few days are a stark reminder of the importance of U.S. assistance to Israel's security. While we work to de-escalate tensions in the region, I remain committed to the security of our allies in the Middle East," Coons said. "The assistance included in this bill will help Israel protect itself in a time of great uncertainty in the region; deter -- and if necessary defend against -- Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas; and deepen bilateral U.S.-Israel ties for decades to come." "The people of Israel face unprecedented threats from Iran's terror-sponsoring regime in Tehran, Iranian-backed proxies like Hezbollah, and other malign actors in the region. In the wake of recent threats from the Iranian regime and their proxies, we must ensure that our allies in the region are prepared to defend themselves." Rubio said. "This important bipartisan legislation advances America's interest in the region and helps to keep Israel safe."
