S. 3012


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696375/s-3012


Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, the Senate remains at an impasse over the  renewal of soon-to-expire health insurance premium tax credits under  the Affordable Care Act. Americans' health insurance premiums will  skyrocket in 2026 unless the Congress acts to renew these subsidies.  Time is running out to solve this problem. The enrollment period for  next year's insurance plans opens in just 9 days. The Trump  administration's intransigent refusal to work across the aisle to  negotiate a solution has resulted in the ongoing government shutdown.

During this shutdown, military servicemembers, air traffic  controllers, and TSA employees are among those who simply must come to  work despite the lapse in congressional appropriations. They should be  paid for that work. That is why today I voted to proceed to  consideration of S. 3012, the Shutdown Fairness Act, sponsored by the  Senator from Wisconsin. Senators from both parties should work together  to ensure payment of military servicemembers and others in critical  roles, including controllers, TSA workers, and those working at  Georgia's CDC. Debate of this bill should include an amendment process  to improve the bill, including by limiting the President's unilateral  authority to determine which Federal workers are paid and which are  not. Such authority could be abused by an executive determined to pay  favored Federal workers and deny disfavored Federal workers pay without  regard for congressional appropriations.
