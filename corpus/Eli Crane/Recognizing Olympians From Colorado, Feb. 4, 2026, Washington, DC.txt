Recognizing Olympians From Colorado


Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight Colorado as a top  producer of Olympians representing Team USA at the 2026 Olympic Winter  Games in Milano Cortina.

Colorado's Fifth Congressional District is known as Olympic City USA,  with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee headquarters in Colorado  Springs.

Today, I am honored to highlight three incredible athletes on Team  USA who reside in my hometown of Colorado Springs: Amber Glenn, Danny  O'Shea, and Ellie Kam. They are among the 16 U.S. figure skaters  nominated to the 2026 U.S. Olympic team.

Mr. Speaker, Colorado's Fifth Congressional District will be rooting  for Amber, Danny, and Ellie as they compete in the next few weeks.

Mr. Speaker, with the opening ceremonies taking place this Friday, I  ask you to join me in wishing them success in their careers and to  bring the gold home for Team USA.
