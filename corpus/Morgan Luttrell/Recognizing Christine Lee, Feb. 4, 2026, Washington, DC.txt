Recognizing Christine Lee

Mr. LUTTRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor an  extraordinary public servant, a trusted leader, and dear friend, my  chief of staff, Ms. Christine Lee, who is actually retiring after a  distinguished career in public service.

In this Chamber, we often speak about policy, votes, and headlines,  but behind every office, behind every Member, there are people whose  work rarely show up in the Congressional Record, people who make the  institution function, who keep the mission on course, and who serve  quietly with excellence every single day.

For years, she has been a steady hand guiding our office. She brought  clarity when things were complicated, calm when things were chaotic,  and purpose when the days were long. She understood that public service  isn't about credit. It is about responsibility. She carried that  responsibility with integrity, discipline, and grace.

As chief of staff, she did far more than manage schedules and  operations. She shaped culture. She built a team that worked hard,  treated people with respect, and never lost sight of why we are here:  to serve the American people, especially the veterans and families who  depend on us.

She has an uncommon ability to see both the big picture and the  smallest details. She could navigate complex legislative strategy while  never forgetting the constituent on the other end  of the phone who just needed help. That balance--the human side of  governance, paired with professional excellence--is rare. That is what  made her indispensable.

In moments of pressure, she was unflappable. In moments of  disagreement, she brought thoughtfulness. In moments of decision, she  was always guided by principle.

I have relied on her judgment more times than I can count. When I  needed honest counsel, she gave it, even when it wasn't easy. When the  office needed leadership, she stepped forward without hesitation. When  the mission demanded long hours and personal sacrifice, she never asked  for recognition. She simply got the job done.

That kind of leadership doesn't happen by accident. It comes with  character, from experience, and from a deep belief in service before  self.

Her impact extends well beyond my office. She has mentored young  staffers who will go on to serve in Congress, the executive branch, and  communities across the country. Her legacy lives on in the people she  has trained, the standards she has set, and the example she modeled  every day.

Public service is often described as thankless. Too often the people  who give the most receive the least public recognition, and today we  correct that.

Ms. Lee has helped shape legislation, supported veterans, solved real  problems for real people, and strengthened this institution. She has  done so with professionalism, humility, and unwavering commitment.

On behalf of the constituents of the Eighth Congressional District of  Texas, on behalf of my staff, and on behalf of a Member of Congress, I  want to thank her.

Her service has mattered, her leadership has made a difference, and  her example will continue to guide us long after she steps away from  this role. As she begins the next chapter of her life, she leaves with  our deepest respect, our sincere gratitude, and our very best wishes.
