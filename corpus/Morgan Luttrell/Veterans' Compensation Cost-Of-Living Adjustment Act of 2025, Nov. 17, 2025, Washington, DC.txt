Mr. LUTTRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2392.

First, I thank Senator Moran and Senator Blumenthal for leading this  bill in the Senate. I also thank the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee  on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Mr. Morgan McGarvey, and  Mr. Takano for joining me in co-leading the House companion of S. 2392.

As chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial  Affairs, I am dedicated to serving my fellow veterans. This legislation  is necessary to ensure that benefits paid to veterans, who are disabled  as a result of their military service, do not lose value because of  economic change outside of their control.

Without their disability compensation benefits, veterans may not be  able to afford the cost-of-living increase. Many disabled veterans and  their families rely on their benefits to help pay for necessities like  mortgage payments and groceries.

I know there are veterans in my district currently struggling to stay  healthy and make ends meet. Personal finances and being able to pay  your bills are a major source of stress and anxiety for so many  veterans, survivors, and their families.

Mr. Speaker, passing this cost-of-living adjustment provides them  with the peace of mind they deserve and access to benefits they are  owed. I know many of my House colleagues are committed to serving their  veteran constituents, which is why I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.
