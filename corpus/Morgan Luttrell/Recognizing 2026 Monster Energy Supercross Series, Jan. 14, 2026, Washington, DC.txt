Mr. LUTTRELL. Mr. Speaker, let's make today a great day.

I rise in recognition of excellence, discipline, and American  competitiveness.

The 2026 Monster Energy Supercross Series is absolutely underway, and  in America we like it. If it goes fast, has got a big motor, and there  is a high probability of somebody getting hurt, even better.

If you have never seen Monster Energy Supercross, I am about to  change your life, and you are welcome. You have got 22 riders in a  confined space going from a starting gate to go-to-the-bathroom-on- your-pants, fast hitting 20-foot jumps with no seatbelts, airbags, or  bumpers; just man on machine.

Last weekend on Saturday, Anaheim I, the first race of the series  went off. In the 250 class, Max Anstie got first; Chance Hymas got  second; Ryder DiFrancesco got third; and last year's champion, Haiden  ``Danger Boy'' Deegan, got fourth place.

In the premier class, Eli Tomac absolutely showed up on his new ride.  Ken Roczen got second; Jorge Prado third; and seventh place, last  year's champion, was Cooper Webb.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to Justin Barcia and Malcolm Stewart  after that horrific crash they were involved in. I hope they are  healing up well and every household has their favorite rider. My oldest  boy loves Cooper Webb. My baby boy, Lincoln, loves Eli Tomac and Ken  Roczen. My wife and I absolutely are the biggest fan of number 7, Aaron  Plessinger, the cowboy. Go forward and do great things, Aaron. Dig in  your spurs. This is your year.
