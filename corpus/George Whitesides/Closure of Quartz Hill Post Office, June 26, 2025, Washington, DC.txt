Closure of Quartz Hill Post Office


Mr. WHITESIDES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm on the  impending closure of the Quartz Hill Post Office and who knows how many  other contract postal units across the country.

On June 1, Stan Boylan, a veteran and the owner of the Quartz Hill  Post Office, received a written termination notice informing him that  his post office was scheduled to close.

My family loves the Quartz Hill Post Office. My wife was devastated  to hear this news. We are not alone. It has been a staple of our  community for over 70 years and services tens of thousands of my  constituents.

I say we do not know the scale of closures because, even after I  submitted an inquiry to the Acting Postmaster General, we have not yet  been given a straight answer. What we do know is that the White House  has been trying to absorb this historically independent agency and has  given DOGE the green light to cut USPS staff and gut services.

Let me be clear. The United States Postal Service does not use  taxpayers dollars for operating costs. Reducing post office locations  will lead to slower service, longer wait times, and delays in receiving  packages, medications, and other necessary deliveries.

I urge the Postmaster General to reverse the decision to terminate  the Quartz Hill Post Office contract.
