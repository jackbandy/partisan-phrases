Stop the Republican Affordability Crisis

Mr. WHITESIDES. Mr. Speaker, every time I talk with constituents, I  hear the same thing: Life is getting more and more expensive.

People are worried about making rent, paying for groceries, and  dealing with gas prices that keep on climbing.

In just the past couple of weeks, we have received more proof of what  our constituents are telling us. According to a recent report,  California families saw their costs go up by more than $2,000 in 2025  due to inflation. That breaks down to $482 more going toward housing,  like rent or a mortgage, and another $581 toward transportation costs,  from buying a car to repairs and gas.

For food, families are paying even more because of the grocery  tariffs from this administration. One trip through your local Stater  Bros. or Vons is enough to feel the pinch. In 2025, families paid $76  more for ground coffee, $71 more for ground beef, and $51 more for eggs  than they did in 2024.

Simply put, our economy is not serving hardworking families and the  basic promises of the American Dream, like homeownership or putting a  child through college, are harder and harder to reach.

Government works best when it is grounded in the needs of the people  that it serves. Our constituents have been clear about what they sent  us here to do, what they sent us here to fight for. We must stay  focused on policies that make life more affordable. We are here to  improve people's lives, and that responsibility should guide everything  we do.

I will continue to fight every day to lower costs and keep the  American Dream alive and within reach.
