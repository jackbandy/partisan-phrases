Firefighter Protections

Mr. WHITESIDES. Madam Speaker, this week marks the first anniversary  of the southern California wildfires that took lives, devastated  communities, and left families across our region displaced.

We are lucky that the damage was not worse, and that is only because  of the wildland firefighters who run toward danger and risk their lives  for all of us.

For decades, these heroes were prohibited from wearing respiratory  protection, even as the science made clear that wildfire smoke causes  lasting lung damage and is linked to more than a dozen cancers.

Firefighters' life expectancy is now nearly 10 years shorter than the  average American. That is unacceptable.

The Healthy Lungs for Heroes Act changes that. It directs our Federal  land agencies to develop and require respiratory protection when smoke  exposure becomes dangerous.

Protecting our firefighters' lungs should not be controversial. This  bill ensures that those who protect us are finally protected  themselves.
