Gun Safety in America

Mr. WHITESIDES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of  someone from my district who I know personally. Her name is Mia Tretta.

In 2019, as a 15-year-old freshman at Saugus High School, Mia was  shot in  the stomach during a horrific attack that took the life of her best  friend. She survived, endured surgeries, and fought to reclaim her  life, eventually earning her way into Brown University.

This past weekend, the nightmare returned. While studying for finals  in her dorm, Mia was forced to shelter in place as a shooter roamed the  Brown campus. She told reporters no one should ever have to go through  one shooting, let alone two.

We are failing our children. It is a national disgrace that a student  in America can survive a high school shooting, only to face another one  before graduating college. We cannot accept this as normal.

Mr. Speaker, we need commonsense gun safety legislation now, reforms  supported by the vast majority of Americans, to end this epidemic.

Mia and her generation deserve to study in peace, not fear.
