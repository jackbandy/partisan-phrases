Fired By President Trump

Mr. WHITESIDES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the story of two Federal  scientists who, in their own words, were fired by President Trump.

I am a biologist and was a postdoctoral researcher at the       EPA Office of Research and Development. Most of my research       focused on clean water and human health, such as drinking       water, recreational water, and efforts to prevent pollution.       My research projects included the impact that wildfires have       on drinking water quality. My work is not political, and my       career should never have been politicized. This was my dream       job.

Another scientist, in their own words, said:

I was a biologist for the U.S. Geological Survey. I       conducted wildfire and fuels-related research in Sequoia and       Kings Canyon National Parks, working closely with park       managers to improve the fuel management plan.

Science is the foundation of American leadership and security. These  firings must be reversed.
