Mr. WHITESIDES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember  Donald Leroy ``Cool'' Kuehl, a proud United States Army World War II  Veteran, whose life was defined by service, courage, and deep love of  country.

Born in 1925 in Long Beach, California, Don answered our Nation's  call during one of the most consequential moments in history. He served  as a radio operator, one of the Army's most dangerous and essential  roles, and in 1943, as a Tech 5th Grade with the 347th Field Artillery  Battalion of the 91st Infantry Division, known as the Wild West  Division in Italy. He contributed to the Allied victory that preserved  freedom for future generations.

As we mourn Don's passing, we give thanks for a life well lived,  guided by wisdom, love, and an enduring belief in living in the moment.  He shared 62 years of marriage with his high school sweetheart,  Virginia, whose love and companionship remained central to his life  until her passing.

Don's final year was enriched by his participation in Coffee4Vets  breakfasts, where he spent his remaining days sharing time, stories,  and camaraderie with fellow Veterans, including other World War II  Veterans. There, I was honored to join in celebrating Don's 100th  birthday, a joyous occasion, last February.

We extend our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. May  we always honor Don Kuehl's service, cherish his legacy, and remember a  life well lived in service to the United States of America.
