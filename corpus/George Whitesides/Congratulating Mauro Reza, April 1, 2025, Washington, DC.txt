Congratulating Mauro Reza, Boots on the Ground Alliance's Veteran of the Year


Mr. WHITESIDES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mauro Reza, a  Vietnam War veteran from Palmdale, California, whose service and  sacrifice exemplify the highest ideals of patriotism and dedication to  our Nation. Mr. Reza was selected as this year's Boots on the Ground  Alliance's Veteran of the Year, an honor his life and service  absolutely merit.

Born and raised in Whittier, Mauro was inspired by his uncle, a  Korean War veteran, to continue his family's proud tradition of  military service. Answering the call of duty, he enlisted in the United  States Army in November 1966 and served with distinction as a UH-1C  helicopter gunship pilot in the 175th Assault Helicopter Unit's 3rd  Platoon Mavericks during one of the most challenging conflicts in  American history. From August 1967 to June 1970, Mauro bravely took to  the skies, engaging in aerial combat operations where skill and courage  were paramount to mission success and the safety of his fellow  soldiers.

After years of valiant service, Mauro transitioned out of military  life, recognizing the profound impact of his experiences in Vietnam.  Yet, his legacy endures--not only through his military contributions  but also in the example he sets for future generations about duty,  resilience, and honor.

It is with great respect and admiration that I recognize Mauro Reza  for his selfless service to our country. His story is a testament to  the courage of those who have fought for our freedoms, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in expressing our gratitude for his dedication.
