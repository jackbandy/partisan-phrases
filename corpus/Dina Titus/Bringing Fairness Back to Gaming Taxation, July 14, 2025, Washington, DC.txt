Bringing Fairness Back to Gaming Taxation

Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge passage of my FAIR BET Act.  The Republican's Triple B overturned a half-century tax provision that  allowed gamblers to deduct 100 percent of their losses from their  winnings. Accordingly, because that has been eliminated, gamblers now  will be required to pay taxes on money they haven't earned.

My FAIR BET Act would undo the Senate mistake by keeping the 100  percent loss policy in place. This will ensure that gamblers don't have  to pay taxes on phantom income and are not lured to offshore and  unregulated markets.

My legislation has bipartisan support because Members on both sides  understand that this is not ideological. It is just fair, good tax  policy.

Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to bet on the come, and pass the FAIR  BET Act.
