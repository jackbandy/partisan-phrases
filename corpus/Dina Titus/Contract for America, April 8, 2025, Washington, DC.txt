Contract for America

Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks, I have held a number  of townhalls, and one thing keeps coming up consistently: Democrats  need a cohesive, concise message that clearly lays out what we are for,  not just what we are opposed to.

In 1994, Newt Gingrich drew up a Contract with America. It was a  simple set of priorities that Republicans promised to enact if they got  the House majority. Well, it worked; the Republicans took the House in  the 1994 mid-term elections.

I propose a Contract for America, one that reflects who we are as  Democrats: Good wages, fair taxes, quality education, protecting Social  Security and Medicare, expanding veterans' benefits, providing  universal healthcare, environmental conservation, and national  security.

We need a message that spells out exactly what we will do to benefit  our constituents and how we will do it. That needs to start right now.
