Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of the Protect  America's Workforce Act.

Since day one, President Trump has worked to dismantle the  institutions that protect workers and weaken the power of organized  labor. He dismissed commissioners from the Federal agency responsible  for enforcing workforce civil rights, and he stripped the National  Labor Relations Board of its quorum.

Then in March, he moved to take away unionization rights from  thousands of government workers, including those at the Departments of  Defense, State, and Veterans Affairs.

We count on these public servants to be on the front lines, keeping  our communities running and our constituents safe. In return, they  deserve to have their rights protected. That is why I am a strong  supporter of this legislation that will overturn the President's  dangerous and illegal executive order eliminating collective  bargaining.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the same and vote in favor of  this important legislation.
