Ms. TITUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to a narrow- minded, shortsighted amendment that is going to be offered to this bill  on the National Endowment for Democracy, prohibiting funding for that  important organization.

By eliminating NED's appropriation, U.S.-based nonprofit  organizations, local partners, and frontline democracy defenders in  dangerous contexts will be put in immediate jeopardy, undermining  efforts to support emerging democracies and those resisting  authoritarian rule like the brave protesters in Iran.

In places like Nicaragua, Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea, Hong Kong,  Tibet, Burma and, as I mentioned, Iran, NED provides vital resources  for those advocating for freedom. This amendment would halt efforts to  provide citizens with accurate information, exposing corruption and  brutality of some of these regimes and kneecapping protesters who are  pleading for freedom.

If we withdraw our support and abandon democracy defenders, we cede  this ground to autocratic regimes which will eagerly step in to replace  us and promote their own interests at our expense. This will devastate  U.S. national security and the advancement of our democratic ideals.

Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to reject this terrible  amendment when it comes up and show the rest of the world we have not  lost our minds nor lost our way.
