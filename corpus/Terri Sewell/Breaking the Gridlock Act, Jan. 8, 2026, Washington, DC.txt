Breaking the Gridlock Act


Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of restoring  the Affordable Care Act tax credits and lowering healthcare costs for  millions of Americans.

As of January 1, more than 400,000 Alabamians faced higher premiums  because Republicans in this body let the ACA tax credits expire. That  is on top of the nearly $1 trillion in cuts that Republicans made to  healthcare earlier this year.

Today's vote represents one more chance for Republicans to do the  right thing, reverse their disastrous policies, and join Democrats in  making healthcare more affordable.

Let's make no mistake: This vote would not have taken place had it  not been for the relentless efforts of House Democrats and our leader,  Hakeem Jeffries. I urge my Republican colleagues to vote ``yes'' to  restore the ACA credits and lower healthcare costs. In the words of Dr.  King: ``The time is always right to do what is right.''

Mr. Speaker, let us restore the ACA tax credits.
