Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act


Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  House Republican's so-called SAVE Act, the most restrictive voting law  to be considered by this body in decades.

The SAVE Act is just the latest in the ongoing assault on our  democracy by President Trump and his allies in Congress. Instead of  working to meet the needs of the American people, House Republicans are  busy spreading fear and lies to justify their attempts to  disenfranchise millions of eligible voters.

Let's be clear: It is already against the law for non-Americans to  vote. This bill is a solution in search of a problem. The SAVE Act  would create new barriers to the ballot box for millions of eligible  voters. That includes almost 70 million American women who got married  and changed their last name. It also includes 140 million Americans  without a passport, and it includes Americans with military and Tribal  IDs.

To be clear, this bill is not about protecting our elections; it is  about making it harder for Americans to vote and easier for Republicans  to win.

As elected officials, we should be working to expand access to the  ballot box, not restrict it. Congress should be considering H.R. 14,  the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to ensure that  every American can freely and fairly vote.

Mr. Speaker, this is very personal to me. I am not only the  Representative of America's civil rights district, but I am also the  proud daughter of Selma, Alabama. It was in my hometown where hundreds  of foot soldiers were bludgeoned on a bridge for the equal right of all  Americans to vote. This legislation before us today makes a mockery of  their legacy.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the SAVE  Act.
