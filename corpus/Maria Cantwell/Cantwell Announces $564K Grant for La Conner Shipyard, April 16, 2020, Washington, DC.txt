Cantwell Announces $564K Grant for La Conner Shipyard


U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, announced today that Mavrik Marine -- a shipyard in La Conner, Washington -- will receive $564,850 in funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation's 2020 MARAD Small Shipyards Grant program. The funding will allow Mavrik Marine to purchase a new U.S.-built bridge crane, welding systems, and a compressor, optimizing its current operation while allowing capacity for new construction.

"This will increase the shipyard's ability to meet its high workload and reduce operating costs, project delays, and further improve safety for employees," Senator Cantwell wrote in a letter of support for Mavrik Marine's grant application addressed to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.

Mavrik Marine primarily constructs passenger ferries and commercial fishing vessels. To meet increasing demand, the Skagit-County based shipyard is partnering with the Port of Skagit to expand its facilities and create additional production space.
