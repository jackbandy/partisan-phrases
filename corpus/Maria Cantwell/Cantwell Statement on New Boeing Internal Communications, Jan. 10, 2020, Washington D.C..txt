Cantwell Statement on New Boeing Internal Communications


Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, released the following statement regarding the newly-released internal communications.

"I am deeply concerned by what is revealed in these newly-released communications. They indicate a motivation to work around the FAA and foreign regulators, and to deemphasize any differences between the 737 NG and MAX to prevent stricter training requirements. Safety can't be short-changed by concerns with schedules or training costs. Boeing needs to immediately produce any other related communications, and I hope Chairman Wicker will accommodate a hearing to discuss needed aviation improvements."
