Cantwell Announces $1.4M in Affordable Housing Grants for Yakama Nation


Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced that the Yakama Nation will receive $1.4 million in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to support the development and operation of affordable housing in Indian Country.

The funding comes from HUD's Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program, which provides federal funds for affordable housing activities in safe and healthy environments in Tribal communities and Native Alaskan villages. This interim funding grant for the Yakama Nation will help ensure Tribal housing operations can continue prior to receiving 2020 IHBG funding later this year.

Senator Cantwell has long prioritized investment in affordable housing, helping to secure nearly $3 billion in additional affordable housing funding in 2018 and introducing legislation last year to increase investment in affordable housing and provide more resources and stronger protections for at-risk groups. In 2018, she also called for improvements to the IHBG program in order to better assist Native American veterans in finding housing in Indian Country.
