Cantwell Statement on COVID-19 National Emergency Declaration


Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement on the president's declaration of a national emergency to help fight the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak:

"I support President Trump's National Emergency Declaration. Those of us from states where COVID-19 is hitting early know that more resources, tools, and flexibility are critically needed right now. This declaration will free up more than $50 billion in federal resources for states and local communities fighting the COVID-19 outbreak on the front lines. It will allow Washington hospitals more flexibility to care for COVID-19 patients and expand critical testing to meet the medical needs as a result of the pandemic.

"In Congress, we are working to make sure every American has the support they need to take care of themselves and their families. I support the Democratic proposal to provide free testing for COVID-19; paid family and sick leave for those impacted by COVID-19 and emergency unemployment insurance for those who are not able to work due to the outbreak; and food security for children on the school lunch program, SNAP, our seniors, and food banks.

"These steps are critical, but there is more we need to do. My top priority is helping anyone who is sick and everyone working to contain the virus, but we also need to fight for every American who has been or will be impacted. I will continue working with my colleagues to find main street solutions for small businesses, our economy, and everyone who has been impacted by this crisis."
