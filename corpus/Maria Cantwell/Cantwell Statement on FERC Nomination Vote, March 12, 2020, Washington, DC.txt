Cantwell Statement on FERC Nomination Vote


Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement on the vote to confirm James Danly to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC):

"I was unable to be present for today's votes, but if I had been able to vote I would have voted against the confirmation of James Danly as FERC Commissioner.  We saw during the West Coast energy crisis how essential it is that the Commission is balanced and independent and ensures just and reasonable rates at all times. Our nation's energy system must continue to modernize to tackle and adapt to emerging threats like cyber-attacks and climate change."
