Cantwell Releases Statement on Impeachment Proceedings


Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement on the start of the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump: 

"I take my role as an impartial juror seriously. I want to see a fair and open process in the Senate, not something rushed through in the dead of night. We should all be able to agree on facts. In order to do that, we need to have a trial that includes seeing the evidence and hearing from witnesses with firsthand knowledge who have not testified."
