Paycheck Protection Program


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to speak about  the critical aspect of the paycheck act as it relates to businesses,  particularly in the newspaper and broadcasting business. It is so  important for us to address this issue because these are the people who  are on the frontlines delivering the information to us about this  crisis. 

  Unfortunately, in the past legislation, we did not include  associations of broadcasters and newspapers under the definition, so up  to several thousand newspapers and hundreds of local radio and  television stations across the country are without existing programs by  the small business affiliation rule to assist these companies in  keeping important news print and news broadcasting staff at their jobs. 

  When I think about what I have learned about the coronavirus from  these individuals, what I have learned about the broadcast information  of nursing home problems, what I have learned about issues with  Remdesivir, I all know that it came down to the local media who was  telling us about it. So when I think of the headlines I am seeing--the  LA Times, ``Coronavirus crisis hastens the collapse of local  newspapers.''; ``Long-Struggling Local Newspapers Pushed to Brink  Brought by Coronavirus''--I know it is time for us to do something to  help these individuals, and I hope that we can do that soon. 

  We need the media--the local small media--to help us continue to  communicate. After all, the basis of a democracy is about truth and  transparency, and they are helping to build a community of truth and  transparency. We need to help them during this crisis.
