Cantwell Applauds $780K Grant to Help Establish Nonstop Air Service from Pullman to Denver


Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) applauded the announcement that the City of Pullman will receive $780,000 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to help attract new service to Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport. Specifically, the funds will support the airport's work with United Airlines to begin a new flight route to Denver, Colorado. 

The funding comes from DOT's Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP), which was designed to help small communities address air service and airfare issues. SCASDP can involve revenue guarantees, financial assistance for marketing programs, start-up costs, and studies to help address air service deficiencies in smaller communities. 

Senator Cantwell has a long record of supporting smart investments in Washington airports. Just in the last couple of years, she successfully secured $23 million in federal funding to support airport upgrades and the construction of a new runway at Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport. In 2017, she secured $5.2 million to make other critical improvements at the airport. Cantwell also recently secured funding to help establish nonstop air service between San Francisco and Pangborn Memorial Airport in Wenatchee.
