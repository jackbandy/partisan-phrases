STATEMENT: Cantwell on Administration's Airstrike in Iraq


Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement on the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani by a U.S. airstrike in Iraq: 

"No one wants to see an escalation with Iran. The President needs a strategy that involves working with our allies to find a diplomatic solution for the region. The President also needs to brief Congress on the intelligence that led to this strike, as well as the plan to protect Americans and allies from the repercussions of his actions."
