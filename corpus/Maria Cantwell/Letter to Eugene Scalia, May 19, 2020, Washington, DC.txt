Letter to Eugene Scalia, Secretary of Labor - Senator Murray, Representative DelBene Lead Washington State Lawmakers in Push to Help Alcoa Workers


Dear Secretary Scalia:

We are writing in support of the recently filed Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) petition to assist the more than 700 workers at Alcoa's Intalco plant in Ferndale, Washington, who are being displaced due in large measure to increased global supply from countries like China and a corresponding reduction in the price of aluminum.

The Intalco plant is one of the largest employers in Whatcom County and supports many indirect jobs in addition to the 700 workers at the facility itself. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that these workers receive the retraining and reemployment resources available through TAA certification. Such a certification will allow them to get back on their feet more quickly, support their families, and continue making critical contributions to their communities and our economy.

We urge you to review this TAA application timely, consistent with all applicable rules and regulations, to ensure that these trade-affected workers receive the assistance they need to obtain employment services and maintain their financial stability.

Thank you for your consideration on behalf of the workers at Alcoa's Intalco plant in Ferndale.

Sincerely,
