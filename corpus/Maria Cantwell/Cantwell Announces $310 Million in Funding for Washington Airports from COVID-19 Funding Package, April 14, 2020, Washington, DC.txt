In February, she helped secure funding for Pullman to start a new nonstop route to Denver. In just the last couple of years, she has successfully secured $23 million in federal funding to support airport upgrades and the construction of a new runway at Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport. In 2017, she secured $5.2 million to make other critical improvements at the airport. Cantwell also recently helped secure funding to help establish nonstop air service between San Francisco and Pangborn Memorial Airport in Wenatchee.
