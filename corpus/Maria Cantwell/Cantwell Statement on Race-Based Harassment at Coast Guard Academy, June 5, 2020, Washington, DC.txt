Cantwell Statement on Race-Based Harassment at Coast Guard Academy


Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, released the following statement today after the release of a report from the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General on race-based harassment at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy:

"The Coast Guard's response to race-based harassment at the Academy was absolutely unacceptable. Racism cannot be tolerated at an institution responsible with training the future leaders of the Coast Guard, and I will be pursuing vigorous oversight into this situation to make sure that systemic reform gets implemented."

Specifically the investigation found that:

In the majority of hate and harassment cases at the Academy, the Coast Guard did not thoroughly investigate or discipline the individuals involved.

The Coast Guard continually failed to adequately include its own civil rights staff while conducting investigations, which lead to incomplete tracking of race-based incidents.

Race-based harassment is underreported at the Academy because cadets feel like they will face consequences for reporting such behavior.
