More information on the grant programs is available HERE. Washington state is expected to receive additional funds for housing programs in the coming weeks as a result of the CARES Act.

Senator Cantwell has long supported funding for HUD's housing and homelessness grants, including the CDBG and HOPWA programs. She has also prioritized investment in affordable housing, helping to secure nearly $3 billion in additional affordable housing funding in March 2018 and introducing legislation in 2019 to increase investment in affordable housing and provide more resources and stronger protections for at-risk groups.
