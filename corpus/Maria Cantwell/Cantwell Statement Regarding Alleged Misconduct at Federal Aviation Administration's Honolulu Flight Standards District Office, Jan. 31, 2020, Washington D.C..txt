Cantwell Statement Regarding Alleged Misconduct at Federal Aviation Administration's Honolulu Flight Standards District Office


Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, released the following statement regarding allegations of misconduct by managers working for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at the Honolulu Flight Standards District Office:

"I join Chairman Wicker in calling for a more thorough review by the Inspector General of helicopter safety and maintenance inspections required by the FAA. On the 20th anniversary of the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash, it is clear all lessons should have already been learned. The FAA must play an aggressive role in overseeing proper aviation maintenance including making sure no one doctors log books or fails to accurately report problems."
