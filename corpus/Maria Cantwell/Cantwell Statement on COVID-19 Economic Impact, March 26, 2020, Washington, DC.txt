Cantwell Statement on COVID-19 Economic Impact


Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement on the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic:

"COVID-19 is impacting every part of our lives, and today's jobless report underscores the economic effects on Washingtonians. Last week alone, unemployment claims in our state increased by 843 percent.

"The relief package the Senate passed last night will provide immediate help by getting laid off workers an additional $600 a week on their unemployment benefits until July 31 and provide an additional 13 weeks of benefits. In Washington, that means workers will have 39 weeks of unemployment insurance. Additionally, more than 3.7 million Washingtonians will get $1,200 checks, and parents will get an additional $500 per child.

"Americans need help making ends meet while they help us beat this virus."
