Tribal Transportation Program Safety Funds are used to address transportation safety issues in Indian Country, where traffic accidents are consistently higher than the rest of the nation as a whole. Funds are available to federally-recognized Indian Tribes through a competitive, discretionary program. 

TTPSF selects projects that will address the prevention and reduction of death or serious injuries in transportation-related incidents. Eligible projects include road safety infrastructure improvements, developing or updating transportation safety plans, and crash data assessment, improvement, or analysis.
