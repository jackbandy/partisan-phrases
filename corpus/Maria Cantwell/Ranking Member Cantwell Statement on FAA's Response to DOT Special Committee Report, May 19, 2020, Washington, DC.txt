Ranking Member Cantwell Statement on FAA's Response to DOT Special Committee Report


U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, today released the following statement regarding the Federal Aviation Administration's response to the Department of Transportation's Special Committee report on the aircraft certification process:

"We want the United States of America to be the leader in aerospace manufacturing. That means we need to be number one when it comes to aviation safety. Today's report shows the FAA is willing to make some improvements in the certification process, but the Congress needs to address shortfalls and problems that exist in the FAA's current oversight authority."

In January, Ranking Member Cantwell sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao highlighting her concerns regarding the Special Committee's final report. She wrote, "While I believe the report makes some important recommendations to improve aviation safety, including mandating safety management systems for manufacturers and increasing the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) workforce capabilities, I believe the report falls short in its review of the FAA's certification process. Instead, it defends a system that is in clear need of improvement."
