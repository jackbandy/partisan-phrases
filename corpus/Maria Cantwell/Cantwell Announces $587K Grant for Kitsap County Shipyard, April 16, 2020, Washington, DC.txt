Cantwell Announces $587K Grant for Kitsap County Shipyard


U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, announced today that SAFE Boats International (SBI) -- a shipyard in Kitsap County -- will receive $587,035 in funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation's 2020 MARAD Small Shipyards Grant program. The funding will help SBI upgrade equipment at its shipyard to allow the company to modernize and increase capacity.

"With grant funding, SAFE Boats International will continue to modernize and expand, creating new jobs and continuing its delivery of state-of-the-art, reliable vessels," Senator Cantwell wrote in a letter of support for the shipyard's grant application in February 2020.

SBI is the leading maritime employer and one of the largest private employers in Kitsap County, with more than 250 employees. The shipyard is an important supplier for the U.S. military and law enforcement agencies.
