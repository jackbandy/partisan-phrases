Cantwell Responds to President Trump's Comments About Seattle


Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement in response to President Trump's comments about Seattle:

"The Trump DOJ is MIA on upholding civil liberties. Former AG Sessions, AG Barr, and President Trump have abdicated their responsibilities on wrongful deaths of American citizens. The Trump DOJ has opened zero major pattern and practice investigations of systemic abuses by police departments.

"What now? A Milley military sweep of our streets? George Floyd had civil rights, Mr. President. Say his name. Say his civil rights were violated. Tell Attorney General Barr to uphold the rights of all Americans, not just some."
