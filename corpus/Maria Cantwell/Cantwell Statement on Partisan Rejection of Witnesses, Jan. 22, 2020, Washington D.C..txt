Cantwell Statement on Partisan Rejection of Witnesses, Evidence in Trump Impeachment Trial


Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement after Senate Republicans rejected attempts to hear testimony from key first-hand witnesses and produce important documents at the beginning of the impeachment trial of President Trump:

"Serious allegations have been made against the President, and the Senate needs to hear all the evidence to conduct a fair and impartial trial. The American public deserves to hear the evidence about allegations of interference in the 2020 election. The Oval Office and U.S. foreign policy should not be manipulated or used for personal political gain. Witnesses and evidence will bring further clarity about whether this was a deep and coordinated effort."

Yesterday, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) introduced 11 amendments to the impeachment trial rules to ensure key evidence and testimony from the White House, Department of State, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Acting White House Chief of Staff and Director of the OMB Mick Mulvaney, Department of Defense, Assistant to the President Robert Blair, OMB Associate Director for National Security Programs Michael Duffey, former National Security Advisor John Bolton, and others are obtained and included in the trial. Ten of the 11 amendment votes failed on party line 53-47 votes -- one failed 52-48.
