Coronavirus Relief Programs Now Open to Farmers, Ranchers


Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today released the following statement on economic relief provisions for farmers in the $470 billion coronavirus response legislation that was signed into law last week:

"The latest coronavirus response legislation expanded the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program to include farmers for the first time.

"Farmers can now apply for the Paycheck Protection Program to help maintain payroll through forgivable loans. Interested farmers should contact their lender immediately to start an application.

"The relief bill also made them eligible for the $60 billion provided for Economic Injury Disaster Loans. Farmers hurt by the current economic crisis should contact the Small Business Administration to apply for these low-interest loans.

"California farmers feed our country and it's critical that they're able to stay in business during this health pandemic. I encourage any farmer struggling due to the crisis to take advantage of these two programs now available to them."
