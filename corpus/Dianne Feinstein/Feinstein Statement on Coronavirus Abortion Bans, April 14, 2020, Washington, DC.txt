Feinstein Statement on Coronavirus Abortion Bans


Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today released the following statement on the move by at least eight states to block access to abortion care during the coronavirus pandemic:

            "It's unconscionable that eight states are using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to block women from exercising their reproductive rights, including abortion.

            "Using a public health crisis as an excuse to attack a woman's right to health care is unacceptable and must stop.

            "It's a false choice to say we can either protect a woman's constitutional right to make her own health care decisions or effectively respond to the coronavirus pandemic. We can do both."
