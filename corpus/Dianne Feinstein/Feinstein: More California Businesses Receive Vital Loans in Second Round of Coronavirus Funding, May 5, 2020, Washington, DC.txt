Feinstein: More California Businesses Receive Vital Loans in Second Round of Coronavirus Funding


Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today released the following statement on crucial funds for California small businesses that were allocated through the second round of Paycheck Protection Program loans:

"Last month, many California small businesses were left behind when the Small Business Administration handed out loans under the emergency Paycheck Protection Program. California ranked only 42nd out of all states in funding per person.

"Following that first round of funding, Senator Kamala Harris and I called on the Treasury Department to immediately address the wide disparities in funding among states.

"I'm pleased to announce that California is receiving far more funds in the second round of loans -- so far we're the third-ranked state in per-person funding. This is a more realistic share of loans for the largest economy in the country, and these loans -- which will be forgiven if businesses maintain staffing levels -- will help provide paychecks to many Californians.

"These funds will ensure more businesses remain viable, more employees keep receiving a paycheck and California's economy can recover as quickly as possible."
