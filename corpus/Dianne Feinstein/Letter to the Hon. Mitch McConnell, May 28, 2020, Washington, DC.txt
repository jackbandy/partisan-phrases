Letter to the Hon. Mitch McConnell, Majority Leader and the Hon. Chuck Schumer, Minority Leader - Booker, Colleagues Urge Senate Leaders to Bar USDA From Allowing Meatpackers to Exceed Line Speed Limits


Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:As you consider additional legislative priorities addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, we urge you toinclude a directive to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service(USDA FSIS) to halt higher-speed slaughter and processing systems for poultry, swine, and cattle.Directing USDA FSIS to retract previously granted approvals and suspend future approvals forplants to operate at line speeds higher than regulatory maximums and to suspend implementation ofthe New Swine Inspections System (NSIS), which allows facilities to operate without any line speedrestrictions, will improve worker and inspector safety, help safeguard animal welfare, and betterprotect consumers.During the COVID-19 pandemic, not only has the Administration failed to protect meat andpoultry workers and inspectors, but FSIS is increasing the safety risks for workers by approving linespeed increases. In just the month of April, FSIS has approved at least 15 new requests from plantsto exceed regulatory line speed maximums. Further, FSIS recently finalized the New SwineInspection System, which revokes line speed maximums in slaughterhouses operating under thatinspection model. By increasing slaughter line speeds, plant employees become even moresusceptible to work-related injuries such as repetitive trauma disorders and amputations due to theneed to work faster. Rather than increasing line speeds, the USDA should be working withprocessing plants to slow down line speeds in order to accommodate social distancing measuresaimed at reducing the spread of the virus in such plants.Increased line speeds not only threatens the safety of workers and inspectors but also underminesthe enforcement of federal humane handling laws and regulations, subjecting some animals to roughhandling and the possibility of regaining consciousness after failed stun attempts. Moreover, thesesystems jeopardize food safety and the USDA itself has concluded, in the absence of compensatingmeasures, that higher line speeds result in more pathogen contamination.Accordingly, we urge you to include language directing FSIS to retract previously granted approvalsand suspend future approvals from poultry and meat plants to operate at speeds exceedingregulatory caps and to cease implementation of the New Swine Inspection System. In addition,Congress should direct the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study on how theUSDA has responded to the rapid spread of COVID-19 in meat and poultry slaughter plants, including an analysis of the impact of faster line speeds on plants' ability to maintain protections foremployees, enforce regulations protecting animals from inhumane slaughter, and uphold food safety.We thank you for your consideration and close attention to these priorities to support and protectworkers, inspectors, animals, and food safety during this crisis.
