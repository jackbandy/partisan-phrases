Feinstein Highlights New Guidance for Employers, Employees on Paid Sick Leave


Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today highlighted the following implementation guidance from the Department of Labor on new paid sick leave provisions included in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act:

"Coronavirus has proven to be highly contagious and easily spread with physical proximity, so it's vital that anyone who is sick stays at home to avoid infecting others.

"The paid sick leave provisions recently passed by Congress will help ensure that those who are sick can self-isolate without having to worry about their paychecks. The sooner we can halt the advance of this disease, the more lives we'll save. Workers shouldn't have to choose between coming to work sick or staying home to stop the spread of disease."
