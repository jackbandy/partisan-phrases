Letter to the Hon. Lindsey Graham, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee - Feinstein Calls for Hearing on Death of ICE Detainee, Conditions at Detention Facilities


Dear Chairman Graham,

I am requesting that the Judiciary Committee hold a hearing to examine conditions at immigration detention facilities during the coronavirus pandemic, including how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is treating immigrants in its custody.

This past week, an immigrant being detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in California died while being treated for a COVID-19 infection. Carlos Escobar-Mejia, a 57-year-old Salvadoran, died just six days after U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw found that the conditions at the Otay Mesa Detention Center were unconstitutional and put medically vulnerable detainees "at substantial risk of serious illness or death."

There are approximately 29,000 immigrants in ICE custody. As of today, only 1,528 of those detained immigrants have been tested for coronavirus, and 753 tested positive. This means that nearly half of those tested are already infected with COVID-19.

This warrants the Committee's immediate attention, and I ask that you hold a hearing into the death of Mr. Escobar-Mejia and conditions at ICE facilities nationwide.
