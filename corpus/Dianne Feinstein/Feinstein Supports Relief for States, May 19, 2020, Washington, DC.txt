Feinstein Supports Relief for States, Localities


Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today announced her support for the State and Municipal Assistance for Recovery and Transition Act, which would provide $500 billion in federal aid to states and localities impacted by the coronavirus pandemic:

"California went from a projected $6 billion surplus to an expected $54 billion deficit this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Just as Congress provided significant relief for businesses and families, we should also help communities so they won't have to cut critical services and jobs and lay off workers.

"The bill would create a $500 billion fund to help cities, counties and states weather this crisis. The funds would be awarded based on population, coronavirus infection rates and revenue lost from the pandemic.

"This bill will distribute aid fairly to communities based on need. States like California shouldn't be denied funds when their budgets have taken a hit because of a pandemic beyond their control.

"Instead of forcing states and localities to lay off teachers, firefighters, police officers and other essential public employees to balance their budgets, this bill is a bipartisan, commonsense approach to helping states and communities during these tough economic times."
