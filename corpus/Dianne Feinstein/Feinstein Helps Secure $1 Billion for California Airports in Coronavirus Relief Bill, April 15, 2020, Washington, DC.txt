Feinstein Helps Secure $1 Billion for California Airports in Coronavirus Relief Bill


Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today announced a series of federal grants that will go to airports across California. The funds were included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which was signed into law last month:

            "Knowing that California airports would be hard-hit by the coronavirus downturn, I worked to ensure that funds in last month's coronavirus relief legislation would help keep those airports running. I'm pleased that more than $1 billion has been awarded to airports throughout California.

            "Air travel has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus pandemic due to travel bans and stay-at-home orders. And many airports were forced to pay for screening and quarantine efforts early on in the outbreak.

            "These grants will help airports recoup the costs of preventing the spread of the virus in their facilities as well as prepare for the return of travelers.

            "Our airports are economic hubs that employ thousands of Californians. These grants will help them through this difficult time, and I will continue working to find ways for the federal government to help."
