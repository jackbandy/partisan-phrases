Feinstein Supports Paycheck Security Act


Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) released the following statement on the Paycheck Security Act, a bill introduced by Senators Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) to cover the wages and benefits of employees of affected businesses and nonprofits until the economic and public health crisis is resolved:

"Each day, more Americans are finding themselves out of work due to the coronavirus pandemic. That is why I'm proud to cosponsor the Paycheck Security Act to provide small businesses with a refundable tax credit to rehire and pay laid off or furloughed employees.

"With nearly 39 million workers filing new jobless claims since March, Congress must do more to help businesses make it through the crisis and rehire and pay their workers. Our bill would expand on the CARES Act, ensuring more businesses remain open and more Americans keep receiving paychecks and health care benefits until this crisis ends. Maintaining the connection between businesses and their workers will be key to helping America recover as quickly as possible once the virus is under control."

The Paycheck Security Act would provide businesses experiencing significant financial hardship as a result of the coronavirus pandemic with a refundable tax credit to rehire and pay laid off and furloughed workers up to $90,000 per year, including health care benefits. It would also provide small and mid-sized businesses with the funds necessary to pay rent, mortgages, utilities and other operating costs until they can safely reopen and sales begin to recover.
