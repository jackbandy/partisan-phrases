Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, once again, we are showing that we can  lead here in Washington, D.C., getting things done with the leadership  of our President and our leadership here in the House, working together  with the United States Senate.

It shows that we are offering that certainty and stability once again  for our economy to make America first. We are going to make the dollar  dominant once again, and we are going to lead on digital currency  payments.

It will increase, of course, the demand for U.S. Treasuries and move  us toward that dominant position we need to have in the financial  markets.

I applaud our chairman. As a new member of this committee, it has  been wonderful to watch a person in action who is attempting to work  with the other side, pushing through bipartisan legislation, and, once  again, proving that Washington can work if we have leadership at the  helm.
