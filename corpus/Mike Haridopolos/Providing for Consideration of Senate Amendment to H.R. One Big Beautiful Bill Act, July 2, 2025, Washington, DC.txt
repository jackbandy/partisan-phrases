Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, promises made, promises kept.

Voters wanted change for one simple reason: It was too expensive to  live in America for the last 4 years. Gas prices, rent prices, and food  prices were up radically. This bill is designed to help those very  people hurt over the last 4 years. People who earn tips or overtime, as  well as those who earn Social Security get a big tax cut.

Mr. Speaker, let's be clear, so the American public hears it loud and  clear: The current tax rate on the wealthiest Americans is 37 percent.  Under this bill, it remains at 37 percent.

At the same time, we are protecting the most vulnerable. Please read  the bill. Seniors in nursing homes are unaffected. Persons who are  disabled are unaffected. Pregnant women on Medicaid are unaffected.  Low-income kids, whose parents aren't making much, are unaffected.

Isn't it nice to see that Washington actually keeps its promises from  the campaign trail? This is a welcome change. Donald Trump said that we  are going to bring America back by putting more money back in their  pockets, instead of sending it up here to Washington, D.C.

He promised a secure border. Mr. Speaker, there is a 99 percent  reduction in the number of people coming across the border illegally.  That is action. What are we putting in this bill? We are putting in the  money needed to make sure it stays that way.

I am proud to support this bill because I came to Washington for one  reason: I came to Washington to make promises, keep promises, and prove  that the Republicans can lead and are willing to make sure that the  great American comeback continues.
