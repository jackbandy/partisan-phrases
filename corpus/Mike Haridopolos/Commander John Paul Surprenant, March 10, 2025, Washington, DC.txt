Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a true American  hero, Lieutenant Commander John Paul Surprenant, a retired officer in  the United States Navy, as we celebrate his upcoming 100th birthday and  service to our country.

Paul joined the Navy as a seaman recruit in 1943. He rose through the  ranks to become a lieutenant commander over a distinguished 30-year  career. He served on 13 Navy vessels, including the USS Tirante during  World War II, where his crew was awarded the Presidential Unit  Citation. He is the last surviving member of that crew.

Beyond his wartime service, his greatest legacy is his family: his  wife, Louise, a fellow Navy veteran, and their five children, two of  whom served in uniform.

Now retired in my hometown of Melbourne, Florida, Paul remains a  proud patriot whose century of life has been dedicated to the service  of our country and his family.

Madam Speaker, today, I honor Lieutenant Commander Surprenant. The  Nation salutes him.
