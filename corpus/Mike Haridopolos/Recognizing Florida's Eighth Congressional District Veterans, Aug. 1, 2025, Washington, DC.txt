Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize and honor seven  remarkable Americans whose military service embodies the very best of  our Nation.

Colonel Mark R. Baaden, Colonel John W. Mansur, Sergeant Raymond L.  Burkard, Chief Warrant Officer Thomas W. Thompson, Sergeant Jeff  William Patterson, Specialist Pascuale F. Coniglio, and Sergeant Lloyd  Lasenby each served our country with honor and unwavering commitment.

Though their paths and ranks differed, all shared a common purpose,  to defend our freedoms and protect the values that define the United  States of America.

Their careers reflect decades of sacrifice and discipline. They  represent the strength and resilience of our Armed Forces and the  patriotism of those who serve out of a deep sense of duty.

Some among them have borne the scars of war. Others have shaped the  lives of those they led and mentored. All have left a lasting impact on  their units, their communities, and this country.

It is my distinct privilege to include their names in the Record. May  their example inspire future generations to serve with the same  courage, integrity, and selflessness.
