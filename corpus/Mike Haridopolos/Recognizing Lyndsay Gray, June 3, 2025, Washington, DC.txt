https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691773/recognizing-lyndsay-gray


Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  distinguished Brevard County resident and Army veteran, Lyndsay Gray.

Enlisting in 2006, Ms. Gray served over a decade as a radiology  technologist.

After training at Fort Sam Houston and Fort Leonard Wood, she was  stationed at Walter Reed, where she led the mammography department and  was selected as a cadre for the Combat Medical Badge course.

She later deployed to Afghanistan, where she trained over 200  coalition troops and American troops in combat lifesaver skills.

Lyndsay medically retired in 2017 after service-connected injuries,  but today, Lyndsay is pursuing her Ph.D. and continues to serve fellow  veterans in our community.

Mr. Speaker, I salute Lyndsay Gray for outstanding service and her  lasting contribution to Floridians and all Americans.
