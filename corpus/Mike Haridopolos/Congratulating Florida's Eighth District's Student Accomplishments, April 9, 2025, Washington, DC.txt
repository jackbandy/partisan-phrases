Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, today we recognize the achievements of  several students from my district who accepted their appointment to the  service academies.

These students demonstrate not just academic achievement but also  strong devotion to our country. Young students like these will become  our Nation's leaders in the future.

It was my honor to call these students this weekend to congratulate  them on this true accomplishment.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Libby Russell and Zanna Paraskevas, who  were accepted to the United States Military Academy at West Point.

I congratulate Savion Kirby, Natalie Doig, Audrey Ponton, and  Maximilian Perez, who were accepted into the United States Air Force  Academy.

I congratulate Victoria Nelson, who was accepted into the United  States Naval Academy.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent each one of them in the United  States House of Representatives.
