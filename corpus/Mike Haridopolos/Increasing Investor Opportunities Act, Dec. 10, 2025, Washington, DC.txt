Increasing Investor Opportunities Act

Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 3383, the  Increasing Investor Opportunities Act.

Our country did not get to the top of the world by playing it safe.  We got here by putting capital to work, the very engine that former Fed  Chair Alan Greenspan wrote about in ``Capitalism in America.''

Our capital markets are the fuel and, ultimately, the rocket boosters  for innovation, and this bill, the INVEST Act, launches economic  growth.

I am also proud that my bill, the Greenlighting Growth Act, is a part  of this package, ripping away the red tape that has strangled emerging  companies in the JOBS Act. There are no more bureaucratic handcuffs.  Instead, we are giving startups the engine they need to grow.

We are fortunate to have Chair Hill and Chair Wagner's leadership on  this laser-focused bill. They do not just talk about innovation. They  have delivered it with this legislation.

This bill will make sure America's capital markets drive down costs,  lift up families, and keep us the number one place to do business in  the world. This is not theory. This is the American blueprint for  prosperity in action. Let's pass this good bill and greenlight the  future.
