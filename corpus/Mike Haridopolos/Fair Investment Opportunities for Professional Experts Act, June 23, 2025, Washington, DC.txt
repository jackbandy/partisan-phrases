Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act


Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I will be brief with this explanation.  I will first say that it is so nice to see our economy moving in the  right direction. This bill will give more opportunities to Americans to  invest with not as many regulations in their way. With these  challenging times overseas, it is nice to see that we recognize that  economic security equals national security, and by expanding the  qualified investor rule, which will give exactly that: more opportunity  to others.

This bill, led by our chairman, expands access to private capital  markets with those who have proven expertise. The bill allows investors  to qualify based on licenses, education, and job experience, not just  net worth.

It truly modernizes our investor standards to reflect today's  knowledge-based economy by widening their pool for investors who are  qualified. It fuels private investment and business growth while at the  same time keeping protections in place by the SEC and FINRA.

For these reasons, I support the good bill by our chairman.
