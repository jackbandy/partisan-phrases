Breaking the Gridlock Act


Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here this afternoon  to talk about what is so important to all of us, and that is  healthcare, not just health insurance.

A clean, 3-year extension brought by the minority would send $110  billion directly to insurance companies.

As the chairman just mentioned, a recent GAO report showed that 23  out of 24 fraudulent enrollees were approved and received taxpayer  subsidies directly to insurance companies. The GAO even reported that  they were not required to provide documentation, such as Social  Security numbers or income verification. It was money sent directly to  insurance companies from taxpayers.

Democrats said healthcare would be affordable, yet since the  implementation of this bad idea, premiums are up 80 percent. At the  same time, nearly 20 percent of the individual market claims are denied  by insurance companies.

In 2024, 87 percent of the revenue made by insurance companies  selling ACA exchange claims came from taxpayer dollars.

To quote an article from The Wall Street Journal, Democrats sold  ObamaCare on the false pretenses that it would make healthcare  affordable. Let me say that again: false pretenses. Extending the  subsidies would perpetuate that fraud.

We passed a bill before Christmas that would reduce costs by 11  percent, and that was from the CBO. The CBO said that, and we are not  exactly the biggest fans of that unique organization. Our plan would  actually fight fraud, which was highlighted in the GAO report.

Finally, we would actually give choice to individuals as opposed to  this one-size-fits-all debacle. We want healthcare, not a plan to  simply fund insurance companies.
