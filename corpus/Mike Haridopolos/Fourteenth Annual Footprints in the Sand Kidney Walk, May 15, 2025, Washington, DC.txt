Fourteenth Annual Footprints in the Sand Kidney Walk


Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, on May 10, 2025, the Fourteenth Annual  Footsteps in the Sand Kidney Walk took place in Cocoa Beach.

This event this year raised $22,000 for kidney patients in need.

Today, I rise to honor the memory of those individuals whose lives  were tragically cut short and to recognize the courage of their family  members who gave the gift of life on their behalf: Chase Agudelo, Seth  Anthony Beyrooti, Michael Robert Brown, Shawn Carpenter, Jose Collins,  Linda Marie Couch, Giovanni Cruz, Brooke Dawkins, Andrew Dorsey, Blake  Eden, ``CJ'' Jordan-Michael Grey, Melissa Houser, Kory Humphrey, Jacob  Monroe, Tribhawan Anand Persaud, Dylan Rowe, Decobe Esters, Deja  Thompson, Donald Walker, Nathan Walker, and Geoffrey Wasden.

Mr. Speaker, I thank them for their sacrifice.
