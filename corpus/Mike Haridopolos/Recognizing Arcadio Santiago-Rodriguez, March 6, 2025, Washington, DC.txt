Recognizing Arcadio Santiago-Rodriguez


Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary service of Master Sergeant Arcadio Santiago-Rodriguez, a  proud member of the Army's 65th Infantry Regiment, known as the  Borinqueneers.

During the Korean war, then-Private First Class Santiago-Rodriguez  displayed extraordinary heroism in the face of danger. When his squad  leader was gravely wounded, he swiftly took command, rallying his  fellow soldiers and leading them safely with unwavering courage and  determination.

Later, while evacuating a wounded comrade, he singlehandedly engaged  five enemy soldiers, killing four and capturing a fifth, forcing that  captured soldier to carry the wounded soldier to safety. For his  heroism, he was awarded the Silver Star.

At 101 years old, Master Sergeant Santiago-Rodriguez continues to  inspire us.

I join my predecessor, the Honorable Bill Posey, in honoring Mr.  Rodriguez, and I hope that he will be recognized for his unwavering  service to our Nation.
