Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Suhina Mitra, a  remarkable high school student from Brevard County, who has shown an  incredible commitment to service in our community.

While attending West Shore Junior and Senior High School, she became  youth ambassador for the Children's Home Society of Florida. She has  volunteered with groups like Who We Play For and HOSA Future Health  Professionals.

Through a web-based campaign, Mitra raised over $20,000 to enhance  STEM education activities at Endeavour Elementary School and even  served as her senior high class president. For her efforts, she earned  the national Peter R. Marsh Silent Servant Scholarship Award.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Ms. Mitra for her leadership and  her service to community.
