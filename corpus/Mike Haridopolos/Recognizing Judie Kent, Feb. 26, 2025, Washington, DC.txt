Recognizing Judie Kent

Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I offer good news today. I rise to  honor the extraordinary bravery of Judie Kent, a young woman and nurse  from my district in Vero Beach, Florida.

This past week, Judie's quick thinking and courageous actions saved  the life of a motorcyclist and father of five who was struck by a car  on his way to work.

As she drove past the scene, Judie instinctively pulled over and used  her incredible medical knowledge to administer critical aid. Her swift  response stabilized his wounds, and she is credited with saving the  man's leg and possibly even his life.

It is selfless acts like these that exemplify the best of our  community, and I am honored to recognize Judie's heroism today.

Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to share her story, and I thank her  for her amazing service and resolve.
