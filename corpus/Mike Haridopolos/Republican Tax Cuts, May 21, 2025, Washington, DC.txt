Republican Tax Cuts


Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, every day I hear this big story about  how we are making big tax cuts for the rich.

Let's be abundantly clear once again, today, that the current tax  rate on the wealthiest Americans is 37 percent. Under the new law we  will be passing soon enough, it will stay at 37 percent.

The people who will get the true tax cuts in this bill are people who  have earned Social Security, people who have earned tips, and have  earned overtime pay. That is the message we need to make clear. It is  37 percent now, and it will be in the future.

We are not cutting taxes for the rich. We are looking out for the  folks that make America work every day and who have been hardest hit in  the last 4 years by high inflation and failed government policies.
