Disapproving the Rule Submitted By the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Relating to ``Overdraft Lending: Very Large Financial Institutions''


Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution to  overturn the CFPB's overdraft rule. This is a classic midnight maneuver  from the previous administration that ignored market realities.

Let's be clear: It is competition, not heavy-handed regulation that  drives down costs. According to the CFPB's own data from 2020 to 2023,  overdraft fees fell by 50 percent without this rule. That means the  market is working, and that is why I support this resolution.
