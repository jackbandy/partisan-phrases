Recognizing Extraordinary Work of Kennedy Space Center

Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the extraordinary  work done in my district at Kennedy Space Center.

I recently had the privilege of touring this iconic vehicle assembly  building, a structure that rises 716 feet into the Florida sky. For  almost 60 years, it has stood as a symbol of American space ambition.

This is where the mighty Saturn V rockets were assembled, launching  Apollo astronauts toward the Moon. It is where three decades of the  space shuttle fleet took shape, and that legacy continues today, where  work is being done to prepare the Artemis II mission.

During my visit, I saw firsthand the progress on the SLS, the Space  Launch System, the rocket that will carry astronauts on a 10-day  journey to the Moon, further than we have been from the Earth for over  50 years.

I saw up close the SLS core stage, a 212-foot fuel tank engineered to  launch the next era of human spaceflight, and the two solid rocket  boosters that have already been stacked onto the mobile launch  platform. Just days ago, the core stage has been integrated with the  boosters, a major milestone in the path to launch.

In the coming months, the crews at the KSC will add more hard work to  the SLS, culminating in securing the Orion spacecraft to the top. The  Artemis II mission is currently on track to launch in April of next  year. When it lifts off, 9 million pounds of thrust will carry American  astronauts further from Earth, as I mentioned before, in over 50 years,  into our lunar orbit. When Artemis II succeeds, America will aim to  return astronauts to the lunar surface in 2027.

These missions are a statement to the world that America still leads,  still explores, and still dares. That is why the work being done by  NASA at Kennedy Space Center is so critical. This team is working  tirelessly to keep Artemis II on schedule, pushing through complex  technical milestones with focus and determination.

This mission matters. Returning to the Moon opens the door to the  future, deep space exploration, technological breakthroughs, and a new  chapter in American space leadership.

It is a reminder to every child looking at the sky that there are  still frontiers to cross and still dreams to chase.

Mr. Speaker, this is a race. China has made no secret of its lunar  ambitions. This Communist dictatorship is building, planning, and  pushing to plant their flag on the Moon and to shape the rules that  follow. We cannot afford to yield that ground.

The Nation that leads in space will shape the world order on Earth,  and that leadership must be American. Kennedy Space Center is where we  make that stand, and I applaud the work of the men and women who are  making Artemis II a reality. I am proud to say the future of American  spaceflight is alive and well at Florida's Kennedy Space Center.
