Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the NDAA, which is designed to  strengthen Federal authorities in detecting and mitigating dangerous  drone activities.

Unmanned aircraft systems, while offering significant potential for  innovation, also present a clear and present risk to the public. This  issue is especially urgent in Florida, which is home to some of the  busiest seaports in America.

Drone attacks on a major seaport would pose a serious threat to our  national security. I appreciate the good work done in the bill.
