Congratulating Bill McInnish


Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Bill  McInnish for his outstanding contributions to education and workforce  development at Eau Gallie High School in Melbourne, Florida, where he  teaches aviation fabrication and assembly technology.

His 27 years of technology and CTE teaching experience are best  defined by his passion and dedication to helping students succeed in  the aerospace industry. As a veteran of the Coast Guard, where he  performed search and rescue missions, he established the first-ever  aviation fabrication and assembly program in an economically  disadvantaged high school.

Under his leadership, this program became the first in the Nation to  award high school students with the National Aerospace/Aircraft  Assembly certification.

It is with great pride that I recognize his exceptional achievements  in building the local talent pipeline, with graduates securing  positions at companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, United Launch  Alliance, and others.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Bill for his incredible contribution to our  district.
