Space Dominance


Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleagues, in fact, the  freshmen Members of Congress, to reach far beyond party lines, beyond  State borders, and even beyond our planet. It affects every American,  shaping our economy, our security, and our future. I am talking about  space.

As President Trump said, you can't be number one on Earth if you are  number two in space. I am going to yield to our senior Member of the  freshman class this year, Vince Fong.

Congressman Fong represents the 20th District of California. He is on  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, as well as the Science  Committee, specifically serving on the Space and Aeronautics Committee.  He proudly represents the Central Valley of California.

Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, next we have, from the great State of  Alaska, the at-large Member from Alaska, Congressman Nick Begich, who  is on the Natural Resources Committee, the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, as well as the Committee on Science, Space,  and Technology.

Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Begich for his  thoughtful words.

I next will introduce the Congressman from the Third Congressional  District in Utah. Congressman Kennedy is one of the few legislators in  Washington who has both a medical degree and a law degree. He is a  former Utah State Senator, he is the proud father of eight, and he will  speak tonight on the issue of space and its importance in his district.

Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind  words and, more importantly, his efforts in Utah to promote the  industry and make sure we have American dominance in space.

As was mentioned, I am proud to be the new chairman of the  Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics. It is not only imperative to our  district but to the Nation for so many different reasons.

I think the chart behind me is really telling the story about America  today. Just a few short years ago, we ceded space dominance to other  nations. We actually had to get a ride to space from, of all people,  our former adversary, Russia. Here we are today, as you look at this  graph, with, last year alone, 155 launches into space, 93 from the  Kennedy Space Center in my home district. We are well on our way toward  space dominance, and we are not slowing down.

In 2025 alone, 26 additional flights have left our skies and, of  course, are orbiting around our world today, providing the  telecommunications necessary not only for commercial use but for  military use, as well, to make sure that our men and women are  protected when GPS is essential.

Tonight, we will have yet another launch into the sky as SpaceX is  propelling this movement forward.

As we recognize, space is important for our economy, infrastructure,  and national defense. It enables modern life, from powering GPS  communications to weather forecasting, artificial limb technology,  solar cells, fire-resistant fabrics, and even medical imaging and  biotechnology.

Space is research and development, and space is a return on  investment. The latest estimates have a 10-1 return for taxpayers when  we lead the world in space and innovative technology.

We have been in this space race before. Everyone can ask their  parents, or maybe a few of us in the Congress, to know that 1969 was a  life changer for so many people. When you ask those folks alive in 1969  what it was like to see a man on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, making that  famous proclamation, it was a game changer. We proved that anything is  possible here in America. We moved forward from that with shuttle  technology and, more recently, with some of the amazing advancements  with SpaceX.

We are in a new space race today, unfortunately, with another  communist dictatorship, that being China. The question is: Will we win  that space race once again? I am confident we will do so for one simple  reason: Our President is confident we can accomplish this.

Remember, our President literally created the Space Force. He is a  true believer. Back in 2019, he created the Space Force because he knew  that space dominance would allow us to not only improve technologically  but make sure that our men and women in the military are protected.

We are confident that Artemis II, which is scheduled to go off in  early 2026, will propel us to the Moon once again and beyond. We like  to say: From the Lagoon to the Moon and Beyond. That is our slogan back  in the Eighth District of Florida, and we are confident that that will  be a reality.

It is about leadership. It is about job security. It is about  economic security. It is about military security and making sure that  we make the next innovations and reach the next frontier. Dominance  means not just military, but it also means jobs and a brighter future  for so many.

When you talk about jobs in the space industry, it is not a job to so  many; it is a career. The dedicated folks at NASA are moving forward  with these new technologies. They are working hand-in-hand in public- private partnerships with companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket  Lab, Boeing, L3Harris, and so many others, along with Northrop Grumman,  to make sure that we are dominant in space so that we do not take  second place in space and lose that technological dominance, which is  so necessary to win this latest cold war.

Just a few years ago, we were playing catch-up. As I mentioned  before, we were literally relying on the Russians to get our men and  women off to the space station. Now, since 2016, we have moved forward,  and as this graph shows behind me, we are once again space-dominant. It  is again the great American comeback, and we are moving beyond it  today.

In just a few weeks, we will see the SpaceX Dragon making sure that  our men and women on the space station are returned back to Earth. More  and more companies are developing space technologies so we can have  satellites and space infrastructure, keeping ahead of our global  competitors.

We cannot be complacent. Just because we lead today does not mean it  is permanent. We must defend ourselves against China and Russia, which  are not standing still. They are major competitors, and they are making  important investments in trying to militarize space, despite the treaty  from 1967. We must innovate. We must invest. We must push forward to  keep our strong position today.

Sadly, China especially does not play by the rules. Just a few years  ago, they literally on purpose created a collision that has led to so  much space debris around our Earth today. We must use our technology  for missile detection, surveillance and reconnaissance, and global  communications to stay ahead of this communist dictatorship.

Fortunately, the U.S. Space Force, which, as I mentioned, was  established in 2019, maintains our dominance and ensures that we are  going to develop hypersonic defense, space-based missile interceptors,  and AI-driven surveillance to keep us ahead of those adversaries. We  cannot afford to fall behind because the price of inaction is just too  high.

The economy of space has also grown dramatically over the last few  years. In 2022 alone, it added $132 billion to the U.S. GDP. It is  projected that, by 2040, it will be over $1 trillion, creating 350,000  private-sector jobs across multiple fields, including launch  technicians, software developers, engineers, researchers, construction,  and manufacturing everything from satellites to heat shields.

Space is not only a source of innovation but also a pillar of the  American economy, fueling growth in both high-tech and blue-collar  industries, as I mentioned.

Small businesses are also benefiting from this emergence. Just a few  weeks ago, I had the honor of visiting a small company called Eta  Space. It is a company in my district that employs 20 people, but they  are having a massive impact on the changing space world. They developed  a satellite that will experiment with cryogenic fuels in orbit, a key  technology for orbit refueling. This innovation will pave the way for  long-distance space travel, making missions to Mars and beyond more  viable and more cost effective.

I might mention, as a member of the Financial Services Committee,  which our Speaker is today, as well, this is an example of community  banks. It was a community bank that allowed Eta Space to get the  financing they needed to put this project together and lead the  technological development we need to go to Mars in the future. Despite  their small size, they are launching  their satellite this year, a testament to the power of American  ingenuity.

These public-private partnerships are key. It is not just a  government program. Companies like SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin  have dramatically reduced launch costs and are saving taxpayers  billions. These firms work alongside NASA and the Department of  Defense, proving that the private industry of America can be a powerful  force in advancing the United States' space leadership. Their success  creates jobs, strengthens our national security, and keeps America at  the forefront of the global space race.

Commercial space is the free market revolution. If you haven't  already done so, read the recent book by Isaacson about Elon Musk. He  basically looked at NASA, saw some of the challenges they faced after  the Apollo program, the cancellation of our shuttle program, and even  the challenges we face in the ARIES program, which was canceled, the  Constellation program, which was canceled, and the X-33 program, and he  said we can do it better at a better cost and win the space race.  Commercial space is the future as they work in partnership with NASA.

Before SpaceX, launch costs were prohibitively high with a single  mission costing hundreds of millions of dollars.

The Falcon 9 rocket, with its reusable booster system, has slashed  costs by a factor of 10. This cost reduction has made space more  accessible, spurring new industries, as I mentioned before, like  satellite internet, space-based manufacturing, and even orbital  tourism.

There are more players and more innovation. The Blue Origin New Glenn  rocket launched recently; Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, future  markets--space manufacturing, asteroid mining, and orbital energy  production are all emerging technologies.

When these companies compete and innovate, they drive down costs for  everyone and, more importantly, will have on-Earth benefits.

One of the issues that people have asked me about is this issue of  rural broadband. For those who don't know, this is a program that has  been allocated over $40 billion so that everyone, not just a select few  in higher urban areas, can enjoy high-speed internet access. This  program, which is allocated over $40 billion, is one which takes time,  because as everyone knows who is in business, you need to get the  permits. It takes a while to get the rights-of-way purchased, and it  takes a while to lay that cable for high-speed internet access.

With the new Starlink system which SpaceX is launching up now, this  can be not only at lower cost but, more importantly, can get to market  faster so that every American can enjoy the access to high-speed  internet. It will save us billions so that we can not only pay down the  debt but also afford the tax cuts which Americans deserve.

In conclusion, we are in the golden age of American spaceflight. We  are witnessing a true renaissance of space exploration where the future  is literally being built today.

I don't know what is next. There are stories about mining asteroids  for rare-earth metals to support global industries; large commercial  space stations that can replace the ISS and host research; permanent  human habitation on the Moon laying the foundation for deeper space  travel; and the human exploration and the settlement of Mars, an  achievement that will truly define this century.

These are not science fiction novels. These are active projects by  American companies, American scientists, and American engineers  bringing in the golden age of American spaceflight.

In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the urgency of action is now. America's  leadership in space is hard-earned, but it is not guaranteed. Our  economy, our technological future, and our national security all depend  on continued space investment.

Congress must act to ensure that the United States remains the leader  in the final frontier. This is our moment. If we invest in space today,  then we will be stronger, safer, and more prosperous for generations to  come.

As I conclude, as the President said well: You can't be number one on  Earth if you are not number one in space.

Mr. Speaker, I especially thank Congressman Fong, Congressman Begich,  and Congressman Kennedy for joining me tonight.
