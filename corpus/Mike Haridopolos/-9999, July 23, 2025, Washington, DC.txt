Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th  anniversary of Indian River County, Florida, founded on June 29, 1925.

For a century, this community has stood as a jewel on the Treasure  Coast, a place where history, culture, and natural beauty come together  in extraordinary ways.

It has grown from humble roots to a thriving community, celebrating a  strong economy, welcoming neighborhoods, and stunning environment. From  the pristine shores of Vero Beach to the citrus groves of Fellsmere,  Indian River County embodies the very best of Florida living.

Mr. Speaker, today, we recognize and celebrate a century in paradise.  I congratulate the people of Indian River County on their 100th  anniversary and 100 remarkable years.
