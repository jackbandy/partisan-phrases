Mr. TIMMONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise for my bill, H.R. 4431, the  Improving Capital Allocation for Newcomers Act, also known as the ICAN  Act.

I am proud to partner with my colleague Representative Brittany  Pettersen on this bipartisan legislation that expands access to venture  capital far beyond our Nation's traditional financial hubs.

H.R. 4431 updates the qualifying venture capital fund exemption by  raising the capital cap from $10 million to $50 million and by  increasing the allowable number of investors from 250 to 500.

These updates allow venture funds to raise more capital from more  individuals. This will support the growth of startups located outside  of Silicon Valley and other major financial centers.

Today, nearly half of the United States' venture funding goes into  companies in California alone, and more than 70 percent is concentrated  in only four States. Meanwhile, many entrepreneurs in other regions  struggle to secure critical Series A funding, which limits their  ability to grow and attract later-stage investments.

Mr. Speaker, an entrepreneur in Spartanburg, South Carolina, deserves  the same access to capital as an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley. This  bill democratizes venture capital by enabling more Americans to invest  in their own communities, drive innovation, and create good-paying  jobs. It is about expanding opportunity and fostering economic growth  in regions that are much in need.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this legislation and to help ensure that investors and  entrepreneurs in every one of our districts have a fair and level  playing field.
