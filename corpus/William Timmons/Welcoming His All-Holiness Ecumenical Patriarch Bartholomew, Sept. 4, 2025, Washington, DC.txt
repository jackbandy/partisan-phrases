Mr. TIMMONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome to Washington,  D.C., His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual  leader of Orthodox Christianity worldwide. As Archbishop of  Constantinople--New Rome, His All-Holiness is recognized as the ``first  among equals'' of Orthodox Primates and shepherds more than 300 million  faithful across the globe.

Since his election in 1991, Patriarch Bartholomew has been an  unwavering advocate for peace, interfaith dialogue, religious freedom,  and environmental stewardship, earning him the title of ``Green  Patriarch'' and international recognition for his vision of  reconciliation and unity. He has convened historic gatherings of  Orthodox leaders, fostered dialogue with other Christian traditions,  and extended a hand of friendship to leaders of the Jewish and Muslim  faiths.

In South Carolina's 4th District, the Greek Orthodox community has  been a vital part of our religious and cultural life. Families in  Greenville and Spartanburg have shared their faith and traditions for  generations, strengthening the bonds of community and enriching the  fabric of our state.

On behalf of my constituents in South Carolina's 4th District,  including the faithful at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in  Spartanburg, I extend a warm welcome to His All-Holiness Ecumenical  Patriarch Bartholomew. His presence in Washington is a reminder of the  enduring bonds of faith, freedom, and shared values that unite people  of all backgrounds.
