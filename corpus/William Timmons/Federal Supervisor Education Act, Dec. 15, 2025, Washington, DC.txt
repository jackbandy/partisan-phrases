Mr. Speaker, the American public relies on Federal supervisors to  lead a workforce that provides high-quality customer service and  faithful execution of the law.

These expectations and standards require a level of professionalism  that can be improved by strengthening relevant education offerings  available to Federal supervisors. My bill would do just that, by  bolstering existing requirements in Federal law governing Federal  workforce training.

Various reports and memos from agencies such as the GAO, Office of  Personnel Management, and the Merit Systems Protection Board indicate a  need to improve relevant educational opportunities for Federal  supervisors.

The Federal Supervisor Education Act, a bipartisan bill dating back  to the 114th Congress, articulates and executes best practices in  relation to Federal supervisory training, including how to effectively  manage employees with unacceptable performance.

These are basic, nonpartisan concepts that are generally available to  private-sector business supervisors and, if implemented, would advance  the interests of good government and strengthen the Federal workforce  on behalf of the American taxpayer.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. TIMMONS. Mr. Speaker, I also thank the House Oversight Committee  for unanimously supporting my legislation in a recent markup. Given the  bill's advancement of good-government principles, I urge my colleagues  to vote for this long overdue legislation, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
