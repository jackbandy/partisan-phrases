Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding  young leader in our community, Kacee Gray, who has been named the Cass  City Junior Citizen of the Year for 2025. Kacee exemplifies the values  of hard work, dedication, and service, making a profound and lasting  impact on Cass City and beyond.

A soon-to-be graduate, Kacee plans to attend Alma College to pursue a  Bachelor's Degree in Business, with the goal of becoming an insurance  agent. Her academic excellence is evident through numerous honors,  including being a Red Hawk Rockstar, a consistent presence on the honor  roll, and earning academic recognition in subjects like English,  Spanish, and Physics.

Beyond her academic achievements, Kacee has demonstrated an  extraordinary commitment to service. She has dedicated her time to  uplifting those around her through extensive volunteer work, including  serving at Revive Common Grounds, assisting with local blood drives,  supporting VFW spaghetti dinners, and bringing holiday joy to children  through Christmas for Kids. She has played an integral role  in school events, from setting up classrooms to managing concession  stands and coordinating prom preparations. Her tireless efforts reflect  a deep-rooted dedication to bettering her community and serving others.

Kacee is also an accomplished athlete, excelling in volleyball,  basketball, softball, and track. She has earned multiple accolades,  including All-Conference First Team, All-Region Outside Hitter, and  All-State Honorable Mention. Her leadership extends beyond the court-- serving as President of Student Council, Treasurer of the National  Honor Society, and a dedicated member of various extracurricular  organizations, always striving to lead with compassion and integrity.

What sets Kacee apart is her unwavering commitment to lifting others  up. Whether stepping outside her comfort zone to sing the National  Anthem at sporting events or leading by example in her community, she  embodies the spirit of service and resilience.

Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Kacee Gray for her  remarkable achievements and dedication to service. She represents the  very best of Cass City's next generation of leaders, and I have no  doubt that she will continue to make a meaningful impact wherever she  goes.
