Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with profound respect and  gratitude to recognize the distinguished service of Chief Warrant  Officer 4 James McInnis, United States Coast Guard, as our Veteran of  the Month for December 2025 from Michigan's 9th Congressional District.  His more than two decades of dedicated service exemplify the highest  traditions of our Armed Forces.

CWO4 McInnis devoted more than 24 years to honorable service in the  United States Coast Guard after enlisting in 1980 and completing basic  training in Cape May, New Jersey. He began his career aboard  operational cutters in the Great Lakes, supporting essential missions  including fisheries enforcement, search and rescue, icebreaking, and  aids to navigation. These missions were vital to the safety of mariners  and the protection of our waterways.

As he advanced through the enlisted ranks, CWO4 McInnis served in  increasingly responsible operational and supervisory roles. He  supported buoy tending and lighthouse operations throughout the Great  Lakes and later coordinated extensive search and rescue efforts across  large maritime regions, overseeing thousands of cases while leading and  mentoring Coast Guard personnel.

Upon promotion to Chief Warrant Officer, Mr. McInnis assumed officer- level responsibilities across multiple Coast Guard missions. He led law  enforcement teams supporting international drug interdiction operations  aboard United States Navy and allied vessels, deploying to the  Caribbean, eastern Pacific, and the Middle East. He also served as an  Aids to Navigation Officer in several major ports, supervising cutters  and crews responsible for maintaining critical waterways and restoring  navigation systems following hurricanes and other emergencies.

In the later years of his career, CWO4 McInnis returned to senior sea  and staff assignments, conducting offshore buoy tending, environmental  response, and complex recovery missions. He concluded his Coast Guard  service in the Great Lakes region, overseeing operations, training, and  navigation systems while supporting the Coast Guard Auxiliary.

Throughout his distinguished career, CWO4 McInnis earned numerous  awards, including four Coast Guard Commendation Medals, five Coast  Guard Achievement Medals, the Navy Achievement Medal, the 9/11 Medal,  two Southwest Asia Campaign Medals, the Kuwait Liberation Medal from  Kuwait, six Sea Service Ribbons, three Good Conduct Medals, and both  the Expert Pistol Medal and Expert Rifle Medal.

Following his retirement in July of 2004, Mr. McInnis continued his  commitment to service through education. Using a degree earned while on  active duty, he taught in Wisconsin's prison system and later, as  Education Director, led the introduction of an associate degree pilot  program within state prisons for the first time since 1994. That  program has since expanded statewide and continues to provide life- changing educational opportunities. He retired from the Wisconsin  Department of Corrections in 2024 and returned to Michigan with his  wife, Anne, to enjoy traveling and cheering for the Detroit Lions.

Mr. Speaker, Chief Warrant Officer 4 James McInnis' lifetime of  service reflects steadfast dedication to our Nation and our  communities. His military leadership and postservice contributions have  strengthened lives and protected our freedoms, and it is my distinct  honor to recognize him as our Veteran of the Month for December 2025.
