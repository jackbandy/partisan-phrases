Recognizing the Life and Service of Deputy Sheriff Bradley J. Reckling


Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to  recognize the life and service of Deputy Sheriff Bradley J. Reckling.

Deputy Reckling served faithfully for 9 years with the Oakland County  Sheriff's Office. He was from Michigan's Ninth District.

Sadly, Deputy Reckling was killed in the line of duty on June 22,  2024. He was only 29 years old. When he was killed, he was a proud  husband and father to three beautiful daughters, with a fourth one on  the way.

As we mark National Police Week, we pause to honor the courage of  those who wear the badge, the ones who run toward danger, and far too  often those who pay the ultimate sacrifice like Deputy Reckling.

Every day, brave men and women put on their uniform and go to work  and they know they may not come home. We owe these people a lot more  than just a thank you. We owe them respect, admiration, and our  unwavering support.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to do the same and to honor  the life of Deputy Sheriff Brad Reckling. May we always appreciate the  men and women in blue.
