Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  distinguished service of Captain Mike Retzlaff, a proud veteran of the  United States Army whose dedication, leadership, and commitment to duty  reflect the highest traditions of military service.

Born and raised in Holly, Michigan, Captain Retzlaff pursued higher  education at Cedarville University, where he earned a Bachelor of  Science degree in Exercise Science and completed the Army ROTC program.  In 2017, he was commissioned as an Armor Officer in the United States  Army, marking the beginning of a career of honorable service to our  Nation.

Captain Retzlaff's first assignment was as a Tank Platoon Leader with  3rd Platoon, Battle Company, 1st Battalion, 66th Armored Regiment at  Fort Carson, Colorado. In 2019, he deployed to Kuwait in support of  Operation Spartan Shield, where his leadership made a significant  contribution to the mission's success. Upon returning, he served as the  Headquarters Company Executive Officer, managing company operations,  resources, and readiness. His performance and dedication during this  period earned him induction into the prestigious Order of St. George.

Following his time at Fort Carson, Captain Retzlaff attended the  Maneuver Captain's Career Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, graduating  in 2022. He was then assigned to the 2nd Squadron, 16th Cavalry  Regiment, where he served as an Armor Basic Officer Leader Course  (ABOLC) Tactics Instructor, training the next generation of Army  leaders.

As Troop Commander, he led more  than 100 soldiers and was responsible for executing live-fire gunnery  training for all new Armor Officers in the United States Army--an  essential mission he carried out with distinction.

Upon completion of command, Captain Retzlaff returned home to  Michigan, where he served at the Detroit Military Entrance Processing  Station. During his tenure, he enlisted more than 1,000 applicants into  their respective branches of service, shaping the future of America's  Armed Forces.

Over the course of his military career, Captain Retzlaff completed  numerous schools, including the Armor Basic Officer Leader Course, the  Army Reconnaissance Course, Air Assault School, the Advanced  Situational Awareness Course, the Maneuver Leaders Maintenance Course,  and the Maneuver Captain's Career Course.
