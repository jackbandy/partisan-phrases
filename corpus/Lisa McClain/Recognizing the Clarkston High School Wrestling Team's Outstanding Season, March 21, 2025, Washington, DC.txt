Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the exceptional  achievements of the Clarkston High School wrestling team and their  dedicated coaching staff during the 2024-2025 season. Their unwavering  commitment, discipline, and perseverance have brought immense pride to  their school and community, both on and off the mat.

This season, the Clarkston Wolves continued their tradition of  excellence, securing their 18th consecutive District Championship and  capturing their first Regional Championship since 2021. Their  remarkable determination propelled them to the State Semifinals for the  first time since 2007--an extraordinary milestone in the program's  history.

Beyond their dominance in competition, these student-athletes  demonstrated the same level of excellence in the classroom, earning  recognition as an Academic All-State Team--a testament to their hard  work and dedication both as wrestlers and as scholars.

Individually, the Wolves had an impressive presence at the state  tournament, with nine wrestlers qualifying, six earning a place on the  podium, one claiming a State Championship title, and another finishing  as a State Runner-Up. These outstanding accomplishments reflect their  relentless drive, skill, and sportsmanship.

At the heart of this success is Head Coach Brian Gibbs, whose  leadership and passion for the sport have shaped Clarkston wrestling  into a powerhouse program. His impact on these student-athletes was  recognized with the Regional Coach of the Year award and the  prestigious Michigan Division 1 Coach of the Year honor--achievements  that underscore his dedication to fostering a winning culture built on  hard work, respect, and perseverance.

This program's success is also a testament to the collective effort  of 55 student-athletes and seven devoted coaches, each playing a vital  role in this historic season.

Mr. Speaker, the Clarkston High School wrestling team has exemplified  the values of teamwork, resilience, and excellence. I extend my sincere  congratulations to the entire team, their coaches, and their families  for an unforgettable season. Their achievements serve as an inspiration  to their peers, their community, and the future generations of  Clarkston wrestlers.
