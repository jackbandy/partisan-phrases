Recognizing Jennifer Sevilla Korn for Her Public Service and Leadership


Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jennifer Sevilla  Korn for her public service and leadership.

A native of East Los Angeles and a proud Marine Corps spouse,  Jennifer is a national conservative leader, policy expert, and  political strategist whose faith has guided her throughout a  distinguished 20-year career in public service. She helped elect and  advise two U.S.  Presidents and two U.S. Attorneys General while leading national  grassroots and communications efforts that achieved historic gains  among minority, veteran, and faith voters.

Appointed by President Trump as Deputy Assistant to the President and  Director of the newly created White House Faith Office, Jennifer works  to protect religious freedom, ensuring Americans of all faiths have a  voice in their government. She advises the President on matters of  faith at home and abroad. Previously, she co-founded the National Faith  Advisory Board, the largest faith coalition in the United States,  representing leaders from every state, denomination, and ethnic  background.

Her earlier career includes serving as Deputy Political Director at  the Republican National Committee, Director of Hispanic and Women's  Affairs in the George W. Bush White House, and Senior Advisor to two  U.S. Attorneys General at the Department of Justice. As a She Leads  America honoree, Jennifer believes leadership is a calling to serve  others with both truth and compassion, empowering individuals,  strengthening families, and preserving freedom for future generations.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating this  outstanding woman for her public service and leadership.
