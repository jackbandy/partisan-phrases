Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend the  Lakes Pilots Association, on their completion of their new docks and  seawall project to preserve the maritime heritage and identity of Port  Huron as a Great Lakes port city.

For over six decades, the Lakes Pilots Association has provided  expert pilotage services to foreign-flagged vessels operating in the  critical waters of District 2. Under the leadership of President  Captain Tony Brando, the Association has played a vital role in  ensuring the safety of navigation, protecting the environment, and  supporting economic activity in the Blue Water Area, including the Port  Huron region.

The Lakes Pilots Association is a trusted guardian of our waterways.  With a team of 17 highly trained pilots and 9 full-time dedicated  employees, the Association is known for its unwavering professionalism,  safety, and reliability. Their efforts not only safeguard ships, cargo,  and crews, but also help maintain the physical and economic integrity  of the waterways they serve.

The Association's contributions extend beyond maritime operations.  Through community outreach efforts like the ``Touch a Freighter''  program, supported in partnership with the local community foundation,  the Lakes Pilots Association has fostered public understanding and  appreciation of Great Lakes shipping and its importance to our region's  heritage.

Their recent investments--including $1 million in new docks and a  seawall--as well as $3.5 million in new pilot boats, demonstrate a  strong commitment to strengthening infrastructure, enhancing  operational capacity, and ensuring long-term service to the region.

The Lakes Pilots Association maintains a close partnership with the  City of Port Huron and other local harbor stakeholders. Their ongoing  collaboration helps preserve the city's identity as a historic port  city, enrich its maritime legacy, and contribute meaningfully to its  economic vitality.

Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and immense pride that we  honor and thank the Lakes Pilots Association for their decades of  dedicated service, commitment to safety and environmental stewardship,  and for their indispensable role in sustaining commerce and maritime  heritage throughout the Great Lakes region.
