Recognizing United States Navy Radioman Petty Officer 3rd Class Natale ``nate'' John Scarpelli


Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with deep respect and  admiration to recognize the remarkable service of Radioman Petty  Officer 3rd Class Natale ``Nate'' Scarpelli, a proud veteran of the  United States Navy and our distinguished Veteran of the Month for  October 2025 from Michigan's 9th Congressional District. His courage,  dedication, and sacrifice during World War II reflect the very best of  the American spirit.

Radioman Scarpelli answered his country's call to service in 1942. He  enlisted in the United States Navy and was assigned as a Radioman Petty  Officer 3rd Class aboard the USS Moreno (AT-87). He joined his ship in  North Africa, becoming the youngest member of a seasoned crew.

The USS Moreno played a critical role in the war effort, carrying out  dangerous missions that included firefighting, towing disabled  warships, deploying depth charges, underwater welding, and escort  operations. Radioman Scarpelli's skill as a radioman, communicating  through Morse code and signal lamp, kept the crew connected during  critical engagements. He also served as the ship's marksman, helping  set sights on its 5-inch cannon, 40mm guns, and long-range weapons.

Radioman Scarpelli's service brought him to the frontlines of some of  the war's most pivotal campaigns. The USS Moreno supported the Allied  invasion of Sicily, clearing the coastline for advancing Army units.  Later, it provided support during the Invasion of Southern France.  During combat, Radioman Scarpelli was wounded by land artillery and  treated at a field hospital before rejoining his ship, where he  continued his duties, including cutting mine cables and neutralizing  deadly sea mines.

In one remarkable mission, the USS Moreno captured a German one-man  submarine armed with a torpedo. The vessel was brought aboard for  inspection, drawing the attention of senior military leadership eager  to study its design.

Radioman Scarpelli also served alongside his three brothers: Frank,  who fought in the Pacific with the Army; John, who took part in the  invasion of Northern France; and Augie, who manned guns on a Navy  merchant ship in the Pacific. Their shared service reflects the  extraordinary sense of duty and sacrifice that defined their  generation.

After the war, which he served through 1945, Radioman Scarpelli  returned home to Michigan. He completed a tool and die apprenticeship,  earned a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering, and began a  distinguished career at Ford Motor Company in Manufacturing  Engineering. There, he developed an innovative single-piece rear  differential system that was later acquired by MIT. He married in 1953,  retired at age 55, and spent the decades that followed traveling the  world, remaining dedicated to his family, faith, and community.

Mr. Speaker, Nate Scarpelli's life is a testament to service and  resilience. Whether on the deck of the USS Moreno or in the engineering  halls of Ford Motor Company, his contributions strengthened both our  Nation's security and its industry. It is my distinct honor to  recognize him as our Veteran of the Month for October 2025.
