Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride and  admiration to recognize the extraordinary life and milestone of Mr.  Edmund Good, a lifelong public servant and respected member of the  Michigan community, as he celebrates his 100th birthday.

For three decades, Mr. Good faithfully served as the Township Clerk  for Brookfield Township, where he carried out his duties with  integrity, diligence, and a steadfast commitment to his neighbors. His  leadership and service helped ensure that local government remained  accountable, transparent, and responsive to the needs of the people.

Mr. Good's dedication to his community was matched by his unwavering  commitment to his country's political life. He was honored to serve as  a delegate for Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, playing a  meaningful role in advancing their principles and vision during pivotal  moments in our Nation's history. His decades of support demonstrate not  only his loyalty to the values he holds dear but also his deep belief  in civic duty and citizen involvement in democracy.

Turning 100 years old is itself a remarkable achievement, a milestone  reached by few and deserving of the highest recognition. Yet, what  makes this occasion truly special is not only the years Mr. Good has  lived, but also the example he has set for all of us through his  service, dedication, and lifelong commitment to faith, family, and  community.

Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize Edmund Good on the  occasion of his 100th birthday. His life reflects the very best of  American perseverance, patriotism, and service. I ask my colleagues to  join me in celebrating this extraordinary man and wishing him continued  health and happiness in the years ahead.
