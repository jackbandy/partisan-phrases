Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a man whose lifetime  of service and dedication to Cass City has left an indelible mark on  our community. It is with great admiration that I recognize James E.  Baker, II, as the 2025 Cass City Citizen of the Year.

Born and raised in Cass City, Jim Baker has lived a life defined by  generosity, leadership, and an unwavering commitment to others. A proud  graduate of Cass City High School and Michigan Technological  University, he has built a successful career as the owner and president  of Jebco Consulting, where his expertise in electro-mechanical  engineering has been widely respected. Yet, despite his professional  success, his true legacy is his dedication to serving his community.

Jim's contributions to Cass City are immeasurable. As a mentor in the  Boy Scouts, he has guided generations of young men toward the rank of  Eagle Scout, instilling in them values of discipline, responsibility,  and service. His impact extends beyond Scouting, as he has dedicated  countless hours to coaching youth athletics, shaping the lives of young  athletes in Little League Baseball, high school football, and the Cass  City Youth Football initiative. His belief in the power of mentorship  has left a lasting impression on the young people he has supported and  inspired.

Beyond coaching and mentorship, Jim has worked tirelessly to  strengthen his community. He has been a dedicated member of the Rotary  Club, an advocate for educational initiatives, and a key organizer in  numerous fundraising efforts that have uplifted Cass City. Even in the  face of personal health challenges, undergoing both a liver and kidney  transplant, Jim has remained steadfast in his commitment to serving  others. The overwhelming support he received during his health battles  was a testament to the lives he has touched though his generosity and  kindness.

Mr. Speaker, James Baker is more than a community leader--he is a  pillar of Cass City, embodying the very best of selfless service,  mentorship, and resilience. It is my great privilege to recognize him  as the Cass City Citizen of the Year. His legacy of service will  continue to inspire and strengthen our community for generations to  come.
