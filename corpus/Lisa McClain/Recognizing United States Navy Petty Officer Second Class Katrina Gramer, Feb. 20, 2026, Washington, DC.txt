Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Petty Officer  Second Class Katrina Gramer for her honorable service to the United  States Navy and her unwavering dedication to supporting our veteran  community. Her service in uniform and her continued dedication to  fellow veterans represents the very best of our service members and the  values they uphold. It is my privilege to recognize her as our February  2026 Veteran of the Month.

A native of Port Huron, Michigan, Petty Officer Gramer enlisted in  the United States Navy in 1999. She completed basic training at Great  Lakes, Illinois, and went on to attend Anti-Submarine Warfare Training  School in San Diego, California, where she trained as a Sonar  Technician.

Her first duty station was in Yokosuka, Japan. While her ship was  operating in the Middle East, the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001, occurred. In the days that followed, her ship launched some of  the first Tomahawk cruise missiles into Afghanistan in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom, answering our Nation's call during a  defining moment in American history. She later served in California,  continuing her dedicated service.

Throughout her time in uniform, Petty Officer Gramer earned numerous  military honors, including the Meritorious Unit Commendation, Navy Unit  Commendation, National Defense Service Medal, and Armed Forces  Expeditionary Medal. These awards recognize her hard work and the  strong performance of the units she served with.

Following her honorable discharge in 2005, Mrs. Gramer continued to  pursue excellence. She earned two degrees: one in Early Childhood  Development and another in Business Administration. She successfully  operated a home childcare business while raising her three children.  Once her children reached school age, she discovered a new calling:  serving those who have served.

Mrs. Gramer has devoted herself to supporting veterans and their  families. She has held leadership positions within her local Veterans  of Foreign Wars Post, maintains membership in her local American Legion  Post, and has served as both Co-Director and Vice President of a local  veterans' resource center. She is an active member of her local honor  guard, where she performs live taps at services and provides honors at  football games, ceremonies, and parades, ensuring that the sacrifices  of our service members are remembered with dignity and respect.

Today, she serves as a Veteran Service Officer for the Vietnam  Veterans of America Michigan State Council. In this role, she assists  veterans, their families, surviving spouses, and caregivers in  navigating the VA benefits system. She takes great pride in ensuring  that those who served our Nation receive the benefits and recognition  they have earned.

Mrs. Gramer currently resides in Holly, Michigan with her husband,  their three children, and their beloved pets, including her trained  service dog, Tinkerbell. She is a proud Navy mother, as her oldest  child currently serves on active duty, carrying forward the family's  strong tradition of military service. Together, their family enjoys  camping, kayaking, bonfires, and sharing meals with one another.

Mr. Speaker, Petty Officer Second Class Katrina Gramer's commitment  to service extends far beyond her time in uniform. Through her  leadership, advocacy, and tireless work on behalf of veterans and their  families, she continues to make a meaningful difference in the lives of  those who have served our nation. It is my great privilege to recognize  her dedication and to honor her as our February 2026 Veteran of the  Month.
