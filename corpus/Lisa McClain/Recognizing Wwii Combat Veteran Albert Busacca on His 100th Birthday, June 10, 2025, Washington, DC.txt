Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Albert Busacca,  a World War II combat veteran, on his 100th birthday. His bravery,  resilience, and selflessness as a veteran helped shape a better world  for future generations. Today, we proudly honor and celebrate this  milestone birthday.

Albert served in combat during World War II in the 4th Infantry  Division and saw action in the European Theatre of Operations. His  efforts played a key role in providing peace for our country and does  not go unnoticed. He also continued to demonstrate his strong work  ethic at General Motors, where he later retired from leaving a proud  legacy of hard work behind.

Beyond his dedication to our country, Albert is a lifelong volunteer  who finds joy in helping his community. He spent a lot of his time  volunteering at soup kitchens, providing nutritious meals to families  and individuals in need.

Albert is also a devoted husband and loving father. He was married to  his wife for over 60 years, and together they raised 8 children. His  children describe him as an incredible father and one of the best  people they have had the pleasure of knowing.

Mr. Speaker, help me congratulate Albert Busacca, an inspiring  example of an American, on his 100th birthday. His contributions to our  country and community reflect his character--brave, selfless, and  committed to serving others. His century of life continues to inspire  his community.
