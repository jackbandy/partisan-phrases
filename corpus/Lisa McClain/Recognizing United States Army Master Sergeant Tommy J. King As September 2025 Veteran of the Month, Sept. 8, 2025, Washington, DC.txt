Recognizing United States Army Master Sergeant Tommy J. King As September 2025 Veteran of the Month


Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with profound respect and  gratitude to recognize the extraordinary service and unwavering  dedication of Master Sergeant Tommy J. King, a proud veteran of the  United States Army and our distinguished Veteran of the Month for  September 2025 from Michigan's 9th Congressional District. His  exceptional military career and steadfast commitment to duty,  excellence, and patriotism embody the very best of American service.

Master Sergeant King is a native of Houston, Texas, who answered the  call to serve his country in February of 1994 at the young age of 18.  He completed basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, followed  by Advanced Individual Training at Fort Lee, Virginia, where he trained  as an Automated Logistics Specialist (92A).

Over the course of 20 years in uniform, his service took him across  the globe with assignments at Camp Casey, Korea; Fort Campbell,  Kentucky; Fort Drum, New York; Kaiserslautern, Germany; and Schofield  Barracks, Hawaii. He also served as an instructor for the  Noncommissioned Officer Academy at Fort Lee, Virginia. While deployed  to Iraq as a Platoon Sergeant and First Sergeant with the 65th Engineer  Battalion, Master Sergeant King earned the Bronze Star for his  leadership and valor. He personally planned and led 72 combat logistics  patrol missions throughout Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom,  accomplishing each without the loss of a single soldier.

Later, Master Sergeant King deployed to Afghanistan as part of PEO  Soldier Weapons and PEO Soldier Sensor and Lasers under the TACOM Life  Cycle Management Command. There, he played a critical role in fielding  and training troops on Individual Gunshot Detection equipment, ensuring  the safety and effectiveness of our warfighters during Operation  Enduring Freedom.

Following his retirement from active duty, Master Sergeant King  remained with his family in Michigan. He supported the University of  Michigan's ROTC program before rejoining TACOM as a Logistics  Management Specialist. Over the years, he rose through the ranks to  become a GS-13 Team Lead for the Organic Industrial Base, demonstrating  the same commitment to mission success that defined his military  career. In August 2025, he concluded more than 35 years of combined  military and civilian service to our Nation.

Master Sergeant King now plans to dedicate his time to supporting  fellow veterans and strengthening the bonds of community that have  guided his life of service. His journey reflects not only a lifetime of  personal sacrifice, but also an enduring devotion to the United States  Army, his fellow soldiers, and the freedoms we hold dear.

Mr. Speaker, let us extend our deepest appreciation to Master  Sergeant Tommy J. King for his decades of selfless service to this  great Nation. His legacy of leadership, sacrifice, and patriotism will  continue to inspire generations to come, and it is my distinct honor to  recognize him as our Veteran of the Month.
