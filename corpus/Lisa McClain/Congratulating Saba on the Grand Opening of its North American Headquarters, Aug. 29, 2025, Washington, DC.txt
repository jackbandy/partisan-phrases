Congratulating Saba on the Grand Opening of its North American Headquarters


Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate SABA on the  grand opening of its new North American headquarters in St. Clair,  Michigan. This nearly 60,000 square foot facility marks a significant  milestone for a company that has grown into a global leader in  adhesives and sealants over the past 90 years.

Founded in the Netherlands, SABA has earned a strong reputation for  innovation, sustainability, and industry leadership--particularly in  the mattress and furniture sectors, where its adhesives are widely used  across the United States. With a market share exceeding 50 percent,  SABA plays an essential role in the products Americans use every day.

The new headquarters includes a one-of-a-kind technical center that  will serve as a hub for testing, training, and product development,  reinforcing the company's commitment to excellence and customer  collaboration. This $4 million investment not only expands production  and warehouse capacity, but also strengthens the local economy and  supports job growth in Michigan.

Mr. Speaker, I applaud SABA's continued success and leadership, and I  am proud to welcome their expanded presence in St. Clair. I wish them  the very best as they open this new chapter.
