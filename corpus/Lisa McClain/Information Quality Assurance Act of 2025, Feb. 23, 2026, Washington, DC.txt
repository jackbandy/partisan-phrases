Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the  Information Quality Assurance Act. This bill is common sense and  restores accountability, transparency, and trust in how the Federal  Government uses information to make decisions that impact the American  people.

Every day, Federal agencies issue regulations that affect our  workers, our small businesses, and our local communities. These  decisions can carry billions of dollars of economic consequences. Yet,  too often, those rules are based on incomplete data, outdated science,  or information that hasn't been properly reviewed for accuracy or  transparency. That is simply bad governing.

Americans deserve to know that when Washington bureaucrats act, they  are using reliable, high-quality information, not assumptions, not  political agendas, and not flawed data.

My bill strengthens safeguards to ensure Federal agencies rely on  data that meets clear standards for objectivity, integrity, and  accountability before new regulations move forward. This bill makes  government work better. It ensures decisions are guided by facts, and  it protects taxpayers from costly regulatory mistakes.

Businesses, job creators, and families deserve confidence that  Federal rules are grounded in reality and not bureaucracy. At its core,  this is about trust. It is about trust that government decisions are  fair, trust that agencies are transparent, and trust that the American  people come before politics.

The Information Quality Assurance Act reinforces a basic principle.  Better information leads to better policy, and better policy leads to  better outcomes for the American people.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud that this effort brings accountability back  into the rulemaking process, and I urge my colleagues to support this  commonsense legislation.
