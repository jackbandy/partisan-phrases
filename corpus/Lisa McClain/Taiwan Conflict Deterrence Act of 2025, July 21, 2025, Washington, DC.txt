Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act of 2025


Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill,  the Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act.

The United States cannot afford to be complacent in the face of  growing Chinese aggression. As a proud Representative from the State of  Michigan, a State that knows the value of manufacturing, trade, and  international stability, I know firsthand how vital peace in the Indo- Pacific is to American jobs and our economy.

Taiwan is not only a democratic partner. It is also a key player in  the global supply chain, especially for semiconductors that power  everything from our cars to our national defense system.

This bill sends a clear and bipartisan message: If the CCP wages war  against Taiwan, there will be consequences. We are talking real,  targeted consequences for corrupt CCP elite. Their financial dealings  and offshore accounts will be exposed and published for the Chinese  people to see.

We are not provoking conflict. We are actually working to prevent it.  Deterrence is strongest when it is credible, and right now, credibility  means passing this bill.

The Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act is not just about Taiwan. It is  about standing up for American values, protecting American interests,  and preserving peace through strength.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this important legislation that I was proud to introduce. Let's  show the world that the United States stands firm against Communist  aggression and alongside our allies.
