Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Harbor Beach  High School football team for winning the Michigan Division 8 State  championship last week.

The Harbor Beach Pirates took home their second State championship in  football. Never trailing in the game, they won 31-20 at Ford Field in  Detroit, and, I might add, they had a perfect 14-0 season.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Coach Schelke and his talented young  group of men on their incredible accomplishment at Ford Field. They  have made Michigan's Ninth District proud. I really hope they cherish  this memory and all of the hard work that they dedicated this season. I  again congratulate the Harbor Beach Pirates.
