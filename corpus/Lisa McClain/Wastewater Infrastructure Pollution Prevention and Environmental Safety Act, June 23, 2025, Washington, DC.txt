Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support for my bill,  the Wastewater Infrastructure Pollution Prevention and Environmental  Safety Act, better known as the WIPPES Act.

This commonsense, bipartisan bill addresses a costly and growing  problem in our communities. Every year, Michiganders' water utilities  spend over $18 million responding to clogs and damage caused by  nonflushable wipes. These products, when disposed of incorrectly,  create massive blockages in our wastewater systems, which lead to  backups, environmental hazards, costly repairs, and, ultimately, higher  rates for our constituents.

The solution is simple: clear, honest labeling.

This bill does not ban wipes. It does not burden small businesses. It  simply requires manufacturers to label packaging for wipes that aren't  designed to be flushed.

This legislation isn't just about preventing clogged pipes. It is  about protecting taxpayer dollars and ensuring our infrastructure can  last for years to come.

The WIPPES Act passed the House last Congress with overwhelming  bipartisan support, and I am proud to lead this legislation alongside  Congressman Kevin Mullin again this Congress and call on the Senate to  take it up.

Functioning infrastructure and lower utility costs are not partisan  issues. They are priorities we should all share.

Let's pass the WIPPES Act. Let's give our local public works  departments, utilities, and consumers the tools they need to keep our  systems flowing and our communities safe.
