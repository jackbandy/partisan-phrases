Recognizing the Accomplishments of the Ninth District Congressional Youth Council


Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional  group of young students who have worked with my staff and me to better  their civic engagement and understanding of the federal government.  This year's Congressional Youth Council consists of some of the  brightest and most dedicated young minds from throughout the Thumb of  Michigan.

These young leaders have remained committed to regular meetings,  coming together to immerse themselves in the legislative process on a  non-partisan, academic basis. Throughout their time in the program,  these students have studied legislation, prepared mock bills, and  worked to better understand critical issues that impact their  communities and countless families across the country. It is incredible  how in-depth and thorough their work has been. This determined group of  students has demonstrated an incredible wealth of knowledge of our  democratic system, its key challenges, and what is to come in the  future.

Mr. Speaker, as policymakers, we would be wise to take notes from  this generation of promising young leaders. I ask all my colleagues to  join me in commending Michigan's Ninth District Congressional Youth  Council for their outstanding performance this year. These students,  along with their families and those in their lives who support them,  should be incredibly proud of the work they have done.
