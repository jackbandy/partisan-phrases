Doe and Usda Interagency Research Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688982/doe-and-usda-interagency-research-act


Mr. Speaker, I am rising in support of the DOE and USDA Interagency  Research Act, H.R. 1326.

I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), again, our former  committee chair, for reintroducing this legislation alongside the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), our ranking member of the  Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.

The Department of Energy and the United States Department of  Agriculture have a long and established history of partnering to  address multidisciplinary research areas like biomass energy  development, sustainable aviation fuels, and various methods for  improving clean energy development and deploying that development in  rural America.

H.R. 1326 is going to codify and strengthen these cross-cutting and  collaborative research and development activities between these two  departments, the Department of Energy and the Department of  Agriculture. This bill positions these agencies to overcome future  international competition challenges while accelerating the production  of biofuels, renewable chemical feed stocks, and conversion systems  that can support clean energy technologies and, of course, rural  economic growth.

Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests to speak on this  bill, and I am prepared to close. I yield myself the balance of my  time.

Mr. Speaker, let's make this a reality with H.R. 1326.
