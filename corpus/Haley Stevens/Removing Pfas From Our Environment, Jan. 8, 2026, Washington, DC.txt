Removing Pfas From Our Environment

Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, PFAS are everywhere, and they are  endangering Michiganders' lives. PFAS, as we know, are toxic forever  chemicals that persist in the environment, contaminate the water we  drink, and accumulate in the body. Sadly, Michigan is ground zero for  PFAS pollution.

I am proud to have worked across the aisle to deliver results for  Metro Detroit and Michigan in this regard, but we must do more. That is  why today I am introducing the PROTECT Act. It is bipartisan  legislation that takes urgently needed steps to remove PFAS from our  environment and prevent future contamination in the air we breathe.

By listing PFAS as hazardous air pollutants, this bill sets the  foundation for strong, science-based standards that will reduce  emissions. The PROTECT Act also holds major polluters responsible for  the cleanup of these poisons, delivering real transparency and  accountability to affected communities.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my bipartisan cosponsors from Michigan and  across the country for joining me in this important effort. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.
