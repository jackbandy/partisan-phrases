Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, this bill makes me sick to my stomach. I  have met with over 200 manufacturers in my district, and the one thing  that I hear over and over again is that the cost of everything is going  up.

This administration is now, yet again, trying to raise prices on  working Michiganders. This bill in Michigan will kick 750,000 people  off their Medicaid. It will eliminate critical investments in Michigan  manufacturing. It means, for Michiganders, that costs will continue to  go up and up.

As someone who served as the chief of staff on the U.S. auto rescue  in the Obama administration, I know what it means to see Michiganders  struggling. I know what it means when Michiganders have to choose  between paying their bills and paying for lifesaving healthcare, all  while billionaires get a tax cut.

This bill, Mr. Speaker, makes me sick to my stomach, and I urge  everyone to vote ``no.''
