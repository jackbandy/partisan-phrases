Recognizing Dr. Carla Hayden


Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call attention to the brazen  firing of our respected Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden.

Last week, she was ruthlessly fired by President Donald J. Trump. Dr.  Hayden is a model public servant who led the Library with dignity and  professionalism for 8 years.

Dr. Hayden was the first professional librarian to oversee our  Nation's largest Library, and, yes, I still have too many overdue  Library books.

I worked with Dr. Hayden during the dark days of COVID-19 to help  Michigan, to preserve the history, and to assist veterans. Her  premature dismissal, Mr. Speaker, is a true loss to the institution and  the millions of people it serves, including my colleagues, who rely on  the Library's nonpartisan resources to research and to draft  legislation.

Politicizing this institution is not right, and we must give Dr.  Hayden the recognition she deserves, a true leader for this country.
