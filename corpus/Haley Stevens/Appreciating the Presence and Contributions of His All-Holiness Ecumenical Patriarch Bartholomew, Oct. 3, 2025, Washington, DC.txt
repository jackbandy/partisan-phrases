Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my gratitude  towards His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the  Archbishop of Constantinople and spiritual leader of Orthodox  Christianity worldwide, for his time spent in our Nation's Capital last  week. On behalf of the strong Eastern Orthodox community I represent in  Michigan's 11th Congressional District, I enthusiastically congratulate  His All-Holiness on receiving the 2025 Templeton Award.

This award underscores his ground-breaking environmental advocacy and  unique ability to merge both scientific and spiritual discourses. His  All-Holiness has exemplified a sense of responsibility towards coming  generations: to preserve, protect, and promote the health of the planet  on which we are honored to live.

Beyond his environmental advocacy, His All-Holiness has been an  unwavering pillar in support of intersectionality, working to foster  relations between devotees of Catholic, Jewish, and Muslim faiths. He  has been relentless in his pursuit to prevent violence on the basis of  religion, to ensure the humane treatment of all, and to join hands  across the world in seeking peace and justice.

In Oakland County, we are blessed with a thriving Orthodox Christian  community. As their Representative in Congress, I am thrilled His All- Holiness joined us in Washington, D.C., last week. His visit reminds us  to be constantly kind and collaborative, one that is much needed during  this time.

Please join me in thanking His All-Holiness for his visit and  congratulating him on this well-deserved award.
