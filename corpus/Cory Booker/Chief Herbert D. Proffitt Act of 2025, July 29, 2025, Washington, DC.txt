Chief Herbert D. Proffitt Act of 2025


Mr. BOOKER. So, Mr. President, this casts a shadow over everything  that was just said because I support these bills. Why do I support  these bills? Because the officers of the State of New Jersey are going  to benefit from them because Donald Trump hasn't targeted these and cut  these, and these are things that are going to help all officers. That  is what this body should do--not pick and choose one State over  another, not pit one State against another, not pit so-called blue  States over so-called red States. It is the United States of America.

God bless my colleague for bringing these bills forward. They should  have been passed a long time ago. I support them fully because they  will apply to every officer in the United States of America.

Ms. CORTEZ MASTO.

Mr. BOOKER. I would just like the clerk to read the titles of the two  bills.
