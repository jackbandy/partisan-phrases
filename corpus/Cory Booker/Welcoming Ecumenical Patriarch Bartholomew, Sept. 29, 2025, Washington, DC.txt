Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, New Jersey is home to one of our Nation's  most vibrant Greek Orthodox communities. For generations, it has  nurtured a community rooted in faith and service--values that continue  to strengthen the fabric of not just our shared home but of American  society.

This month, our Nation's Capital welcomed His All-Holiness Ecumenical  Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of over 300 million  Orthodox Christians worldwide. His visit to the United States--where he  has met with congressional leaders and the President of the United  States--is a reminder of our shared efforts and responsibility to  pursue peace and justice, religious tolerance and coexistence, and  environmental stewardship in all we do.

His historic visit serves as a profound moment of unity, reflection,  and joy for Greek Orthodox New Jerseyans and Americans of all faiths  across the country. We deeply respect and appreciate his decades of  moral leadership and unwavering commitment to the dignity of all  humanity.
