Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kathryn  Angell, a dedicated public servant who has spent years serving the  residents of Illinois' 9th Congressional District with skill,  compassion, and professionalism.

Kathryn has been a member of my staff since January 2022, after  having previously served with distinction as an intern in the office.  From her earliest days here, she demonstrated a deep commitment to  public service and a genuine concern for the people who turned to our  office for help.

In her role as a Constituent Advocate, Kathryn handled a wide range  of complex and often deeply personal issues, including IRS cases,  housing matters, student loan concerns, and many other challenges faced  by families across the district. She approached each case with patience  and determination, understanding that for many constituents, reaching  out to a congressional office comes at a moment of frustration or  hardship. Kathryn worked tirelessly to navigate federal agencies that  can be difficult to access and slow to respond, and she never lost  sight of the human impact of her work.

Constituents benefited not only from her knowledge, but from her  persistence and her willingness to see cases through to resolution. My  staff and I could always trust that Kathryn's work would be handled  with care, diligence, and respect for the people we serve.

Over the years, Kathryn earned a strong reputation as a thoughtful,  responsive, and reliable member of my team. She coordinated the  office's participation in the Congressional App Challenge, engaging  with high school students across the district as they learned to code  and develop their first apps. Kathryn was also deeply involved in the  office's congressional outreach efforts, regularly representing the  office at community events and neighborhood office hours throughout the  district.

As Kathryn leaves the office to pursue new opportunities, I want to  express my sincere gratitude for her service. While we will miss her  greatly, I am confident that she will continue to use her talents and  experience to make a positive difference in the lives of others. Her  experience in this office has prepared her well for whatever path she  chooses to pursue next, and I am confident she will excel in any role  she undertakes. I wish her every success in her future endeavors.
