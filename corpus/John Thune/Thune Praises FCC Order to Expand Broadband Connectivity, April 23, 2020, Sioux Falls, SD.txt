Thune Praises FCC Order to Expand Broadband Connectivity


U.S. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet, today issued the following statement on the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) report and order to expand unlicensed broadband operations, such as Wi-Fi, into the 6 GHz band to help enable new American innovations and investments.

"As we rely on technology to do our jobs and stay connected to our family and friends during these unprecedented times, we've seen just how vital strong connectivity is to daily life," said Thune. "My MOBILE NOW Act recognized the role both licensed and unlicensed spectrum play in the communications landscape. I'm pleased that the FCC moved forward today with making more spectrum available for unlicensed use, which will continue to help advance telehealth, distance learning, precision agriculture, and other services vital to rural America."

Thune is the author of the MOBILE NOW Act, which was signed into law in 2018. Last December, Thune led a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai asking the commission to open up the 6 GHz band for unlicensed use.
