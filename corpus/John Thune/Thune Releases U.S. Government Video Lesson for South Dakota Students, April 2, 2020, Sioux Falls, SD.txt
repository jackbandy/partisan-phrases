Thune Releases U.S. Government Video Lesson for South Dakota Students, Parents, and Teachers


U.S. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) today released a U.S. government video lesson in which he gives a brief overview of how the federal government works. Thune hopes the video can be used as a resource for students, parents, and teachers who are now utilizing technology in many of their new at-home learning environments.  

"I know there are a lot of students out there who are studying in a very unique learning environment these days at home, and I want to thank all of the teachers, school officials, and staff who are making it possible for our students to continue to pursue their studies even at a time when they can't get into the classroom," said Thune. "That's why the wonder of technology makes a huge difference. I thought maybe what I would do today, as I know a lot of you have to study government, have to study history, is just do a quick tutorial on how the U.S. Congress works in terms of our government."
