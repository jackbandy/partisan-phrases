Hearing of the Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee - Statement of Sen. Thune, Hearing on Legislation to Protect U.S. From Digital Infrastructure Corruption


U.S. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet, today previewed new legislation to ensure U.S. communications infrastructure security is a clear negotiating objective of our country's trade policy. During a Commerce Committee hearing on 5G supply chain security, Thune questioned a panel of experts on additional steps the United States should take to effectively secure our communications network, particularly as we begin nationwide deployment of 5G infrastructure.

Thune's remarks (as prepared for delivery).

"With increased speeds and greater capacity, 5G networks will unleash new innovations and enable breakthroughs in a variety of sectors from agriculture to health care.

"There is a lot of promise with these new and advanced technologies, but the U.S. can only deliver on those promises if we maintain the security of communications networks both here at home and abroad.

"The decisions we make today with our trade partners around the world will impact our national security and economic outcomes for years to come. 

"I intend to introduce legislation this week to ensure the security of our communications infrastructure is a clear negotiating objective of U.S. trade policy. 

"Unfair trade practices of communications equipment suppliers owned or controlled by a foreign government should not be tolerated.

"Period."
