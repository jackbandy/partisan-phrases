Iran


Mr. THUNE. Madam President, before I begin my remarks this afternoon,  I want to speak briefly about Iran.

For decades, the regime in Iran and its terrorist proxies have sought  to sow chaos and violence throughout the Middle East. They threatened  ``Death to America'' and to wipe Israel off the map. All the while, the  mullahs have pursued a nuclear enrichment program that goes well beyond  what is required for peaceful energy purposes.

Madam President, Iran can never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.  This has been the position of President Trump and Members of this body  for years.

Since his reelection, President Trump made clear that a peaceful  resolution was possible if Iran agreed to give up its nuclear weapons  ambitions. Iran's leaders refused.

As a result, on Saturday, the President ordered precise and limited  strikes to go after Iran's nuclear program, consistent with this long- held national security imperative. I am grateful for the  professionalism of all of our servicemembers in carrying out this  important mission.

Just a few hours ago, Iran launched an attack against our  servicemembers in Qatar and Iraq. President Trump has been clear that  he is not afraid to hold Iran accountable for any retaliation, and Iran  risks going down a dangerous road with these attacks.

Nevertheless, I am glad that the initial reports indicate that no  Americans were killed in these strikes. If Iran is considering any  further attacks against U.S. forces or interests, it should think long  and hard about the consequences.

I look forward to hearing from the administration during tomorrow's  all-Senators briefing.
