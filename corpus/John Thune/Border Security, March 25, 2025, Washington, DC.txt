Border Security

Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, from the day he took office, President  Trump made it clear that he would not hesitate to take action to deter  our enemies and protect our Nation, and that is exactly what he has  been doing, both here at home and abroad.

Needless to say, 4 years of recordbreaking illegal immigration at our  southern border, under President Biden, left a gaping hole in our  national security. The chaos that raged at our southern border was an  invitation to terrorists and criminals, and law enforcement was  stretched thin trying to deal with the flood of illegal immigration.

During his campaign, President Trump made it very clear that putting  an end to our border crisis was going to be at the top of his agenda,  and he has been delivering on that promise.

In just 2 months, his bold action to secure our border and enforce  our immigration laws has led to a precipitous drop in illegal crossings  at the southern border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded  just 11,709 encounters--apprehensions between ports of entry, plus  inadmissible aliens--at our southern border for the month of February-- 11,709.

Just to put that number into perspective, in February 2024, with  President Biden, Customs and Border Protection recorded 189,913  encounters at our southern border--189,913 to 11,709, a 93-percent  drop.

President Trump and his administration have made incredible progress,  and our Nation is more secure because of their efforts.
