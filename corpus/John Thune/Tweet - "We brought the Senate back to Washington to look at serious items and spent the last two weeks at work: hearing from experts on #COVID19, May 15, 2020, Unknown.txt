Tweet - "We brought the Senate back to Washington to look at serious items and spent the last two weeks at work: hearing from experts on #COVID19, passing critical national security legislation, & monitoring the effectiveness of relief efforts already being implemented."


"We brought the Senate back to Washington to look at serious items and spent the last two weeks at work: hearing from experts on #COVID19, passing critical national security legislation, & monitoring the effectiveness of relief efforts already being implemented."

"Meanwhile, House Dem leadership is bringing back members to vote on an 1815-page Dem fantasy bill that would cost an additional $3 TRILLION & is chock-full of left-wing wish-list items unrelated to#COVID19. 

How bad is the bill? Even members of their own party are skeptical."

"One more time for @HouseDemocrats in the back: This bill will not pass the Senate.

It shouldn't pass. Look what's in it:- Taxpayer $$ for illegal immigrants- Tells states how to handle their elections- 68 mentions of "cannabis"

What does any of that have to do with #COVID19?"

"The country is in a crisis & Dems seem focused on the same agenda they've had for years. How about we look for ways to help our country fight this pandemic & reopen safely. 

NO amount of federal spending can substitute for a healthy, dynamic economy."
