Recognizing the 125th Anniversary Veblen, South Dakota


Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Veblen, SD. The town of  Veblen will be celebrating its quasquicentennial July 18-20, 2025.  Veblen will host quasquicentennial events, which include a parade,  vendor show, street dance, class reunions, fireworks, and much more.

Veblen is located in Marshall County, nestled in the beautiful  rolling hills of the Coteau des Prairies in northeastern South Dakota.  The Veblen area has long been known as a community surrounded by the  natural beauty of the breathtaking Glacial Lakes Region. Home to more  than 300 people and multiple businesses, Veblen is known for its rich  historical heritage and robust rural spirit. Since its beginning 125  years ago, the community of Veblen continues to serve as a strong  example of South Dakota values and traditions.

I offer my congratulations to the citizens of Veblen on its  quasquicentennial and wish them continued prosperity in the years to  come.
