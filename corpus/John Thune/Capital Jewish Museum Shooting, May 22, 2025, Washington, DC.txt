Capital Jewish Museum Shooting


Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I begin, I need to mention the  shooting that occurred last night outside an event at the Capital  Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, held by the American Jewish Committee.  From everything we know so far, it is appallingly clear that event  attendees were deliberately targeted. And two young Embassy employees-- tragically, two employees on the verge of getting engaged and starting  a life together--were murdered in the attack.

I am grateful that the suspect is already in custody and for the help  the Capitol Police provided in responding to the attack, and I know  that he will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  But I suspect that is little comfort right now to the many whose sense  of safety has been shattered and who are worried that they will be  targeted simply because they are Jewish or Israeli.

My prayers today are with the families of the deceased, with event  attendees, with the employees of the Israeli Embassy, and with all the  members of the Jewish community suffering in the wake of this attack.  And to the Israeli and Jewish communities here in Washington, DC, know  that we stand with you.
