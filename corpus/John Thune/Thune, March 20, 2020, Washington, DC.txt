Thune, Daines, and King Applaud Administration's Quick Action to Delay Tax Filing Deadline


U.S. Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), and Angus King (I-Maine) today applauded the Treasury Department for quickly approving their request to extend the federal tax filing deadline from April 15, 2020, to July 15, 2020. Today's decision comes one day after Thune, Daines, and King introduced the Tax Filing Relief for America Act, legislation that would have made this change legislatively, and it coincides with the Treasury Department's previous announcement that it would extend the tax payment deadline for filers who owe the IRS for the 2019 tax year. Americans who would like to file early are still able to do so, and the Treasury Department is processing returns so taxpayers can get their hard-earned money returned to them as soon as possible.

"We want to thank the Treasury Department for taking such quick and decisive action by approving our request to provide this additional relief to the American people," said Thune, Daines, and King. "These are difficult times for everyone, and the least we can do is hit pause on tax season so Americans can focus on what's more important -- protecting themselves and their families and making critical decisions that will help them weather this storm."

Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) are cosponsors of the Tax Filing Relief for America Act, which is supported by the Association of International Certified Public Accountants.
