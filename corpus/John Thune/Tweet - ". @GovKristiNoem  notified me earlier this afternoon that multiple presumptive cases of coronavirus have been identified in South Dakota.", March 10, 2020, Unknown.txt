".@GovKristiNoem notified me earlier this afternoon that multiple presumptive cases of coronavirus have been identified in South Dakota."

"As the governor said, the state has been preparing for this possibility for weeks, and I am confident all of the necessary steps are being taken as we learn more about these individuals, where they may have traveled, and anyone else they may have contacted."

"At the federal level, I'm laser-focused on ensuring state and local governments around the country have the resources they need to fight the coronavirus outbreak, and last week, I was proud to support bipartisan legislation that significantly invests in this fight."

"My staff and I are working closely w/ the governor and her team, and I would encourage South Dakotans looking for more information about #COVIDãƒ¼19 to visit http://coronavirus.gov or http://covid.sd.gov and be aware of any state or local updates in the coming days and weeks."
