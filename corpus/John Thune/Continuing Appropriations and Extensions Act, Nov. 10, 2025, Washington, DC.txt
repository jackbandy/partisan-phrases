Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this has been a very long road--quite  literally, the longest shutdown in history. I am very, very happy to be  able to say that we are coming to the end.

Before we close today, I want to take the time to say thank you to my  staff, who have worked around the clock tirelessly now for the past 6  weeks; to the staff of the Appropriations Committee, who have played a  critical role in getting us to where we are today; to the Cloakroom  staff; to every Senate staffer on both sides of the aisle, who has  spent 41 days coming into work without pay; to the custodial staff,  who, again without pay, have kept this building and the Senate office  buildings livable; to all institutional staff, without whom this place  would not run; to the Secretary of the Senate and everyone in her  office; the Sergeant at Arms and her team; the Architect of the Capitol  and his staff; and everyone on the floor right now making this session  happen; and to the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police, who have  shown up during this shutdown day in and day out to protect the rest of  us. I am humbled by and grateful for your service.

I know that the strain of these weeks has been immense, and you all  have families, rent to meet, bills to pay, car and mortgage payments. I  am grateful for all you have done to keep the Senate running and for  all that you do every day, shutdown or no shutdown, to serve the Senate  and to serve our country.

With that, after 6 excruciating weeks, I will stop talking and let  all of you get some rest.
