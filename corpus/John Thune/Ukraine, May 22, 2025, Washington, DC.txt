Ukraine


Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, one other topic I want to mention before I  get to the main subject today is the war in Ukraine.

For the last 4 months, President Trump has gone to extraordinary  lengths to bring an end to the bloodshed in Ukraine, and we here in the  Senate commend him for those efforts.

Now the ball is in Putin's court. It is time for him to come to the  table in good faith and make a serious proposal for an immediate cease- fire that can lead to a just and lasting peace in Ukraine. I hope he  realizes it is time to do so. If not, the Senate stands ready to act.  Thanks to the dogged work of Senator Graham, we have bipartisan  legislation, cosponsored by 80 of my colleagues, to impose additional  economic sanctions and tariffs on Russia. If Russia is not willing to  engage in serious diplomacy, the Senate will work with the Trump  administration to consider additional sanctions to force Putin to start  negotiating.
