  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the Senate had three priorities for this  week: reauthorizing the expiring provisions of the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act, passing the second phase of our coronavirus response,  and initiating a serious discussion about what else we need to do to  help Americans address this challenge. I have to say I am glad we have  already made progress on all three fronts. 

  On Sunday, several key provisions of the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act expired, including the provision that allows the FBI  to wiretap lone-wolf terrorists--terrorists not affiliated with a  specific terrorist organization--and the roving wiretap provision that  prevents the FBI from having to seek a new wiretap warrant each time a  terrorist suspect changes his phone number. 

  Every minute of every day, the men and women of our law enforcement  and intelligence communities are working to track terrorist threats and  prevent attacks on American citizens. We need to ensure that they have  all the tools they need to do their jobs. 

  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act provisions that expired  Sunday are key weapons in the fight to keep Americans safe. I am  pleased we were able to pass a 77-day extension yesterday and set up a  process for consideration of a long-term extension. 

  I strongly support the bipartisan House bill, which combines  extensions of these key anti-terrorism tools with new accountability  measures that will ensure that law enforcement is held to the highest  standards when pursuing surveillance of suspected terrorists and  foreign agents. Attorney General Barr has also endorsed the House bill.  I look forward to taking up this legislation and debating several  issues raised by my colleagues before we are on the brink of another  expiration.
