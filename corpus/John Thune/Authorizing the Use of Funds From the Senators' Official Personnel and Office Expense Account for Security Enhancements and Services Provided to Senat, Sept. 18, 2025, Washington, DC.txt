Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I will shortly ask for unanimous consent to  authorize Senators to use their office accounts for security purposes.  Every Senator will now have additional flexibility to address the  security concerns they face as public officials. Along with the  additional investment in security in the continuing resolution that  Republicans have put forward, there is ongoing bipartisan work to  address Member security in the legislative branch appropriations bill,  which I hope House and Senate will complete work on in the very near  future.

We are also actively working with the Sergeant at Arms to identify  additional authorities for security options for Senators. I am grateful  to the Senate Sergeant at Arms and the Capitol Police for their work on  this and for the collaborative efforts of many Senators from both  parties.

Res. 413, which is  at the desk.
