Thune Launches Special COVID-19 Resources Page on His Website


U.S. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) today launched a microsite to provide South Dakotans with important up-to-date information about the COVID-19 pandemic. The microsite features news and updates from Thune, and it includes informative documents and resources related to the recently enacted CARES Act. It also features links to South Dakota-specific information to help workers, families, and small businesses better navigate this crisis. The microsite will continue to highlight the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's latest information, updates, and guidelines.

"This newly launched resources page will hopefully serve as a one-stop-shop for South Dakotans who are looking for tools and information to help them through this highly uncertain time," said Thune. "In addition to South Dakota-specific information related to support and relief efforts, it will also serve as a hub for news and updates from me and my staff in Washington and throughout South Dakota. The site highlights relevant information regarding the ongoing pandemic, including how the federal government is working to provide folks in our state with critically important assistance to weather this storm."

You can access the microsite at www.thune.senate.gov/COVID19, www.thune.senate.gov/coronavirus, or by clicking on the "important update" banner on the homepage of his website, www.thune.senate.gov.
