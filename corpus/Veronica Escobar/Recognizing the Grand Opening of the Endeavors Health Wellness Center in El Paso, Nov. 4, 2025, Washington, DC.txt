Recognizing the Grand Opening of the Endeavors Health Wellness Center in El Paso


Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the  grand opening of the Endeavors Health & Wellness Center in El Paso,  Texas. Endeavors is a distinguished Texas-based nonprofit organization  dedicated to serving veterans, active-duty service members, first  responders, caregivers, and their families through comprehensive  housing, behavioral health care, wellness, and community support  services.

Endeavors has demonstrated commitment to the El Paso community  through the establishment of the Endeavors Health & Wellness Center, a  centrally located facility designed to expand access to integrated,  whole-person care that complements and strengthens existing local,  state, and federal resources.

The Endeavors Health & Wellness Center in El Paso represents a  significant investment in community care, strengthening El Paso's  continuum of services through increased access to critical behavioral  health resources, collaboration with local and national partners, and  the promotion of dignity, resilience, and recovery among those who have  served and sacrificed for others. This community-focused asset will  undoubtedly help thousands of El Pasoans in need of support. I am  grateful for Endeavors' commitment to care for veterans, active-duty  service members, first responders, caregivers, and their families and  look forward to continuing to collaborate for the greater good of so  many.
