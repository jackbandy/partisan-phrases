Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, Republicans spent the last 4 years telling  Americans to trust them on the economy, and Donald Trump promised to  lower costs for Americans on day one.

Months into this administration, with Republicans in complete  control, prices are up, inflation is up, joblessness is up, the stock  market is all over the place with American retirees losing  trillions of dollars in just 72 hours, and a recession is looming.

Let's be clear: Republicans have no plan to prioritize hardworking  Americans, but they have a $7 trillion plan to help billionaires. They  will do that by cutting Medicaid and nutrition programs and  exploding the national debt by $6 trillion.

This budget resolution makes Americans sicker and poorer, and it will  make the rich richer.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to have some common sense and work  with Democratic colleagues. Together we can address all of this. I will  be voting ``no'' on this resolution.
