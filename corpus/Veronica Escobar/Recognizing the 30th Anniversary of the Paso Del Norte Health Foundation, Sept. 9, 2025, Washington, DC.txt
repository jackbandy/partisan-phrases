Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 30th  anniversary of the Paso Del Norte Health Foundation in El Paso, Texas.

Established in 1995, the Paso Del Norte Health Foundation has worked  to ensure our binational tri-state community has the knowledge,  resources, and support needed to lead healthy and productive lives.

For three decades, the foundation has partnered with countless local  and national organizations to address some of the most critical  challenges in the borderland--from chronic disease prevention,  expanding mental health support, and helping develop the next  generation of healthcare leaders.

The PDNHF has supported local governments, non-profits and  educational institutions to promote health and the well-being of our  community. Over its 30-year history, the PDNHF has helped reduce  smoking, promoted diabetes awareness and increased physical activity  and healthy eating, created a medical forgivable loan fund, programing  to support oral health, support for the community through the COVID-19  pandemic, and support in growing El Paso's quality of life assets.

The community is grateful for PDNHF's investment in our region and  congratulates the board and staff committed to this mission. I ask all  my colleagues to join me in celebrating the incredible legacy of the  Paso Del Norte Health Foundation.
