Collins, King Announce an Additional $52.7 Million to Expand COVID-19 Testing in Maine


U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced today that Maine has been awarded a total of $52,673,451 to purchase, administer, and expand capacity for COVID-19 testing.

 

"Expanded testing is essential for helping to protect Mainers' health during the current public health crisis and to safely reopen our communities," said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  "Testing will also give Mainers the confidence to resume their daily lives and return to work, school, restaurants, and recreational activities.  This important funding will provide a substantial boost to Maine's efforts to ramp up testing."

 

This investment for Maine was included in the $480 billion bipartisan agreement that was signed into law last month, which included $25 billion for COVID-19 testing efforts. Of that amount, $11 billion was set aside for States, localities, territories, and tribes to support testing needs. In April, Senators Collins and King announced that Maine would receive $16,295,844 for COVID-19 testing, which was an initial allotment of state funding.

 

Separately, last week, Senators Collins and King announced that 18 Maine health centers have been awarded a total of $4,732,797 for COVID-19 testing.
