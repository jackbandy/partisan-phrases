Senators Collins, King Announce Maine Hospitals to Receive More Than $42 Million to Support Fight Against COVID-19


U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced today that Maine hospitals and other health care providers will receive an immediate infusion of $42,042,864 to bolster their efforts in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.  The funding distributed represents the second tranche of funding allocated through the $100 billion for medical providers that was included in the CARES Act that Senators Collins and King voted for.  Earlier this month, Senators Collins and King announced more than $145 million for Maine hospitals.

 

"This funding is vital to protecting the health and safety of Mainers and will provide critical support to our doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals who are on the frontlines," said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  "We will continue to ensure that all health care providers have the resources they need to continue to respond to this pandemic and treat patients."

 

Across the state, nearly 100 health care providers will receive this funding, which will be used to reimburse providers for health care-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and to ensure uninsured Americans can get testing and treatment for COVID-19.
