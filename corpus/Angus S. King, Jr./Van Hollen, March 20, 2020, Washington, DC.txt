Van Hollen, King Urge Negotiators to Establish a Special Adviser to the President on Global Health Security within Phase 3 Package


Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Angus King (I-Maine) sent a letter to Senate leadership urging them to establish a Special Adviser to the President for Global Health Security, within the negotiated phase three coronavirus package. As noted in their letter, the Special Adviser would lead a Directorate for Global Health Security at the White House National Security Council and would advise the White House on global health crises. President Obama had previously established this directorate; however, President Trump eliminated it in 2018. 

The Senators write, "We respectfully request that you include the following amendment to S.3548, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. This amendment would establish a Special Adviser to the President for Global Health Security, who would lead a Global Health Security directorate at the White House National Security Council."

They underscore, "Pandemic preparedness is a vital national security interest, which the coronavirus outbreak has made clear. Strong and consistent senior leadership at the National Security Council is necessary to direct a whole-of-government response to a global health crisis. That is why, following the Ebola outbreak, the Obama administration established a directorate at the National Security Council to prepare for and respond to pandemic threats."

The Senators conclude, "This provision would help ensure the United States is better prepared for the next global health emergency."
