Collins, King Announce $500,000 for Rice Public Library in Kittery


Today, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Angus King (I-Maine) announced that the Town of Kittery has received $500,000 from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The federal funding will support the renovation and expansion of Rice Public Library.

 

"The Rice Library is a pillar of the Kittery community, offering more than 400 programs for children and adults each year," said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement. "This funding will help the town renovate infrastructure that is more than a hundred years old, allowing the people of Kittery and Southern Maine to continue to enjoy the library and its array of educational services into its second century."

 

"This grant will help Kittery transform the 19th century Rice Building into a 21st century Library," said Kittery Town Manager Kendra Amaral. "The project will enhance our ability to deliver excellent humanities programming in an accessible and vibrant public space.  We are grateful for the funding award from the NEH, and for Senators Collins' and King's support of our project."

 

In May, Senators Collins and King wrote a letter in support of this grant application.

 

The National Endowment for the Humanities, an independent federal agency, was established in 1965 to support nationwide research and programs in subjects such as history, literature, and philosophy. By issuing funding to support the humanities, the NEH supports programs that bolster educational opportunities around the country.
