Letter to the Hon. Neil Chatterjee, Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - Senators Join Calls for FERC to Foster Dialogue on Carbon Pricing


Dear Chairman Chatterjee:

As we all try to make our way through these challenging times, we know that the Commissionschedule remains highly uncertain and subject to change.

You recently received a petition from a broad set of stakeholders that spans the energy industry,requesting that you convene a technical conference or workshop to discuss frameworks forintegrating carbon emission reduction policies into our wholesale energy markets. Specifically,the petition requests that FERC look at how carbon pricing can be integrated into our energymarkets in a way that maintains reliable low-cost energy.

We believe this issue warrants more attention from the Commission, especially in light of recentactions and statements from several grid operators. For example, the New York IndependentSystem Operator (NYISO), ISO New England, PJM Interconnection, and California IndependentSystem Operator Corporation have all taken steps or made statements supporting the policyoutlined in the petition. NYISO has taken the most concrete steps and is actively working ona proposal exploring how a carbon price could be integrated into their energy market. InitialNYISO reporting shows that such a policy could help the state reach its stated climate policygoals, while bringing in billions in economic benefits to the state.

The Commission has a rare opportunity to heed the call from a diverse set of energy stakeholderswho want to develop long-term certainty in the energy market with policies that could deployand incentivize reliable, low cost, and emissions free energy. Therefore, we request that theCommission grant the request in this petition.
