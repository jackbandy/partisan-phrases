After Senator King Seeks Relief for Veterans, IRS Announces They Will Automatically Receive Direct Stimulus Payments


Today, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) applauded an announcement by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that recipients of benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) would receive their stimulus payment from the CARES Act with no additional action needed. Today's announcement comes after King joined a group of 47 Senators in calling on the Administration to issue stimulus checks automatically to recipients of benefits through the VA or the Supplemental Security Income program. In the letter, Senator King and his peers pointed out that these are two groups with large amounts of non-filers and groups for whom the federal government has the data necessary to deliver the stimulus checks automatically. 

"This is a long-overdue, common sense conclusion: it should be as easy as possible for our veterans to access emergency stimulus checks," said Senator King. "During this uncertain time, the last thing our nation's veterans should have to worry about is extra paperwork. I'm pleased that the Administration complied with Congress' intent and streamlined this process using our existing systems, and will keep pushing to make sure we're taking care of those who've sacrificed so much to defend our safety."

Senator King was a leading voice calling for direct cash payments to the American people, and voted for the bipartisan agreement for the third phase of coronavirus relief, which includes a direct payment of up to $1,200. Earlier this month, he successfully advocated for the Treasury Department to allow Social Security beneficiaries to automatically receive the direct payments included in the recently-passed CARES Act without having to file tax returns.
