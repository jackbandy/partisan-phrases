Collins, King Announce Nearly $5 Million to Expand COVID-19 Testing in Maine


U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced that 18 health centers throughout Maine have been awarded a total of $4,732,797 to purchase, administer, and expand capacity for COVID-19 testing.

 

"Community health centers are the backbone of Maine's rural health care system, and they have been instrumental in helping to protect Mainers' health during the current public health crisis," said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  "Expanded testing is crucial for our ability to ultimately reopen our society and to give Mainers the confidence to resume their daily lives.  This important funding will be used to increase walk-up and drive-up testing as well as purchase the PPE necessary to help protect those on the front lines."
