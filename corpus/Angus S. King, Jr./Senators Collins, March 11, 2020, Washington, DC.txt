Senators Collins, King Announce $4.6 Million to Support Maine's Response to Coronavirus


U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, and Senator Angus King announced today that Maine will receive $4,568,000 to help fight the coronavirus. 

 

The funding was made available through the $7.8 billion coronavirus appropriations package that passed Congress last week with Senators Collins and King's support and was signed into law on March 6, 2020.

 

"The coronavirus poses a significant public health threat, particularly to seniors, and a robust response is required to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19," said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  "The funding released today will support the Maine CDC's efforts to reduce the risk of exposure, properly diagnose patients, and treat Mainers who contract the virus."

 

This funding will allow Maine to carry out surveillance, epidemiology, laboratory capacity, infection control, mitigation, communications, and other preparedness and response activities.
