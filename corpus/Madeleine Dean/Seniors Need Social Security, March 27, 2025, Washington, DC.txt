Seniors Need Social Security

Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, more than 17 million seniors  live on less than $30,000 a year. Yet, Republicans look to weaken or  sever lifelines like Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.

President Trump announced a plan to fire 12 percent of Social  Security employees, close 26 offices, and slash phone services.  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently said his family wouldn't  complain about missing a Social Security check and that the only people  who would are fraudsters.

Well, Mr. Lutnick's family might be able to afford to lose a payment  or two, but most Americans cannot. This is their money. Americans pay  for these programs. These are earned benefits. People are afraid, and  rightfully so. They are calling, texting, emailing, and stopping me on  the street.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my constituents, seniors, Americans with  disabilities, and working families, I have a message for President  Trump and his incompetent billionaire buddies: Hell no, our seniors are  not the fraudsters. You are.
