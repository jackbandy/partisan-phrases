Tariffs

Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, in just 2 days, Wall Street  lost $6 trillion in value in the worst selloff since 2020. Many of my  constituents lost tens of thousands of dollars, money saved over  decades.

Now we are all scrambling with the news of a 90-day pause on tariffs  after  President Trump swore up and down he would do no such thing. Sadly, we  cannot trust a word our President says, let alone plan around his  erratic behavior. Mr. Trump's turbulent game of chicken with some of  our closest allies is absurd.

How does Mr. Trump expect people whose 401(k)s and kids' college  savings accounts just took a nosedive to feel secure in their  retirement? How does he expect people to save for retirement at all?  The short answer is that the President does not know, and, even worse,  he does not care.

Mr. Speaker, the President lost $11 trillion in value in the first 11  weeks of his second term. I call upon my Republican colleagues to  please call out the President's destructive decisions. It is time to  say that the emperor has no clothes.
