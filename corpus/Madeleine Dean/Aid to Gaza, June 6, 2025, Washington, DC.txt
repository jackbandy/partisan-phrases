Aid to Gaza

Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Gaza is starving. Since March,  Palestinians have waited for food, water, medical supplies, and  nutrition kits that have not come.

Instead, an estimated 170,000 metric tons of aid sits right outside  the Gaza Strip, prohibited to enter by Prime Minister Netanyahu.

Let me be clear. Since October 7, the return of all hostages, living  and dead, has been my priority. They must be returned home to their  loved ones, living and deceased.

Dignity must be afforded Palestinians, as well. Children must be fed.  Doctors must be able to treat the injured and the dying. As of now,  that has not happened.

Instead, there is chaos, gunfire, and imminent death. Half of the 2.3  million Gazans soon face starvation. Gaza is at risk of an avoidable  famine.

Look at this photo of a young girl in her father's arms who has lost  more than 40 percent of her body weight. That is the condition in Gaza.

Look at this photo of desperately needed aid sitting right outside  reach.

Where is our humanity? Where is our compassion? We must bring aid,  hope, and life to Gaza.
