Trump Leads with Smoke and Mirrors

Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the United States airstrikes  in Iran, which we hope to be briefed on today, is the latest in the  signature chaos and erratic decisionmaking from the Trump White House.

I thank God that our extraordinary military appears to have  exquisitely executed its mission. We can be grateful to our military's  carrying out of a decision while we ask questions about that decision.

While the news is inundated with reports of Trump's airstrikes, there  are many concerns that we are not hearing about here at home: hostages;  Ukraine; Federal institutions, like USAID and NIH, gutted; the big,  ugly bill that would slash Medicaid for 14 million Americans, including  110,000 of my constituents; and the cruel cuts at SAMHSA that will  jeopardize the lives of those struggling with addiction and mental  health.

The Trump White House leads with smoke and mirrors, but they are  doing incredible harm to my constituents and Americans across this  country. I call upon my colleagues to not let them be successful in  their attempts to obscure and distract.

Thomas Jefferson said: When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes  duty.

Resist.
