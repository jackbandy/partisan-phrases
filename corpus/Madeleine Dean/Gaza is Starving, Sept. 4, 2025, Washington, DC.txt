Gaza is Starving

Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, there are places on this Earth  with unbearable suffering. Right now Gaza is starving. Children are  starving.

These photographs are very difficult to look at, but I ask you to  look because this is a man-made famine. We are 698 days into the Hamas- Israel war, which we all understand, but it has been nearly 200 days  since Prime Minister Netanyahu barbarously blocked all food, water, and  medicine into Gaza.

There are Palestinians in a cage with very little resources. There  are emaciated children too weak to walk or speak. Doctors, aid workers,  and journalists struggling with hunger and malnutrition, or being  killed as they fight to save the sick and wounded.

Instead of responding with mercy and moral clarity, the world watches  and  the Trump administration responds with its usual weakness and cruelty,  denying injured Palestinian children passage to the United States for  care.

This massive suffering is man made, thus it must be stopped by man.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Netanyahu must cease-fire now, bring all hostages  home now living and dead, and surge humanitarian aid now. ``We must  repair the world''; ``Tikkun Olam.''
