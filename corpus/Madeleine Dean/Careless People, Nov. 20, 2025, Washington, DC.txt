Careless People


Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for more than 40 days,  families across our country suffered through the longest government  shutdown in history.

How did our President and Congressional Republicans respond?

They responded by amputating the East Wing of the White House to make  way for a $300 million gilded ballroom.

They responded by throwing a lavish Gatsby-themed party at Mar-a-Lago  where the President's wealthy friends toasted with champagne mere  moments before 42 million Americans lost their monthly food assistance.

They responded by inserting a disgusting, corrupt provision into a  so-called clean spending bill that allows for a slush fund for eight  Republican Senators at the last hour to each collect as much as a  million dollars or more--one million taxpayer dollars each--because  their phone records were lawfully seized in connection with the January  6 insurrection.

The President and Congressional Republicans aren't looking for ways  to feed people or lower costs. They are thieves lining their pockets.

I believe F. Scott Fitzgerald would have called them ``careless  people.''
