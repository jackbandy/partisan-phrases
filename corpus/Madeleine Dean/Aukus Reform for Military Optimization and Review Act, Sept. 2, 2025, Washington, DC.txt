Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  4233, the ARMOR Act, legislation that I was proud to work on with  Representative Kim and Representative Zinke.

AUKUS was a historic initiative launched under the Biden  administration. It is an example of the collective strengths of the  United States, Australia, and the U.K. It exemplifies our commitment to  working as allies, as partners, to positively contribute to defense  security around the world, including leveraging our shared capabilities  to shape a free and open Indo-Pacific and to counter the rising threat  that China poses.

I recently returned from a bipartisan, bicameral codel to Australia  and the Indo-Pacific, and all were eager to build on the AUKUS  framework.

This legislation will strengthen the AUKUS collaboration and joint  operability. It clarifies that re-exports and retransfers within the  geographic territory of the United States, the U.K., and Australia are  permitted under the previously exempted defense trade provisions.

Importantly, it also preserves Congress' oversight authority and  continues to ensure the protection of the most sensitive technologies  that underpin our security.

I am grateful to have worked with Representative Kim on this  bipartisan effort to support our allies and bolster our shared defense.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, as well.
