Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Bilirakis and  Ranking Member Pallone for bringing this bill forward.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the TAKE IT DOWN Act. Senate bill  146 was my bill, and it is still my bill. I thank Congresswoman Salazar  for her leadership on this. I thank Congresswoman Dingell for her  longtime leadership on this and for leading this effort with me on the  House side. I thank Senators Cruz and Klobuchar for their strong  leadership on this.

As we speak, the internet is awash with real and fake nonconsensual  intimate imagery. Mr. Speaker, the consequences, as you just heard, are  devastating for every victim, their family, and their community. It  happens to men and boys, to women and girls. Most often, it happens to  women and girls.

As AI becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives, Congress must  meet this moment. We must empower and protect victims from bad actors  who share their intimate images, real or fake, without consent and from  the most harmful developments of AI.

During the 2023-2024 school year, 15 percent of high school students  reported hearing about deepfakes of nonconsensual intimate images that  depicted kids at their schools. It happened to one of my hometown  constituents, a 20-year-old, bright college student named Jack  Sullivan. He was sextorted by two men claiming to be a woman on  Instagram. They threatened Jack. They told him they would post intimate  images of him unless he paid huge sums of money. He paid and he paid.  When he could no longer pay their demands, Jack took his own life. We  must do better for Jack and every other victim of these crimes.

As a former educator, and a mother, and as a grandmother, this  sickens me. As an elected official, I am moved to protect our children.  Congress must create guardrails to protect Americans' privacy and  dignity at a time when online exploitation is easier than ever.

That is what our bill does. The TAKE IT DOWN Act criminalizes the  publication of real or fake AI-generated intimate images. It requires  websites to react, to respond, and to remove these horrifying images  and videos within 48 hours of a victim's report. I suggest they act  even faster. Finally, we will hold online platforms and social media  companies accountable. This cannot wait.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have bipartisan support for this bill. I  thank Representative Salazar and Senators Cruz and Klobuchar. I thank  the First Lady and the President for their leadership on this. I  implore all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this important  bill.
