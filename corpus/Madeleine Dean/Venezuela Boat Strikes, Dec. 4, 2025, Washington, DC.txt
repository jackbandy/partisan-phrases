Venezuela Boat Strikes

Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, commanding our Armed Forces  and safeguarding our national security requires exemplary honor,  experience, and loyalty to the Constitution.

Yet time and time again, the President and his Defense Secretary have  proven themselves unfit. They have ordered dozens of illegal strikes on  alleged drug boats in the Caribbean without congressional approval.  This week, we have learned they likely committed war crimes by ordering  a second strike targeting and killing survivors.

At the same time, President Trump is pardoning criminals like Juan  Orlando Hernandez, the former President of Honduras who was convicted  in a U.S. court for smuggling more than 500 tons of cocaine into our  country and was sentenced to 45 years.

The President is also threatening violence against our very Members  of Congress who simply reminded our military of their constitutional  duty not to follow illegal orders. Most troubling, the President  doesn't know how to lead, and he doesn't care.

Mr. Speaker, I implore my Republican colleagues, ask yourself: Is the  President serious about stopping the flow of fentanyl?

No. He is deathly unserious.
