Create Tariff Policy That Supports U.S. Economy

Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Article I, Section 8 of the  Constitution grants Congress, and Congress alone, the ``power to lay  and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.''

As Chief Justice John Roberts correctly noted last week, the Framers  were explicit: The executive has no given power to reach into the  pockets of the people to impose taxes and tariffs.

The Supreme Court has now confirmed two truths that we have known:  Tariffs are a tax on consumers, on you and me; and number two, the  President's disastrous, on-again-off-again tariffs are not just  illegal, they are also unconstitutional. I am thankful to the Court for  so clearly recognizing and rooting their opinion in our Constitution.

Now we must turn our focus to those who unjustly suffered because of  this President's economic chaos. The Treasury Department must  immediately issue refunds for the $134 billion stolen from American  families and businesses.

I call upon all of my colleagues in Congress, Republicans and  Democrats, let's work together to create tariff policy that supports  U.S. economic objectives, laws that give businesses the security and  time needed for investments, and that bring costs down for consumers.
