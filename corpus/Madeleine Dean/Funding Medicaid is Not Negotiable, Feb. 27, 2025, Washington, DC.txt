Funding Medicaid is Not Negotiable


Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government runs  out of money in 2 weeks.

Republicans, who lead both Chambers and the White House, have yet to  produce an actual funding plan. Instead, House Republicans passed a  blueprint to slash up to $2.5 trillion from Medicaid.

In my State of Pennsylvania alone, that jeopardizes care for nearly 3  million people, including 100,000 people struggling with addiction.

In my district, that means risking medical care for more than 45,000  people under the age of 21 and more than 15,000 people over the age of  60.

These are children and seniors, vulnerable people who rely upon  Medicaid for their health and for their very lives.

Negotiations are always part of the process, yet our duty remains to  safeguard our children, our seniors, the working poor, people with  disabilities, and people struggling with addiction. That is not  negotiable.

Our budget reflects our values. Protecting life, liberty, and  happiness are our values. We must live up to that.
