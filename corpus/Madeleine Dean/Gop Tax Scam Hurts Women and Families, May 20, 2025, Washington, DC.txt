Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, addiction is a public health  crisis from which no community is immune. We saw the worst of it in  2021, when, in a 12-month span, more than 110,000 people died of  overdose. That is 300 or more people a day, 365 days a year.

Here is a small light. In 2024, overdose deaths fell by 27 percent.  We are finally seeing progress. That is a huge dent in this horrible  tragedy.

What is the response of the Trump administration? Shuttering SAMHSA  and shifting and shafting it into an illogical AHA--somebody tell me  what that department is--organization and proposing a budget that kicks  nearly 14 million people off Medicaid.

Nearly half of those struggling with opioid use disorder rely on  Medicaid. In Pennsylvania alone, that is 100,000 people who may now  lose their only chance at life, at recovery, at treatment.

I know the desperate hope. I know the prayers for a loved one to find  recovery. My son Harry is 12\1/2\ years in recovery from opioid  addiction.

My family knows the struggle of way too many families, and we are  among the lucky ones, though I don't like to call it lucky. Every  family should be as lucky as I.

At this time, we must save more lives.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the President not cut Medicaid and SAMHSA.
