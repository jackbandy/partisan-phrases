Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week marked a stunning  milestone: 100 days of chaos, cruelty, and lawlessness under the Trump  administration. We see it in our economy, in our homes, and in our  relationships abroad.

Just 100 days ago, President Trump inherited a strong economy, yet  our economy shrank in the first 3 months of this year. He imposed  punishing tariffs, then he didn't, wiping out $11 trillion in wealth in  11 weeks. The price of gas, eggs, and other groceries are still too  high.

The President handed an unelected, unqualified billionaire, Elon  Musk, unfettered access to private data and indiscriminately fired  devoted civil servants. Services at Social Security and IRS have been  slowed in the aftermath.

Because the President has aligned himself with dictators like Putin,  our allies across the globe are now openly admitting they can't trust  us.

This is not good governance. It is not reform.

Mr. Speaker, history will not be kind to those who enable this  President through words or through their appalling silence.
