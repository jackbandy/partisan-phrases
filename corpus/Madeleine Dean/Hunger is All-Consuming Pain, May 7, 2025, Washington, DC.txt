Hunger is All-Consuming Pain

Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, hunger is an all-consuming  pain. Many of us are lucky never to have known that pain. Yet, in my  district alone, nearly 25,000 households rely on food assistance to  stave off hunger. SNAP feeds seniors who live alone, children without  nutrients to grow, and families who work hard every day, but it is  still not enough.

Now, Republicans sadly want to cut SNAP in order to subsidize another  tax break for the rich, a move that could increase a household of  four's grocery bill by $175 a month, or nearly $2,000 a year.

Our common humanity should be enough to block this cut, but sadly, it  seems it is not for too many of my colleagues.

Mr. Speaker, I raise another argument: SNAP dollars flow directly  into our economy, local businesses, and farms. We have a chance to ease  the pain of our most vulnerable.

I will not stand by as Republicans steal from the American people and  give even more to the rich.

The Gospel of Matthew reminds us of the power of caring for the least  among us, saying: ``For I was naked and you clothed me''; ``for I was  hungry and you gave me food.''
