Pennie Enrollment

Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on January 1, Republicans in  Congress allowed the Affordable Care Act credits to expire.

Instead of celebrating a new year, millions of Americans confronted  healthcare premiums skyrocketing overnight. Many had to make an  impossible choice. Just look at my home State of Pennsylvania, where  85,000 people who receive their health insurance through Pennie, our  health insurance marketplace, were forced to drop coverage.

That is one in five Pennsylvanians, and it is not surprising who is  bearing the brunt of this crisis: older Pennsylvanians and rural  communities, some of the most vulnerable among us; 85,000 people who  can't access preventative screenings for cancer or visit a pediatrician  when their child is sick; and people who may or will delay lifesaving  care because they simply cannot afford it.

These tax credits save lives. That is why the House voted last month  to extend them for 3 years. It was overwhelmingly supported. It was  bipartisan. It is humane.

My message to my Senate colleagues is this: Bring this bill to the  floor today. We cannot waste another moment.
