Violating Core Tenets of Our United States

Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, ``Congress shall make no law  respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free  exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;  or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.''

I read these words today, the very first of the Articles of our Bill  of Rights, the First Amendment, because 250 years later, our President  does not seem to recognize them.

We were born from assembly. We live by free speech and a free press.  These are the core tenets of our United States. Yet, the President  floods American cities with lawless, thuggish ICE agents.

Their grotesque operations have killed two Americans in Minneapolis.  It is hard to articulate the sheer brutality and the bone-chilling  horror of the Renee Good and Alex Pretti murders, citizens shot dead  while exercising their First Amendment rights.

Two journalists have been arrested. Children have been taken from  their homes. U.S. citizens have been unjustly detained. At this point,  more than 35 people have died in ICE custody, and 15 have been shot.

If we allow this to continue, then what does that say about our  Nation?
