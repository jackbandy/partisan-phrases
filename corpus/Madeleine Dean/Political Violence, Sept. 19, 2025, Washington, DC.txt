Political Violence

Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, when I came to Congress in 2019, I knew it was  a time of great tension, yet I was motivated all the more to do this  work.

In the almost 7 years since, our empathy and our common humanity has  been tested in unimaginable ways.

The latest is the horrific murder of Charlie Kirk.

Beyond the horror of such a vile act is the pervasive ugly rise in  political violence.

We have witnessed it in my home State of Pennsylvania with the  attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Butler; and, again, with the  arson attack on Governor Josh Shapiro's home on Passover with his  family sleeping upstairs; and again in Minnesota with the murder of  House Speaker Emerita Melissa Horton, her husband, Mark, and their dog  in their home; and now, again, at Utah Valley University.

We must condemn political violence in all its forms and in all its  twisted motivations and perverse ideologies.

We must, instead, commit ourselves to civic engagement and education,  commit ourselves to decency, dignity, and the truth for the good of  this Nation, our neighbors, our families, and most especially our  children.
