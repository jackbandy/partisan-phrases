Developing and Empowering Our Aspiring Leaders Act of 2025

Our economy is struggling. People cannot afford groceries and gas.  Every day, it seems more and more people are getting laid off. The  American Dream is increasingly out of reach.

A core engine of our economy has always been the entrepreneurs who  take the risk of starting their own company. By implementing key  changes to the legal definition of a venture capital fund, H.R. 4429  will make it easier for capital to flow into American small businesses.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
