I rise in support of H.R. 4431, the Improving Capital Allocation for  Newcomers Act of 2025, or ICAN Act, offered by Mr. Timmons and Ms.  Pettersen.

Like the DEAL Act, the ICAN Act also amends the definition of  ``venture capital fund'' under the Investment Company Act. Currently,  in order to qualify as a venture capital fund under this act, a private  fund must hold $12 million or less in assets and have no more than 250  investors. This bill adjusts those figures upward, raising the cap to  $50 million and the investor limit to 500.

It also requires the SEC to conduct a study 5 years after enactment  to determine the bill's impact on how capital is being allocated to  companies owned by these venture funds. Based on the results of the  study, the SEC could further adjust the $50 million and 500 beneficial  owner limit upward or downward.

The ICAN Act should help venture funds to more widely invest in small  and growing businesses.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all colleagues to support H.R. 4431 to make it  easier for capital to flow to startups and small businesses. This bill  does so by increasing the dollar size and number of investors for  venture funds.

Additionally, it requires the SEC to conduct a study that examines  how funds are invested across several metrics, including the veteran  status of a company's founders, geographical location, and industry  sector, size, and state of development. Based on the results of this  study, the SEC would be authorized to adjust the bill's limits upward  or downward by a tailored amount, if needed.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
