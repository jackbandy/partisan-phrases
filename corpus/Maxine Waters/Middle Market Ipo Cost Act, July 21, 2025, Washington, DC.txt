Middle Market Ipo Cost Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693906/middle-market-ipo-cost-act


Mr. Speaker, this bill requires the SEC to study the costs  encountered by small- and medium-sized companies when undertaking the  initial public offering of their securities to the public, otherwise  known as IPO, as well as certain other offerings that are exempt from  SEC registration.

When going public, companies tend to hire underwriters, like  investment banks, and other professionals, like attorneys and  accountants, to help prepare the IPO. Underwriters serving as  intermediaries between companies and prospective investors typically  receive a set percentage of the IPO price as compensation for their  work.

Large companies have in recent years been able to negotiate lower  percentages for this process, which reduces their overall fee. At the  same time, smaller companies have continued to pay the same historic  percentage for this service.

Simply put, this bill sheds light on how much small- and medium-sized  companies are paying for their underwriting fees, which will allow  these companies to negotiate lower prices.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support my friend from  Connecticut (Mr. Himes) commonsense measure. I reserve the balance of  my time.

I support Mr. Himes' bill, which will shed light on how much small-  and medium-sized companies are paying for their underwriting fees to go  public. I hope it will finally put pressure on the SEC to address this  important issue for smaller companies.

Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
