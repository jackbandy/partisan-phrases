Systemic Risk Authority Transparency Act


Ms. WATERS.  He is also the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations.

Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Ranking Member Green,  for his good work on this bill.

H.R. 3716 will ensure that if we have another banking emergency, as  we did 2 years ago with several regional banks, and regulators respond  by using systemic risk tools, that Congress and the American people  promptly receive detailed information from GAO and others on what went  wrong and what should be done to promptly fix it.

This bill is supported by Americans for Financial Reform and Public  Citizen.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
