Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, this big, ugly bill strikes healthcare from  17 million Americans, shutters hospitals, and starves 12 million people  by taking away their food stamps.

These cuts add up to $1.3 trillion, the exact cost of the tax cut  Republicans are handing out to the richest 1 percent of Americans. That  is not all. The entire bill will add a whopping $3.3 trillion to our  Nation's $35 trillion debt. So much for Republicans being the party of  fiscal responsibility.

They are also gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an  agency that returned $21 billion to families cheated by megabanks. They  are cutting housing funds during an affordability crisis and weakening  oversight of Wall Street. Maybe they have forgotten that the people  elected them, not Trump or the billionaire class.

Mr. Speaker, it will be a cold day in hell before we let Republicans  get away with this.
