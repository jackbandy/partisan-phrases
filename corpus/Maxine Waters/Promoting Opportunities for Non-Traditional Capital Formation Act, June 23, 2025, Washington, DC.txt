Promoting Opportunities for Non-Traditional Capital Formation Act


Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  3422, the Promoting Opportunities for Non-Traditional Capital Formation  Act. This bill deals with the Office of the Advocate for Small Business  Capital Formation, which is an independent SEC office that was  established to advance the interests of small businesses.

The office proactively works to identify and address unique  challenges faced by minority-owned, women-owned, and rural small  businesses as well as businesses located in natural disaster areas.

My bill requires the SEC small business advocate to provide  educational resources and host events to promote capital-raising  options for these underrepresented small businesses. My bill would also  require the Office to meet annually with representatives of State  securities commissions to ensure that there is a whole-of-government  approach to addressing the unique needs of underrepresented businesses.

The North American Securities Administrators Association, or NASAA,  strongly supports this legislation, particularly as it would strengthen  collaboration and coordination between regulators.

In a letter to my office, written in support of this bill when it was  previously introduced, NASAA emphasized former Republican SEC  Commissioner Michael Piwowar's comments that ``for a capital formation  agenda to succeed, it is essential that State and Federal regulators  work together to support the businesses that seek to engage in these  offerings while also protecting investors.''

Indeed, my bill makes sure that Federal regulators and State  regulators do just that, while at the same time advancing the cause of  small business capital formation across the spectrum.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague (Mrs. Wagner) for cosponsoring my  bill, and I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this bill into  law.
