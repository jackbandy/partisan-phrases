McSally Introduces Bill to Reauthorize the Special Diabetes Program for Indians


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) introduced legislation on Wednesday to reauthorize the Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) for an additional five years and increase funding to $200 million per year. Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) are original cosponsors of the bill.

According to the CDC, American Indians and Alaska Natives have a greater chance of having type 2 diabetes than any other population. For nearly 2 out of 3 Native Americans who have kidney failure, diabetes is the primary factor. 

"Diabetes continues to devastate Native American communities, leading to other serious health conditions," said McSally. "SDPI has proved to be successful in curbing the rate of diabetes in native communities and ensuring Native Americans have access to the care they need in order to stay healthy. I urge the Senate to swiftly reauthorize this important program."
