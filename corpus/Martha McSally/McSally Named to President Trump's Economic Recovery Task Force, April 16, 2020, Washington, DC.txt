McSally Named to President Trump's Economic Recovery Task Force


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) announced today that she will serve on President Donald Trump's bipartisan congressional task force to provide counsel on the re-opening of America in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

"The coronavirus pandemic has given way to unprecedented challenges unlike any we have seen in our nation's history. Americans have been asked to stay home and not work in order to save lives and that gravely impacted the livelihoods of so many," McSally said. "But I am confident America and Arizona will recover from this extraordinary time stronger than ever.

"It is an honor to be named to the president's bipartisan task force to plan our country's path forward. This morning, I spoke to President Trump, Vice President Pence, and Senators on both sides of the aisle to discuss how to allow people to safely return to work while saving lives and defeating the virus. I've been in constant communication with Arizona small business owners, industry leaders, and elected officials to understand the challenges they are facing and develop solutions that will put us in the best possible position to harness economic growth once we have turned the corner on this crisis. I will take Arizonans' concerns and ideas straight to the task force of decisionmakers to inform a strong economic recovery that benefits Arizona's families and businesses while prioritizing the safety of all citizens."
