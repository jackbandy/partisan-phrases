McSally Calls for Strengthening Medicare Advantage Plans for Arizona Seniors


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) this week joined Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), and 59 other senators in sending a letter to ask the Administration to further strengthen affordable options available to seniors using Medicare Advantage plans for calendar year 2021.

Nearly 490,000 Arizonans were enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans in 2018. Thirty-eight percent of Medicare beneficiaries in Arizona were enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans in 2018, as compared to 34 percent nationwide.

"We appreciate the Administration's work to preserve and strengthen the program for current and future beneficiaries," the senators wrote. "As annual updates are considered for plan year 2021, we ask you to provide Medicare Advantage plans the incentives and flexibility to offer affordable, patient-centered options, including to beneficiaries with End Stage Renal Disease who have the opportunity to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan for the first time."

The senators continued, "Millions of seniors and individuals with disabilities depend on Medicare Advantage for their comprehensive health care coverage.  Enthusiasm for the program remains strong, with more than 94 percent of enrollees reporting high satisfaction with their plan.  This year, average premiums are expected to decline by 14 percent, the lowest average premium since 2007, while enrollment is projected to increase to more than 24 million."

On December 19, McSally delivered major health care wins for Arizona in a year-end funding package that passed the U.S. Senate.
