McSally Introduces Bill to Withhold Pay Until Senate Passes COVID-19 Relief Package


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) introduced legislation today to withhold pay from all U.S. Senators until a COVID-19 relief and support package is passed.

"If Americans aren't getting paid, then neither should the Senators failing to support the workers and families who need help making ends meet," said McSally. "Today, I introduced legislation to have Senators' pay withheld until relief is passed. It is despicable that millions of Americans are without a paycheck in this time of crisis, while the Senate wastes precious time playing political games. The Senate must pass this relief package now in order to get cash straight to the people."
