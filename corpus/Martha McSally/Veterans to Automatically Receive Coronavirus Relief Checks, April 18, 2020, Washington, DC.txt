Veterans to Automatically Receive Coronavirus Relief Checks


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) shared the following information regarding the Treasury Department's announcement Friday that they are working with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure that our veterans and their beneficiaries who collect Compensation and Pension (C&P) benefit payments will automatically receive their one-time coronavirus relief check. 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act established Economic Impact Payments for individuals who make less than $99,000 a year or married couples that make less than $198,000 a year. 

"Economic Impact Payments will be issued automatically to our Veterans and their families who did not file tax returns for 2018 or 2019," said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. "The Treasury, IRS and VA are working hard to ensure our nation's heroes receive these payments quickly and without any additional action or paperwork."

Many non-tax filing beneficiaries have already begun using the "Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info" tool to provide basic personal information to receive their EIP. There will be no interruption to payments being processed using this online tool. Veterans with Internet access are encouraged to continue providing information.

For those who do not have access, or choose not to use the "Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info" tool, their EIP will be processed with no further action required from them.
