McSally Announces Over $2 Million in HHS Grants for Arizona Rural Health Program


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) on Friday announced the release of over $2 million in CARES Act funding for Arizona's rural communities.

The University of Arizona will receive over $1.3 million for the Small Rural Hospital Improvement Program, and over $800,000 in funding for its Telehealth Resource Center.

"Arizona's rural communities have been hard hit by this public health crisis and our rural hospitals are rapidly losing revenue," McSally said. "The University of Arizona has long been a pioneer in rural health care and telehealth, and they've stepped up in phenomenal ways to ensure rural patients get the care needed during the coronavirus outbreak. These grants are just one of the several ways CARES Act funding is providing relief to rural and underserved communities in Arizona."
