McSally Continues to Call out China's Reckless Behavior


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) on Thursday called for the immediate banning of China's wet markets following reports they have reopened despite being linked to the first cases of COVID-19 in the country's Hubei province. 

"China's wet markets are disgusting, inhumane, and dangerous, leaving humans exposed to an array of deadly diseases," McSally said. "Given the interconnectedness of today's world, these markets not only pose a risk to Chinese citizens, but to people around the globe, including Americans. The Chinese Communist Party has done enough damage to global health by covering up the severity of the coronavirus with the help of the World Health Organization, and now this? It's unacceptable. I urge the U.S. to pressure the Chinese government into shutting down these unsafe markets."
