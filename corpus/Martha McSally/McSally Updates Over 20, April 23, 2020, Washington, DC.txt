McSally Updates Over 20,000 Arizonans on Latest COVID-19 Resources


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) provided an update on coronavirus relief and resources to over 20,000 Arizonans today during her sixth telephone town hall since the coronavirus outbreak.

During the over hour-long call, McSally discussed the latest coronavirus aid package passed by the Senate on Monday and the immediate need to get relief payments into the hands of small business owners. She also shared that Social Security recipients will be the next group to receive their Treasury relief checks. 

McSally answered questions regarding resources for the Navajo Nation, antibody testing, relief payments for veterans, and reopening the economy.

"As many of you know, funding for a key small business relief program ran out," McSally said. "Every day counts for our small businesses, which create nearly half the jobs in America. This week, I supported the passage of legislation to increase that funding for our small businesses and to increase funding for our health care heroes, as well as state-led testing. I'm in close contact with the Treasury making sure those relief checks get out to all Arizonans who are eligible. I continue to be amazed by the innovation and acts of goodwill we see every day in our state.
