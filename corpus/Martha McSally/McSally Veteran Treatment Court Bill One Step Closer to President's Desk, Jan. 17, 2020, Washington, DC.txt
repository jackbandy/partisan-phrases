McSally Veteran Treatment Court Bill One Step Closer to President's Desk


U.S. Senator Martha McSally's (R-AZ) legislation to aid veterans in crisis by expanding access to veteran treatment courts unanimously passed the Senate this week.

U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Tina Smith (D-MN), Rick Scott (R-FL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) are co-sponsors of the legislation.

"My fellow service members put their lives on the line for our country and deserve our full support as they make the often difficult transition back to civilian life," said McSally. "Due to invisible wounds, some veterans can fall into addiction and other negative behavior patterns. Veteran treatment courts are a proven way to help veterans in crisis get back on the right path after they've become involved with the criminal justice system. I've seen the life-saving and life-changing impact of these courts in Arizona and I know the expansion of these programs would greatly benefit our nation. I'm grateful to my colleagues for unanimously supporting our legislation."

On November 5, McSally introduced the Veteran Treatment Court Coordination Act of 2019.

 Companion legislation was introduced by Representatives Charlie Crist (D-FL) and Elise Stefanik (R-NY).
