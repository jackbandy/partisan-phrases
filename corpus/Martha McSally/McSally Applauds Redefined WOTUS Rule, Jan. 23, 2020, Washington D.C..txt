McSally Applauds Redefined WOTUS Rule


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) applauded today's announcement by the EPA to redefine the 2015 Waters of the United States Rule.

"The existing WOTUS Rule overreached to give the federal government the authority to regulate every ditch, stream, and creek in the backyards of farmers, ranchers, builders, and small business owners," said McSally. "As a result, bureaucratic red tape suffocated our country's engines of jobs. Since my first day in Congress, I've been fighting to roll back this burdensome rule and I applaud the Trump Administration for allowing commonsense to prevail by returning the onus of water and land rights where it belongs: the states."

On September 12, McSally applauded the EPA's finalized rule to fully roll back the 2015 Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule.

In March 2016, March 2017, and April 2019, McSally submitted an appropriations language request to the Appropriations Committee to prohibit the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from using appropriated funds for the WOTUS rule, or any substantially similar rule.

In May 2018,  McSally voted in favor of an amendment to the Farm Bill which would have repealed the 2015 WOTUS Rule.

In June 2017, McSally supported the Trump Administration's release of a proposed rule that will kill the Obama Administration's WOTUS Rule by effectively re-codifying the Clean Water Act as it existed prior to 2015.
