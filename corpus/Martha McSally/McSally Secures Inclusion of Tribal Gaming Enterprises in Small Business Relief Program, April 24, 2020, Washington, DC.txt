McSally Secures Inclusion of Tribal Gaming Enterprises in Small Business Relief Program


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) announced today that small tribal gaming enterprises under 500 employees can now apply for financial relief through the Payment Protection Program (PPP). McSally fought for specific language in the CARES Act to ensure this tribal parity, and has persistently pushed federal agencies to execute the legislation as intended.  

In addition to the many phone calls to members of the executive branch to urgently remedy this issue, Senator McSally sent a letter to the Small Business Administration and Treasury Department earlier this month.

"Finally. This is a huge victory for our tribal communities and the many tribal and non-tribal employees who rely on tribal gaming enterprises for their livelihood," McSally said. "This lifeline should have been available to our small tribal gaming enterprises from the very beginning due to the language I helped secure in the CARES Act. I've been insistent on this change to the SBA's PPP guidance for weeks so it is great to see tribal gaming enterprises finally included in the program. Now, we need the CARES Act relief allocated for tribal communities distributed immediately."
