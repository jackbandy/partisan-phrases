McSally Introduces Bill to Expand Forgivable Expenses Under the Paycheck Protection Program


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) introduced legislation today to support the safety of consumers and employees during the reopening of the American economy. Her bill would aid small businesses with necessary safety improvements and short-term purchases of personal protection equipment (PPE).

The Main Street Enhancement and Safety Act would extend loan forgiveness under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to small businesses for the purchase of PPE for employees or necessary improvements to the business to create a safer environment for consumers. Currently, PPP loans are only forgivable if funds are used for payroll, rent, mortgage interest, or utilities.

"As millions of small businesses across America reopen, it is imperative that employees have the proper equipment to protect themselves and consumers from the coronavirus," McSally said. "Expanding loan forgiveness under the Paycheck Protection Program to cover PPE and other safety expenses will give our small businesses the support they need for these new unforeseen costs."
