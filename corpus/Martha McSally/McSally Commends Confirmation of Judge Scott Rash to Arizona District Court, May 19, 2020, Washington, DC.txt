McSally Commends Confirmation of Judge Scott Rash to Arizona District Court


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) issued the following statement today following the Senate's confirmation of Judge Scott Rash to serve as a U.S. district judge for the District of Arizona.

"Judge Scott Rash will make an excellent federal judge for the District of Arizona," McSally said. "His work ethic and fair-mindedness will help him navigate the heavy caseloads currently facing our judges in the District of Arizona. Judge Rash is widely respected in the Tucson legal community, and though he will be greatly missed at the Pima County Superior Court, he will be a great asset to Arizona's District Court. His confirmation is good news for Arizonans seeking justice."
