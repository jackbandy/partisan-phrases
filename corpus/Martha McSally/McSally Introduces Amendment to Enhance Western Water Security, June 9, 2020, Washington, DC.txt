McSally Introduces Amendment to Enhance Western Water Security


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) on Tuesday introduced an amendment to the sweeping Great American Outdoors Act that would repair or replace aging Bureau of Reclamation water infrastructure across the country. Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), James Risch (R-ID), and Kirsten Sinema (D-AZ) have cosponsored the amendment.

"Throughout Arizona and across the West, there is a significant need to reinvest in the water infrastructure that our farms and cities were built upon, many of which are a century old," McSally said. "My amendment will provide much-needed funding to local water operators so they can make critical repairs to water infrastructure in their communities while improving water security in the West."

McSally's amendment is based off of a bipartisan bill introduced last year alongside Sinema to improve water supply infrastructure.

The amendment is endorsed by multiple farm and water organizations around the country, including:

Irrigation and Electrical Districts Association of Arizona; Association of California Water Agencies; Coachella Valley Water District; Family Farm Alliance; Friant Water Authority; National Water Resources Association; Yakima Basin Joint Board; Western Growers; Western States Water Council; Columbia Basin Development League; Diamond Plastic Corporation; Kennewick Irrigation District; North West Pipe Company; Roosevelt Water Conservation District; Washington State Water Resources Association; and more.
