McSally, Sinema Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Strengthen Arizona's Federal Courts


U.S. Senators Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) earlier this month introduced bipartisan legislation to bolster the judicial system in Arizona and alleviate the backlog of cases in Arizona's federal courts.

"Arizona's expanding population means it is overdue for more new federal judgeships than nearly anywhere in the country. Although Arizonans should be proud of the growing number of Americans who choose to call our state home, our federal judges are burdened with heavy caseloads that hinder their ability to effectively do their jobs," McSally said. "Our bipartisan bill would address this problem by bringing the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona up to full strength, which would aid in statewide efforts to address crime and illegal immigration. I am committed to fighting for a strong judiciary in Arizona so that our judges have the tools they need to deliver timely justice."

"Arizona is one of the fastest growing states in the nation. Making Arizona's federal judgeship a permanent position increases access to judicial services for all Arizonans," said Sinema.

 Background:

The size of the federal judiciary in Arizona has not kept up with the size of the population, leaving the state overdue for more new federal judges than almost any place in the United States.The Judicial Conference of the United States, the national policy-making body for the federal courts, defines any vacancy where weighted filings are in excess of 600 per judgeship as a "Judicial Emergency." The district of Arizona currently has 800 weighted filings per judgeship. This legislation would carry out the March 2019 recommendations by the Judicial Conference of the United States to create four additional judgeships and to convert a temporary court judgeship into a permanent post for the district of Arizona.
