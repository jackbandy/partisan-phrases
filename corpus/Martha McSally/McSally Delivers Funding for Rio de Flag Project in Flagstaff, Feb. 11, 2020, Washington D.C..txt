McSally Delivers Funding for Rio de Flag Project in Flagstaff


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) today announced that she helped deliver $52 million in federal funding to complete the Rio de Flag flood control project.

"When I visited Flagstaff on my 15-county listening tour last year, I heard from Flagstaff leaders about why the Rio de Flag flood control project is so critical to the safety of the community," said McSally. "I pushed strongly and relentlessly for this project to receive necessary funding after years of delay and I am glad to see it has finally been prioritized in the Army Corps work plan." 

First authorized in 2000, the Rio de Flag project would ensure that that the downtown Flagstaff community including Northern Arizona University and the historic Southside community are permanently protected from a catastrophic flood. Senator McSally engaged with the Senate Appropriations Committee as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) to advocate for the project and help secure the funding needed to complete construction. 

"I want to thank all of our Arizona congressional delegation who signed a letter of support for this project, especially Congressman Tom O'Halleran, and Senators Kryrsten Sinema and Martha McSally for their unwavering support and commitment to this project," Flagstaff Mayor Coral Evans said. "We also owe a debt of gratitude to Congresswoman Kirkpatrick, who sits on the House Appropriations Committee and fought tirelessly for this project, and Congressman Paul Gosar, who never relented in his support and dedication to this project."

On January 10, McSally pressed the Corps on the importance of the Rio de Flag project and requested funding be included in the agency's upcoming work plan.

On February 10, the Corps released their FY2020 work plan which included the $52 million needed to complete the Rio de Flag flood control project.
