McSally Meets with President Trump to Advocate for Greater Flexibility in CARES Act Funding for States, Cities, and Tribes


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) released the following statement today after attending a meeting at the White House with President Trump on increasing flexibility of CARES Act funds for states, tribes, and local governments. McSally has been a relentless advocate for this flexibility for states in discussions with the White House and Senate leadership.

"It was great to meet with the President and his team today to share the importance of giving Arizona more flexibility with CARES Act funding," said McSally. "I have been engaged with Governor Ducey, Arizona mayors, and tribal leaders throughout this crisis about what our state, cities, towns, counties, and tribes need right now. They need to be able to use already allocated funds efficiently and expediently, without burdensome red tape or onerous restrictions that tie their hands from supporting their communities. It was a productive conversation and I will continue to push for greater flexibility in talks with the Administration and in Congress to ensure Arizona's communities have support during this unprecedented crisis."
