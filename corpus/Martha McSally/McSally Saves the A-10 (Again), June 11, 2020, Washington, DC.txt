McSally Saves the A-10 (Again)


U.S. Senator Martha McSally made good on her promise to keep the Air Force from mothballing the A-10 warthog, "a fixture at Davis-Monthan Air Force base in Tucson for over 40 years."

During a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting yesterday on this year's annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), McSally inserted language that prohibits the Secretary of Defense from divesting or retiring any A-10 aircraft. She also required the Secretary of the Air Force to brief Congress on the required A-10 fleet size and validate the assumptions used to justify any future A-10 fleet size reductions.  

"I flew 325 hours in combat in the A-10 and commanded the one deployable A-10 squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, so I know the unique capabilities that the A-10 brings to save American lives on the battlefield," said McSally. "I stopped them from mothballing the A-10 when I first came to the House and did it again this year in the Senate. I authored this provision in this Senate defense bill and had it successfully adopted by the committee to save the A-10, again."
