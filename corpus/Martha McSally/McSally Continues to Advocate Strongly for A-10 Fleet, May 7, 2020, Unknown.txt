McSally Continues to Advocate Strongly for A-10 Fleet


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) today pressed the U.S. Air Force (USAF) Chief of Staff nominee on the future of the A-10 Warthog fleet.

During a U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee hearing to consider Defense Department nominations, McSally reminded USAF Chief of Staff nominee, General Charles Q. Brown, Jr., of legal requirements she crafted in the Fiscal Year 2017 defense bill prohibiting the USAF from retiring even one A-10 aircraft until a series of reports were submitted to Congress.

McSally is in ongoing discussions with USAF leadership following the release of their FY 2021 budget proposal, which would prematurely phase out 44 A-10s.

"Are you aware of the requirements we've had in the NDAA in the past related to this [retiring an A-10]?" McSally asked.

U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff nominee, General Charles Q. Brown, Jr., said: "I'm somewhat aware. In my preparation, I've been made aware in a little more detail."

"Ok, great. I was concerned that the proposal for this next year's budget included phasing out some number of the A-10s without any regard to those requirements we had in there where we clearly said you can't plan to retire one more A-10 until these things have happened and these things have not happened yet. So we're in ongoing discussions with your leadership and, should you be confirmed, this is something we are going to be engaging with you on," McSally said.
