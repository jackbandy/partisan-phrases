McSally on Administration Effort to Lower Insulin Prices for Seniors


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) released the following statement Tuesday after President Trump announced lower insulin costs for seniors through Medicare's Part D Senior Savings Model.

"Our nation's seniors shouldn't have to choose between buying groceries and buying insulin," McSally said. "Capping insulin costs through Medicare is a huge step in the right direction as we look to reduce drug pricing across the country. I applaud the President's efforts to make insulin prices more affordable and predictable, and I will continue working with the President and the Administration to bring down prescription drug costs for our seniors and families."

Across the nation, participating enhanced Part D prescription drug plans will provide Medicare beneficiaries access to a broad set of insulins at a maximum $35 copay for a month's supply, from the beginning of 2021 through the various phases of Part D coverage. The Part D Senior Savings Model (announced on March 11, 2020) is a voluntary model that tests the impact on insulin access and care by participating Part D enhanced alternative plans offering lower out-of-pocket costs, at a maximum $35 copay for a month's supply, for a broad range of insulins.
