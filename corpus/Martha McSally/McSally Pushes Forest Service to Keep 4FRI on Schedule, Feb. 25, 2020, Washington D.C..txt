McSally Pushes Forest Service to Keep 4FRI on Schedule


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) today urged the U.S. Forest Service Chief to keep forest restoration projects in Arizona on schedule.

During a U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing to examine the President's fiscal year 2021 budget request for the U.S. Forest Service, McSally asked for a specific timeline on Phase 2 of the Four Forests Restoration Initiative (4FRI).

"The Phase 2 RFP (Request for Proposal) has been delayed multiple times," McSally said. "Now some of the delays are largely due to listening to stakeholders and improving the RFP, which is commendable, but it is important that we adhere to an aggressive timeline. Can you share on the record when you expect a contract to be awarded at this point?"

USDA Forest Service Chief Victoria Christiansen said: "The proposals are due in May. It's our top priority to evaluate in the summer months and we will award in early fall and it's a priority to stay on time." 

McSally also highlighted the need to streamline the regulatory barriers to active forest management in Arizona. She encouraged all Forest Service staff involved in the 4FRI project to read the recent report by Northern Arizona University's Ecological Restoration Institute on modernizing 4FRI implementation.

 On June 13, 2019, McSally introduced legislation outlining the specific changes Forest Service needed to implement to make the 4FRI project more efficient and economical.

On April 9, 2019, McSally obtained a commitment from the Forest Service to work with her on streamlining forestry regulations in Arizona.  

McSally toured multiple forest management-related sites during her 15-county listening tour in her first 90 days as a U.S. Senator, including the Flagstaff Watershed Protection project and the Forest Energy Corporation biomass electricity plant.
