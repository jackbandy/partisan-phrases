McSally Secures $10 Million for Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport Control Tower


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) announced that she secured $10 million in federal funding for the construction of a new control tower at the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport.

"When I attended pilot training at Williams Air Force Base--now Gateway Airport--in 1990, I saw the challenges presented by the old air traffic control tower and can attest firsthand to the urgent need for a new one," McSally said. "This new tower will improve safety at the airport as it expands into an international hub with the construction of Skybridge, the nation's first joint U.S.-Mexico customs processing hub." 

Mesa Mayor John Giles said: "We are grateful for the tremendous partnership we have with the FAA and for their continued support and investment in Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport. I would also like to thank Senators McSally and Sinema and the Arizona Congressional Delegation for their support. The Airport is a vital part of the regional transportation system and a new Air Traffic Control Tower will allow it to continue growing and serving the needs of the Greater Phoenix Region, including Skybridge, the first of its kind inland customs port with Mexico that's expected to add 17,000 jobs to the area."

J. Brian O'Neill, A.A.A.E. Executive Director Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport said: "Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport would like to thank the entire Arizona Congressional Delegation for their tireless efforts to secure this critical funding for a new Air Traffic Control Tower. Our representatives in Washington truly understand the regional importance of the Airport and the need for continued infrastructure investment. We would also like to thank the staff at the FAA for their continued support, guidance, and confidence in the future growth and success of Gateway Airport."
