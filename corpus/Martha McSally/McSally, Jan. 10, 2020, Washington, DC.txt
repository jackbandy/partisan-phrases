McSally, Sinema Urge Completion of Rio de Flag Flood Control Project


U.S. Senators Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) moved this week to safeguard Flagstaff residents against catastrophic flooding.

In a letter to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the senators requested funding for the completion of the Rio de Flag flood control project.

"For the last 30 years, Coconino County and the City of Flagstaff's top priority has been to mitigate potential flood damage caused by heavy rain or snowmelt which flows into the Rio de Flag. A significant flood event would have devastating impacts for nearly half of Flagstaff's population and 1,500 structures valued at over $916 million in 2008," the senators wrote. 

"Given the increase in FY2020 funding for Army Corps construction projects, we ask that you include funding in the FY20 work plan to complete the project and ensure that downtown Flagstaff, Northern Arizona University, BNSF Railroad, and the historic Southside community are permanently protected from a catastrophic flood. The federal government and the City of Flagstaff have already invested nearly $45 million in Rio de Flag and delaying the project would be a waste of precious taxpayer dollars."
