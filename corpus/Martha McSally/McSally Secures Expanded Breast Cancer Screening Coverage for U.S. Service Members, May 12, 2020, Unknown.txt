McSally Secures Expanded Breast Cancer Screening Coverage for U.S. Service Members, Veterans


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) announced today that the Department of Defense will implement a new policy allowing female service members and veterans on TRICARE to receive expanded breast cancer screening coverage starting on May 29. This follows several calls by the Senator for change.

Last year, McSally introduced a bill that would grant female TRICARE users access to the most effective breast imaging option: Digital Breast Tomosynthesis, also known as DBT or 3D mammography. TRICARE was the only national payer not covering preventative DBT screenings at the time. Following McSally's bill introduction and a bipartisan letter, the Department of Defense (DoD) updated its coverage policy officially on January 1, 2020.

Beginning on May 29, female TRICARE users age 30 or over will be covered for annual DBT screenings and those who've received DBT screenings between January 1, 2020 and May 29, 2020 will be eligible for reimbursement.

"This is a major victory for our female servicemembers and veterans covered under TRICARE," McSally said. "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women, but when detected early the overall chances of survival increase dramatically. Women in our Armed Forces now have access to the best preventative breast cancer screenings. I'm glad the Defense Department heard our repeated calls for change and implemented this commonsense policy."
