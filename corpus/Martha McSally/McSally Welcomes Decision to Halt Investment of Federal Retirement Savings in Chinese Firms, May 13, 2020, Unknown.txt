McSally Welcomes Decision to Halt Investment of Federal Retirement Savings in Chinese Firms


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) issued the following statement Wednesday in response to the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) announcement that it would not allow the retirement savings of federal employees and military personnel to be invested in Chinese entities due to the Chinese Communist Party's handling of coronavirus.

This announcement comes one day after McSally called on the FRTIB to reverse its flawed decision to invest federal retirement savings into Chinese firms.

"Investing the hard-earned savings of our federal workforce, to include military personnel, in Chinese firms that pose a threat to American national security and interests is reckless," McSally said. "This misguided policy never should have existed in the first place, but I welcome the board's decision to reverse it. China is our adversary and American policy must make clear that there are consequences to malign behavior."
