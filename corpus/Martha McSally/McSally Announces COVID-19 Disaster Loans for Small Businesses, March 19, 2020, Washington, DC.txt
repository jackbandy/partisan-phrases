McSally Announces COVID-19 Disaster Loans for Small Businesses


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) today announced the availability of economic injury disaster loans for Arizona small businesses impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is currently offering low-interest federal disaster loans for working capital to small businesses suffering substantial economic injury as a result of the coronavirus.

"I am in close contact with small business owners across Arizona and am working to ensure they receive the full support of the federal government, so they can come out of this crisis stronger than ever," McSally said. "I asked the Administration to move quickly to declare the entire state of Arizona eligible for these loans, which will help our local businesses with day-to-day operations. This is just one step we are taking to address the economic impact of the coronavirus, and we are currently working on a larger relief package that will provide direct financial support to local businesses." 

Small businesses can apply through the SBA's Disaster Loan Application Portal or by calling 1‐800‐659‐2955.
