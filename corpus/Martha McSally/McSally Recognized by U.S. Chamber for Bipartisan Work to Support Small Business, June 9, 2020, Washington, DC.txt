McSally Recognized by U.S. Chamber for Bipartisan Work to Support Small Business


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) released the following statement Tuesday after she was recognized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for her bipartisan leadership in supporting America's small business owners and entrepreneurs.

McSally was one of ten Senators to receive the U.S. Chamber's first ever Abraham Lincoln Leadership for America Award for advancing policies that benefit small business growth.

"I'm honored to receive the U.S. Chamber's Abraham Lincoln Leadership for America Award today for my record of bipartisan pro-job, pro-free enterprise work in Congress," McSally said. "Now more than ever, we need to work together to revitalize the economy, get people back to work, and create more jobs for Americans and Arizonans. I will keep fighting for commonsense pro-growth policies including low taxes, deregulation, and incentives to bring manufacturing home from China."

"Now more than ever, our nation needs elected leaders with the courage to pursue common ground and bold, bipartisan solutions to America's greatest challenges," said U.S. Chamber President Suzanne Clark. "These awards honor the deserving members of Congress that are forging common-sense sense solutions, working across the aisle, to enact lasting and meaningful reforms. In the days ahead, Congress must work together and support our nation's free enterprise principles that will help bring our economy back to strength and put our people back to work.""Last year, the U.S. Chamber pledged to heighten our focus and reward bipartisan leadership and constructive governing, and we are now making good on that promise today," Clark added.
