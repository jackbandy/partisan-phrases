McSally Introduces Bill to Prohibit Use of Taxpayer Funds for Chinese Drones


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) on Thursday introduced legislation to prohibit the use of federal funding to purchase drones manufactured in communist China or by Chinese state-owned companies. The bill, Securing Our Skies Against Chinese Technology Act 2020, would require U.S. private entities and state and local governments to certify they are not using Chinese drones in order to receive federal funds.

"At a time when federal agencies are banning or grounding Chinese drones base on cybersecurity concerns, China is now donating them to state and local law enforcement across the United States," McSally said. "This is just another part of China's ongoing effort to exploit the global pandemic and it is unacceptable. We should not risk giving China the chance to spy on Americans amid our efforts to combat the coronavirus. My legislation is a commonsense step toward exposing communist China's real intentions and shoring up our national security."
