McSally Helps to Secure 100 Ventilators for Arizona's Coronavirus Response


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) today secured 100 ventilators from the Strategic National Stockpile to help Arizona deal with the coronavirus pandemic. McSally spoke with President Trump on Wednesday to appeal for the additional ventilators. She followed up on the request Friday.

"This is potentially life-saving news for Arizona," McSally said. "On Wednesday, I asked President Trump for more ventilators for Arizona as we prepare for an increase of coronavirus. Today, the President delivered and we now have 100 ventilators en route to our state. I am grateful to President Trump and Vice President Pence for hearing my call. I am also grateful to have a partner in Governor Ducey to bring home this assistance for Arizona's hospitals, tribes, and communities. I will continue to work with the Trump Administration and Governor Ducey to defeat this virus, protect the health of Arizonans, and provide financial relief."
