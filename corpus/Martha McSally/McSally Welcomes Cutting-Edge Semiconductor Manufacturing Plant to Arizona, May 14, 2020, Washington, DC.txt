McSally Welcomes Cutting-Edge Semiconductor Manufacturing Plant to Arizona


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) on Thursday lauded the announcement today that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) plans to build an advanced chip manufacturing facility in Arizona, which will bring an estimated 1,600 jobs to the state along with an estimated $12 billion in investment.

"This announcement is fantastic news for Arizona and America, and bad news for China," McSally said. "Communist China has long sought to dominate the global semiconductor supply chain, which would create an overreliance on Beijing to create semiconductor chips that power everything from 5G to sophisticated weapons systems. I have been advocating to enhance key manufacturing like this domestically as it impacts our national security. Today's announcement by TSMC brings us closer to that goal. Arizona is a great place to live and work and I welcome TSMC to our amazing state. Congratulations to Governor Ducey and the Trump administration for making this happen."
