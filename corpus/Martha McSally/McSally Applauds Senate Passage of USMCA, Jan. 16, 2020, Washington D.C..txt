McSally Applauds Senate Passage of USMCA


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) today praised passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in the U.S. Senate. The agreement now heads to the president's desk for his signature. Mexico has already ratified the USMCA, and the agreement will go into effect once Canada approves the finalized agreement.

"Good news for Arizona's workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses is finally on its way," said McSally. "For over a year, I have advocated tirelessly to get USMCA to the president's desk. I have met with hundreds of employees and local businesses to hear how their livelihoods will only be improved with the passage of USMCA and the opportunities it will bring.

"Arizona's economy is heavily reliant on cross-border commerce with Mexico and Canada. It sustains more than 228,000 Arizona jobs and over $9 billion in exports to our neighbors. This trade agreement will harness job growth and spur economic activity by modernizing the antiquated guidelines stifling greater and wide-ranging opportunities for cross-border commerce.

"I look forward to the president signing the agreement and its enactment, so that Arizonans can finally operate under a trade agreement that has their best interest in mind," concluded McSally.
