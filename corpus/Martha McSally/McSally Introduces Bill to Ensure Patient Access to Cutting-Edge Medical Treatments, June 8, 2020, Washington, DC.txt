McSally Introduces Bill to Ensure Patient Access to Cutting-Edge Medical Treatments


U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) introduced legislation on Monday to secure patient access to FDA-cleared breakthrough medical treatments and technology by providing temporary coverage under Medicare. 

"Each year, American innovation results in breakthrough medical technology that saves lives and improves quality of life," McSally said. "Unfortunately, it can take up to three years after FDA approval for these breakthrough technologies to be approved by Medicare for seniors. My bill fixes that by allowing seniors to get equal access to new medical technologies right away."

"This legislation would be another significant step forward in providing patient access to transformational medical technologies that save and improve lives," said Scott Whitaker, president and CEO of AdvaMed. "We commend Senator McSally for her leadership, and for the importance she has placed on provisions that will help support an innovation ecosystem that would spur development of life-changing technologies and improve patient outcomes. We look forward to working closely with Congress and CMS on additional ways to facilitate a more efficient coverage and payment process."
