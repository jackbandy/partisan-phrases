McSally, Hawley Introduce Resolution Condemning China's Plans to Violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration and Hong Kong Basic Law


U.S. Senators Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) proposed "sweeping national security law" for Hong Kong that would ban secession, subversion, and foreign interference.

The resolution states unequivocally that passage of this proposed law would put Beijing in direct violation of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law. The resolution also calls upon all free nations to stand firm against the CCP's campaign to destroy Hongkongers' basic liberties and human rights.Joining Senators McSally and Hawley on the resolution are Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Lee (R-UT), Gary Peters (D-MI), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), Mitt Romney (R-UT), and Ted Cruz (R-TX).Representative Mike Gallagher (R-WI) plans to introduce companion legislation in the House.
