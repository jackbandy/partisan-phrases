Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025


Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for  her leadership on this issue.

I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3633, the so-called CLARITY Act.  I believe this misguided legislation will have devastating impacts on  our financial stability, national security, and investor protection.

While my Republican friends claim that this bill will regulate crypto  market structure, in reality, it eviscerates the longstanding history  of investor protections that have made our markets the envy of the  world.

Most importantly, this bill, this push for crypto, will not end well  for the U.S. taxpayer. This bill will lead to the next financial  crisis, and the largest crypto donors who wrote this bill will walk  away unharmed because the worst aspect of this bill is that Republicans  have repeatedly refused to include a single amendment preventing a  Federal taxpayer bailout of the crypto industry.

That is what this bill does.

Additionally, this bill includes zero provisions to prevent the  President, who has a $620-million conflict of interest, from continuing  his ability to accept emoluments from foreign governments like Abu  Dhabi.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and protect the  American taxpayer.
