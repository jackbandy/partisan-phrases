Gerald E. Connolly Esophageal Cancer Awareness Act of 2025


Mr. Speaker, I also thank the majority for their courtesy in moving  this bill expeditiously to the floor.

The Esophageal Cancer Awareness Act was introduced by our dear  friend, the late Ranking Member Gerry Connolly and by a bipartisan and  unanimous vote of our committee, the bill was renamed in his honor.

First of all, I acknowledge Gerry's wife, Smitty, and his daughter,  Caitlin Rose, who are in the gallery, along with many of Gerry's  current and former staff to witness the debate on this bill.

Our Ranking Member, Mr. Connolly, lived his life serving others and  making our country a better place. He was a steadfast advocate of the  disadvantaged and the voiceless, and he stood up for what was right and  what was just.

Gerry was a skilled statesman, an accomplished legislator, and a  fierce defender of democracy. I am sure he would want everyone here to  continue fighting like hell to stand up for those who cannot stand up  for themselves, to defend the rights of every American, and bring  accountability and transparency to power.

Esophageal cancer is the fastest increasing cancer among American  men. It is also one of the deadliest. This bill would direct the GAO to  report on key issues relating to esophageal cancer, including Federal  spending for it under the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program and  the screening rates among high-risk individuals within that program.  This bill will hopefully offer some significant amount of help in the  fight against esophageal cancer.

Mr. Connolly was the epitome of a public servant and will be deeply  missed. It is our job now to continue this fight in his memory.

Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge all Members to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
