Gaza

Mr. MORENO. Mr. President, I have been in the U.S. Senate now for a  total of 125 days. I have seen some outrageous comments over the last  125 days. My colleague has been here exactly 12,000 days more than I  have. Let me just set the record straight.

On October 7, 2023, families, mothers, fathers were sitting at home,  enjoying a peaceful existence in one of the most difficult places on  Earth to live. They had a day planned of joy at a festival.  What happened? People came over and savagely--savagely--murdered  children, raped women, took hundreds of hostages, killed more Jews than  at any time since the Holocaust.

What you just heard for the last 15 minutes could be summarized as  the absolute propaganda of Hamas. Let me just be clear. This war was  started by Hamas. It could end today by Hamas if they released every  last hostage, including an American citizen.

We are sitting here in the U.S. Senate and not even saying a word of  the fact that there is a U.S. citizen being held hostage by a terrorist  group in the Middle East. That is outrageous. That should be at the top  of the agenda. Why have civilians been killed in Gaza? Because they  hide weapons in hospitals, in schools, in homes.

Hamas is the enemy, not our greatest ally, which is Israel. I was  just there 2 weeks ago. Two weeks ago, I was there. There is almost no  Israeli that hasn't seen a mom, a dad, a son, a grandson, granddaughter  that hasn't been either injured or killed to protect their country. The  fact that we are disparaging our greatest ally at this level is  completely outrageous.

I had plans to go home, see my wife and kids, but I rose today  because I cannot stay silent after listening to that kind of nonsense  spewed here in the U.S. Senate. It is a disgrace, and we should not  ever forget that Israel is just fighting the war that we would  otherwise fight.
