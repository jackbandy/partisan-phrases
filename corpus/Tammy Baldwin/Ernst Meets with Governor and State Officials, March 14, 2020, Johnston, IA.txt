U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) met with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg, and other state officials, as well as spoke with a number of Iowa grocers from Hy-Vee, Fareway, Casey's, Kum & Go, Walmart, Target, Kwik Star, CVS, Walgreens, and independent grocers, at the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) in Camp Dodge this morning. During the meeting, Ernst received firsthand, up-to-date information on the efforts of Governor Reynolds and her team to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and discussed the needs and concerns of local grocers from across the state of Iowa.

"It's so important in a time of crisis that we're working in a coordinated effort--from federal, state, and local officials to members of our business community and private sector--to support Iowans across the state. Today, I was able to hear directly from a number of our Iowans and state officials about the work they're doing and the ways we will be able to further support them at the federal level," said Senator Ernst. "Governor Reynolds and her team continue to work diligently to combat the virus, and we will continue to support and work closely with her and her team to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across our state. We're all in this together, and we are going to get through this."
