U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Congratulates Dedicated Men and Women of the 115th Fighter Wing on U.S. Air Force Announcement


U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin released the following statement after the U.S. Air Force announced that Wisconsin Air National Guard's Truax Field has been selected as a location to operate the F-35A:

"I congratulate the dedicated men and women of the 115th Fighter Wing and I appreciate the Air Force recognizing the tremendous strategic, geographic and economic capabilities that Truax offers. The Air Force's selection of Truax as the location to operate the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter will create stability for the air wing and provide an enduring benefit to our economy and the State of Wisconsin. During this time of economic uncertainty, basing the F-35 mission at Truax Field will maintain the more than 1,650 jobs to which the 115th currently contributes, and over the lifetime of the F-35 mission there is an estimated economic impact of $4.8 billion for Wisconsin. I am going to continue my work with the U.S. Air Force, Wisconsin's Air National Guard and Dane County to make sure this positive development works for our community."
