"I have serious concerns that the Trump administration's health care sabotage and absence of a plan to lower drug prices undermines our ability to respond to #coronavirus.

We need a commitment from @SecAzar to make any potential #coronavirus vaccine affordable to all, stop promoting #junkplans that don't cover the care necessary to prevent the spread of the virus and stop promoting efforts to undermine Medicaid that jeopardizes people's health care

People should be able to seek appropriate medical care for #coronavirus without being worried they cannot afford it. https://nytimes.com/2020/03/03/health/coronavirus-tests-uninsured.html?searchResultPosition=4"
