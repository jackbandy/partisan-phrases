U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Supports Senate Resolution Supporting Constitutional Right To Peacefully Protest & Condemning President Trump's Order To Tear Gas Peaceful Protesters Outside The White House Last Night


Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin announced her support for a new Senate resolution introduced by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

The Senate resolution affirms the constitutional rights of Americans to peaceably assemble, exercise freedom of speech, and petition the government for redress of grievances must be respected; that violence and looting are unlawful, unacceptable and contrary to the purpose of peaceful protests; and that Congress condemns the President of the United States for ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against the Americans who were peaceably protesting in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C. on the night of June 1, 2020, thereby violating the constitutional rights of those peaceful protestors.

A copy of the Senate resolution can be found here. When Senator Schumer asked for the resolution to be passed by unanimous consent today, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) objected.
