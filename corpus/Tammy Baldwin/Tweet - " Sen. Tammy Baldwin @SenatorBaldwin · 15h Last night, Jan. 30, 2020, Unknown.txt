Tweet - " Sen. Tammy Baldwin @SenatorBaldwin Â· 15h Last night, the White House Counsel wouldn't answer  @SenatorRomney 's question asking the exact date  @POTUS  ordered the hold on security aid to Ukraine. So I asked which witnesses could answer that question.  Hint: it's witnesses blocked by the President, like John Bolton."
