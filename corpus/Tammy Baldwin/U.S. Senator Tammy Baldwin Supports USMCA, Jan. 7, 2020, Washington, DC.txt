U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Supports USMCA


U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin released the following statement announcing her support for the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA).

"President Trump's trade wars have hurt our Wisconsin economy and more than 1,900 dairy farms have gone out of business since he took office. The President's deal with Mexico and Canada fell short but I support the improvements Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats won to make this a better trade deal that I can support. The USMCA implementing legislation includes many changes I have pushed for with the Trump administration, including truly enforceable labor standards that benefit our workers, and making sure that we confront Canada's unfair trade barriers and Mexico's limits on Wisconsin cheese exports so that we have a trade deal that increases market access for our Wisconsin dairy farmers and cheesemakers. NAFTA, which I opposed, cost Wisconsin jobs and needed to be fixed. I will vote for the USMCA because it is a better deal for farmers, manufacturers, businesses and workers. Going forward, President Trump needs to understand Wisconsin needs better trade deals, not trade wars and that in order to stop the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs we not only need fair trade deals, our workers need tax reform that rewards their hard work and doesn't encourage corporations to send their jobs to other countries."
