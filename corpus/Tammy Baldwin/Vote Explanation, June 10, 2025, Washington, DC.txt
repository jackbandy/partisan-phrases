Vote Explanation


Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, on June 9, 2025, the Senate voted on  rollcall vote No. 297, the confirmation of the nomination of Brett  Shumate, of Virginia, to be an Assistant Attorney General. Due to  travel delays, I missed this vote. However, I oppose confirming this  nominee, and I would have voted nay if I were present.
