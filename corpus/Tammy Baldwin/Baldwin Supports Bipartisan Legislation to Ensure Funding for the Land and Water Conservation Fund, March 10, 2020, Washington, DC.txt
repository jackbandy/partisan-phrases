Baldwin Supports Bipartisan Legislation to Ensure Funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund


U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin is calling on the Senate to support the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act to ensure essential federal funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) that will protect and preserve public lands for generations to come. This legislation will be considered by the full Senate this week and also provide a large funding boost to address deferred maintenance in our national parks and federal recreational lands.

"Wisconsin has long been a national leader for conservation and we have a rich history of hunting, fishing and enjoying the great outdoors. I'm working across party lines to protect these traditions for future generations and safeguard the natural resources we enjoy in Wisconsin," said Senator Baldwin. "Wisconsinites understand that protecting public access to our natural resources is important to our quality of life and to our economy, so Congress must act to guarantee strong funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund for years to come."

Wisconsin has received more than $200 million in LWCF funding over the past five decades, protecting and providing public access to places like the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, the Ice Age National Scenic Trail, the North Country Scenic Trail, the St. Croix National Scenic River and the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.

Senator Baldwin has long advocated for investing in the LWCF. Last year, she worked with a bipartisan group of Senators to permanently reauthorize LWCF.
