U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Applauds U.S. Navy's Selection of Wisconsin to Build New Ships


U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin released the following statement applauding the U.S. Navy's announcement today that Wisconsin's Fincantieri Marinette Marine shipyard has been selected to build a class of up to 10 multimission guided-missile frigates (FFGs) for the Navy's FFG(X) program.

"I take great pride in representing Wisconsin's shipbuilding industry because our workers have helped sustain America's security for generations, boasting a successful history of building ships for our nation's defense," said Senator Baldwin. "This is a big win for our Made in Wisconsin economy right now and it will support thousands of skilled workers at the Marinette Marine shipyard and bring an additional 1,000 jobs to Marinette as the Navy quickly moves forward with construction of the Frigate."
