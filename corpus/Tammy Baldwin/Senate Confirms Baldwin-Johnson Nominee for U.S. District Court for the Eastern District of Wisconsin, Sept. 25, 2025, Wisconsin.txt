“The people of Wisconsin deserve to have qualified, experienced, impartial judges working for them – and I am confident that’s just what we will get with Byron Conway. I was proud to work with Senator Johnson to stand up our bipartisan nominating commission and earn the support from both Democrats and Republicans alike in the Senate. Byron Conway has a proven track record and temperament for this position, and I look forward to seeing him faithfully serve Wisconsin’s Eastern District with fairness and distinction."
