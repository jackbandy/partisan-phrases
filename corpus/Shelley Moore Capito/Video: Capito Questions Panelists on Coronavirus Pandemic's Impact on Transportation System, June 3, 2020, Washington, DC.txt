Video: Capito Questions Panelists on Coronavirus Pandemic's Impact on Transportation System


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today participated in a full committee hearing titled, "The State of Transportation and Critical Infrastructure: Examining the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic." The hearing focused on the impact that COVID-19 has had on surface transportation and the supply chain.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown our country in to unprecedented times. The members of our nation's surface transportation system have been at the forefront ensuring critical supplies and resources get delivered around the country. Thankfully, the support we were able to provide in the CARES Act, especially through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), and the regulatory responses taken by federal agencies have helped support the economic recovery during this pandemic. However, we do not know how far reaching these impacts will be on our nation's transportation system in the years to come. Hearing from today's panelists helped provide me with a better understanding of the level of severity these impacts are, what is being done to mitigate the impacts, and how Congress can help in its recovery," Senator Capito said.

Senator Capito launched a page on her website to help bring current and accurate information to West Virginians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Click here to access the webpage for the latest updates and resources.
