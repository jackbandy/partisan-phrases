Manchin, Capito Announce More Than $300K for Economic Development in West Virginia


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $306,000 from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) for economic development across West Virginia.

"It is great to see the EDA supporting regional economic development across West Virginia. Especially as we battle the COVID-19 pandemic, our economy is essential for creating good paying jobs, boosting economic development, and improving the lives of all residents and businesses across the Mountain State. West Virginians are some of the hardest working people and through investments like these, West Virginians will be able to prove it. I will continue to fight for federal funding that strengthens our state and supports West Virginians through economic development," said Senator Manchin. 

"The EDA continues to be a key partner as West Virginia grows economically," Senator Capito said. "The issues that face our Eastern Panhandle differ greatly from southern West Virginia or our Ohio River Valley. I am glad to see funding headed to West Virginia to support research and economic development strategies and I remain hopeful that tangible economic gains can be made moving forward. As we navigate this difficult and uncertain time, we must work together and develop solutions that give our citizens the tools they need to be successful. Spurring economic growth and creating opportunity for West Virginians has always been a top priority of mine, and I look forward to continuing to work together with EDA through investment opportunities like these to create a better West Virginia."
