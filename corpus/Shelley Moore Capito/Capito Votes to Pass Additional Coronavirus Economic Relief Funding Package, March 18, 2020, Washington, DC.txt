Capito Votes to Pass Additional Coronavirus Economic Relief Funding Package


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today voted to pass a second emergency supplemental funding package to provide economic relief to individuals, small businesses, and families during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The measure passed the Senate on a vote of 90 to 8.

"The phase two of the emergency assistance package includes necessary aid, including testing, health supplies, and relief for workers. This bill provides important resources for individuals, families, and small businesses impacted by the coronavirus outbreak," Senator Capito said. "There's a lot of uncertainty now and in the coming weeks and months about how COVID-19 will affect not only the overall health of our country but also the economic prosperity of small businesses and the thousands of individuals working for them. Today's vote is another reassurance that the federal government will continue to respond to these concerns. Passing phase two was an important step, but it's not the only step we need to take. Moving ahead, we need to make sure we focus our efforts on providing the resources necessary to support our economy through this time by putting more money back in the pockets of hardworking West Virginians and Americans that have been impacted during this time."
