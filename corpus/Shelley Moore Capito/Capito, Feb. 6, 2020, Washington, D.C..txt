Capito, Rosen Introduce Legislation Establishing Streamlined Veterans Helpline


U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) introduced the Veterans Affairs Communications Act, legislation that would create a simple, easy-to-remember helpline for veterans to use in order to obtain information and assistance with all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) services.

"Our veterans have put their lives on the line to make sure we are able to enjoy the many freedoms we have today," Senator Capito said. "We owe it to these brave men and women to make sure they are aware of and can easily access the resources provided by the VA that they may need. This legislation will help accomplish that by creating a hotline for veterans to access important services and connect them to the proper entity within the VA, without having to call multiple phone numbers."

"Our veterans have provided so much to our communities and devoted their lives to our country, and when in need, they deserve a simple way to navigate the VA assistance available to them," said Senator Rosen. "The Veterans Assistance Hotline Act would create a short, simple phone number that would allow veterans to easily seek help and access all the critical services the VA provides. I will continue working with my colleagues on bipartisan, commonsense legislation to benefit the brave men and women who have defended our nation."
