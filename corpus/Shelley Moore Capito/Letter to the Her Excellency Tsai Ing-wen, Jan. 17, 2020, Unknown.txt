Letter to the Her Excellency Tsai Ing-wen, President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) - Inhofe, Menendez, Senators Send Letter Congratulating Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Reelection


Dear Madam President:

As members of the United States Senate Taiwan Caucus and longstanding friends of Taiwan, we write to congratulate you on your reelection as President of Taiwan. We are grateful for such a strong friendship, and we wish you success as you continue your work as an advocate for a democratic and prosperous Taiwan at the heart of a free and open Indo-Pacific region.

We also congratulate the people of Taiwan, whose determination and resilience made another free election in Taiwan possible. Despite Beijing's attempts to interfere in the election, the people of Taiwan demonstrated their commitment to the path of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. The people of Taiwan have earned the admiration of free people everywhere.

As we approach the 41st anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act, a robust U.S.-Taiwan relationship is as important as ever, and our commitment remains enduring. Taiwan serves as a critical economic and security partner for the United States, and our friendship is paramount to achieving the free and open Indo-Pacific region we both seek. We look forward to continuing to work with you and your government to advance our mutual interests in the years ahead.

Even as we celebrate Taiwan's democracy and elections, we also extend our condolences to you and the people of Taiwan on the death of General Shen Yi-ming, a friend of many of us and of the US-Taiwan partnership. We look forward to honoring his memory by continuing to strengthen our defense relationship.

Again, please accept our congratulations, and best wishes to you and the people of Taiwan.
