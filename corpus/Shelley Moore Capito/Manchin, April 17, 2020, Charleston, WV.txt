Manchin, Capito Announce $3 Million for Affordable Housing in West Virginia


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $3,000,000 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Housing Trust Fund (HTF) through the CARES Act, which was signed into law by President Trump on March 27th, to preserve and expand affordable housing options and provide assistance for low-income families in West Virginia.

"Investment in public housing is critical to the health of our communities, especially during these difficult times with economic uncertainty and record unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone deserves a roof over their heads, no matter their circumstances. When people lose jobs through no fault of their own, having access to affordable housing can help them get back on their feet. When we get through this terrible pandemic, we will show everyone that nobody works harder than West Virginians, and I will continue to fight to ensure that everyone will have the opportunity to get back on their feet and have a roof over their head," said Senator Manchin.

"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our way of life has dramatically changed. These times of great uncertainty, compounded by housing insecurity, put many West Virginians in really tough circumstances. This funding though HUD's Housing Trust Fund is an important provision in the CARES Act that provides security to families in our state who need it most. This investment coupled with local efforts, will help provide support and affordable housing in communities across our state as we begin to transition to a new phase of recovery. I will always advocate for and support West Virginians in need and will stand beside the residents of our state as we continue to battle this pandemic," said Senator Capito.
