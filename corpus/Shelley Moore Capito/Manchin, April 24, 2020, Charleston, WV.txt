Manchin, Capito Announce $1.8 Million for Hospital Improvement to Combat Coronavirus


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $1,854,974 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Coronavirus State Hospital Improvement Program for the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR).

"Healthcare providers are on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic and our rural hospitals, many of which were already running on shoestring budgets, are taking a financial hit. We can't allow any of our rural hospitals to close during this pandemic, which is why I proposed HHS alter the formula to distribute emergency funding to hospitals to include dedicated funding for rural hospitals. I will continue to fight until our healthcare providers receive the support and help they need while they are taking care of their fellow West Virginians," said Senator Manchin.

"Making sure our rural health centers and hospitals received the support they need has been an crucial focus for me as Congress has negotiated COVID-19 relief packages. Too often our rural health centers do not have the resources they need, especially during a time like this. This funding will allow them to meet the challenges associated with this virus head on and continue to assist their communities.  Additionally, this funding will help support telehealth resources in our state, a crucial component of accessible healthcare for our residents who live a considerable distance from hospitals or health centers. Recently, I spoke with FCC Commissioner Carr about the role telehealth will play in the future of medical care in West Virginia. These improvements to our medical facilities have always been a priority of mine and will continue to be as we work to make West Virginia a better, safer, and more connected state," said Senator Capito.
