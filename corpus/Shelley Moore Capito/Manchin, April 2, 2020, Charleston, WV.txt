Manchin, Capito Announce More Than $2.5 Million for Senior Services in West Virginia


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $2,571,641 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as part of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for senior services across West Virginia.

"This funding is critical to ensuring seniors in West Virginia have access to the care and essential services every citizen deserves, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic which disproportionately affects elderly West Virginians. As a state with a high senior population, we must continue to ensure that our greatest generation receives the care they need and deserve. I will always advocate for West Virginians' access to healthcare and will continue to fight for them in Washington," said Senator Manchin.

"Providing our disabled and senior citizens with access to proper health services is essential, especially during this difficult time," said Senator Capito. "These programs help strengthen the quality of care in our state and provide critical services for those who need it most. I am thankful for the continued support HHS brings to West Virginia and the resources they provide for our state health agencies."
