Capito's Subcommittee Funds More Than $131 Million for School Rebuilds


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced a $131,671,998.45 grant awarded to the state of West Virginia School Building Authority for the replacement of Richwood Middle School, Richwood High School, and Summersville Middle School damaged as a result of 2016 flooding. Funding is provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Senator Capito's Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee funds FEMA.

"Today's announcement is a long time coming for these Nicholas County schools," Senator Capito said. "Through my chairmanship, I've worked extensively with FEMA Region III Administrator MaryAnn Tierney to make sure we take care of this community and get our kids back in proper schools. I look forward to continuing working with our partners in the Administration to provide even more funds upon approval of the cost-share adjustment. This is an important step in flood recovery, and I'm glad to deliver this funding today."
