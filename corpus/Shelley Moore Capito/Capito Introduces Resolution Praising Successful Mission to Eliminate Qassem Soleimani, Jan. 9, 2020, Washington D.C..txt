Capito Introduces Resolution Praising Successful Mission to Eliminate Qassem Soleimani


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) today joined Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and 41 other Republican colleagues to introduce a resolution honoring the members of the military and intelligence community who carried out the successful mission that killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) and a designated terrorist. 

"Qassem Soleimani was a terrorist responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans," Senator Capito said. "The men and women of our military and intelligence community who worked to eliminate him deserve thanks and praise in this successful mission. President Trump should be commended for acting swiftly and decisively after months of Iranian aggression." 

The resolution is modeled on a resolution unanimously supported by the U.S. Senate in 2011, after American forces killed Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. 

Senators Capito and Cruz were joined by their colleagues U.S. Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), David Perdue (R-Ga.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). 

Earlier this week, Senator Capito released a statement on the death of terrorist Qassem Soleimani.
