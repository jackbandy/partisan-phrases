Capito Votes to Pass USMCA Trade Agreement


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) today voted in favor of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement. The agreement passed by a vote of 89-10.

"USMCA gives a 21st-century update to our trading policies with Mexico and Canada," Senator Capito said. "West Virginia had $1.5 billion worth of exports to Canada and Mexico in 2018, and this much-needed revision ensures West Virginia manufacturers and transporters are treated fairly, and robust economic growth continues in North America. President Trump kept his promise that he would improve the outdated NAFTA and put American workers first. USMCA does just that. By updating intellectual property protections, cutting red tape, and encouraging more goods to be manufactured in the United States, USMCA works for West Virginia, especially our auto, chemical, and aluminum industries." 

BACKGROUND: 

President Trump and the leaders of Canada and Mexico signed the USMCA on November 30th, 2018, and it was passed overwhelmingly by the U.S. House of Representatives in December 2019. Senator Capito is a member of three of the six committees that USMCA went through in the Senate before coming to the Senate floor for a final vote. Those committees include the Appropriations Committee, the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.
