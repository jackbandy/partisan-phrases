Manchin, Capito Announce More Than $1 Million for Maternal and Child Health Services in West Virginia


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $1,031,880 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that will support the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR) Maternal and Child Health Services programs. This funding will help DHHR maintain and strengthen their role in providing and evaluating the healthcare of women, mothers, infants, and children.

 "I am pleased that HHS is partnering with the West Virginia DHHR to provide quality healthcare to mothers and children across our state. Far too many mothers in West Virginia do not have access to affordable and quality healthcare. No family should ever have to choose between their health and their financial security. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will fight every day so that we can keep West Virginia's families strong, safe, and healthy," said Senator Manchin.

"This funding will be essential in helping our state agencies to provide aid to the women, children, and families in West Virginia that need it most," said Senator Capito. "These services are crucial to new mothers and infants of our state, and I am committed to making sure these resources are continually available. I'm glad HHS recognized the need for such aid in West Virginia, and I'm optimistic this grant will help save and improve lives."
