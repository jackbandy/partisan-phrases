Capito Applauds First Round of Funding for West Virginia COVID-19 Funding for Hospitals


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today applauded the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announcement of the first delivery of the initial funding to providers in support of the national response to the coronavirus (COVID-19). West Virginia will receive a total of $246,574,851 in funding within this first round. This funding is part of the distribution of the $100 billion provider relief fund included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act that Congress recently passed and President Donald J. Trump signed into law.

"It is my top priority to make sure everyone in our state has the resources they need to handle the effects of this pandemic. That includes our hospitals, health care professionals, and patients who are on the frontlines fighting this pandemic head-on. I am glad to see the quick delivery of these important funds to our hospitals that desperately need them. To be clear, this is only the first of several rounds of funding. As the additional funding from the CARES Act for health care providers is allocated, I will continue to make sure West Virginia's needs are met, including those of our rural health providers," Senator Capito said.
