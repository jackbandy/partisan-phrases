Manchin, Capito Announce $100K for COVID-19 Research at WVU


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $109,440 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the West Virginia University Research Corporation. This funding will be used to research how Appalachians respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to better understand how to disseminate information in similar crises in the future.

"The COVID-19 pandemic suddenly changed every West Virginian and American life. We have adjusted to new ways of living, working, and socializing. And we are all inundated with information about this pandemic from every angle," said Senator Manchin. "I am pleased that West Virginia University (WVU) will be conducting research on the effect of this crisis on Americans in rural Appalachia and how the participants change their views on the COVID-19 pandemic over time. West Virginia continues to lead in research and innovation and I am proud of WVU as they work to understand the long term effects of this virus on our society, specifically rural Appalachia."

"West Virginia's resilience has shone through as our country battles the COVID-19 pandemic, and I could not be more proud of our residents," Senator Capito said. "Too often, West Virginia is forgotten in the data points of larger research projects, so I am happy to see this study focus on Appalachia specifically. Information gathered from this project will help strengthen the research capabilities of WVU and better prepare West Virginia for the future."
