Manchin, Capito Announce More Than $300,000 for Senior Corps Organizations in West Virginia


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced a grant of $302,661 through the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) for West Virginia Senior Corps organizations. This funding will create opportunities for citizens 55 and older to use their skills and experience to better their communities through a multitude of service projects.

"Our senior citizens are one of the best resources to educate the future generations of West Virginia. This funding will help our citizens provide academic tutoring, mentoring, disaster relief support, and more for the Charleston and Summersville communities. I am glad to see the CNCS investing in our senior members to ensure that their knowledge isn't lost for the next generation," said Senator Manchin.

"I am encouraged by the effort of Senior Corps in our state and the support they are receiving through the CNCS," said Senator Capito. "Programs such as this directly benefit both the lives of those who are underserved in our communities, as well as the volunteers who graciously give their time, energy, and experience for those in need. As West Virginians, we are always ready to lend a helping hand and work together to build one another up. I am thankful that Senior Corps and the CNSC has recognized this aspect of our culture and look forward to the progress made with this funding."
