Capito's Subcommittee Provides Additional Funds for Flood Mitigation


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced a $1,922,410 grant to Wood County for the acquisition and demolition of 11 flood-prone residential structures impacted by severe storms, flooding, and landslides. Funding is provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) and the federal government share is 100 percent of the project cost. FEMA is funded through Senator Capito's Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, and she most recently spoke with FEMA Administrator Gaynor last week where she reiterated her focus on recovery efforts.

"As we continue to rebuild from the devastating 2016 flooding, it is important to keep in mind possible future disasters," Chairman Capito said. "I am pleased to see another project that I am able to support through my chairmanship, especially one that enables residents in the floodplain in Happy Valley along the Little Kanawha River to have the opportunity to seek safer residences, reducing potential future loss of life and property. I will continue to work with FEMA to see that West Virginia not only receives necessary funds to rebuild our communities, but also resources to take critical mitigation measures for our future."
