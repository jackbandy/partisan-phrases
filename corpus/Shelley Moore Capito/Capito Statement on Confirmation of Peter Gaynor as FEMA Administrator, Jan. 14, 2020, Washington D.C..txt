Capito Statement on Confirmation of Peter Gaynor as FEMA Administrator


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, today released the below statement after voting to confirm Peter Gaynor as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator:

"I've had the chance to meet with Mr. Gaynor personally, and I am confident that he will continue to be a strong partner in our efforts to address some of the most pressing issues facing our state. He has the qualifications and experience, and understands the important role that FEMA plays in West Virginia, especially after the 2016 floods that devastated so many communities. I'm encouraged by his emphasis on preparedness. I look forward to continuing working with him in his confirmed role as FEMA Administrator."

In April 2019, then-FEMA Acting Administrator Gaynor testified before the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee at Senator Capito's invitation.
