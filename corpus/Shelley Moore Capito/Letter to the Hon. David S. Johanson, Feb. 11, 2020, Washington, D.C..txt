Letter to the Hon. David S. Johanson, Chairman of the International Trade Commission - Capito, Colleagues Send Letter to International Trade Commission Urging Proper Enforcement of Trade Laws


Dear Chairman Johanson,

We write in regards to the challenges facing the kitchen cabinet industry in the United States. American manufacturers of kitchen cabinets, which collectively employ more than 250,000 Americans, have been suffering the impact of illegal Chinese dumping on American markets.

Some estimates have found that the American cabinet industry has suffered as much as $4 billion in harm as a result of China's unfair trade practices. Furthermore, the dumping margins of some of these products have exceeded 200 percent.

When foreign countries are allowed to take these actions, workers and their families right here at home are harmed. Data from the International Trade Commission's preliminary investigation into Chinese cabinet dumping found that the domestic cabinet industry pays an hourly wage of $17.20. Workers who hold these jobs are able to make meaningful contributions to communities large and small across our country. The loss of a kitchen cabinet manufacturer has an outsized impact in small-town America, which is already struggling with a weakened farm economy.

Without action, Chinese cabinet imports -- which are up more than 75 percent since 2015 -- are bound to continue increasing. The Commission's unanimous agreement at the affirmative preliminary injury vote this past April underscores the gravity of the situation.

We appreciate the Commission's work on this issue and encourage the Commission to fairly enforce our trade laws.
