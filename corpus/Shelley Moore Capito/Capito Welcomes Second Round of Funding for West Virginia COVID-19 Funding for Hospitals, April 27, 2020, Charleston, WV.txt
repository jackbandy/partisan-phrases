Capito Welcomes Second Round of Funding for West Virginia COVID-19 Funding for Hospitals


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is releasing half of the second round of funding to providers in support of the national response to the coronavirus (COVID-19). West Virginia will receive a total of $34,175,203 in funding within this half of the second round. This funding is part of the distribution of the original $100 billion provider relief fund included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act that Congress passed and President Donald J. Trump signed into law. West Virginia received a total of $246,574,851 in funding within the first round of funding.

"I'm glad to see additional funding going to our West Virginia hospitals so they can continue their hard work to battle this pandemic," Senator Capito said. "Making sure our hospitals have the equipment and resources they need is essential to getting our communities healthy. Again, this funding is only half of the second round and is not the last round from the CARES Act. In addition, with the passage of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) deal, another $75 billion will be available to hospitals after the CARES Act funding is exhausted. There continues to be strong, bipartisan support and personal gratitude for our healthcare workers during this time. I'm optimistic this continued funding will help them do their jobs more safely and efficiently."
