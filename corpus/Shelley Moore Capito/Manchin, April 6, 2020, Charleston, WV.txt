Manchin, Capito Announce $3.7 Million For Greenbriar Valley Airport


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $3,758,289 from the Department of Transportation (DOT) Essential Air Service (EAS) Program for the Greenbrier Valley Airport to continue its partnership with SkyWest Airlines, Inc. to provide Greenbrier and White Sulphur Springs with United Express Jet Service through 12 round trip flights per week to Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD) and Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD).

"Air travel is critical for economic growth and West Virginia's tourism industry. Ensuring that West Virginia has reliable air travel allows more visitors to travel to our state and will create new economic opportunities through our state's aerospace and tourism industries. As a member of the Senate Appropriations, I will always fight for funding that maintains service at our airports and grows our economy," said Senator Manchin.

"The partnership between SkyWest and the Greenbrier Valley Airport is great news for our state, especially the Greenbrier Valley Region," Senator Capito said. "This will not only create an economic boost in our state, but also provides an opportunity for our residents to use local options when traveling to the Washington and Chicago metro areas. I am thankful for DOT's investment in West Virginia and look forward to the positive outcomes of this decision.
