Capito Memorial Day Statement


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) today issued the following statement ahead of the Memorial Day holiday on Monday:

"As West Virginians, we understand the honor in service to our country. Many West Virginians, past and present, have answered this call of duty, and my thoughts are with the families of those who have given the ultimate sacrifice. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I understand with humble awareness the cost of the freedom that we enjoy every day. While this Memorial Day will be honored differently than in years past, it is still as important as ever to honor the brave men and women of the United States Armed Services. As we gather in spirit on Memorial Day, I encourage West Virginians to use this time to reflect upon the sacrifices made by our armed forces and their families. I encourage everyone to take the time to remember those who lost their lives serving our nation, and thank those who have served in our country's military. Their sacrifices have not gone unnoticed, and we are forever grateful."
