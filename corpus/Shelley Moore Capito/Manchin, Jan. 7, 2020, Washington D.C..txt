Manchin, Capito applaud FAA decision to continue 24 hour Air Traffic Control operations at Yeager airport


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) today applauded the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) decision to continue 24 hour Air Traffic Control operations at the Yeager Airport. In October, the FAA released a memo with the proposal to cut 24 hour Air Traffic Control operations at Yeager Airport.

"The FAA announcement that Yeager Airport will continue their 24 hour Air Traffic Control operations is great news for Charleston and West Virginia and I applaud their decision. Senator Capito and I have been working with the Kanawha County Commission to advocate for the FAA to maintain 24 hour operations at Yeager. I am glad they listened and will continue to support the great work of Yeager's Air Traffic Control team. While this is great news for Yeager, I know this fight is not over and I will work with the FAA to ensure that the Huntington Tri-State Airport will also keep their operations to provide support and security across our region as well," said Senator Manchin.

"As our state's largest airport, Yeager plays a key role in our economy and is relied on by thousands of West Virginians each year," Senator Capito said. "Since my office became aware of FAA's proposal to possibly limit the operating hours of Yeager's Air Traffic Control Tower, I immediately expressed concern and remained on top of the issue with both the FAA and Yeager. I am glad that the FAA ultimately decided to not move ahead with this proposal, which would have disrupted service and impacted our state's economy."

"Yeager Airport (CRW) is so very thankful for the leadership of Senator Manchin and his hardworking staff--acting quickly with Senator Capito and the Kanawha County Commission to reach a resolution before this became a much bigger issue," said Yeager Airport Director Nick Keller.
