Manchin, Capito Announce $23 Million for Child Care and Development Support in West Virginia During COVID-19 Pandemic


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $23,161,653 for vulnerable populations across West Virginia in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. These Child Care and Development Block Grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Children and Families is made available through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) that was signed into law on Friday, March 27. This funding will be given directly to states and will support access to childcare and childcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"With schools closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many working parents are forced to choose between caring for their children or going to work. No parent should have to make that decision, which is why it is critical that we provide support for child care across our state so that essential workers can continue to care for West Virginians in need. Every essential worker should have access child care and I will continue to fight for the people of West Virginia to get the services they need during these difficult times," said Senator Manchin.  

"Childcare professionals across our country have courageously stepped up during this time, especially in West Virginia. The challenges that face childcare providers are emphasized in rural states like ours, which makes this support even more important," said Senator Capito. "These funds will also be able to support our first responders and essential work force organizations with child care services. We must continue to ensure that the necessary resources are provided for our childcare professionals and facilities, so that they can do their jobs effectively and safely."
