Manchin, Capito Announce More Than $3.4 Million for Americorps in West Virginia


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $3,481,390 from the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to support around 130 AmeriCorps members across West Virginia.

"West Virginians are some of the most giving people and are always willing to help their neighbor in times of need. AmeriCorps volunteers serve across our state and become a part of our communities, supporting where they are needed and providing a helping hand. They work in schools and community centers across our state and come to love the Mountain State just as much as we do. I am a proud supporter of the AmeriCorps program and look forward to seeing the great work the volunteers in West Virginia do while they call our beautiful state home," said Senator Manchin.

"A sense of community and a desire to help one another is at the core of our identities as West Virginians, which makes AmeriCorps a great partner for service projects in our state," said Senator Capito. "This funding will support volunteers in projects that help combat unemployment, educational roadblocks, and substance use in our state. Community projects are a great force in West Virginia and help make our home a better place. I am thankful for the continued support AmeriCorps provides for our communities and look forward to seeing all the lives that will be impacted as a result of this funding."

Every year, 75,000 AmeriCorps members serve through 21,000+ schools, nonprofits, and community and faith-based organizations across the country. AmeriCorps members help communities recover after disasters, fight the opioid epidemic, tutor and mentor young people, connect Veterans to jobs, care for seniors, reduce crime and revive cities, and meet other critical needs. AmeriCorps is funded by the CNCS, the federal agency for volunteering and service, and recently marked its 25th anniversary. Since AmeriCorps began in 1994, more than 1.1 million AmeriCorps members have served the nation, providing more than 1.6 billion hours of service and earning nearly $4 billion in education awards to pay for college or pay back student loans.
