Capito, Colleagues Condemn House of Representatives for Withholding Articles of Impeachment


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) today introduced a Senate Resolution demanding that the Speaker of the House immediately transmit the two Articles of Impeachment against President Trump to the Senate.

The resolution criticizes Speaker Nancy Pelosi for claiming "the power to effectively veto a resolution passed by a duly elected majority of the House of Representatives," and notes that the refusal to forward the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is a "gross infringement on the constitutional authority of the Senate to try impeachment."

"In the United States Senate, we cannot move forward until Speaker Pelosi sends the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate," Senator Capito said. "House Democrats argued that impeachment was an emergency and they needed to act quickly, yet they have delayed this process for weeks. It makes no sense. By sitting on the articles, Speaker Pelosi is proving to the American people that this has been about political games from the beginning. Nothing is accomplished by delaying this process further, so I urge the Speaker to do her job and send the articles to the Senate so we can begin this process."

26 Republican Senators have signed on to the resolution.
