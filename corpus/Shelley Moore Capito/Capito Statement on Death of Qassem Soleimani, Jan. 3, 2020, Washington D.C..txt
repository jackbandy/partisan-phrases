Capito Statement on Death of Qassem Soleimani


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) today released the below statement regarding the death of Qassem Soleimani:

"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is a terrorist organization, and Qassem Soleimani has been a leader of the world's greatest state sponsor of terrorism. There is no question that Soleimani is responsible for the murders of many Americans, and he was actively plotting to kill more. Scores of U.S. soldiers died or were seriously wounded in Iraq by the IED weapons that he was responsible for. Iran has been escalating tensions for months now, most recently sponsoring the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, and yesterday's action demonstrated that Iranian terrorism will not be tolerated."
