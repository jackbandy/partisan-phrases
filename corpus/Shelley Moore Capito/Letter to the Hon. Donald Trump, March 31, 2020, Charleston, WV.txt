Letter to the Hon. Donald Trump, President of the United States - WV Delegation Sends Letter to President Trump in Support of Governor Justice's Disaster Declaration Request


Dear Mr. President:

These are challenging times for our nation, and for our beloved West Virginia. As such, we write in support of Governor Jim Justice and his request for an expedited major disaster declaration for the state of West Virginia as a result of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

On March 30, 2020, Governor Jim Justice requested aid under the provisions of Section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 5121-5207 and implemented by 44 CFR 206.36 following your declaration of a National Emergency on March 13, 2020.

Though West Virginia was the last state to have its first reported case in the country, we see how fast this virus can spread. In a short time, we went from zero cases to over 100. Governor Justice declared West Virginia in a State of Emergency on March 13, 2020. 

At this time, West Virginia has 145 positive cases and one death as we continue to perform and analyze thousands of tests. This declaration will support that testing system, enhance our national guard assets, and support critical efforts such as ensuring children who would normally be in school are receiving food. 

It is our goal to support and help you in your efforts to contain this virus and to ensure the health and safety of our fellow citizens. We have a lot to do together and this declaration enables us to achieve the greatest impact for the largest number of people in the fastest way possible. 

We appreciate your prompt consideration of this request.
