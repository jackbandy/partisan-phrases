Capito Visits Yeager Airport


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) today visited Yeager Airport in Charleston where she met with administrative staff, Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel, and trainees, and toured several facilities at the airport. Senator Capito's visit comes after the recent announcement that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will continue 24-hour air traffic control operations at Yeager Airport.

"Yeager Airport is an economic engine in the Kanawha Valley and is vital infrastructure for not only Charleston, but for the entire state," Senator Capito said. "Prior to today's visit, I had worked closely with the FAA and Yeager to make sure the ATC tower has the 24-hour coverage that is very much needed for many reasons including safety and military reasons. The ATC operations are so important to this airport, and I am thrilled Yeager can continue these normal operating hours, which will provide support and security across the region."
