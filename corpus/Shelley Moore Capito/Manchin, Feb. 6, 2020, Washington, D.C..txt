Manchin, Capito Announce $339,000 for Undergraduate Astrophysics Research in Appalachia


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $339,477 to support research experiences for eight undergraduate students from the greater Appalachian area. Students will have the opportunity to examine a range of subjects in the fields of astronomy and physics. The award comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and is jointly funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Division of Physics (PHY).

"We all know that West Virginia University (WVU) is a world class research institution, and its partnership with the Green Bank Observatory and the National Science Foundation (NSF) has been especially rewarding. As a result, West Virginia scientists are at the forefront of astrophysics research. Just last year, astronomers at the Green Bank Telescope detected the most massive neutron star ever observed. The work at WVU and Green Bank continues to make all of us West Virginians proud and I am excited that this funding will help educate and train the next generation of scientists in our state," Senator Manchin said.

"Experience in STEM fields is an essential aspect to the education of our youth and the advancement of Appalachian communities," said Senator Capito. "With this grant, students from across West Virginia will have access to our Green Bank Observatory facility and professional development mentoring though advisors at WVU. I am thrilled NSF is providing our students with the opportunity to be on the cutting edge of astrophysics, and I know grants like this will help prepare our state and its youth for the future."
