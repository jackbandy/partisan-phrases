Manchin, Capito Announce $6 Million for Senior Support Services in West Virginia Communities Amid Coronavirus Outbreak


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $6 million for communities across West Virginia to aid older adults and individuals with disabilities in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Community Living (ACL) received additional funding in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) that was signed into law on Friday, March 27. Specifically, these grants will fund home-delivered meals, in-home care services, services to families and caregivers, and support to centers for independents living across West Virginia.

"West Virginians always take care of each other. During these difficult times, we must continue to do everything possible to make sure that every West Virginian is taken care of, especially our senior citizens who are more vulnerable and at a high risk of experiencing complications due to COVID-19. It is crucial that we take care of our neighbors who must stay at home to keep them as safe as possible, and I will continue to fight for funding to ensure they receive the care and support they deserve," said Senator Manchin.   

"As our state responds to the COVID-19 pandemic, one of our central focuses has been to protect our at-risk population. Services that these grants will provide such as delivered meals, respite care, and additional support for caretakers is a crucial aspect of that goal. As we enter a new phase in our pandemic response, we must make certain that necessary resources are available to West Virginians and that additional provisions are made for our older residents and those with pre-existing conditions. I will continue to advocate for funding to our communities and state centers for independent living," said Senator Capito.
