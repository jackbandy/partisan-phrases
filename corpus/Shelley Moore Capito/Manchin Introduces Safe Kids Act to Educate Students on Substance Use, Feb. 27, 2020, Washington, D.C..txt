Manchin Introduces Safe Kids Act to Educate Students on Substance Use


U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today introduced the Saving America's Future by Educating (SAFE) Kids Act of 2020. The SAFE Kids Act directs the Department of Education along with several health agencies to develop evidence-based, age appropriate curriculum on the negative impacts of substance use -- including but not limited to opioids, tobacco, and vaping. This legislation also establishes a competitive grant program for states to implement the curriculum in public schools. More information on the SAFE Kids Act can be found here.

"The opioid epidemic has ravaged our nation and our state. Families have been destroyed, tens of thousands of lives have been lost, and an entire generation is starting their lives at a disadvantage because of this terrible crisis. We must do better for our future generations. In high schools across America, 1 out of 8 seniors reported using prescription opioids recreationally. Of those seniors, 7 out of 10 also used another substance like marijuana or alcohol. That is unacceptable, which is why I am introducing the SAFE Kids Act to create a curriculum to educate our students on these dangers. I believe education and awareness are the keys to preventing substance use misuse and abuse in the next generation and ensuring the next generation of West Virginians and Americans aren't burdened by this awful epidemic," said Senator Manchin.
