U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $15,670,945 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for Head Start programs across West Virginia.

"We know early childhood education is a significant indicator of future educational success and Head Start programs provide West Virginia's children important building blocks. I'm pleased to see this funding awarded and know it will have a real impact on the children who benefit from it. As a member of the Senate Appropriations committee, I will continue to secure funding that will give our children every opportunity to be successful," said Senator Manchin.

"A solid educational foundation opens countless doors in life," Senator Capito said. "I'm glad to see this funding come in support of our Head Start programs in southern West Virginia that will prepare young West Virginians for a lifetime of learning. Providing educational resources to our children in West Virginia will help prepare them for the future and set them on a path towards success. As a Head Start champion, I will continue to advocate for our state's Head Start programs and make sure they receive the support they need."
