Capito Statement on House Delivery of the Articles of Impeachment


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) today released the below statement following the delivery of the two Articles of Impeachment against President Donald J. Trump to the Senate: 

"After a long and useless delay, Speaker Pelosi has finally delivered the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate. Now that the articles have been delivered, the Senate can move forward. By delaying the process, Speaker Pelosi confirmed that this impeachment is a partisan political exercise. Leader McConnell has been very clear from the beginning that the Senate will follow the procedure that was used in the Clinton Impeachment trial, and that is that senators will have the opportunity to hear opening arguments from both sides first and then we will decide if we need additional witnesses. 

"West Virginians have made it clear to me time and time again that they would rather Congress focus on working on behalf of the American people on issues that really matter, and I agree. The Senate will promptly begin performing its constitutional duty to sit as a court of impeachment and then get back to working for the American people." 

Last week, Senator Capito join 26 other Republican senators in introducing a Senate Resolution demanding that Speaker Pelosi immediately transmit the two Articles of Impeachment against President Trump to the Senate.
