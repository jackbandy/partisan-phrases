Capito Statement on Coronavirus Supplemental Funding


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today voted in favor of the emergency supplemental funding package to help states treat, prevent, and prepare for the Coronavirus. The funding package passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 1.

"With this additional funding, our country is even more prepared to limit the spread of the coronavirus, test those showing symptoms, and treat those suffering. The federal government has organized a comprehensive, expansive response to this public health emergency, and the funding my colleagues and I approved today will help states continue efforts to keep their communities safe. At the same time, while these are critical funds that will help states and agencies, we must remain vigilant and adapt as we move forward. This is an issue I continue to be very focused on, and I will continue to monitor and encourage coordination and communication between agencies at the federal level," Senator Capito said.

A portion of the funding provided for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is specifically tied to the FY2019 Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) grant awards for states and localities. In West Virginia, this means the state will receive at least $5 million in funding.
