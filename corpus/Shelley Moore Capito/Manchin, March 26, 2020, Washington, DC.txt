Manchin, Capito Announce $1.7 Million for Coronavirus Response at West Virginia Health Centers


U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $1,739,288 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the coronavirus response across West Virginia through the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2020 which President Trump signed into law on March 6th.

"In a rural state like West Virginia, health centers play a vital role in our healthcare system and right now they are essential to testing, treating, and containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic while also caring for those West Virginians affected. I've heard directly from West Virginia healthcare professionals that they need additional equipment such as masks, gowns, and ventilators so they can be safe while caring for those in need. I am glad our health centers are receiving this funding and will continue to fight for more support for our state and our medical professionals," said Senator Manchin. 

"From the beginning of this pandemic, the priority has been to get the necessary resources to our health care providers as quickly as possible. These resources are essential to ensuring they are able to safely and effectively help those in West Virginia who may have contracted COVID-19 to help prevent further spread in our state. I am grateful to see this first round of funding coming to West Virginia so quickly, but even more so for our brave health care professionals and volunteers on the front lines of this outbreak. We are continuing to monitor our state's situation and stand ready to continue to aid our healthcare providers," said Senator Capito.
