EPA Announces Regulation of PFAS in Drinking Water Based on Capito Legislation


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a leader on the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, today applauded the announcement that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will propose Safe Drinking Water Act regulatory determinations for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in drinking water. Senator Capito has been aggressively pushing the EPA to set this standard, introducing several pieces of legislation and talking with EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler personally on the subject several times.

"Setting drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS has been a legislative priority of mine for years, including in leading bipartisan legislation to require them," Senator Capito said. "I applaud the EPA and Administrator Wheeler for starting the process to finally regulate these legacy "forever' chemicals and provide Americans the certainty that the water they drink, cook and wash with, and bathe in is free of these harmful compounds. West Virginia is all too familiar with the challenges of PFAS contamination, and now communities around the country are realizing they also have challenges from PFAS pollution. Setting maximum contaminant levels for these two compounds is an essential step in addressing this human health and environmental issue and I look forward to continuing to work with the EPA to ensure standards are robust, scientifically-driven, and issued in a timely fashion."
