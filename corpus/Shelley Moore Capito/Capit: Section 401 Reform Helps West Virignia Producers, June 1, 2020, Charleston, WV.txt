Capit: Section 401 Reform Helps West Virignia Producers, Supports American Energy Independence


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a leader on the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, today issued the following statement after the White House announced a new policy concerning Section 401 of the Clean Water Act: 

"Section 401 of the Clean Water Act has been abused by liberal state governments for years to politically attack the fossil fuel industry," Senator Capito said. "The policy announced today means West Virginia producers could finally have a fair shot at selling affordable natural gas to consumers in New England and elsewhere around the country. The result of states like New York blocking new pipeline construction is that our fellow Americans must pay more for dirtier foreign energy, such as polluting fuel oil, often from hostile regimes like Russia. Doing this when our country is so energy rich is nonsensical, wasteful, expensive, and hurts our economy, our environment, and American workers. I'm glad the Trump administration is standing up for American energy independence and putting a stop to the political gamesmanship around Section 401."
