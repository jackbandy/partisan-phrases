Capito Announces Additional COVID-19 Funding for West Virginia Hospitals


U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and President Donald Trump's Congressional Economic Task Force, today applauded that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announcement of additional funding to providers in support of the national response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. West Virginia will receive a total of $159,588,044 in funding within the targeted allocation to rural hospitals. This funding is part of the distribution of the original $100 billion provider relief fund included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act that Congress passed and President Trump signed into law. In the first half of the second round of funding, West Virginia received $34,175,203.

"This announcement, which includes $10 billion specifically for rural medical providers, shows the Trump administration's continuing to support our rural communities," Senator Capito said. "We're continuing to ensure our hospitals have the funds they need to protect their employees and treat patients. With the passage of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) deal recently, hospitals can expect another $75 billion to be available to them after the CARES Act funding is exhausted. The federal response for health care providers remains strong, and I'm glad our West Virginia hospitals are getting another boost of support."
