Recognizing and Thanking Nate Soule


Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank someone  whose impact on my office and on me personally cannot be overstated, my  chief of staff, Nate Soule, as he concludes his service to New York's  17th Congressional District.

When I first ran for the New York State Assembly in 2020, before  there was a congressional office or a seat in this Chamber, Nate took a  leap of faith and helped build a campaign from the ground up. Together,  we delivered a victory many said was impossible, defeating an incumbent  in a district with a 2-1 Democratic enrollment advantage. That race was  the foundation for everything that has followed.

In Albany, Nate served as my chief of staff and helped lead one of  the most active offices in the State assembly. Our team delivered real  results for the Hudson Valley and built a reputation for being  accessible, responsive, and relentless when it came to constituent  services.

When I was elected to Congress, Nate once again stepped up, first as  deputy chief of staff and communications director and now as my chief  of staff. Through every transition, he has brought discipline, sound  judgment, and an unwavering commitment to the people we serve.

Nate understands that public service is not about titles or  headlines. It is about doing the work, telling the truth, and  delivering for the people who sent us here. His counsel is steady and  measured, his loyalty unwavering, and, above all, his friendship  cherished.

Through Nate's vision, his hard work, and his invaluable leadership,  our office has not only been more effective but has set a standard for  what public service can and should be. I have no doubt that he will  bring the same integrity and dedication as he embarks on a new chapter.  Doina and I wish Nate and his wife, Lauren, the very best.               Honoring the Life of Anthony ``Tony'' DeFeciani

Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Anthony  ``Tony'' DeFeciani, who passed away peacefully on December 23, 2025.

Born and raised in Haverstraw, Tony was a proud New Yorker, attending  Haverstraw High School and participating in the marching band, where he  was voted the most musical in his senior year.

Following graduation, Tony enlisted in the United States Navy and  proudly served during the Korean war. He was awarded the Bronze Star  after more than 30 years of service. Returning home, Tony worked at  Bear Mountain, Lederle Laboratories, and New York Telephone/Verizon,  retiring after 30 years of professional service.

Tony also gave back to his community as a volunteer firefighter with  the Haverstraw Fire Department Relief Hose Company No. 3 for 60 years,  serving as fire chief.

Tony was an avid gardener and fisherman, built his own boat, and ran  Rainbow Gardens, known locally for its tomatoes.

A devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, Tony  shared 66 years of wonderful marriage with his beloved wife, Joan.  Together, they raised six children. He cherished every moment with his  family and community and will be deeply missed.                      Honoring Life of Theodore Schultz

Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Theodore  ``Ted the Great'' Schultz, who passed away peacefully on January 10,  surrounded by his family.

Born in Nyack, Ted was raised on his grandfather's farm in Pomona and  attended Spring Valley High School, where he earned the rank of Eagle  Scout. A talented athlete, he wrestled and played football, earning the  nickname ``Tank,'' and went on to attend Illinois Wesleyan University,  where he played football for 4 years and later earned his MBA from  Washington University.

It was at Illinois Wesleyan that Ted met his wife, Carol. They  settled in Pearl River, New York, where they raised their children,  Traci and Craig, before later moving to Stony Point.

Ted built a remarkable career at Ted Schultz Auto Sales, relocating  the dealership to Nanuet and growing it into a nationally ranked Ford  dealership while earning numerous President's Awards.

Beyond work, Ted enjoyed time with friends, boating on the Hudson  River, and spending time with his grandchildren. His legacy lives on  through the lessons he passed on to his family, his friends, and the  many lives he touched. May he rest in peace.                   Recognizing S.W. Johnson Fire Department

Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the S.W. Johnson  Fire Department in Rockland County on an incredible milestone of 150  years of dedicated service to our community.

Since its formation in 1876, S.W. Johnson has been 100 percent  volunteer, embodying selflessness, courage, and a commitment to  protecting our neighbors.

One of the department's most treasured pieces of history is its  steamer, a Button manufactured in 1896 by the company that would become  American LaFrance. This remarkable piece of equipment reflects the rich  legacy and enduring dedication of S.W. Johnson and the fire service  today.

I say thank you on behalf of New York's 17th Congressional District  to the many firefighters who have given their time and bravery to this  firehouse over the years. Congratulations to S.W. Johnson on 150 years  of dedicated service. Their commitment, bravery, and volunteer spirit  are an inspiration to us all.
