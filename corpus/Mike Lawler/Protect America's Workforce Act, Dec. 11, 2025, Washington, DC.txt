Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2550,  Protect America's Workforce Act.

Earlier this year, an executive order changed the collective  bargaining status of tens of thousands of Federal workers. These are  career public servants, many of them veterans, who show up every single  day to serve our country. Every American deserves a voice in the  workplace, and that includes the people who keep our government running  and open.

Ensuring collective bargaining rights strengthens our Federal  workforce and helps deliver more effective, accountable service to the  American people. We must ensure that collective bargaining agreements  already in place remain, as well as ensuring that good government goes  hand in hand with that.

Mr. Speaker, I was proud to join colleagues across the aisle as being  the 218th signature to advance this bill forward.

I thank Congressmen Fitzpatrick and Golden for leading this effort,  as well as my fellow Congressmen here, Mr. Bresnahan, as well as  Congressman LaLota, for their leadership on this front.
