Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary  service and well-earned retirement of Cardinal Timothy Michael Dolan,  whose leadership has profoundly shaped the Catholic faith in New York  and across our Nation.

Since becoming archbishop of New York in 2009, Cardinal Dolan has  been a steadfast advocate for religious freedom, Catholic education,  and the dignity of every person. He has led with conviction,  compassion, and humor, reminding us that faith must also always be  lived out through service.

Under his leadership, the Archdiocese of New York was strengthened in  meaningful ways, including the reopening of dozens of Catholic schools,  ensuring that families across our State continue to have access to  education rooted in faith, values, and community.

Beyond New York, Cardinal Dolan has become a respected national voice  for the church, guiding conversations with clarity, humor, and grace,  and bringing people together in moments of challenge and celebration  alike.

I am honored to call Cardinal Dolan a friend. While he will be deeply  missed as the leader of the Archdiocese of New York, I wish him the  very best in his retirement and have no doubt that his voice and his  witness will continue to inspire for years to come.                    Honoring Life of Alfred ``Al'' Magnatta

Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Alfred  ``Al'' Magnatta, who passed away just a week before what would have  been his 101st birthday.

At a young age, Al answered the call to serve his country during  World War II, enlisting in the U.S. Air Force. Serving as a B-17 aerial  gunner with the Eighth Air Force was an experience that forever shaped  his life.

After returning home to New York, Al continued to serve his community  by joining the Congers Fire Department, eventually serving as their  fire chief, becoming the oldest fire chief in the department's history  and its longest serving member.

Al continued to serve his community by providing leadership at the  county level, helping guide emergency response efforts, mentoring  future firefighters, and shaping fire service standards. Throughout his  decades of service, he responded to countless emergencies and earned  the respect of all who served alongside him.

Al represented the very best of our community, and I extend my  heartfelt condolences to his family, friends, and all who had the  privilege of knowing him. His legacy will never be forgotten. May he  rest in peace.                        Commending Chief Daniel Hyman

Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary  act of courage and public service by Ramapo Town Police Chief Daniel  ``Dan'' Hyman, whose quick actions saved the life of a fellow neighbor.

While off duty, Chief Hyman noticed smoke coming from a home. After  seeing a resident attempt to escape the fire, he immediately sprang  into action.

Without hesitation, he secured a ladder, climbed to the window the  resident was attempting to escape from, and calmly coached the  individual to safety. His quick thinking, bravery, and selfless action  helped save a life from what would have been a tragedy.

Chief Hyman joined the Ramapo Police Department in 1989 and has  served his community with integrity, valor, and professionalism for  more than three decades.

His actions represent the very best of public service and our  community. I commend Chief Hyman for leading by example and for  reminding us what true heroism looks like in our communities.                           Recognizing Robi Schlaff

Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary  career of Robi Schlaff, a devoted public servant who has spent her  career protecting women, children, and families across Westchester  County.

Since 2013, Robi has served as director of the Westchester County  Office for Women, overseeing critical programs that support victims of  domestic and family violence. She also serves as executive director of  the Westchester County Family Justice Center, where she helped build a  coordinated, victim-centered model that has become a statewide example.

Earlier in her career, Robi practiced family law, representing  children and survivors of domestic violence and served as a mediator in  family court. She has been instrumental in developing initiatives such  as the Domestic Violence High-Risk Team and the Pace Women's Justice  Center, earning national recognition, including the End Violence  Against Women International Game-Changer award. In addition, she worked  alongside Pete Grannis in the New York State Assembly and the  Department of Environmental Protection.

As Robi retires from her role, I am proud to recognize her unwavering  commitment to protecting our communities. Having worked with her in  County Executive Astorino's administration, I am deeply grateful for  her public service and her friendship. I wish her all the best in her  well-earned retirement.
