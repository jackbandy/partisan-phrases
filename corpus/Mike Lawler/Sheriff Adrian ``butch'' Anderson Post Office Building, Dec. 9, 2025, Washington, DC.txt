Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  legislation honoring a man whose life was defined by service,  leadership, and an unwavering commitment to his community.

Sheriff Adrian ``Butch'' Anderson dedicated more than five decades to  public safety and public service in Dutchess County, New York.

Sheriff Anderson's law enforcement career began in 1970, when he was  appointed a deputy sheriff in the Dutchess County Sheriff's Office. He  served in the uniform patrol division and was promoted to detective in  1974.

In 1983, he was elected mayor of the village of Pawling and served  for 8 years.

Sheriff Anderson was elected Dutchess County Sheriff in 1999 and  served with honor until his untimely passing on September 29, 2021,  during his sixth term.

He also served as a member of the Dutchess County GOP Executive  Committee, took on pivotal roles in New York State Sheriffs'  Association, and chaired President Trump's New York campaign in 2016.

Butch's commitment extended beyond law enforcement. He was actively  involved with community organizations, including the Make-a-Wish  Foundation of Hudson Valley, and the McElroy Children's Cancer  Foundation.

Sheriff Anderson lived a life marked by courage, integrity, and a  genuine concern for the people he served. He believed in leading from  the front, treating others with respect, and showing up for his  community every single day.

A close friend of longtime Pawling resident James Earl Jones, Sheriff  Anderson's voice was a mixture of Darth Vader and John Wayne. He had a  distinctive voice and presence, and he was a humble and gentle man.

It is, therefore, my honor to announce this legislation designating  the United States Postal Service facility located at 298 Route 292 in  Holmes, New York, as the Sheriff Adrian ``Butch'' Anderson Post Office  Building. This legislation serves as a lasting tribute to a man whose  service profoundly shaped Dutchess County for more than five decades.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Sheriff Anderson, for his  service, his sacrifice, and his unwavering commitment to Dutchess  County. His legacy will endure for generations to come.
