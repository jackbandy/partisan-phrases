Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of legislation  honoring a man whose service and leadership left a lasting mark on  Rockland County and the town of Haverstraw.

Paul Piperato dedicated more than three decades of his life to public  service, including 15 years as Rockland County clerk, where his vision  and commitment transformed county government for the better.

Paul was revered and respected across party lines. As a Rockland  County clerk, he revolutionized the office, making it more accessible  and efficient for the community that he so dearly loved.

Paul's work extended beyond his official duties, touching lives  through his involvement with numerous civic organizations, including:  Jawonio, People to People, and The ARC Rockland Foundation.

During his tenure, he modernized county services by developing a  cutting-edge computer imaging system, launching a 24-7 online records  portal, and introducing e-filing and e-recording services that improved  efficiency and accessibility for residents. His work ensured that  government functioned not just effectively but responsively, meeting  people where they are.

Paul created the highly successful veteran discount program, Return  the FAVOR, demonstrating his deep commitment to those who served our  Nation. His dedication to attending naturalization ceremonies for new  citizens reflected his profound love for our community and country,  bringing joy to those he welcomed as his fellow Americans.

His legacy as a public servant made him a pillar of Haverstraw in  Rockland County and continues to benefit residents every single day  through the programs and systems that he put in place.

It is, therefore, my honor to help introduce this legislation to  rename the United States Postal Service facility located at 86 Main  Street in Haverstraw, New York, as the Paul Piperato Post Office  Building. This designation is a meaningful appreciation for his hard  work, his leadership, and his lifelong commitment to serving others.

By renaming this post office, we ensure that future generations will  know the name of Paul Piperato, not only as a county clerk but as a  visionary public servant who worked tirelessly to improve the lives of  those who he served.
