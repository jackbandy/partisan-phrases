Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, the reason we know this is a Democratic  shutdown is because of how angry they are that we are about to reopen  the government, period. That is all you need to know.

Jerry Nadler said the shutdown is really ``an extremist policy  designed to appeal to an extremist base and hold the whole country  hostage.''

That is exactly what the Democrats have done over the last 43 days.  They have held the American people hostage, trying to extract insane  things, like free healthcare for illegal immigrants.

If they were serious about tackling the healthcare affordability  crisis in this country, then they would address the fundamental problem  with ObamaCare. Since ObamaCare took effect, healthcare premiums have  risen by 96 percent and on the open market by 114 percent.

When I asked Leader Jeffries to sign on to the 1-year extension of  the premium tax credit, he refused. He stuttered. He stammered. He  couldn't answer a single question because this shutdown was never about  healthcare. It was always about appeasing a far-left radical base.

Chuck Schumer said: Every day gets better for us.

Katherine Clark said: Of course, people will suffer. We want to use  this as leverage.

It is an embarrassment to this country. You should all be ashamed of  yourselves for inflicting this pain on the American people, taking away  food stamps from 42 million Americans, defunding WIC, and not paying  our troops, our Federal employees, and our air traffic controllers. It  is a disgrace, and you should all hang your heads in shame.

Vote ``yes'' to pass the bill and reopen the government.
