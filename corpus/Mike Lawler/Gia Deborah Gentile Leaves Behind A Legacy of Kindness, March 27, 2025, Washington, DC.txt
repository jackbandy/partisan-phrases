Gia Deborah Gentile Leaves Behind A Legacy of Kindness


Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Gia  Deborah Gentile, a remarkable young woman from Hawthorne, New York, who  tragically passed away on March 9 at just 14 years old after a brave  and tireless battle with neuroblastoma.

Though her life was far too short, Gia's legacy is one of kindness,  compassion, and selfless service. Whether it was through her role on  the student council, her leadership on the Westlake High School varsity  cheer team, or her dedication to the Service Club, Gia led by example,  always putting others before herself and inspiring those around her.

Even while facing the most difficult of challenges, Gia's heart of  gold never wavered. She continued to serve and support others,  embodying a spirit of positivity, empathy, and generosity that touched  everyone she encountered.

As her parents, Carmine and Dana, and her siblings, Jordana and Tino,  continue to grieve this unimaginable loss, we keep them in our thoughts  and prayers. Gia's memory will forever shine brightly in the hearts of  all who were blessed to know her.

May Gia rest in peace and may we all strive to live each day in the  spirit of kindness that she exemplified.
