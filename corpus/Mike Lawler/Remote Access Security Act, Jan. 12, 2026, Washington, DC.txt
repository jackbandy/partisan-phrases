Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the Remote Access  Security Act.

Mr. Speaker, export controls exist to limit critical technology  developed in the U.S. from falling into the hands of our adversaries.  Export controls are a major tool of the administration to protect  sensitive tech and bolster our own national security, and these rules  have never been more timely or important as China seeks to enhance  their chip and AI development.

Unfortunately, there is a major loophole in our export control  regime. As the laws and regulations are written, physical export  controls do not apply to remote access of items. This means that still  to this day, the CCP can access our tech through the cloud and utilize  it for their own malicious purposes. Our export controls are only as  strong as the weakest link, and right now, the CCP has a real tool to  sidestep these prohibitions. We need action now.

My bill defines ``remote access'' and adds remote access provisions  into existing law. It provides the Commerce Department with the  authority to regulate controlled items through the cloud and finally  close this loophole.

The Remote Access Security Act received unanimous support in the  House Committee on Foreign Affairs during markup, passing with a  bipartisan vote of 51-0.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Mast, as well as my bipartisan co- leads, Speaker Johnson, and Leader Scalise for helping to move this  bill to the floor today.

I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting this  bill in committee unanimously and certainly strongly encourage a  unanimous vote here on the floor.

We all recognize the threats we face around the globe and in  particular from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, among many other bad  actors. Our export control laws are put in place for a reason, and it  is to protect sensitive technology from getting into the hands of bad  actors.

However, when our laws were established, they did not take into  account the ever-changing technology, and so it is imperative that we  as a Congress act with urgency to update our laws and ensure that  China, Russia, Iran, and others do not have access to sensitive  technology remotely. That is why this bill is imperative, and I  encourage all of my colleagues to vote in the affirmative.

Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
