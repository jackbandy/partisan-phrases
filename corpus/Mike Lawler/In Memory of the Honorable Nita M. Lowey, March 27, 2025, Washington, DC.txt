Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the remarkable career  and lasting legacy of Congresswoman Nita Lowey. As the first woman to  chair the House Appropriations Committee, she shattered barriers and  paved the way for so many others during her 32 years in the House of  Representatives.

Nita was a tireless advocate for the Hudson Valley, and she was  committed to getting things done on behalf of her community. Along with  Congressman Latimer, we now represent portions of the district she once  served. I know I speak for George in saying that we are proud to follow  in her footsteps.

Her commitment to bipartisanship is something I have tried to carry  forward in her honor. Nita knew that real solutions come from working  across the aisle, and her ability to build consensus led to critical  investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure that benefited  New Yorkers and Americans across our country.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Nita Lowey for her extraordinary leadership and  her unwavering belief in a better future for all Americans. May her  memory be a blessing, especially for her husband, Stephen; her  children; and her beloved grandchildren.

Nita will be sorely missed.
