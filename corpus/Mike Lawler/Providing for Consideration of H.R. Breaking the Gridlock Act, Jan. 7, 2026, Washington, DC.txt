Providing for Consideration of H.R. Breaking the Gridlock Act


Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, after the 43-day Democratic-led shutdown, I  agreed to sit down with my Democratic and Republican colleagues to  negotiate in good faith to extend the ACA enhanced premium tax credit  with reforms.

We negotiated a 2-year extension with income limits, with insurance  reforms, and with the elimination of zero-premium plans. Unfortunately,  we could not get that bill to the floor for a vote, so I and three of  my other Republican colleagues felt that we had no choice but to sign  the discharge for this 3-year clean extension.

I am voting in favor of this discharge and this legislation to send  it to the Senate so that the Senate will have the opportunity to put  forth a reform package that can pass Congress and become law.

The fact is that health insurance premiums have risen 96 percent  since ObamaCare took effect in 2010, with insurance companies' profits  increasing by 2,000 percent.

Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, insurance companies' profits have increased  by 2,000 percent.

Republicans and Democrats can agree that our system is broken, and we  need to fix it. We need to work in a bipartisan way.

To me, this is two-pronged: deal with the immediacy of the enhanced  premium tax credit, and deal with the larger healthcare reform issues  that have to take effect. Enough of the blame game on both sides. Let's  focus on actually delivering affordable healthcare for Americans.
