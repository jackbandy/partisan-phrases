Recognizing Doug Kennedy


Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  career of Doug Kennedy, who is retiring after 45 years of serving  southeast Nebraska as a radio broadcaster.

Doug's service as a reporter and news director for KWBE in Beatrice  has spanned a remarkable seven different station ownerships. During  that time, his accuracy and professionalism earned the trust of his  listeners and the respect of his colleagues.

Doug's list of accolades features more than 100 awards from the  United Press International and Associated Press, and his enduring  dedication has meant so much to his community.

Described by Mayor Bob Morgan as a positive and stabilizing influence  for the city, Doug has also served several years on the City of  Beatrice Community Redevelopment Authority.

Doug's steadfast work ethic is a model of Nebraska devotion to a job  well done, and I certainly wish him a happy retirement.
