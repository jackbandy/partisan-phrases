One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the  diligent work he has done in bringing folks together, hearing from all  Members, and helping formulate a bill that is great for America and  great for workers. We know that what we did in 2017 increased wages for  workers at an amount even better proportionately than higher-income  folks.

I will also point out that my colleagues across the aisle voted for a  large portion of this bill last year.

Now, there are various criticisms that they have kind of pivoted I  guess a bit, but when you really look at what we are doing, we are  preventing a tax increase on the middle class. The average American  household, without this bill getting done, will face about a $1,500 tax  increase. American Farm Bureau tells us that the average farm will face  a more than $5,000 tax increase if we don't get our bill done.

Mr. Speaker, this is the right thing to do. This is great for  America.
