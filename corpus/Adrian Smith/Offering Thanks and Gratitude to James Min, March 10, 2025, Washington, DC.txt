Offering Thanks and Gratitude to James Min


Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I am glad to offer my thanks and  gratitude to James Min, as well.

I appreciate the fact that when I was a brand-new Member of Congress,  a while back, that he has always been a great help not just to me but  to anyone who asks. I am grateful for his selfless public service. As  was said before, I think it will last for generations. I am grateful,  and I wish him well.
