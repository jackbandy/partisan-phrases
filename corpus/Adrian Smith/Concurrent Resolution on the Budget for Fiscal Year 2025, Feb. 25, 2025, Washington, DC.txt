Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chair, the American people want us to have  a thoughtful exchange here. I will hopefully contribute to that,  especially when I hear some of the accusations made that are just off  base, misleading, and false.

Warren Buffett has paid a record amount in taxes. I think that is  worth noting. That has been in the press very widely in the last few  days.

This budget framework delivers on House Republicans' and the  President's promise to minimize tax burdens for Americans across the  income spectrum, promote security in our communities, and unleash  economic growth.

The resolution would allow us to extend the historic tax relief from  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which has been enormously successful, and we  know this, in allowing families to keep more of their paychecks and  supercharging growth for small businesses.

If these tax cuts are allowed to expire, as we have heard, the  average American would suffer. Make no mistake, small businesses,  family farms, and so many other folks would suffer.

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chair, the American people want us to have  a thoughtful exchange on this. Let's elevate the debate and stick to  the facts, realizing we can do well for the American people by doing  so.
