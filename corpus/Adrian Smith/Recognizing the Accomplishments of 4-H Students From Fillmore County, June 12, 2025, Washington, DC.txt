Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of 4-H students from Fillmore County, Nebraska. They  competed in the American Rocketry Challenge national finals last month.

Selected from over 1,000 entries from across the Nation, the students  qualified as national finalists after designing, building, flight  testing, and launching their rocket under highly specified requirements  to target an impressive 790 feet and land while keeping the rocket's  payload intact.

On May 16, I was delighted to welcome members of the club, which  calls itself the STEAM Punks, to the Rockets on the Hill event, along  with Coach Kristina Woods. Team leaders Kelsey Ellison and Ruby Long,  displayed their model, the product of a 2-month engineering process.

Through their hard work and technical excellence, these young people  have made Nebraska's Third District proud. With such dedication, they  will continue to reach even greater heights.
