Recognizing and Thanking Judge James Worden Upon His Retirement


Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  thank County Court Judge James Worden upon his retirement. A lifelong  Nebraskan, his judgeship has been evidence of his dedication to public  service.

Throughout his two-decade tenure, Judge Worden has served Nebraskans  with integrity and a profound commitment to upholding the rule of law.

Whether it was expanding others' understanding of the judicial  system, celebrating families' new beginnings through National Adoption  Day events, or demonstrating compassion in the Scotts Bluff juvenile  drug court, he exemplified a judicial career built on the conviction  that justice should be firm, fair, and just.

Judge Worden will be remembered for his strong faith and devotion to  his family and as a trusted member of his community. He is someone who  quietly led by example and generously gave his time to strengthening  the lives of others.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Judge Worden for his faithful service to the  State of Nebraska. I wish him, Joni, and his entire family all the best  in the years ahead and congratulate him on a career defined by respect,  service, and lasting impact.
