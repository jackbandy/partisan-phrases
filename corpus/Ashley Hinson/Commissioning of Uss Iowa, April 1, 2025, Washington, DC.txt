Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the commissioning of  the U.S. Navy's state-of-the-art nuclear-powered submarine, the USS  Iowa, and the brave men and women who will serve aboard her.

This vessel represents not only the strength and innovation of our  naval warfighters but also the heart and tenacity of Iowans.

Within the USS Iowa, you will find unique nods to our great State,  highlighting Iowa's agriculture, leadership in education, and  contributions to energy production.

The USS Iowa will enhance our force readiness around the world and  serve as a powerful deterrent, compelling our adversaries to maybe  think twice before attempting to destabilize the international order.

I thank the crew for their service and pray for their continued  safety.

May she always navigate with Iowa grit and return home safely.
