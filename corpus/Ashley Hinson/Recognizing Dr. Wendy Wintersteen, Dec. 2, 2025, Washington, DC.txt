Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Wendy  Wintersteen, president of Iowa State University, on her retirement next  month after more than 40 years of distinguished service.

Dr. Wintersteen has been a remarkable leader whose commitment to her  students and to the State of Iowa has left a lasting impact on the  institution. She brought the ``Innovate at Iowa State'' vision to life,  solidifying the school's role as a national leader in research and  entrepreneurship.

Under her leadership, Iowa State University has advanced cutting-edge  research to strengthen Iowa agriculture. She supported world-class  faculty and helped prepare the next generation of leaders and  innovators to solve challenges and better our State and our Nation.

My husband, Matt, an Iowa State alum, and I, of course, look forward  to many more Cyclone games and know that Dr. Wintersteen will be  cheering on the Clones for many more years to come.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Wintersteen and congratulate her on her  retirement.
