One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Ms. SANCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I flew overnight through thunderstorms and  flash flood warnings to be here to stand up for my district this  morning because Republicans refuse to stand up for theirs.

I have been in Congress for over 20 years, and I have never seen such  cowardice from my colleagues across the aisle. Time and time again, we  see Republicans fold like cheap lawn chairs.

Senator Murkowski said it was a bad bill. Then why the hell would she  vote for it?

I am here to stand up against a bill that kicks 17 million Americans  off of their healthcare, a bill that cuts school lunches and food  assistance to children who go to bed hungry every night, a bill that  includes billions of dollars for ICE, an already bloated agency that  has been upending due process and racially profiling people in my  district for weeks.

Mr. Speaker, I say to my colleagues across the aisle, have you no  decency? Have you no humanity? It is not too late to do what you know  is right by your constituents and by your country. Vote ``no'' on this  one, big, steaming pile of crap.
