Breaking the Gridlock Act


Ms. SANCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the many working  families who rely on the ACA tax credits.

Speaker Johnson should have let us vote on this bill at the end of  last year, but instead of bringing down the cost of healthcare,  groceries, or housing, Republicans are focused on protecting President  Trump while he invades foreign countries, builds golden ballrooms, and  renames monuments to himself, all while families in my district watch  their healthcare premiums double.

I will remind everyone: Republicans already kicked 15 million people  off their healthcare to pay for tax cuts for billionaires.

I urge my Republican colleagues now to do the right thing and to vote  on behalf of their constituents' interests. Vote to extend the ACA tax  credits and lower costs for America's families.
