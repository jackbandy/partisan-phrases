Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Rochester  Community Players theater group on their 100th season.

As the second oldest continually operating community theater in the  State of New York and a part of the Little Theatre Movement in America,  their rich history dates back to 1925, with their opening performance  at the Historic German House in Rochester, New York.

Today, the group performs throughout our city, providing  opportunities for local professionals to share their talents on the  stage and behind the scenes. We are blessed to have a vibrant and ever- growing artistic community in Rochester. The Rochester Community  Players have been at the helm for an entire century, a remarkable  accomplishment.

I congratulate President Michael Krickmire and Vice President Elaine  Sauer on this momentous occasion and look forward to their continued  work to uplift our local talent and provide high-quality entertainment  for years to come.
