Recognizing Lucia Colindres


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Hispanic American  Heritage Month to recognize an outstanding leader from Rochester, New  York, Lucia Colindres.

Originally from El Salvador, Lucia Colindres came to the United  States in 1989, bringing with her a spirit of resilience and service  that has defined her life's work. Since that time, she has established  herself as a beacon of light in Rochester, devoting her career to  championing equity and addressing the most pressing needs of the Latino  community.

As Chief Program Officer of the Ibero-American Action League, Lucia  leads with vision and determination, overseeing vital health  initiatives that strengthen families across the region by addressing  social determinants such as access to care, nutrition, and housing.  Previously, in senior leadership at Rochester Regional Health, she  spearheaded innovative pro-Medicaid programs that prioritized  prevention and compassion by tackling the root causes of health crises.  Through her leadership, Lucia has ensured that Latino families in  Rochester are not only supported in times of need but also empowered to  build healthier and more fulfilling lives.

Lucia's influence extends beyond institutions into the broader  community. As a founding member of the Community Health Workers  Association of Rochester, she has worked tirelessly to advance and  professionalize a workforce that is indispensable to the well-being of  families. Through every role she has held, Lucia Colindres has  exemplified what it means to lead with both vision and heart by  strengthening Rochester, uplifting families, and building a legacy of  service that will endure for generations.

It is an honor to recognize Lucia Colindres during Hispanic American  Heritage Month. Her leadership has strengthened our community, advanced  equity, and created opportunities that will endure for generations.
