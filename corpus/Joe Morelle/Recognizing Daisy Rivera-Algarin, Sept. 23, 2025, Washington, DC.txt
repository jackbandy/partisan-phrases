Recognizing Daisy Rivera-Algarin


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Hispanic American  Heritage Month to honor an extraordinary advocate from Rochester, New  York, Daisy Rivera-Algarin.

As a founding member of Latinas Unidas, Daisy Rivera-Algarin has long  recognized the vital importance of representation, equity, and cultural  pride in community leadership. When she saw that Latina voices were  underrepresented in positions of influence, she took bold action,  bringing together a group of Latina activists to chart a new path  forward by creating Latinas Unidas. Today, the organization stands as a  powerful testament to her vision of uplifting Latina women, connecting  them with the tools and opportunities needed to thrive, and celebrating  the enduring richness of their cultural heritage.

Daisy's leadership was also instrumental in creating La Marketa,  serving as a vibrant marketplace and community gathering space where  food, art, and culture unite. More than just a place to shop, La  Marketa serves as a beacon of Rochester's Hispanic community, honoring  traditions and offering a cultural home where generations can come  together to celebrate their shared identity. It is a living legacy of  Daisy's belief that culture is not only to be preserved but to be  celebrated openly and proudly.

For nearly 25 years, Daisy carried this same commitment into public  service through her work with Rochester city government. She began as a  Business Development Associate and rose to become Director of  Neighborhood Service Centers, where she worked tirelessly to ensure  that residents had both a voice and a champion in City Hall. In 2024,  her leadership and dedication were recognized with the NYS Women of  Distinction Award. Across every role, Daisy combined professional  expertise with a cultural perspective and compassion deeply rooted in  her heritage.

It is a privilege to recognize Daisy Rivera-Algarin during Hispanic  American Heritage Month. Her dedication to public service has made an  immeasurable impact on our community and will continue to inspire  future generations.
