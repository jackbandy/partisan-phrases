Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Hispanic American  Heritage Month to pay tribute to a distinguished community leader from  Rochester, New York, Padron-Morales.

As co-founder of Hipocampo Children's Bookstore, Henry Padron-Morales  has created a space that celebrates culture, diversity, and the power  of literacy. Rooted in his Puerto Rican heritage, his vision and  leadership have fostered a love of reading while amplifying voices that  too often go unheard. Through this work, Henry has become a trusted  advocate for inclusivity and cultural pride in our community.

Henry's commitment to justice and community leadership began at an  early age and has remained a guiding force throughout his life. He  helped establish organizations such as the Puerto Rican Youth  Development and Resource Center and the Spanish Action Coalition, and  he was involved in the first Puerto Rican Festival in Rochester, New  York. At the heart of his activism has always been a dedication to  ensuring that marginalized voices are heard and that his community has  a meaningful seat at the table.

Alongside his advocacy, Henry devoted 34 years to the Rochester City  School District, most of them as a beloved kindergarten teacher. In his  dual-language classrooms, he cultivated environments where children of  all backgrounds could learn together, honor one another's cultures, and  see themselves reflected in their education. Through his teaching,  Henry inspired countless young people to embrace their identities and  take pride in their heritage.

It is with great pride and admiration that I recognize Henry Padron- Morales this Hispanic American Heritage Month. His steadfast dedication  to youth empowerment and cultural celebration uplifts Rochester and  serves as an enduring inspiration for future generations.
