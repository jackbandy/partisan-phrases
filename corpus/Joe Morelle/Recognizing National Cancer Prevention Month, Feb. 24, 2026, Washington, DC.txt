Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize February as  National Cancer Prevention Month and to reaffirm our unwavering  commitment to reducing the burden of cancer in communities across our  Nation.

Cancer is a devastating disease that has touched far too many  families in my district and across the country. Nearly every one of us  knows a parent, child, sibling, or friend whose life has been altered  by a diagnosis. The grief that follows the loss of a loved one to  cancer is profound, and it strengthens our resolve to do everything in  our power to prevent this disease wherever possible.

This month reminds us that while cancer has affected so many lives,  there are meaningful steps we can take to reduce its impact. Research  shows that a significant share of cancer cases may be preventable  through practical, evidence-based measures. Simple but important  actions, such as staying physically active, maintaining a healthy diet,  protecting our skin from excessive sun exposure, and keeping up with  recommended screenings, can make a real difference in reducing risk.

At the same time, prevention must extend beyond individual choices.  Too many families face obstacles to early detection and timely care.  Access to screenings such as mammograms and colonoscopies can mean the  difference between early treatment and a far more difficult journey. We  must also confront the persistent disparities in cancer outcomes, as  rural communities and communities of color too often face greater  barriers to prevention, screening, and care.

National Cancer Prevention Month serves as a solemn reminder of both  the progress we have made and the work that remains. By strengthening  prevention efforts, expanding access to lifesaving screenings, and  working to close gaps in care, we can honor those we have lost and help  spare other families from the hardship of a cancer diagnosis.
