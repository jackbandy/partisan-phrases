Recognizing Roosevelt Mareus


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Caribbean American  Heritage Month to recognize an extraordinary leader from the Rochester  community: Roosevelt Mareus.

As Executive Director and Dean of the Rochester Educational  Opportunity Center, or REOC, Roosevelt Mareus has led with vision,  integrity, and a deep commitment to uplifting others. Under his  leadership, REOC has continued its vital mission of empowering  individuals, helping countless students break the cycle of poverty and  reach their utmost potential.

Born in Haiti, Roosevelt's journey is one of remarkable resilience  and transformation. As a young man overcoming adversity, he found  direction and opportunity through the very institution he would one day  lead. Beginning his career at REOC as a security guard, he steadily  rose through the ranks to become Executive Director. His life story is  a testament to his perseverance and dedication.

Roosevelt's passion for service extends far beyond Rochester. Deeply  connected to his Haitian roots, he founded Elevate Haiti Ministries, an  organization dedicated to building an orphanage and school in Haiti.  Over the past decade, Elevate Haiti has offered critical education and  housing for young boys.

During Caribbean American Heritage Month, it is my great privilege to  recognize Roosevelt Mareus. His leadership and service continues to  inspire and uplift communities both here at home and abroad.
