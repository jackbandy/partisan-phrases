Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Caribbean American  Heritage Month to recognize a trailblazing leader and advocate from  Rochester, New York: Norma Thom.

Born in Trinidad and Tobago, Norma brought to the United States a  deep commitment to culture, education, and service. After arriving in  Rochester, she transitioned from her role as a schoolteacher to become  a prominent voice for the Caribbean American community.

Norma is a founding member of The Rochester West Indian Festival  Organization, a nonprofit that has celebrated and promoted Caribbean  heritage in Rochester for over 42 years. Through her leadership, she  has fostered unity, cultural pride, and greater visibility for  Caribbean Americans across our region.

Beyond her community advocacy, Norma also built a distinguished  professional career. She spent 29 years at Eastman Kodak Company, where  she worked in the supply chain and logistics department. She retired in  2003, leaving behind a legacy of excellence in both her workplace and  her community.

It is an honor to recognize Norma Thom during Caribbean American  Heritage Month. Her enduring legacy continues to uplift Rochester and  inspire future generations.
