Recognizing Jim Brown


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an exemplary public  servant, distinguished leader, and dear friend from Rochester, New  York, Jim Brown, who is retiring after more than three decades of  dedicated service to the Joseph A. Floreano Rochester Riverside  Convention Center.

Jim Brown began his tenure at the Convention Center on April 4, 1994,  and over the course of 30 years, built a career defined by  professionalism, integrity, and unwavering commitment to the success of  Rochester's premier event facility. He held several key positions,  including Event Manager, Director of Operations, Building Manager, and  Facility Manager, before being appointed Executive Director on October  8, 2014. In every role, Jim led with humility and purpose, ensuring  that the Convention Center served as a welcoming, world-class venue for  both residents and visitors.

Under his leadership, the Floreano Convention Center strengthened its  reputation as a hub for regional and national gatherings, driving  economic development and fostering community engagement. Jim's deep  understanding of operations, combined with his steady guidance and  collaborative spirit, helped modernize the facility and expand its  impact across the Greater Rochester region. His ready smile and warm  personality have been the hallmark of his tenure, and his decades of  service reflect not only professional excellence but also a genuine  commitment to the people and institutions that make Rochester thrive.

Across every stage of his career, Jim Brown has exemplified  dedication, leadership, and service. His contributions have enriched  Rochester's cultural and economic landscape, strengthened professional  standards in the venue management field, and supported countless  colleagues, businesses, and community partners.

Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and deep appreciation that I  recognize Jim Brown for his remarkable career and his enduring  contributions to the Rochester community. His legacy of service will  continue to benefit our region for years to come, and his leadership  will be greatly missed.
