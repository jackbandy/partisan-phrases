Recognizing Marlene Henry


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Caribbean American  Heritage Month to recognize an exceptional public servant from  Rochester, New York: Marlene Henry.

As the owner of PeppaPot Catering, Marlene Henry is far more than a  business owner--she is a quiet but powerful force for good in our  community. Time and again, she has offered her culinary talents in  service of others, often at her own expense. Whether providing food at  no cost to those in need or offering discounted services for community  events, Marlene exemplifies the spirit of generosity that defines  Caribbean American heritage.

Her commitment to service extends well beyond the kitchen. Marlene is  among the first to volunteer for community events, including Caribbean  American Heritage Month celebrations, Mother's Day initiatives, and  cultural festivals. She approaches every act of service with humility,  never seeking recognition, but always delivering excellence.

Marlene's impact is also felt through her efforts to pass on cultural  traditions to the next generation. She devotes time to teaching young  people how to prepare and appreciate authentic Caribbean dishes,  ensuring that the flavors, stories, and values of our shared heritage  endure.

It is my distinct honor to recognize Marlene Henry this Caribbean  American Heritage Month. Her deep compassion, cultural pride, and  unwavering service enrich our community and inspire us all.
