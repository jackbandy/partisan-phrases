Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Jewish American  Heritage Month to pay tribute to a remarkable spiritual leader and  community advocate from Rochester, NY: Rabbi Alan Katz.

Rabbi Katz served with grace and wisdom as the rabbi of Temple Sinai  from 1986 to 2020, and now holds the distinguished title of Rabbi  Emeritus. Throughout his decades of service, Rabbi Katz has been a  moral compass and unifying force in our community, fostering interfaith  dialogue, social justice, and compassion.

He has held leadership roles with numerous organizations including  the Rochester Board of Rabbis, Jewish Community Federation, the Levine  Center to End Hate, and the Commission of Christian-Jewish Relations.  His commitment to promoting peace and understanding transcends borders,  exemplified by his work with the Partnership Together program  connecting Rochester and Modi'in, Israel, where he served as co-chair  for four years.

In 1995, Rabbi Katz was awarded the State of Israel Peace Award, a  fitting recognition of  his life's work. Today, he continues his service through the National  Rabbinic Council of ARZA and World Union for Progressive Judaism,  guiding the global Reform Jewish movement.

It is with profound respect and admiration that I recognize Rabbi  Alan Katz this Jewish American Heritage Month. His legacy of  leadership, advocacy, and deep spiritual care continues to bless our  community and beyond.
