Congratulating Monroe Red Jackets


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Monroe Red  Jackets high school football team, led by Coach Terrell Cunningham and  New York State Gatorade Player of the Year Messiah Hampton, who made  history as the first-ever Rochester City School District Class B State  champions.

This team showed what is possible when talent meets determination,  when hard work rises above the challenges we face, and when young  people refuse to be defined by the obstacles in front of them.

They believed in each other. They believed in themselves. They showed  New York State what Rochester pride looks like.

This championship brings hope. It brings hope for the students who  have proven their dreams are within reach, for a school that showed  excellence thrives here, and for a community that has so much to be  proud of.

We thank the players, coaches, families, and fans for reminding us  that greatness lives right here in Rochester. I cannot wait to see what  all these young people go on to do. We congratulate the Monroe Red  Jackets.
