Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act

Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, this vote is a waste of time. Nothing in  this Republican healthcare plan will stop Americans' healthcare  premiums from skyrocketing.

When this bill fails to become law--and it will fail--20 million  Americans will see their premiums surge on January 1. Many will not  even be able to afford hundreds or even thousands more each month, they  will lose their healthcare coverage completely.

This is a partisan exercise that does nothing to address the crisis  before us. That is why, moments ago, four Republicans signed onto the  bipartisan legislation to end this crisis and protect Americans'  healthcare, giving it the signatures necessary to be considered on the  House floor. The American people expect us to act with urgency,  decisiveness, and transparency.

Mr. Speaker, cancel this vote. Call up the bipartisan bill to save  Americans' healthcare before you take another vacation.
