https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689009/recognizing-salvation-army-of-harrisonburg-and-rockingham-countys-100th-anniversary


Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the Salvation  Army of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County. For over 100 years, they  have remained dedicated to sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ while  providing care and support to all those in need.

Just 60 years after the founding of the international movement known  as the Salvation Army, the Salvation Army of Harrisonburg and  Rockingham County was established on June 27, 1925.

Since its founding, the Salvation Army of Harrisonburg and Rockingham  County has partnered with the local community to efficiently and  effectively assist individuals and families facing poverty. It has made  a positive difference in countless lives, offering a helping hand to  those caught in difficult circumstances.

Today, the organization is faithfully led by Lieutenants Douglas and  Sharon Ingold, who continue the mission of serving others with  compassion and integrity.

The Salvation Army of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County holds its  iconic Red Kettle Campaign every year to raise funds for the  organization's programs that benefit the local area. The organization  remains steadfast in its commitment to offering programs and services  to all those in need without discrimination.

I congratulate the Salvation Army of Harrisonburg and Rockingham  County on doing the most good for 100 years.            Congratulating Roanoke Valley Christian Schools Eagles

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Roanoke  Valley Christian Schools Eagles varsity boys' basketball team for  winning the 2025 VACA State championship, securing back-to-back titles  and etching their names into school history.

After graduating eight seniors last year, expectations were tempered,  but led by returning seniors Logan Gutierrez, Luke Somers, Matthew  Cummings, Christian Crosby, Ethan Cummings, and Cayden Wayne, along  with new senior Colton Bowman, the Eagles rose to the challenge with  grit and unity.

Logan and Luke each reached the 1,000-point milestone, while  underclassmen like Jacob and Zach Mioduszewski, Landen Gutierrez, Jack  Rakes, and Dallas Riles played vital roles in the team's depth and  success. Eighth-grader Brayden Hawley rounded out the squad and made  his mark, as well.

With Coach Josiah Somers at the helm and a foundation built on  relentless defense and selfless play, the Eagles swept the Southwest  District, South Region, and State titles.

Mr. Speaker, this team showed the heart of champions. I congratulate  the RVCS Eagles.

Eagles soar.

Delivering on President Trump's Priorities in Reconciliation

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are delivering on the  mandate the American people gave us last November. We passed a  responsible budget resolution, and now we are moving forward with a  strong reconciliation package that reflects President Trump's America  First agenda.

The bill secures our southern border, keeps taxes low for working  families and small businesses, strengthens our economy, protects Social  Security, restores American energy leadership, supports our men and  women in uniform, and brings much-needed accountability to Washington.

We have taken the lead in the House. Now it is time for the Senate to  do the same. When they return to Washington, the Senators should take  up the House resolution, move the bill forward, and send it to the  President's desk.

The American people expect results. They want a government that works  for them, not against them. With this legislation, we have the chance  to make real, lasting change for the American people. Let's get it  done.
