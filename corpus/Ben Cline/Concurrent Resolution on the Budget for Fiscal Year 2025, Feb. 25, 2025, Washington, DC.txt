Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, back in November the American people issued a  resounding rejection of the profligate policies of the Biden-Harris  administration that existed over the past 4 years by electing President  Donald Trump.

In the first month of his new administration, President Trump has  answered this election mandate, signing executive orders aimed at  securing our Nation's borders, unleashing domestic energy production,  and rooting out the waste, fraud, and abuse that was left over as the  final remnants of Biden's failed legacy.

However, the President cannot achieve all of these policy objectives  alone. He needs Congress. It will take those of us in the House and  Senate, concerned about addressing our fiscal irresponsibility the last  4 years and working together in a unified fashion, to pass a  reconciliation package that is set in motion by today's budget  resolution. It will give this administration the tools they need to  succeed in fulfilling their election mandate.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this budget as  we work to deliver real savings for the American people.
