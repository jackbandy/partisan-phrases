https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698845/bankruptcy-administration-improvement-act-of-2025


Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 3424) to amend titles 11 and 28, United States Code, to modify the  compensation payable to trustees serving in cases under chapter 7 of  title 11, United States Code, to extend the term of certain temporary  offices of bankruptcy judges, and for other purposes.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                       S. 3424

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Bankruptcy Administration       Improvement Act of 2025''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Congress has amended the laws governing bankruptcy fees       as necessary to ensure that the bankruptcy system remains       self-supporting, while also fairly allocating the costs of       the system among those who use the system.

(2) Because of the importance for the bankruptcy system to       be self-funded, at no cost to taxpayers, Congress has closely       monitored the funding needs of the bankruptcy system,       including by requiring periodic reporting by the Attorney       General regarding the United States Trustee System Fund.

(3) Because the system governing bankruptcies of various       types is interconnected, Congress has established fees,       including filing fees, quarterly fees in chapter 11 cases,       and other fees, that together fund the courts, judges, United       States trustees, and trustees serving in bankruptcy cases       under chapter 7 of title 11, United States Code.

(4) Trustees serving in bankruptcy cases under chapter 7 of       title 11, United States Code, are vital to the functioning of       the bankruptcy system, as they provide services at the front       lines of the bankruptcy process, administering thousands of       cases.

(5) Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustees provide valuable returns       of assets to government creditors, including the Internal       Revenue Service, the Department of Agriculture, the Small       Business Administration, and other Federal, State, and       municipal governments.

(6) Due to the work of the chapter 7 bankruptcy trustees,       millions of dollars are also disbursed annually to private       creditors of all types, including medical providers,       unsecured creditors, small businesses, and micro-enterprises       such as domestic support providers.

(7) Despite the essential role of chapter 7 bankruptcy       trustees, since 1994 the amount of compensation paid to these       trustees has not been increased. As in 1994, bankruptcy       trustees receive only $60 per case (composed of $45 from       subsection 330(b)(1), and $15 from subsection 330(b)(2), of       title 11, United States Code) in nearly 90 percent of chapter       7 cases, and bankruptcy trustees receive no compensation at       all for cases in which the filing fee is waived by the       bankruptcy court.

(8) Since 1994, there have been significant increases in       salaries, attorney fees, budget appropriations, filing fees,       and court-related fees associated with chapter 7       bankruptcies. In contrast, the $60 paid to chapter 7 trustees       has remained the same and has not even been increased for       inflation. In 2021, Congress attempted to implement a       mechanism that would give chapter 7 trustees a raise, but the       trustees only received increased compensation for 1 fiscal       year. Based on Consumer Price Index estimates, the $60 paid       to trustees in 1994 would be the equivalent of over $125       today.

(9) This Act and the amendments made by this Act--

(A) increase the compensation of chapter 7 bankruptcy       trustees to the level that is appropriate, overdue, and       proportionate with the level that was intended in 1994, by       increasing the total compensation of trustees to $120 per       case;

(B) ensure adequate funding of the United States trustee       system through the increase of certain fees, which will also       apply to districts that are not part of a United States       trustee region as required by existing law; and

(C) support the preservation of existing bankruptcy       judgeships that are urgently needed to handle existing and       anticipated increases in business and consumer caseloads.

(10) This Act will not alter the filing fee under chapter 7       of title 11, United States Code, and will not modify, impair,       or supersede the current authority of the district courts of       the United States, or of bankruptcy courts, to waive the       payment of filing fees by indigent individuals.

Mr. CLINE.  3424.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3424, the Bankruptcy  Administration Improvement Act of 2025.

The bill before us today is an important piece of legislation that  will help ensure the bankruptcy system continues to function  efficiently and without taxpayer funding.

Congress designed the bankruptcy system to be funded through the fees  imposed on those who utilize the system. From time to time, Congress  has passed legislation to respond to how the bankruptcy system is  operating.

S. 3424 responds to the current bankruptcy climate in three ways:  First, the bill extends the temporary quarterly fees used to pay for  the United States Trustee Program within the Department of Justice and  bankruptcy judgeships. Ensuring taxpayers are not on the hook for the  administration of the Bankruptcy Code is critical. The only way to  ensure the bankruptcy system is funded far into the future is to  maintain the current fee schedule.

Second, S. 3424 extends for an additional 5-year period numerous  temporary bankruptcy judgeships across the country. These bankruptcy  judges ensure that bankruptcy cases are quickly and efficiently  administered. While bankruptcy filings in recent years have slowed,  early data suggests that bankruptcy filings will likely increase in the  coming years. Maintaining these temporary bankruptcy judgeships for the  next 5 years will ensure that the bankruptcy system can continue to  operate at full capacity if necessary.

Finally, and most importantly, S. 3424 increases the pay per case for  Chapter 7 trustees. Chapter 7 trustees play a critical role in the  bankruptcy system, ensuring that creditors recover as much as possible  from bankruptcy debtors. Chapter 7 trustees also ensure that the  government receives unpaid taxes, fines, and fees or whatever else it  may be owed during a bankruptcy case. In around 90 percent of the  cases, Chapter 7 trustees receive the statutory minimum payment for  their services, $60 per case. This rate was established in 1994 and has  never been permanently increased.

S. 3424 increases the pay per case by adjusting chapter 7 trustee  compensation for inflation since 1994 to $120. This change is long  overdue.

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, again, this important legislation promotes  efficient government rather than expanding it, reinforces user-funded  government services, strengthens accountability and oversight, and  reduces market distortions caused by uncertainty.

Mr. Speaker, I urge its support, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
