https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696845/recognizing-50th-anniversary-of-opera-roanoke


Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Opera Roanoke on  the momentous occasion of its 50th anniversary.

Founded in 1976 as the Southwest Virginia Opera Society by a group of  dedicated volunteers, the company staged its first production of ``The  Consul'' in 1978, and in 1991, became the fully professional  organization we now know as Opera Roanoke.

For five decades, it has been a cornerstone of cultural life in  Roanoke and across Virginia's Blue Ridge, presenting compelling  performances and fostering a broader appreciation for opera in western  Virginia.

Over the years, the company has benefited from remarkable artistic  leadership and the guidance of legendary mentors, such as Eleanor  Steber and Irene Dalis. A special thank you to the board of trustees,  who have contributed to the success of the opera: John Johnson,  President; Krista Vannoy, Immediate Past President; Frank Giannini,  Treasurer; Jim Dubinsky, Secretary; Isabel Ditzel; and Eric Monday.

This anniversary season opened with ``Love and Sacrifice: A tribute  to the Heart of Opera Roanoke,'' which also marked the retirement of  Maestro Steven White, whose more than 20 years of service have  profoundly shaped the company's artistic excellence.

As Opera Roanoke looks ahead to its 50th anniversary season and  upcoming  production of ``Hansel and Gretel,'' I congratulate the organization,  its artists, its leadership, and its supporters on five decades of  achievement. May the next 50 be just as inspiring.                 Celebrating Robert Holland's 100th Birthday

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Robert Holland  of Roanoke, Virginia, who will celebrate his 100th birthday this  Thanksgiving Day, November 27, 2025.

Mr. Holland is a proud World War II veteran who enlisted in the  United States Army at just 18 years old. He spent his 19th birthday in  France, serving as a Staff Sergeant with the 381st Battery. He worked  as a powder man and also served in supply operations, roles vital to  our mission's success in Europe.

After the war, Mr. Holland returned to his home State of West  Virginia before settling in the Hollins area of Roanoke County in 1950  to be near family. He went on to enjoy a long and honorable career with  the General Electric Company and has been a valued member of the  Roanoke community ever since.

Mr. Speaker, as he marks a century of life, service, and devotion to  family and country, I am proud to join his loved ones and neighbors in  wishing Mr. Robert Holland a very happy 100th birthday and thanking him  for his steadfast service to our Nation.                Congratulating Warren County Middle School FFA

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, for the first time in Warren County's  history, a middle school FFA chapter has earned the highest honor  possible from the National FFA Organization. Receiving the National  Chapter Award with a gold three-star rating places Warren County Middle  School's FFA among the very best agricultural education programs in the  Nation.

A testament to the hard work, leadership, and community spirit of our  students, these young people are not only learning about agriculture  but also taking initiative to serve their neighbors, strengthen their  school, and build a brighter future.

Led by adviser Lynne Phillips and officers Harlie Brooks, Madison  Ballard, Bella Kaplan, Allie Englert, Camberlee Lockhart, Cadence  Flint, Alexis Clark, Silas Dutton, and Lex Flores, alongside all other  members, planned and carried out projects that range from food drives  to environmental cleanups, demonstrating that middle school students,  when given the tools and the trust, can rise to extraordinary heights.

Mr. Speaker, fewer than 10 percent of FFA chapters nationwide receive  this distinction. Warren County's students have set a new standard of  excellence, and they remind us that the seeds of leadership, once  planted, can grow into something that lifts up an entire community. I  am proud to honor them today.                       Denouncing Socialism in America

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, socialism has left a long trail of suffering  across the globe. Wherever it has taken root, it has brought economic  collapse, political oppression, and the deterioration of freedom.

Despite this record, we are seeing a troubling rise in socialist  rhetoric here at home, especially among younger Americans and in major  cities like New York City where these ideas are becoming increasingly  mainstream. At the same time, support for the free-market principles  that built our Nation has declined. This shift endangers the core  values handed down by our Founding Fathers: liberty, personal  responsibility, and limited government.

We cannot ignore these warning signs. We cannot allow the failures of  socialist systems abroad or here in the United States to be rewritten,  dismissed, or forgotten. That is why House Republicans are set to vote  on a resolution that firmly rejects socialism in all its forms and  reaffirms our commitment to the American ideals of freedom and self- governance.

Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve to know where their elected  officials stand. House Republicans will choose freedom, and we will  stand for the principles that are the foundation of this great Nation.
