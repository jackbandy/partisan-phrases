Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary  group of young athletes from Virginia's Sixth Congressional District,  the Parry McCluer High School boys' cross-country team, who have  achieved a rare and remarkable feat. This season, the Fighting Blues  captured their third consecutive VHSL State championship, securing  titles in 2023, 2024, and now 2025.

At this year's State meet, the team delivered a dominant performance.  Kebryl Chandler claimed the individual State title, finishing first  overall. He was followed by outstanding efforts from Caleb Cooper, who  placed sixth; Josh Cooper, eighth; Logan Wheelock, ninth; and Hinckley  Lovelace, who finished 12th. Their combined strength, discipline, and  endurance propelled Parry McCluer to another well-earned championship.  They were joined by their teammates, Sebastian George and Sam  Carpenter, who helped make the team a success throughout the season.

This exceptional program thrives under the leadership of coaches  Chris Poluikis and Jacob Zimmerman, whose guidance, training, and  belief in these athletes have built a true championship tradition.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate each runner, their coaches, their  families, and the entire Parry McCluer community. Their three-peat  victory is a testament to perseverance, teamwork, and excellence, and  it continues to make the city of Buena Vista, the Sixth Congressional  District, and the entire Commonwealth of Virginia proud.
