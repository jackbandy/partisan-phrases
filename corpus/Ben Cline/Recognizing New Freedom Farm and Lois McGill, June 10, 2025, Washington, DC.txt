https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692312/recognizing-new-freedom-farm-and-lois-mcgill


Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable  impact of New Freedom Farm in Botetourt County, Virginia, and to honor  its founder, Lois Dawn McGill, as she prepares for a well-deserved  retirement.

Since 2016, New Freedom Farm has served as a place of healing for  veterans, first responders, and rescue animals, offering a sanctuary  where pain met purpose and isolation gave way to hope.

Through Lois' tireless dedication, lives were transformed and bonds  were forged between heroes and horses. As the farm prepares to close on  July 31, we reflect not with sorrow but with deep gratitude. The legacy  of New Freedom Farm will live on in the hearts it healed and the  community it united.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Lois for her vision, compassion, and unwavering  service. She has left an indelible mark on all she has touched.                 Honoring Retirement of Fire Chief Tim Williams

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and commend an  extraordinary public servant, Shenandoah County Fire Chief Tim  Williams, who will retire on October 1 after an astounding 50 years of  dedicated service in fire and rescue.

Chief Williams began his journey as a volunteer with the Strasburg  Volunteer Fire Department in 1975. He went on to serve 25 years with  Fairfax County, ultimately retiring as a captain, and then brought his  leadership to Shenandoah County, where he has served since 2005,  including the past 9 years as chief.

Chief Williams has been a unifying force, skillfully bridging the gap  between volunteer companies and career staff. Under his leadership, the  department launched a strategic plan that brought all stakeholders  together and set a path for the future. His guidance has ensured  operational readiness and the expansion of essential services, even as  challenges grew more complex.

Chief Williams leaves behind a legacy of integrity, collaboration,  and tireless dedication. I thank him for his service, leadership, and  enduring commitment to the safety of our communities. He has truly  earned this next chapter in his life.                    Eliminating Wasteful Federal Spending

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, the House is finally doing what the American  people have demanded for years. We are cutting wasteful spending and  restoring fiscal sanity.

This week, we are voting on a rescission package sent by President  Trump to eliminate $9.4 billion in reckless spending. That includes $3  million for Iraqi Sesame Street, $500,000 for electric buses in Rwanda,  and millions more for climate projects in Southeast Asia and Latin  America, as well as taxpayer dollars that have been flowing to radical  gender ideology programs around the world. That is not the role of the  Federal Government, and that is not an appropriate use of taxpayer  dollars of American citizens.

Taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund woke projects overseas or  bloated government programs at home. They should be funding efforts  that protect our border, defend our Nation, and serve the American  people.

House Republicans promised to root out waste, fraud, and abuse. H.R.  4 keeps that promise and takes a critical step forward toward a leaner,  more accountable government. I urge my colleagues to support it.
