Schatz: Kauai To Receive $4.5 Million In Federal Funding To Keep Bus, Public Transit Services Operational During Pandemic


U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai"i) today announced that Kauai will receive $4.5 million in federal funding to support public transit operations during the coronavirus pandemic. The new funding is part of the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

"For the essential workers who rely on public transportation, this new funding means the Kauai bus system will have the resources to continue operating, while keeping passengers and transit employees safe," said Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

"As this emergency evolves, public transportation is critical. This federal funding helps us focus existing county resources toward other immediately pressing needs. Mahalo to our Congressional delegation," said Mayor Derek Kawakami.

The federal funds can help pay for the expenses necessary to operate, maintain, and manage the Kauai bus system, and can be used for such costs as driver salaries, fuel, personal protective equipment, and cleaning supplies. The CARES Act funding can also be used for administrative leave, such as leave for employees due to reductions in service or leave required for a quarantined worker.
