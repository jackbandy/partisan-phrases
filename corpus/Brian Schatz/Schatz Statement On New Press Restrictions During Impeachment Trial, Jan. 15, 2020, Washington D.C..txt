Schatz Statement On New Press Restrictions During Impeachment Trial


Today, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai"i) released the following statement on new unreasonable restrictions on media access during the Senate impeachment trial. 

"As the Senate begins to consider the articles of impeachment, the American people deserve a full view of these proceedings. But the new restrictions imposed on the press will make it more difficult for reporters to keep the public informed about every step of this historic trial. These unreasonable restrictions must be reversed so that the press has the access they need to do their jobs, expose the truth, and keep our leaders accountable.

"We swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and that includes protecting the First Amendment."
