Schatz Statement On State Of The Union Address


Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai"i) released the following statement in response to President Trump's State of the Union address.

"Tonight the president had an opportunity to bring people together during this dark time. Unfortunately, what we heard was the same divisiveness that has defined his presidency. While there may be a chance for compromise on infrastructure, the address offered no real solutions to the challenges we face. Nevertheless, I will continue to look for common ground in the Senate, and fight the administration when they undermine American values."
