Schatz Joins Effort To Prevent War With Iran


Today, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai"i) signed onto a war powers resolution to force a debate and vote in Congress to prevent further escalation of hostilities with Iran.

"Congress, not the president, has the constitutional authority to declare war, and I oppose a war with Iran," said Senator Schatz. "No one mourns the death of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani, a ruthless terrorist responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans. However, President Trump's decision to kill him outside Baghdad airport carries serious strategic consequences for which he was unprepared, including the unraveling of our relationship with Iraq, undermining our ability to prevent ISIS's return, and putting U.S. diplomats and service members in Iraq and the region in danger."

War powers resolutions are privileged, meaning that the Senate will be forced to vote on the legislation. The resolution underscores that Congress has the sole power to declare war, as laid out in the Constitution. The resolution requires that any hostilities with Iran must be explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force, but does not prevent the United States from defending itself from imminent attack. The resolution will force a public debate and vote in Congress as intended by the framers of the Constitution to determine whether United States forces should be engaged in these hostilities.
