Hawai"i Set To Receive $13.7 Million In New Federal Funding To Improve Public Housing


Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that the Hawai"i Public Housing Authority (HPHA) will receive a $13,723,489 grant to repair, renovate, and modernize public housing in Hawai"i.

"These federal funds will help our state invest in needed repairs and upgrades to ensure that Hawai"i public housing residents have a safe place to call home," said U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai"i), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

The grant was provided through HUD's Public Housing Capital Fund, a program that offers annual funding to approximately 3,100 public housing authorities nationwide. HPHA received an increase of nearly $350,000 from last year's allocation -- despite the Trump administration's attempts to cut funding for the program each of the last three years.

In Hawai"i, 4,320 families live in federal public housing units and stand to benefit from this new federal funding.
