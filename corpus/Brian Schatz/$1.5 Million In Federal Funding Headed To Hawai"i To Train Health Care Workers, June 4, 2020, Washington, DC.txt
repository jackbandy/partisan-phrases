$1.5 Million In Federal Funding Headed To Hawai"i To Train Health Care Workers, Expand Telehealth, Purchase PPE During COVID-19 Pandemic


Today, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai"i) announced that Hawai"i will receive $1,500,000 to support the preparedness and response needs of hospitals, health systems, and health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds can be used to train health care workers, expand the use of telehealth services, replenish stockpiles of supplies such as personal protective equipment, and coordinate efforts across health care facilities.

"Hospitals and health care workers are working tirelessly to help keep our families safe and healthy," said Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "These new federal dollars will help ensure that they have the resources they need to prepare for and respond to this pandemic."

Authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, this funding comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP). The HPP provides the only federal funding for health care system preparedness and response for disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic. Previously, Hawai"i received $400,682 in HPP emergency supplemental funding through the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2020. These funds will be managed by Hawai"i Healthcare Emergency Management and the Department of Health.

In addition to the funding announced today, Hawai"i has received federal grants to support care for rural communities, expand contact tracing capacity, and help local providers respond to the pandemic.
