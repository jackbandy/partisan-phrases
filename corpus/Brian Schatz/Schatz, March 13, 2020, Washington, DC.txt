Schatz, Senators Introduce Bill to Ensure Free Coronavirus testing


U.S. Senators Brian Schatz, Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and a number of their Democratic Senate colleagues introduced the Free COVID-19 Testing Act, legislation that would ensure free tests to confirm coronavirus (COVID-19) infections.

"Testing should be free and available for everyone who needs it. We can't stop this outbreak if we don't know how it's spreading," said Senator Schatz.

The Free COVID-19 Testing Act would waive cost-sharing for COVID-19 diagnostic testing and related health care services for individuals enrolled in private health plans, Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, VA as well as for federal civilians, American Indians and Alaska Natives. Private insurers would be barred from imposing limits like prior authorization for testing. For uninsured individuals, this legislation would cover the cost of lab fees, and states would have the option and new incentives to cover COVID-19 diagnostic testing and related health care services through their Medicaid programs.
