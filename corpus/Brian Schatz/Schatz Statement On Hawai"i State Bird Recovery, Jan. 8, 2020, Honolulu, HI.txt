Schatz Statement On Hawai"i State Bird Recovery, Downlisting


Today, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai"i) released the following statement on the downlisting of Hawai"i's state bird, the nene, from "endangered" to "threatened."

"The recovery of the nene shows how the Endangered Species Act is supposed to work. With a science-based recovery plan and a strong partnership between the state and federal governments, the species has gradually rebounded. We have a long way to go before the nene is completely recovered, and it will require continued protections, but this is an important milestone. I thank the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Hawai"i Department of Land and Natural Resources, and the many environmental organizations and volunteers who have worked to save our iconic state bird."
