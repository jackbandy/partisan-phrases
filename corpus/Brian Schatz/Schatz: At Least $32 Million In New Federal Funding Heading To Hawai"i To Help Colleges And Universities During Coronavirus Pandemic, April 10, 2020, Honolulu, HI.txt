Schatz: At Least $32 Million In New Federal Funding Heading To Hawai"i To Help Colleges And Universities During Coronavirus Pandemic


U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai"i), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that Hawai"i is set to receive at least $32 million in new federal funding to help higher education institutions respond to the coronavirus crisis. 

"As students leave campus and educators adapt to distance learning programs, Hawai"i colleges and universities are struggling to stay afloat," said Senator Schatz. "This new federal funding will help our schools continue providing services to students during the pandemic."

Due to the coronavirus, colleges and universities in Hawai"i are facing operational and economic challenges. These new federal funds will be used to assist students and help stabilize colleges and universities so that they can continue to provide educational services.

At least 50 percent of the funds the institutions receive must be used for emergency financial aid grants to students to help ease expenses caused by campus disruptions from the coronavirus. These expenses can include food, housing, technology, health care, course materials, and childcare. 

The remaining funds can be used by institutions to help cover the costs of changing the delivery of instruction and transitioning to distance learning. The funds can be used for technology, faculty and staff trainings, and payroll, among other things. The funds cannot be used for endowments, capital improvements to athletic facilities, sectarian instruction or religious worship, or to pay contractors for performing pre-enrollment recruitment activities.

The funding is made available through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law in March. 

Under the CARES Act, higher education institutions in Hawai"i and across the country are also able to lift some restrictions like the ability to use Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant funds as emergency aid for students. Institutions no longer have to match funds for certain aid. In addition, work study payments can be made to students unable to work due to coronavirus-related closures.
