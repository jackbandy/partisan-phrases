Schatz: Hawai"i Receiving $58 Million In New Federal Funding To Support Rural Hospitals And Community Health Centers And Cover Cost Of COVID-19 Care, Testing, Treatment


U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai"i) today announced that 14 health centers across Hawai"i will receive $3.8 million to expand COVID-19 testing and contact tracing.

"Ramping up testing is critical to reopening our economy," said Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "This new federal funding will give our local health centers additional resources to test more people for COVID-19, conduct contact tracing, and help stop the spread in our state."

The new federal funding, which was part of the latest relief package passed by Congress, will be used by health centers to expand the range of testing and testing-related activities to best address the needs of local communities, including the purchase of personal protective equipment, training for staff, procurement and administration of tests, laboratory services, notifying identified contacts of infected health center patients of their exposure to COVID-19, and the expansion of walk-up or drive-up testing capabilities.
