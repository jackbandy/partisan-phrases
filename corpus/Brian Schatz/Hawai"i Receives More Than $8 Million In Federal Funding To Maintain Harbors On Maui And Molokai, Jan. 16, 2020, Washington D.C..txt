Hawai"i Receives More Than $8 Million In Federal Funding To Maintain Harbors On Maui And Molokai


Today, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Hawai"i received more than $8 million in federal funding to maintain harbors on Maui and Molokai. The new funding was included in the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act passed by Congress and signed into law last year.

"As an island state, our harbors and ports keep our state connected and our local economy moving," said U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai"i), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "This new funding will help maintain our harbors on Maui and Molokai so that the cargo carriers and boat and ship operators that rely on them can continue to safely do their jobs and provide residents with the food and goods they need."

The $4.6 million for the Kahului Deep Draft Harbor and the $3.5 million for the Kaunakakai Deep Draft Harbor will be used by the Army Corps to help maintain and operate the two harbors.

Kahului Deep Draft Harbor is Maui's only commercial port and is located on the northern coast of the island. The Kaunakakai Deep Draft Harbor is located on the south central coast of Molokai.
