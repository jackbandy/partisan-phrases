Letter to Hon. Calvin Scovel, Inspector General - Schatz, Hirono Call For Investigation Into FAA's Handling Of Hawai"i Helicopter Safety Warnings Following New Senate Report, Whistleblower Complaints


Dear Inspector General Scovel:

The recent air tour tragedies that have occurred in Hawai"i have shaken public confidence and raised concerns with the safety of the air tour industry.  The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation has released details of an investigation into helicopter safety which highlights flaws in internal FAA safety culture.  The report includes whistleblower complaints alleging that the FAA directly disregarded serious concerns about the safety of helicopter air tours in Hawai"i. 

We request that you launch an investigation into the specific oversight lapses raised by the whistleblowers as it relates to helicopter operations in the State of Hawai"i, as well as policies and procedures within the Office of Aviation Safety, the Western-Pacific Region, and the Hawai"i Flight Standards District Offices that may result in increased risk to operators, passengers, and the general public.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.  We look forward to your updates and report

Sincerely,

Brian Schatz
