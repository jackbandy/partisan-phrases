Resolution, to Remove United States Armed Forces From Hostilities with Presidentially Designated Terrorist Organizations in the Western Hemisphere


Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.  Con. Res. 61.

This resolution would prohibit the President of the United States  from using all tools at his disposal in the fight against designated  terrorist organizations in the Western Hemisphere. These are the same  narcoterrorists who are waging, and have been waging, a war on the  American people through the use of deadly drugs and poison that are  flooding into our country.

Let's talk about reality, not about rhetoric.

First of all, the number one job of any government is to protect its  people. Since September 11, 2001, roughly 4,000 Americans have been  killed inside the United States either by al-Qaida, ISIS, and similar  ideologically linked terrorist groups.

Meanwhile, since 2021--I am not talking about 2001--nearly 400,000  Americans have died from overdose poisoning, deaths fueled by foreign  terrorist organizations including the Venezuelan regime and violent  cartels operating in our own backyard. That 400,000 is about the size  of my native city of Miami. This is, in reality, a weapon of mass  destruction.

Yet here we are, debating whether to retreat from fighting terrorists  in our own hemisphere, while continuing to fight them halfway around  the world.

I have spent my life in public safety. Mr. Speaker, I have seen what  happens when you hesitate, when you retreat, and when you take your  foot off the gas. People die. Families are destroyed, and communities  suffer.

This resolution does nothing to promote peace. It invites danger,  continued chaos, and the loss of more American lives--more American  lives.

It tells terrorists and cartels that the United States Congress is  willing to tie the hands of our Commander in Chief while they ship  poison into our communities and profit from American death.

As someone who fled communism, I know this lesson well: Weakness  invites aggression. When America steps back, evil steps forward.

Mr. GIMENEZ. We must reject this resolution and make clear to the  world that the United States has the will to confront narcoterrorism  head-on and that we will never surrender to the very people who are  killing our children.

Too many Americans have already died because we turned a blind eye to  this threat.

For the sake of our national security, our communities, and the men  and women in uniform who stand the line every single day, I urge a  ``no'' vote on this resolution.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. Mast) for  yielding me the time to speak on this important matter.
