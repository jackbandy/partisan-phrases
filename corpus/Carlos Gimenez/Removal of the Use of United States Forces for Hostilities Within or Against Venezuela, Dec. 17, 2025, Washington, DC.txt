Removal of the Use of United States Forces for Hostilities Within or Against Venezuela


Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  resolution.

This resolution would prohibit the use of United States Armed Forces  off the coast of Venezuela without regard for the real and growing  threats posed by the foreign terrorist Maduro regime.

Let's be clear-eyed about the danger that we face. The Maduro regime  is a designated foreign terrorist organization, a narcoterrorist state  that collaborates with other foreign terrorist organizations and  violent cartels to flood our hemisphere and our communities with deadly  poison.

Venezuela has been taken over. The Venezuelan people are held hostage  by a foreign terrorist regime that uses their land as an operating base  for international drug trafficking, fueling a crisis that has cost  nearly 400,000 Americans their lives since 2021.

This resolution would have us pull back from the fight against  designated terrorist regimes and cartels in our own hemisphere, just  miles from our shores. It tells the foreign terrorist regime in  Venezuela and its criminal allies that Congress is willing to look the  other way as hundreds of thousands of Americans continue to die every  single year.

We must reject this resolution and send a clear message: The United  States will confront narcoterrorist regimes in our hemisphere, stand  with the Venezuelan people, and never surrender to terrorist regimes  that threaten our security. Too many Americans have already paid with  their lives because this threat was ignored.

For the sake of our national security, our communities, and the men  and women in uniform who stand the line every day, I urge a ``no'' vote  on this resolution. I thank my colleague for yielding me the time.
