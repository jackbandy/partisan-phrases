Decoupling From Foreign Adversarial Battery Dependence Act


Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1166, the  Decoupling from Foreign Adversarial Battery Dependence Act.

As Communist China seeks to gain influence in critical industries  around the world, the United States must be at the forefront of  combating and decoupling from the CCP. This includes battery  technology.

As we become more and more dependent on battery technology, we need  to ensure that these batteries are sourced from nonadversarial  countries. As it stands, Communist China produces approximately 80  percent of the world's batteries and roughly 70 percent of the world's  lithium ion batteries. This dependence puts U.S. supply chains at risk  and threatens our national security.

Our government should not be spending tax dollars to procure  batteries from companies that profit from slave labor or provide  another avenue for the CCP to expand their surveillance apparatus here  in the United States. As an agency tasked with protecting the homeland,  the Department of Homeland Security should not be procuring batteries  from a geopolitical adversary.

H.R. 1166, the Decoupling from Foreign Adversarial Battery Dependence  Act, is a critical first step in addressing this issue. Modeled after  previous provisions included in the FY 2024 NDAA, my legislation builds  off of these efforts and prohibits the Department of Homeland Security  from procuring batteries from companies that have deep ties to the CCP  and engage in human rights abuses.

H.R. 1166 helps our Nation take a step forward in advancing our  efforts to decouple from the PRC and safeguard critical supply chains  from exploitation.

I am proud that this bill passed out of the Committee on Homeland  Security in a bipartisan manner last Congress and was passed on the  House floor. I look forward to seeing it pass and becoming law in the  119th Congress.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
