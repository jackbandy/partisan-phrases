Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my  bill, H.R. 1608, the Department of Homeland Security Vehicular  Terrorism Prevention and Mitigation Act of 2025.

On New Year's Day 2025, our Nation was shaken by a horrific ISIS- inspired attack in New Orleans that took the lives of 14 innocent  people and injured dozens more.

This tragedy is a stark reminder that vehicles are increasingly being  weaponized as instruments of terror. H.R. 1608 directs the Department  of Homeland Security to confront the growing threat of vehicle-based  attacks. It mandates a comprehensive assessment of current and emerging  tactics, including the potential misuse of autonomous vehicles,  rideshare platforms, and connected vehicle technologies.

Further, the bill strengthens coordination between Federal, State,  and local governments and the private sector to better safeguard public  gatherings, critical infrastructure, and high-density urban areas.

I thank Congressman Troy Carter, who represents the community  devastated by the New Year's Day attack, for his partnership and  leadership on this effort.

This practical and bipartisan legislation is about honoring the lives  we lost by doing everything possible to prevent and mitigate future  attacks. With major events on the horizon, including America250, the  FIFA World Cup, and the Los Angeles Olympics, we must ensure every  necessary security measure is in place to protect the millions of  visitors and attendees these events will bring.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1608.
