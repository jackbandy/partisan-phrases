Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National  Hispanic Heritage Month and to commend the extraordinary work of the  Miami-Dade County Hispanic Affairs Advisory Board.

Each year, our Nation honors the history, culture, and countless  contributions of Hispanic Americans. Today, Hispanics and Latinos  represent the largest minority in the United States, accounting for  more than 19 percent of our population and nearly 70 percent of the  residents of Miami-Dade County.

The Hispanic Affairs Advisory Board has long served as a strong  advocate for our Hispanic community. It leads countywide efforts to  celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month and to promote cultural unity across  our diverse community.

This year, Miami-Dade County's 2025 Hispanic Heritage Month Kickoff  Celebration will bring together elected officials, more than 30 Consuls  General and international diplomats, as well as community leaders from  across South Florida. This celebration reflects the multicultural  richness that defines both our county and Nation.

I am proud to recognize the Miami-Dade County Hispanic Affairs  Advisory Board for its leadership, dedication, and tireless service.  Their work not only highlights the invaluable contributions of Hispanic  Americans but also reminds us that cultural unity strengthens the very  fabric of our communities.
