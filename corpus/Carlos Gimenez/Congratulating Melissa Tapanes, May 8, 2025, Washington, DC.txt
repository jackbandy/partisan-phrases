Congratulating Melissa Tapanes


Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Melissa  Tapanes on being named President of the Builders Association of South  Florida.

Ms. Tapanes is an accomplished attorney who specializes in complex  legislative and quasi-judicial matters. She has demonstrated a strong  commitment to public service, holding leadership roles with the Miami  Downtown Development Authority and numerous civic and legal  organizations.

Her dedication to education and public policy began early, with an  appointment by Governor Jeb Bush and her successful advocacy for the  establishment of a public law school at Florida International  University.

Throughout her career, Ms. Tapanes has earned prestigious honors,  including the South Florida Business Journal's ``40 Under 40'' and  Ford's ``Mujeres Legendarias.'' She has been consistently recognized by  The Legal 500, ranked in Chambers USA, and acknowledged by Super  Lawyers and Florida Trend.

I look forward to working with Ms. Tapanes in her new role as  President of the Builders Association of South Florida.
