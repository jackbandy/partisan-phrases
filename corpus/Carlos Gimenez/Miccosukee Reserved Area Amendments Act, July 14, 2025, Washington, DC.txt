Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act

Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill,  H.R. 504, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act. This bipartisan  legislation ensures that the Miccosukee Tribe has the legal authority  to manage, protect, and preserve their land and continue their  traditional way of life.

Specifically, the bill amends the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act to  include the Osceola Camp, an inhabited Tribal village located within  the heart of Florida's Everglades. The Osceola Camp is not only home to  Tribal members, but it is also a site of historical and cultural  importance.

Including this land in the reserved area will empower the Tribe to  protect their community, manage water flow into the Everglades National  Park, and raise structures within the camp to prevent catastrophic  flooding. The Everglades is the largest subtropical wilderness in the  continental United States and one of the most unique ecosystems on the  planet.

For generations, the Miccosukee Tribe has served as a responsible  steward of the fragile environment. Their leadership in conservation,  water management, and environmental protection has helped preserve the  natural beauty, the biodiversity, and the cultural heritage of south  Florida.

This bill is about fairness and conservation. It ensures the  Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their home, their land,  and their way of life.

I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto) for cosponsoring this  measure. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 504.
