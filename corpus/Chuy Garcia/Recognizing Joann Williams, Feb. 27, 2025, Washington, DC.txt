Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Black History  Month, I rise to recognize Joann Williams, a dedicated leader in  Illinois' Fourth Congressional District and a pillar of the LeClaire- Hearst community on Chicago's southwest side.

Joann is a U.S. Army disabled veteran who has dedicated her life to  service both in uniform and in her neighborhood. She has spent decades  being a driving force of opportunity, making sure to uplift her  community and ensure that other veterans receive the respect that they  deserve.

As the founder of the Hearst Community Organization, she has fought  for jobs and public spaces and to secure critical resources to help  people lead better lives. Her dedication reflects the resilience we  honor this month.

Mr. Speaker, Joann's unwavering service has left a lasting impact and  touched countless families. I thank her for her sacrifice to our  country and her service to community.
