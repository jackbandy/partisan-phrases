Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 100th  anniversary of the Stickney Police Association, the oldest organization  in the Village of Stickney, located in Illinois' 4th Congressional  District. For a century, the members of this association have been a  positive presence in the community. They have raised funds to support  youth athletics, clubs, churches, schools, and both the Fire and Police  departments.

Beyond their philanthropic work, the Stickney Police Association has  played a vital role in building and maintaining trust within our  community. They understand the importance of supporting one another and  serving all members of the community with respect and care.

Our community appreciates their ongoing efforts to keep us safe and  supported.

I thank the Stickney Police Association for their unwavering  commitment to service and their dedication to our community and each  other. Congratulations on their centennial celebration.
