Senate Budget Committee Approves Trade Legislation


The Senate Budget Committee today approved H.R. 5430, The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act. The agreement is designed to boost economic growth by modernizing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The bill was previously approved by the Senate Finance Committee last week and by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee earlier today. In addition, the bill was also referred to the Senate Committees on Appropriations, Commerce, Science and Transportation, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and Foreign Relations.

"This is a modern trade deal built to work for modern businesses," Chairman Enzi said. "For many industries like agriculture, machinery and minerals, this deal would help create and maintain quality jobs in Wyoming while fostering new innovation and fairer trade across the board."
