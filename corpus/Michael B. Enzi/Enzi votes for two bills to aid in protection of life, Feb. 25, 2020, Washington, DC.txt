Enzi votes for two bills to aid in protection of life


In a series of votes today on the Senate floor, U.S. Senator Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., voted in support of two bills that would have helped to protect human life. Both bills failed to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance.

The first bill, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, would have banned abortions beginning at 20 weeks with exceptions for rape, incest or to save the mother's life. The second bill, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, would have required health care practitioners to provide medical care to a fetus that survives an abortion procedure.

"The ideas in these bills were well accepted, internationally-recognized norms that would have helped safeguard the sanctity of human life," Enzi said. "Did you know that the United States is only one of seven countries, including China and North Korea, where an unborn child can be killed by elective abortion after 20 weeks? We also don't have any federal protection to ensure that children delivered alive following an attempted abortion will receive medical care. These bills were not radical changes but would have provided commonsense protections for the preservation of life.

Enzi was a cosponsor to both pieces of legislation. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act was led by Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act was led by U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, R-Neb.
