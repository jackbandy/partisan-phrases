Senator Enzi's COVID-19 (coronavirus) information


While Wyoming often prides itself on being isolated from the mainstream, it is certainly not immune to all the world health crises. As the number of COVID-19, or coronavirus, cases rise in the United States, it is important that we take precautions to keep ourselves and our communities safe.

So far, Congress has passed two coronavirus relief packages. The first, which the Senate passed on March 5, was an emergency funding package that focused on vaccines and research and development. The second, which the Senate passed on March 18, was the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. It provides for free testing for those who need it, paid sick leave and unemployment benefits. Congress is working on additional packages that could include economic support such as direct payments and small business loans.

America has not had a semi-quarantine like this in my lifetime. We must take it upon ourselves, following cautionary steps, to slow the spread of this virus within our communities.

My office is taking appropriate precautions but is planning on continuing operations to assist constituents.
