Enzi supports new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico


U.S. Senator Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., joined his colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee today to vote in support of the United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement (USMCA), bringing the deal one step closer to final approval. Enzi said the new agreement would help boost economic growth in Wyoming and across the country by modernizing the quarter-of-a-century old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

"This is a modern trade deal built to work for modern businesses," Enzi said. "Wyoming workers have a lot to gain in opportunities from this agreement. The state is invested in many markets that export across North America. For many industries like agriculture, machinery and minerals, this deal would help create and maintain quality jobs in the state while fostering new innovation and fairer trade across the board."

In 2018, Wyoming produced about $270 million exports to Canada and Mexico, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The Senate Finance Committee projected that between the United States, Canada and Mexico, trade was worth nearly $1.4 trillion in 2018.

While Enzi said he supports the USMCA trade deal, he noted his disappointment that important intellectual property protections for biologic medicines were left out of the agreement. Enzi will work to see that future trade deals include strong intellectual property protections that protect American innovation.
