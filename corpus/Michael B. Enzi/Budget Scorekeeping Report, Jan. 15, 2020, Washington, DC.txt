Budget Scorekeeping Report


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for January 2020. This is my third scorekeeping  report since I filed the deemed budget resolution for fiscal year 2020  on September 9, 2019, as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019,  BBA19. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues  with the amounts agreed to in BBA19. In the Senate, this information is  used to determine whether budgetary points of order lie against pending  legislation. The Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the  Congressional Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to  section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act CBA. The information  included in this report is current through January 7, 2020. 

  Since I filed the last scorekeeping report on December 4, 2019, four  measures with significant enforceable budgetary effects have been  enacted. 

  The first measure enacted this reporting period, H.R. 5363, the  Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education  Act, FUTURE Act, cleared the Senate by voice vote and became P.L. 116- 91. The bill included two provisions with significant cost over the 10- year period: a permanent extension of mandatory funding for  historically Black colleges and universities and additional mandatory  funding for the Pell Grant program. To offset these provisions, the  measure allows the Department of Education to access taxpayer data when  administering Federal student aid programs. Overall, CBO estimates that  the FUTURE Act would reduce outlays by $997 million in the first year,  $835 million over 5 years, and $435 million over 10 years. This measure  was charged to the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 

  The second measure enacted this reporting period was the conference  report to accompany S. 1790, the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2020. This measure, which became P.L. 116-92 and was  charged to the Armed Services Committee, authorized appropriations for  the Nation's national defense apparatus for the current fiscal year. In  addition to the authorization of funds, the conference report included  changes in law, notably to the Survivor Benefit Program, that would  affect direct spending and revenues. According to CBO's estimate, the  measure would increase direct spending by $5.6 billion over the 2020 to  2029 period. 

  The third measure, H.R. 1158, the Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2020, became P.L. 116-93. This bill provided funding for fiscal year  2020 programs within the jurisdictions of four Senate appropriations  subcommittees, including Defense, Commerce-Justice-Science, Financial  Services and General Government, and Homeland Security. CBO estimated  that the bill would bring total budget authority provided for programs  covered by these four subcommittees to $860.3 billion in fiscal year  2020. Of the amounts provided, $767.6 billion was considered regular  appropriations and $92.6 billion qualified for cap adjustments under  existing law. 

  The final measure with significant effects enacted this reporting  period was H.R. 1865, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2020. This bill, which became P.L. 116-94, provided appropriations for  fiscal year 2020 for the remaining eight Senate appropriations  subcommittees, extended numerous expiring programs and tax provisions,  repealed several healthcare taxes, expanded access to retirement plans,  provided additional resources for pensions for miners, and contained  several provisions related to various foreign policy initiatives. CBO  estimated that divisions A-H of the bill, which provided discretionary  appropriations, would bring total appropriated budget authority for  covered programs to $539.9 billion in fiscal year 2020. Of the amount  provided, $520.4 billion was provided as regular appropriations and  $19.5 billion qualified for cap adjustments under existing law. CBO  further estimated that divisions I--Q of the bill would increase  deficits by $408.9 billion over the 2020 through 2029 period. Divisions  A--H were charged to the Appropriations Committee; divisions I and K  were charged to the Banking Committee; division J was charged to the  Foreign Relations Committee; division L was charged to the Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs Committee; divisions M, N, O, and Q  were charged to the Finance Committee; and division P was charged to  the Commerce Committee. The measure passed the Senate by a vote of 71  to 23. 

  Budget Committee Republican staff prepared tables A-D. 

  Table A gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays  under the fiscal year 2020 deemed budget resolution. This information  is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of  the CBA. Legislation enacted to date has resulted in six authorizing  committees breaching their allocations provided by BBA19. In total  authorizing committees have breached outlay limitations by more than  $29.1 billion over the 2020 through 2029 period. 

  Table B provides the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. The table shows  that the Appropriations Committee is compliant with spending limits for  current the fiscal year. Those limits for regular discretionary  spending are $666.5 billion for accounts in the defense category and  $621.5 billion for accounts in the nondefense category of spending. 

  The 2018 budget resolution contained points of order limiting the use  of changes in mandatory programs, CHIMPs, in appropriations bills.  Table C, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 billion for 2020, shows  the Appropriations Committee has complied with the CHIMP limit for this  fiscal year. CHIMPs enacted as part of the 2020 appropriations cycle  include $5.7 billion from changes to the Crime Victims Fund and $9.3  billion in changes to accounts related to the Children's Health  Insurance Program.  

  Table D provides the amount of budget authority enacted for 2020 that  has been designated as either for an emergency or for overseas  contingency operations pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced  Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. Funding  that receives either of these designations results in cap adjustments  to enforceable discretionary spending limits. There is no limit on  either emergency or overseas contingency operations spending; however,  any Senator may challenge the designation with a point of order to  strike the designation on the floor. To date, more than $88.0 billion  has been enacted with either the emergency or overseas contingency  operations designations for the 2020 appropriations cycle. 

  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress. 

  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for 2020, table 1, which  helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA  section 311. Following the enactment of the two minibus appropriations  bills in December and the continued spending of authorizing committees,  the current level is now in excess of allowable levels by $15.4 billion  for budget authority and $1.7 billion for outlays in 2020. Details on  2020 levels can be found in CBO's second table. 

  Current-law revenues are currently below enforceable levels for all  enforcement periods. Due to the enactment of the Further Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2020, and to a lesser extent this year's national  defense authorization bill, revenues are currently $34.4 billion,  $150.7 billion, and $386.2 billion lower than assumed in the deemed  budget resolution for 2020, 2020 through 2024, and 2020 through 2029,  respectively. Social Security spending levels are consistent with the  budget resolution's figures for 2020; however, Social Security revenue  levels are $15 million below assumed levels. 

  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  pay-as-you-go, pay-go, rule table 3. This rule was established under  section 4106 of the 2018 budget resolution. The Senate pay-go scorecard  currently shows a credit of $965 million in 2020 but deficit increases  of $1.1 billion and $5.2 billion over the 2019-2024 and 2019-2029  periods, respectively. Please note that the deficit effects of division  I through division Q of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2020 are excluded from the Senate's pay-go scorecard pursuant to title  X of division I of that law. 

  This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on  September 9, 2019. I raised two points of order during this reporting  period. On December 17, 2019, I raised the long-term deficits point of  order against the national defense authorization conference report for  increasing deficits by more than $5 billion in years following the  current budget window. That point of order was waived by a vote of 82  to 12. On December 19, 2019, I raised the same point of order against  the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, but that was also  waived with a vote of 64 to 30. 

  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.

U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                   Washington, DC, January 15, 2020.      Hon. Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 

       Dear Mr. Chairman:  The enclosed report shows the effects       of Congressional action on the fiscal year 2020 budget and is       current through January 7, 2020. This report is submitted       under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the       Congressional Budget Act, as amended. 

       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on       September 9, 2019, pursuant to section 204 of the Bipartisan       Budget Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-37). 

       Since our last letter dated December 4, 2020, the Congress       has cleared and the President has signed the following       legislation that has significant effects on budget authority       and outlays in fiscal year 2020: Fostering Undergraduate       Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (Public Law       116-91); National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2020 (Public Law 116-92); Consolidated Appropriations Act,       2020 (Public Law 116-93); and Further Consolidated       Appropriations Act, 2020 (Public Law 116-94).

  require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the 

  Department of Health and Human Services--in particular the Food and 

  Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health--be excluded 

  from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 

  Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the 

  Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 

  (Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this 

  report do not include $567 million in budget authority and $798 

  million in estimated outlays. \b\ For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget 

  Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not 

  include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. 

  As a result, amounts in this current level report do not include those 

  items. \c\ Section 124 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020 (division A 

  of P.L. 116-59), appropriated funding for the Ukraine Security 

  Assistance Initiative (within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on 

  Defense) and designated those amounts as funding for overseas 

  contingency operations. That provision took effect upon enactment on 

  September 27, 2019. \d\ In consultation with the House and Senate Committees on the Budget 

  and the Office of Management and Budget, rescissions of emergency 

  funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant 

  to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 

  Control Act of 1985 shall not count for certain budgetary enforcement 

  purposes. These amounts, which are not included in the current level 

  totals, are as follows:   ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Budget                                     Authority     Outlays      Revenues ------------------------------------------------------------------------     Further Consolidated                    -7            0           0      Appropriations Act, 2020      (Division H, P.L. 116-94)... ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \e\ Section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 requires the 

  Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget to publish the 

  aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2020; those 

  aggregate levels were first published in the Congressional Record on 

  September 9, 2019. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget 

  has the authority to revise the budgetary aggregates for the budgetary 

  effects of certain revenue and spending measures pursuant to the
