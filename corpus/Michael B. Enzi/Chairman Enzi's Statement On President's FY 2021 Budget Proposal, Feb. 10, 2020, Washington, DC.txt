Chairman Enzi's Statement On President's FY 2021 Budget Proposal


Senator Mike Enzi (R-WY), Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, issued the following statement today on the President's fiscal year 2021 budget proposal:

"Presidents' budgets are a reflection of Administration priorities, but in the end, they are just a list of suggestions, as the power of the purse rests with Congress," said Chairman Enzi.  "Bipartisan consensus will be necessary to bring our debt and deficits under control.  I hope to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put our country on a more sustainable fiscal course."
