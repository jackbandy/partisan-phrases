Enzi supports bipartisan, bicameral legislation to improve hemophilia patients' access to health care


U.S. Senator Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., joined a bipartisan group of senators and representatives in introducing legislation that would improve access to critical health care services for individuals with hemophilia.

Currently, Medicare patients with the bleeding disorder are frequently denied access to clotting factor therapies -- which can exceed $10,000 a day -- because of the program's per-diem reimbursement rates. The Hemophilia Skilled Nursing Facilities Access Act, led by U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, D-N.J., would add treatments for hemophilia to the list of services paid for by Medicare. 

"Medicare patients with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders require specialized treatments to recover after being hospitalized, but they currently face challenges when they try to receive this critical care," Enzi said. "By changing the payment structure for these important treatments, we can help make sure these patients have access to the care they need."

There are almost 15,500 SNFs across the U.S. that provide short-term, intensive, inpatient rehabilitation services to more than 1.35 million people who no longer need to be in a hospital setting but still require health care services.

The legislation was also cosponsored by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and U.S. Representatives Debbie Dingell, D-MI-12, Darin LaHood, R-IL-18, Brian Higgins, D-NY-26, and Gus Bilirakis, R-FL-12.
