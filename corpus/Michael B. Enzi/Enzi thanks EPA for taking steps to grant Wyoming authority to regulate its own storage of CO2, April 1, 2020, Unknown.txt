Enzi thanks EPA for taking steps to grant Wyoming authority to regulate its own storage of CO2


U.S. Senator Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., applauded the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for proposing a new rule that would allow the state of Wyoming primary enforcement authority over Class VI underground injection wells, which are used for storing carbon dioxide (CO2).

Enzi said Wyoming has been a leader in clean coal technologies like carbon capture and sequestration, which are important for reducing emissions. He said this, along with other efforts, help to ensure America is able to viably use all of its energy sources so we have affordable options.

"In Wyoming, we know that you have to be willing to invest in technological innovation to create a more sustainable future for coal and our energy industry, and this announcement proves that our state is effective in these efforts," Enzi said. "What Wyoming is doing is working. The decision to move closer toward giving our state authority to run its own program provides hope that Wyoming will continue to be a leader in fueling the nation."

Once final, Wyoming will join North Dakota as the only two states with primary enforcement authority for underground injection control of Class VI wells.

The Safe Drinking Water Act requires EPA to develop underground injection control program requirements to protect sources of drinking water. States, territories and tribes adopt these rules but can submit applications to become the primary regulatory body. The EPA is now accepting public comments on the decision for 45 days.
