Enzi: Expired Programs Cost Govt. Hundreds of Billions of Dollars


Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi (R-WY) said federal programs with expired authorizations are costing the government hundreds of billions of dollars every year, after a new report was issued by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).  CBO analyzed all the programs and activities funded by Congress through the annual appropriations process and found that hundreds have authorizations that expired or will expire this fiscal year. CBO found that the federal government is on pace to spend around $332 billion in fiscal year 2020 on programs with expired authorizations, an increase from $307 billion for fiscal year 2019.   Many of the current unauthorized programs have been expired for a decade or more, with some expiring more than thirty years ago.

"It is time for Congress to take a close look at what we are actually funding," said Chairman Enzi.  "Lawmakers should review and authorize programs and activities before they fund them. This could help improve government programs that are not delivering results, including by reconsidering a program's purpose and imposing some accountability. Most important, going back to re-examine what we are funding could prevent duplication and overlap in federal programs."
