Budget Scorekeeping Report


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for June 2020. This is my first scorekeeping report  since I filed the deemed budget resolution for fiscal year 2021 on May  4, 2020, as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, BBA19. The  report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues with the  amounts agreed to in BBA19. In the Senate, this information is used to  determine whether budgetary points of order lie against pending  legislation. The Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the  Congressional Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to  section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act (CBA). The information  included in this report is current through June 1, 2020. 

  In general, my filing of May 4 established the following enforceable  budgetary levels: (1) allocations for fiscal year 2021 for the  Committee on Appropriations; (2) allocations for fiscal years 2021,  2021 through 2025, and 2021 through 2030 for committees other than the  Committee on Appropriations; (3) aggregate spending levels for fiscal  year 2021; (4) aggregate revenue levels for fiscal year 2021, 2021  through 2025, and 2021 through 2030; and (5) aggregate levels of  outlays and revenue for fiscal years 2021, 2021 through 2025, and 2021  through 2030 for Social Security. Allocations and aggregates for fiscal  year 2020 were not overridden by this filing and continue to be  enforced under the fiscal year 2020 deemed budget that was filed on  September 9, 2019. 

  The figures underpinning the new enforceable levels are based on the  discretionary spending limits set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act of  2019 and CBO's March 2020 baseline, adjusted to reflect legislation  enacted between the publication of the baseline and my May 4 filing.  Enforceable figures in this filing exclude the direct budgetary effects  of provisions in legislation enacted after the release of the baseline  that were designated as an emergency pursuant to section 4112 of the  fiscal year 2018 congressional budget resolution, H. Con. Res. 71,  115th Congress. 

  Budget Committee Republican staff prepared Tables A-G. 

  Table A gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or falls below its allocations for budget authority and outlays  under the fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021 deemed budget  resolutions. This information is used for enforcing committee  allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. To date, eight  committees are out of compliance with their allocations for fiscal year  2020, however no committees have breached their newly released  allocations this cycle. 

  Tables B and C provide the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. The tables show  that the Appropriations Committee is compliant with spending limits for  fiscal years 2020 and 2021. The figures included in Table C reflect  advanced and permanent appropriations that have already been enacted  but will become available for obligation in fiscal year 2021.  

  Tables D and E display figures related to limits on the use of  changes in mandatory programs, CHIMPs in appropriations bills. These  $15 billion limits, found in the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution for  fiscal year 2020 and section 207 of BBA19 for fiscal year 2021,  currently show the Appropriations Committee in compliance. 

  Tables F and G provide the amount of budget authority enacted for  2020 and 2021, respectively, that have been designated as either for an  emergency or for overseas contingency operations, OCO, pursuant to  section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit  Control Act of 1985, as amended. Funding that receives either of these  designations results in cap adjustments to enforceable discretionary  spending limits. There is no limit on either emergency or OCO spending;  however, any Senator may challenge the designation with a point of  order to strike the designation on the floor. 

  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress. 

  Because legislation can still be enacted that would have an effect on  fiscal year 2020, CBO provided spending and revenue reports for both  fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021. This information is used to  enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA  section 311. CBO's estimates show that current levels of spending for  fiscal year 2020 exceed amounts in last year's budget resolution by  $68.6 billion in budget authority and $55.1 billion in outlays, 2020,  Tables 1-2. Revenues are $114.8 billion below the revenue floor. As  well, Social Security outlays are at levels assumed for 2020, while  Social Security revenues are $16 million above levels assumed in  budget. 

  For fiscal year 2021, the current law levels are $1,180.0 billion and  $667.8 billion in budget authority and outlays, respectively, below  allowable levels, 2021, Tables 1-2. This spending room will be spent  down as regular appropriations bills are enacted for fiscal year 2021.  Revenues and Social Security levels are at the levels assumed by the  fiscal year 2021 deemed budget. CBO's report also provides information  needed to enforce the Senate pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule, 2021, Table 3.  This rule is enforced under section 4106 of the 2018 budget resolution.  The scorecard stands at zero for all enforceable levels consistent with  the filing of newly deemed budget levels. 

  This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on May  4, 2020. Since that filing, no points of order have been raised. 

  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.

       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on       September 9, 2019, pursuant to section 204 of the Bipartisan       Budget Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-37).

  through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services--in particular the Food and Drug Administration 

  and the National Institutes of Health--be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and 

  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment 

  Control Act of 1974 (Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include 

  $567 million in budget authority and $798 million in estimated outlays. b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the aggregate spending 

  and revenue levels for 2020 published in the Congressional Record on September 9, 2019, by the Chairman of the 

  Senate Committee on the Budget pursuant to section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-37) do 

  not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this 

  current level report do not include those items. c Section 124 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020 (division A of P.L. 116-59), appropriated funding for 

  the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Defense) and 

  designated those amounts as funding for overseas contingency operations. That provision took effect upon 

  enactment on September 27, 2019. d In consultation with the House and Senate Committees on the Budget and the Office of Management and Budget, 

  rescissions of emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 

  251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 shall not count for certain 

  budgetary enforcement purposes. These amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as 

  follows:                                                                         Budget                                                                   Authority         Outlays          Revenues ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Division H,                  -7                0               0  P.L. 116-94)................................................ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- e Spending and Revenue effects designated as an emergency pursuant to Section 4112 of H.

  Department of Health and Human Services--in particular the Food and 

  Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health--be excluded 

  from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 

  Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the

  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-37) do not include budget 

  authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, 

  amounts in this current level report do not include those items. c Current level excludes $68,534 million in budget authority, $72,977 in 

  estimated outlays and all revenue effects resulting from funds

  and revenue levels for fiscal year 2021; those aggregate levels were 

  first published in the Congressional Record on May 4, 2020. The Chair 

  of the Senate Committee on the Budget has the authority to revise the 

  budgetary aggregates for the budgetary effects of certain revenue and 

  spending measures pursuant to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and
