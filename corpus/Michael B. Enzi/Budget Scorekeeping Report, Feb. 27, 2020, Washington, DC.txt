Budget Scorekeeping Report


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for February 2020. This is my fourth scorekeeping  report since I filed the deemed budget resolution for fiscal year 2020  on September 9, 2019, as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019,  BBA19. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues  with the amounts agreed to in BBA19. In the Senate, this information is  used to determine whether budgetary points of order lie against pending  legislation. The Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the  Congressional Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to  section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, CBA. The information  included in this report is current through February 21, 2020. 

  Since I filed the last scorekeeping report on January 15, 2020, only  one measure was enacted with significant budgetary effects. On January  29, 2020, the President signed H.R. 5430, the United States-Mexico- Canada Agreement--USMCA--Implementation Act, into law. The measure  implemented the USMCA and affected both revenue and spending. According  to CBO, the USMCA Implementation Act will decrease direct spending  outlays by $74 million over 10 years and increase revenues by nearly $3  billion over the same period. Direct spending effects are largely  attributable to the act's provisions related to the dairy industry,  while revenues are expected to increase due to higher receipts from  tariffs on motor vehicles and parts. The USMCA Implementation Act also  included $843 million in discretionary appropriations, designated as  emergency spending, for Federal agencies to execute the agreement. 

  Budget Committee Republican staff prepared tables A-D. 

  Table A gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or falls below its allocations for budget authority and outlays  under the fiscal year 2020 deemed budget resolution. This information  is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of  the CBA. Legislation enacted since the enactment of BBA19 has resulted  in six authorizing committees being in breach of their allocations. The  direct spending effects of the USMCA Implementation Act were credited  to the Finance Committee, which continues to violate its allocation  over all enforceable periods. In total, authorizing committees have  breached outlay limitations by more than $29 billion over the 2020  through 2029 period. 

  Table B provides the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. The table shows  that the Appropriations Committee is compliant with spending limits for  current the fiscal year. Those limits for regular discretionary  spending are $666.5 billion for accounts in the defense category and  $621.5 billion for accounts in the nondefense category of spending. 

  The 2018 budget resolution contained points of order limiting the use  of changes in mandatory programs, CHIMPs, in appropriations bills.  Table C, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 billion for 2020, shows  the Appropriations Committee has complied with the CHIMP limit for this  fiscal year. 

  Table D provides the amount of budget authority enacted for 2020 that  has been designated as either for an emergency or for overseas  contingency operations, OCO, pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the  Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.  Funding that receives either of these designations results in cap  adjustments to enforceable discretionary spending limits. There is no  limit on either emergency or overseas contingency operations spending;  however, any Senator may challenge the designation with a point of  order to strike the designation on the floor. The addition of $843  million in emergency-designated funds from P.L. 116-113 brings total  emergency and OCO spending to $88.9 billion for the 2020 appropriations  cycle. 

  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress. 

  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for 2020, Table 1, which  helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA  section 311. The current level is now in excess of allowable levels by  $15.4 billion for budget authority and $1.7 billion for outlays in  2020. Details on 2020 levels can be found in CBO's second table. 

  Current-law revenues are currently below enforceable levels for all  enforcement periods. Revenues are currently $34.4 billion, $150  billion, and $383.2 billion lower than assumed in the deemed budget  resolution for 2020, 2020 through 2024, and 2020 through 2029,  respectively. 

  Social Security spending levels are consistent with the budget  resolution's figures for 2020; however, Social Security revenue levels  are $15 million below assumed levels. CBO's report also provides  information needed to enforce the Senate pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule,  Table 3. This rule is enforced under section 4106 of the 2018 budget  resolution. The Senate PAYGO scorecard currently shows an enacted  deficit decrease of $984 million in 2020, but enacted deficit increases  of $361 million and $2.2 billion over the 2019-2024 and 2019-2029  periods, respectively. The deficit effects of the USMCA Implementation  Act do not include the amounts designated as supplemental  appropriations because those amounts are recorded as discretionary  spending, which is not recorded on the Senate's PAYGO scorecard. 

  This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on  September 9, 2019. Since my last filing, one point of order was raised.  On January 16, 2020, Senator Toomey raised a point of order against the  emergency designations in the supplemental appropriations title of the  USMCA Implementation Act. That point of order was waived by a vote of  78-21. 

  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.

Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 

       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2020 budget and is       current through February 21, 2020. This report is submitted       under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the       Congressional Budget Act, as amended. 

       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on       September 9, 2019, pursuant to section 204 of the Bipartisan       Budget Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-37). 

       Since our last letter dated January 15, 2020, the Congress       has cleared, and the President has signed, the United States-      Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (P.L. 116-113).       That Act has significant effects on budget authority and       outlays in fiscal year 2020.            Sincerely,                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                                                          Director.

  through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services--in particular the Food and Drug Administration 

  and the National Institutes of Health--be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and 

  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and lmpoundment 

  Control Act of 1974 (Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include 

  $567 million in budget authority and $798 million in estimated outlays. b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as 

  approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a 

  result, amounts in this current level report do not include those items. c Section 124 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020 (division A of P.L. 116-59), appropriated funding for 

  the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Defense) and 

  designated those amounts as funding for overseas contingency operations. That provision took effect upon 

  enactment on September 27, 2019. d In consultation with the House and Senate Committees on the Budget and the Office of Management and Budget, 

  rescissions of emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 

  251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 shall not count for certain 

  budgetary enforcement purposes. These amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as 

  follows:                                                                         Budget                                                                   Authority         Outlays          Revenues ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Division H,                  -7                0               0  P.L. 116-94)................................................ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- e Section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 requires the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget 

  to publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2020; those aggregate levels were first 

  published in the Congressional Record on September 9, 2019. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget 

  has the authority to revise the budgetary aggregates for the budgetary effects of certain revenue and spending 

  measures pursuant to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and H.Con.Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent 

  resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, as updated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019.
