Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the  following proclamation commemorating the Multi-Year Reunion of Amanda  Elzy High School located in Greenwood, Mississippi, and recognizing the  pivotal role it played in the Civil Rights Movement.

Whereas the House of Representatives joins the graduates of       Amanda Elzy High School and the citizens of Mississippi in       honoring the school on occasion of its multi-class reunion;

Whereas Amanda Elzy High School is named in honor of Dr.       Amanda Elzy, a distinguished educator and trailblazer who       helped cofound Mississippi Valley State University and was       the first Black woman to serve as Assistant Superintendent of       the Leflore County School System;

Whereas Amanda Elzy High School, located in the heart of       the Mississippi Delta in Greenwood, Mississippi, stands as a       beacon of resilience, education, and racial progress since       its founding in 1959;

Whereas, the school's establishment followed a       consequential moment in the Civil Rights Movement,       symbolizing the demand for equality in education and the       enduring pursuit of justice in Leflore County and beyond;

Whereas the legacy of Amanda Elzy High School lives on       through its alumni-many of whom have remained in Mississippi       and work tirelessly to improve their communities, including       through civic engagement, grassroots organizing, and       philanthropic leadership;

Whereas more than 130 alumni from the graduating classes of       the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s are expected to gather for the       Amanda Elzy Multi-Year Reunion, to be held on August 28-29,       2025, at the Leflore County Civic Center;

Whereas this reunion not only honors the rich legacy of       Amanda Elzy High School but also seeks to highlight the       school's uncertain future due to funding challenges-making       this celebration both a joyful and urgent call to preserve an       institution that has served generations.

Now, therefore, be it Resolved, that the House of       Representatives commemorates and honors the Amanda Elzy High       School Multi-Year Reunion and the alumni for their lifelong       commitment to education, community, and the values of       progress and equity that the school embodies.
