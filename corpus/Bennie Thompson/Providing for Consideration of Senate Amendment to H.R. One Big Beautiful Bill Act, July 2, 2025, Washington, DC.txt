Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, Republicans are openly bragging about how the bill kicks  children and the elderly off Medicaid, nutritional assistance, and  more, all to pay for another tax break for wealthy Republican donors.

My Republican colleagues are not talking about the trillions and  trillions of dollars their political giveaway is going to cost. In  fact, Mr. Speaker, Vice President Vance has said historic levels of  Homeland Security funding in the bill sweetens the deal for the devil.

This deal means billions of American tax dollars to build a wall  Trump promised Mexico would pay for.

This bill means billions of dollars for masked ICE agents to  terrorize immigrant families who have been contributing to our country  for decades, including law-abiding marines and even American kids.

This bill means billions of dollars for DHS to continue obstructing  Congress and denying due process to legal immigrants.

My Republican colleagues may be fooled by the one big, ugly bill, but  the American people are not. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  rule and the underlying bill.
