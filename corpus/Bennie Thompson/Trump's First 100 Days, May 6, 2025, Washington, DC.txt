Trump's First 100 Days

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the  challenges and burdens placed on Black Americans during the first 100  days of the Trump Administration. Donald Trump is undoing the progress  African Americans have fought for, threatening justice, equality, and  our democracy. His administration has cut jobs, programs, and services  that help Black professionals, students, and business owners thrive.  Mississippi's public universities invested over $23 million in DEI  programs that supported Black students, and now those programs are at  risk. Donald Trump has also removed protections for minority-owned  businesses, weakened civil rights enforcement, and cut funding for  public health research, all while costs rise. More than 664,000  Mississippians are at risk of losing Medicaid. Black families, already  facing chronic illness and poor healthcare access, will bear the full  burden. Head Start, which serves nearly 20,000 children in Mississippi,  is also in danger. Black children, who already face significant  barriers to education, will be hit the hardest. These cuts cause actual  harm and send the message that Black lives and futures don't matter. We  deserve leadership that sees, hears, and fights for us. And we won't  stop demanding it.
