One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, we are here in the dark of  night because President Trump has one goal: to pass massive tax cuts  for billionaires by cruelly stealing healthcare away from millions of  Americans.

H.R. 1, the ``One Big Ugly Bill,'' isn't about securing the border,  and it never has been.

The bill recklessly throws an enormous amount of taxpayer money at  the border to buy the votes of Republicans who are reluctant to support  the GOP tax scam and devastating Medicaid cuts.

Just tonight, Republicans snuck into the bill a $12 billion  ``Lonestar Kickback'' to give Texas Governor Greg Abbott a handout for  his unconstitutional border security operations.

The ``One Big Ugly Bill'' gives the Trump administration billions to  ramp up mass detentions and deportations, including American children  with cancer, and deny due process to whomever they can, including those  in the country legally.

The ``One Big Ugly Bill'' spends $46.5 billion on Trump's failed  border wall--which Trump originally said Mexico would pay for.

That amount is nearly four times what Trump originally promised the  wall would cost, and it is ten times what the bill spends on Customs  and Border Protection personnel.

The ``One Big Ugly Bill'' allows the Homeland Security Department to  create a slush fund that will enable the worst impulses of the Trump  administration, like private jets for the Secretary and securing the  President's many multi-million-dollar golfing vacations at his branded  properties.
