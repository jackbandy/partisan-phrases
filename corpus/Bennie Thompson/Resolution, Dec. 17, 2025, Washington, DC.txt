Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  resolution.

I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the resolution, and I thank  my colleague from New York for having the moral courage to offer it.

We are a nation of laws. The Trump administration's boat bombings are  illegal under U.S. and international laws. Simply put, these are war  crimes.

Further, the administration has failed to provide Congress with basic  information, even as Trump directs a massive buildup of U.S. forces and  threatens war.

I might add, Mr. Speaker, those of us who have been in so-called  classified briefings still have not received any additional information  beyond what is already in the eyes of the public and on TV.

It is our duty as Congress to rein in the lawless administration and  prevent an illegal war. This is a moment for Members on both sides to  choose order over chaos, morality over expedience, and country over  party. We must rise to the occasion and vote ``yes'' on this  resolution.
