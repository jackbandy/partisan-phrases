Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and commend an outstanding Mississippian, Mr. Casey D. Younger, Sr.,  for his exemplary academic achievements, athletic excellence,  professional success, and recent induction into the Millsaps College  Athletics Hall of Fame.

A native of Vicksburg, Mississippi, Mr. Younger has always  demonstrated a commitment to excellence. A proud graduate of Vicksburg  High School, he went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political  Science from Millsaps College in 2008, where he stood out as both a  scholar and an athlete. He was named to the Dean's List, served as  Chair of the Political Science Club, and received several athletic  honors, including selection to the National Football Foundation  Hampshire Honor Society, the ESPN The Magazine Academic All-District  Team, and NCAA Football All-American honors.

Mr. Younger continued his academic pursuits at the Mississippi  College School of Law, earning his Juris Doctor degree in 2012. During  his time in law school, he was awarded the Best Paper Award in the  Constitutional Law Seminar, the John B. Fareese Trial Advocacy  Scholarship, and the prestigious R. Jess Brown Award. He also held  leadership roles as Vice President of the Black Law Students  Association, Editor of The African American Law School Survival Guide,  Chair of the Thurgood Marshall Trial Practice Team, and served as a  Star Mentor to his peers.

Today, Mr. Younger is a respected attorney based in Jackson,  Mississippi. His primary areas of legal practice include medical  malpractice defense, motor vehicle defense, nursing home and long-term  care defense, premises liability, products liability, and workers'  compensation defense.

His athletic legacy continues to be recognized. In 2021, Mr. Younger  was named to the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC) 30th  Anniversary Football Team and inducted into the Vicksburg Warren School  District's Athletics Hall of Fame. Now, in 2025, Millsaps College has  honored him as a member of its Athletics Hall of Fame--a fitting  recognition of his contributions to collegiate athletics and leadership  on and off the field.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the  remarkable life and accomplishments of M. Casey D. Younger, Sr. He is a  shining example of the talent, discipline, and integrity that  Mississippi produces and a role model for future generations.
