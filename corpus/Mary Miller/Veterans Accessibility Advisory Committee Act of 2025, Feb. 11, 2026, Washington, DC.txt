Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the SAVE America Act ensures  that only American citizens vote in American elections. This should be  the easiest ``yes'' vote this year.

The American people want the SAVE America Act. Mr. Speaker, 83  percent of adults support requiring a photo ID to vote, as do 73  percent of Democrat voters.

Democrat politicians standing here today oppose it, just as they have  opposed every election integrity measure.

Democrats cannot win on their ideas because their agenda has made  life harder for American families.

The Democratic Party knows that cheating is their only path to  victory. Their goal is to replace the votes of American citizens with  those of illegal aliens.

House Republicans are standing up for the American people here today.

Congress has a responsibility to protect the integrity of our  elections. The SAVE America Act upholds that duty.

I urge my colleagues to listen to the American people and vote  ``yes.'' America is watching.
