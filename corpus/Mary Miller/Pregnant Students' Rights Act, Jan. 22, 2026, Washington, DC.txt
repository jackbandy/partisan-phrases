Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 6359, the Pregnant Students' Rights Act.

Mr. Speaker, college can be a challenging environment, especially for  pregnant women. Many feel forced to choose between motherhood and their  education. Nearly 30 percent of all abortions in the United States are  performed on women in college.

Title IX already protects the right of pregnant women to stay in  school. However, many of them face a lack of resources and support.  Some even fear punishment and a loss of scholarships simply for  carrying their baby to full term while taking classes.

The Pregnant Students' Rights Act requires colleges and universities  to inform pregnant women of their rights and protections. This includes  information on modified class schedules or excused absences.

This bill also requires universities to inform pregnant women how to  file a complaint with the Department of Education if their Title IX  protections are violated. Let me be clear: No woman should ever have to  choose between finishing her education or experiencing the joy of  motherhood.

To my colleague on the other side, I have had a similar situation  also, but I do want to thank her for acknowledging that the life within  her was a baby. Women are fully capable of raising children and getting  an education at the same time. I know because I did it.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Hinson for her leadership on the  Pregnant Students' Rights Act.
