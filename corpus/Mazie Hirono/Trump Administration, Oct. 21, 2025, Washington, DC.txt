Ms. HIRONO. Yes. Would my colleague yield for a question?

Ms. HIRONO. First of all, I commend you for holding the floor to  raise issues of such concern to the American people.

I want to focus my question on the corruption of the Trump regime.  This corruption is rampant and unending, from making untold sums off  meme coins to the latest outrage, demanding that the Department of  Justice pay him more than $200 million. That is taxpayers' money that  he wants to get his hands on. We have a President putting his financial  interests before the best interests of the American people.

This is the classic Trump playbook: using the power of his office to  make a profit at the expense of the American people and as a  distraction from the chaos and cruelty that he is sowing every single  day. It is classic authoritarianism, using the tools of government to  enrich himself, reward his friends, and punish his enemies.

So I am asking my colleague: What kind of threat does this blatant  corruption pose to our democracy, our institutions, and on the American  people?

Ms. HIRONO. Certainly.

So the rampant corruption of this regime, what kind of threat does  this blatant corruption pose to our democracy, our institutions, and  the American people?
