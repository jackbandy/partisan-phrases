Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Neabsco Baptist  Church located in Woodbridge, Virginia for their extraordinary  commitment to serving families in need.

During the height of pandemic, the church created the Food Giveaway  Program to help members from the congregation put food on their tables.  As the harmful impacts of the pandemic spread throughout the Prince  William County, the church expanded its mission--opening its doors to  the entire community.

As of today, volunteers come together once a week to package and  distribute food boxes to families across the community. What started as  a small operation has now grown into a critical lifeline for thousands.  The Neabsco Baptist Church has now provided food to over 5 million  families, ensuring that no one goes hungry.

I want to personally thank the Neabsco Baptist Church and all the  volunteers for their unwavering commitment and generosity. Having had  the opportunity to join them alongside my team to pack food boxes, I  have witnessed firsthand their compassion and dedication.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the  Neabsco Baptist Church for the lasting impact it has made on the lives  of families throughout the Prince William County community.
