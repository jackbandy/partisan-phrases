Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and welcome His All- Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, D.C. He serves  as the spiritual leader and Primus inter Pares (First among Equals) of  Orthodox Christianity worldwide, a Church of 300 million people.

Later this month, His All-Holiness will visit the United States to  receive the Templeton Prize, the world's most prestigious international  award at the intersection of religion and science. This honor is  awarded annually to those who advance Sir John Templeton's vision of  progress in religion through discoveries and insights that deepen our  understanding across faiths. Since being elected Ecumenical Patriarch,  Bartholomew has been a courageous voice for unity, religious freedom,  and environmental stewardship. His leadership has left a lasting mark  on both the Orthodox world and the entire global community.

This will not be his first visit to the United States. When he came  in 1997, he was received in the Oval Office by President Bill Clinton  and First Lady Hillary Clinton, who hosted a White House reception in  his honor. He was also presented with the Congressional Gold Medal in  the U.S. Capitol Rotunda by Speaker Newt Gingrich, a rare and  distinguished honor. The State Department hosted him in the Ben  Franklin Room, and Vice President Al Gore welcomed him at a breakfast  at the Vice President's Residence.

These visits remind us of the enduring spiritual and cultural bonds  between the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the United States. As we  prepare to welcome His All-Holiness once again, we recognize not just  the leader of a faith, but a global advocate for justice, peace, and  human dignity.

On behalf of Virginia's 7th District Greek Orthodox community, it is  an honor to welcome him to Washington.
