Constituent of the Week: Joe Clontz


Mr. VINDMAN. Madam Speaker, during this Small Business Week, it is my  honor to recognize Joe Clontz on his receipt of the John L. Stanley  Award from the Orange County Chamber of Commerce.

This award is given to those who are committed to going above and  beyond to support Orange County's business community.

Through Joe's business of providing critical electrical services to  the residents of Orange, he has built a legacy of hard work. What makes  him so deserving of this award is not just what he does at work. It is  the time and energy he devotes to strengthening our community. He has  helped grow local businesses and create new opportunities for the  people of Orange County.

During Small Business Week, I am honored to congratulate him on this  well-earned award and recognize him as this week's Constituent of the  Week.

Madam Speaker, I congratulate Joe and offer my best wishes to him on  continued success.
