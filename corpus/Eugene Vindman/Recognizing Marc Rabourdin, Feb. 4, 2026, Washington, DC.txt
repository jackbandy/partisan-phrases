Recognizing Marc Rabourdin


Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor an exceptional  member of my staff who is moving on to his next chapter.

Marc Rabourdin, my deputy district director, has served the people of  Virginia's Seventh Congressional District with distinction for more  than 4 years.

Marc began his service to the Seventh Congressional District working  for my dear friend and predecessor, former Congresswoman and now  Governor Abigail Spanberger.

He has continued to deliver results for central and Northern Virginia  on my team with the same professionalism and care. From day one, his  dedication has made a real difference in the lives of the people we  serve. Always calm, steady, and deeply knowledgeable, Marc has been a  trusted presence and an invaluable resource to our constituents and our  team.

A true public servant, Marc earned his nickname, the mayor, in our  office because he knows the communities, local leaders, and needs of  the Seventh District better than just about anyone.

Mr. Speaker, while we will miss him, we are grateful for his service  to Virginia's Seventh Congressional District and wish him every success  in his next endeavor serving Virginians.
