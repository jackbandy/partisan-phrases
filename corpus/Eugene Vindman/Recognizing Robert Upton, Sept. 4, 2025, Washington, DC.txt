Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Robert Upton, a  Culpeper native who is training to join the U.S. Navy Submarine Force.

Robert is currently a student at the Naval Submarine School, training  to serve as a sonar technician. Once he graduates, Robert will serve  aboard or in support of a Navy submarine.

Robert is inspired by his father, who was in the Army, and his  grandfather, who was in the Marines during the Vietnam war.

As a 25-year Army veteran and a member of the House Armed Services  Committee, I know just how much our servicemembers sacrifice to serve  this country. That is why, this week, I am recognizing Robert as  Constituent of the Week.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Robert for his service and sacrifice now and  into the future for this Nation. In Congress, I will always work to  deliver for servicemembers like Robert.
