Protecting Details of Ongoing Military Operations

Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, Signalgate is real. Protecting the details  of ongoing military operations is a critical and basic requirement to  ensure our national security and the safety of our military personnel.  I know this from my 25 years in the Army and from my work on the  National Security Council.

I join my colleague, Congressman Pat Ryan, in calling for an  immediate congressional investigation of Signalgate. If the messages  aren't classified and contain no sensitive war plans, as the  administration claims, they should be released immediately.

I am calling for the full conversation to be shared with Congress so  that we can fulfill our oversight role and verify the administration's  accounting of events. If the administration truly believes no lines  were crossed, no war plans discussed, and no classified information  shared, then they should release the messages and let Members of  Congress and the American people see for themselves, as the President  has done in the past, and defend those actions publicly.

The American people deserve transparency and confidence. We must  verify that no laws were broken and ensure our national security isn't  being used as a shield to avoid accountability. American lives are at  stake.
