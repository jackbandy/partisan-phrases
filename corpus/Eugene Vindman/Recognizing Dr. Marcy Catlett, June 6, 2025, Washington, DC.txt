Recognizing Dr. Marcy Catlett


Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the exceptional  leadership of Fredericksburg City Public School Superintendent Dr.  Marci Catlett.

Dr. Catlett has been a trailblazer in implementing forward-thinking  strategies to strengthen her students' well-being.

In the summer of 2024, she launched an initiative to curb cell phone  usage in schools by requiring her students to store their phones for  the entire school day.

As a lawmaker in Congress, leading the effort to remove phones from  schools from bell to bell nationwide, I am grateful for Dr. Catlett's  commitment to helping our students unplug.

As a father of two kids, I know the importance of creating a learning  environment that nurtures the academic success and mental health of our  young folks.

Collaborating with educators like Dr. Catlett has been critical in  working to build a stronger future for Virginia's next generation of  leaders. I extend my deepest gratitude to her for advancing these  critical initiatives.
