Appeasement Invites More Aggression

Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, history has taught us time and time again  that appeasement in the face of aggression and evil only invites more  aggression.

We saw it in the 1930s, and we are seeing echoes of it in the Trump  administration's actions today.

When we hesitate to support Ukraine, we drag our feet, or allow  political infighting to stall critical aid, we are sending a dangerous  message to autocrats, especially China.

Vladimir Putin invaded a sovereign democracy. He is betting that the  free world will grow tired, turn inward, and look away. We cannot let  that happen.

Standing with Ukraine is not charity. It is deterrence and in our  national security interests.

If we do not stand with Ukraine, eventually American troops will be  forced to fight aggressors in East Asia and Europe.

Deterrence is the key to putting them and our national security  first.

Appeasement failed the world before. We cannot afford to repeat that  mistake.
