Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, as a veteran, I cannot support a budget  that would cut $23 billion from care for veterans exposed to burn pits  and toxic substances during their service to our country.

This budget also harms local police by cutting hundreds of millions  to COPS grants and justice assistance grants.

The Federal workers I represent know firsthand the disruptions and  uncertainty that come when lawmakers fail to govern responsibly.  Hardworking Americans understand that if you don't do your job, you  don't get paid. Congress should be no different.

I am proud to work with Congressman Fitzpatrick on a bipartisan  commonsense bill that forces Members of Congress to show up to work  without pay during a shutdown. This would encourage real cooperation,  prevent last-minute crises, and ensure that lawmakers are putting the  American people first.

This budget is an unserious proposal that guts healthcare programs  that Virginians count on. I won't vote for a bill that will lead to  kids, veterans, and seniors losing the care they need.
