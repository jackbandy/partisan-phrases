Peace Talks with Ukraine


Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, we have all seen the recent news on  Ukraine: Zelenskyy is set to meet Putin. Putin must immediately agree  to a 30-day cease-fire. To force that, the United States and President  Trump must increase the pressure on Putin.

This is not a regional fight. Ukraine's sovereignty is a U.S.  national security issue. It is also a humanitarian crisis. As of 2023,  the U.S. State Department had documented the abduction of approximately  20,000 Ukrainian children. That number has only increased. The program  that was keeping track of those children has recently been cut.

These Russian abductions represent a deliberate effort to eliminate  Ukrainian national identity, destroy family ties, and are a specific  element of a genocide crime under international criminal law. The  Russians claim, further, that 700,000 children have been seized. None  of this can stand.

As someone who has traveled over a dozen times to Ukraine in order to  investigate war crimes, I know how important it is that we make a stand  now, not later. We must uphold our American values by seeking peace in  the region and demanding the immediate return of Ukraine's missing  children.

We will see this week whether Mr. Putin shows up for peace talks with  Ukraine in Turkiye or remains an international pariah and coward.
