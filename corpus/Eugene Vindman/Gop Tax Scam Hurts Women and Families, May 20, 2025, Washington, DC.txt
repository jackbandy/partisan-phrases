Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families

Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the extreme  cuts to Medicaid and SNAP being pushed by extreme Washington  Republicans.

Last month, I spoke with Shannon, a mother whose son relies on  Medicaid for lifesaving care. I also spoke with Eugene, a fifth- generation farmer in Culpeper who grows produce that goes straight to  food banks, schools, and churches. Both Shannon and Eugene are facing  uncertain futures because of these cuts.

More than 56,000 kids in Virginia's Seventh Congressional District  rely on Medicaid or SNAP. These cuts would take food away from children  as young as 8 years old. I guess we will just have to give our 8-year- old kids little, tiny boots with little, tiny bootstraps so they can  pull themselves up.

These aren't just budget choices. They are moral ones. They are the  wrong ones. We should support families and the farmers who feed them,  not punish them.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject these cruel cuts and  stand with families and farmers like Shannon and Eugene.
