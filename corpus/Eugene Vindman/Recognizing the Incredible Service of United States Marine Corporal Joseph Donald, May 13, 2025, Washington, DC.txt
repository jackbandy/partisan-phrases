Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor United States Marine  Corporal Joseph Donald for his incredible service to our country and to  recognize his recent approval to receive the Purple Heart.

The Purple Heart is one of the oldest and most revered military  decorations. It is awarded to those who have been wounded or killed in  action while serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. It represents not just  injury, but sacrifice--the physical cost of defending our freedoms.

Corporal Donald served honorably for over six years, including  deployments to both Afghanistan and Iraq. His time in uniform coincided  with some of the most dangerous years of conflict, ending in 2011.  During that period, he witnessed the loss of many fellow Marines-- brothers and sisters in arms who gave their lives in service.

In 2011, while deployed in Afghanistan, Corporal Donald was severely  injured in an explosion. Despite the severity of his injuries, Corporal  Donald's resiliency is a true testament of his character and to the  Marine Corps values of honor, courage, and commitment.

Today, as we recognize Corporal Donald's receipt of the Purple Heart,  we also reflect on the sacrifices made by so many service members like  him. His story is one of bravery, dedication.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Corporal Donald formally on  the honor of receiving the Purple Heart award. I join the rest of the  community in thanking Corporal Donald for his courage and bravery in  the line of duty.
