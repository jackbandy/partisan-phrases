Pete Hegseth Must Go

Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the Representative for  72,000 veterans and tens of thousands of Active-Duty personnel who live  in the Seventh Congressional District of Virginia.

As a 25-year Army veteran, former Army JAG prosecutor, and National  Security Council staff adviser, I can say this: Imminent strike  approval and mission launch times are highly classified.

Sharing specific launch and strike times 31 minutes before the  mission begins and 2 hours before our forces were over enemy territory,  in harm's way, is an egregious breach of national security. At best,  the success of the operation was at risk. At worst, our pilots' lives  were in danger.

This isn't a political issue. It is about trust, discipline, and the  safety of our  servicemembers. Our men and women in uniform deserve better, and  Secretary Hegseth needs to do the right thing to restore the confidence  of the Armed Forces, the American people, and our allies. Pete Hegseth  must go, and Congress must investigate to fulfill its constitutional  responsibilities.
