Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize my district's  2025 Congressional Art Competition winner, Kaitlyn Anthes as my  Constituent of the Week.

Kaitlyn's charcoal drawing, titled To Light and Guard, will hang in  the U.S. Capitol representing Virginia's Seventh District for the next  year.

Her artwork was so impressive that when we received her piece, my  district director initially thought we had purchased professional  artwork to hang in the office.

In addition to being a talented artist, Kaitlyn recently graduated  from Courtland High School in Spotsylvania.

In Congress, I am working to strengthen public education so students  like Kaitlyn have access to programs that allow them to pursue their  passions.

I congratulate Kaitlyn on this well-earned accomplishment and wish  her luck as she heads off to college in the fall.
