Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize this week's  constituent of the week, Ernisha Hall, on her work as cofounder,  president, and CEO of the Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce.

For over half a decade, Ernisha has been leading the chamber in  working to foster economic stability for Black businessowners. Serving  over 2,700 businessowners to date, the chamber has introduced programs  throughout Virginia that are aimed at strengthening the visibility of  Black businessowners.

Mr. Speaker, Ernisha's commitment to her community and continued  success serve as an inspiration to us all. As her Representative in  Congress, I am grateful for the work she does each day in pursuit of  economic justice. I congratulate her again on her accomplishments. It  is a privilege to highlight her story on the floor of the U.S. House. I  am thankful for all that she does.
