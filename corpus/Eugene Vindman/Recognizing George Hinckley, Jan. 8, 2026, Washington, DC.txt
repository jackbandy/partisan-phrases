Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize George Hinckley  on his work in founding Smart Community STEM Camp.

This camp is a youth program that teaches kids coding and how to fly  and operate drones, provides mentorship, and brings communities  together.

As camp director, George encourages young Virginians who are  interested in pursuing technology-based careers as their pathway to  success.

George's dedication to STEM education is contributing to the future  of learning and exposes students to diverse opportunities.

Mr. Speaker, George's leadership and unwavering commitment to this  program are truly deserving of this recognition. I am honored to  congratulate him on this well-earned moment and recognize him as this  week's Constituent of the Week.

I congratulate and thank George for all that he does for our  students.
