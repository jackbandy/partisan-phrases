Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize Dr.  Shamira A. Brown--a dedicated researcher, a passionate toxicologist,  and a trailblazer in the field of environmental work.

Dr. Brown began her academic journey at Southern University, where  she earned a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Chemistry. Her  pursuit of knowledge did not stop there. She went on to earn her MS/ Ph.D. with a concentration in Environmental Fate and Exposure from the  same institution, demonstrating both her commitment and excellence in  the scientific field.

In 2003, Dr. Brown further distinguished herself by studying and  conducting research at Oxford University, expanding her global  perspective and deepening her expertise.

Dr. Brown's research has addressed some of the most complex issues in  environmental toxicology and public health. These include the fate and  transport of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pesticides  contamination in groundwater, and the development of green chemistry  solutions to reduce industrial pollution. Her groundbreaking  investigations into the disproportionate effects of environmental  toxins on disadvantaged communities have raised awareness around  environmental justice and equity.

As a toxicologist, Dr. Brown does not simply study issues, she  creates pathways toward solutions that focus on scientific progress and  community health. Throughout her career, Dr. Brown has also been a  committed mentor and advocate for underrepresented students in STEM.  Her leadership and dedication have inspired many young scientists,  including her own six children, some of whom have pursued environmental  research. Her impact goes beyond the classroom and the lab, shaping a  future for science that is more innovative and more inclusive and  representative of the communities it serves.

Dr. Brown's professional experience highlights her exceptional  expertise. She worked as an Environmental Protection Specialist for the  Federal Aviation Administration from 2004 to 2018. She also served as a  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Endangered Species  Specialist for the Office of Airports and Environmental Planning.  Additionally, she was an Environmental Fate Consultant for pesticides  and persistent chemical pollutants (PCPs) in air, soil, and water.

I want to personally thank Dr. Brown for her lifelong dedication to  research, scientific advancement, and the mentorship of future  generations. Her contributions have not only elevated the standards in  her field, but have also opened doors for countless others.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in recognizing.  Dr. Shamira A. Brown for her outstanding achievements and unwavering  commitment to science and education. She is a true asset to our  community and to our environment and I wish her the best of luck in her  research to come.
