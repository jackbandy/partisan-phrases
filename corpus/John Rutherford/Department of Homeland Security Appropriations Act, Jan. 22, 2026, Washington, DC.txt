Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the fiscal  year 2026 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act and urge  my colleagues to do the same.

This bill champions public safety, and it refocuses the Department of  Homeland Security back on its fundamental mission that was really lost  sight of during the Biden administration.

This legislation, Mr. Speaker, provides funding to important agencies  to defend the Nation against the threat posed by terrorists, criminals,  and foreign adversaries.

It aligns with President Trump's agenda to close our border and  supports local, State, and Federal law enforcement officers that are  deporting dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities.

Mr. Speaker, this bill gives TSA the resources to keep the flying  public safe while getting rid of wasteful programs like VIPR.

It supports CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency, which is securing vital infrastructure from adversaries like  China.

It also provides FEMA with the resources it needs to support  communities following disasters, and it invests in the Coast Guard, who  is keeping fentanyl and other dangerous drugs off our shores and out of  our communities.

This bill, Mr. Speaker, puts America first. It protects Americans and  secures our homeland, and I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  this bill.
