Recognizing James ``jim'' P. Citrano


Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of  James ``Jim'' P. Citrano, who passed away this last August at the age  of 83.

Jim was born on January 2, 1942, in Newark, New Jersey. After  graduating  from Colgate University, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in  the U.S. Marine Corps.

In 1967, Jim was deployed to Vietnam as an H-34 helicopter pilot with  the HMM-363, also known as the Lucky Red Lions. They were flying  assault support missions, earning Jim the Distinguished Flying Cross.

After the war, Mr. Speaker, this American hero relocated to  Jacksonville, Florida, with his wife and four children. There, he built  a successful 40-year career in commercial real estate property  management, development, and brokerage.

Always a community servant, Mr. Citrano generously dedicated his  time, serving on numerous boards, including St. Vincent's Hospital and  the University of North Florida.

As a law-and-order man, Jim was also a faithful supporter of the  Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. As sheriff, I was very proud to call him  my friend.

Jim was a valued member of our northeast Florida community and will  be greatly missed by all. I pray for Mr. Citrano's beloved family and  friends as they mourn this great loss.
