Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize and  congratulate Penny Justice on her selection as the winner of the  Patriot of the Year Award. This annual award ceremony celebrates our  great American servicemembers, first responders, and citizens, and  recognizes men and women who, through their actions and words,  exemplify servant leadership and patriotism.

Mrs. Justice has made exceptional contributions in support of service  members, veterans and their families in Northeast Florida, and has  demonstrated extraordinary patriotism and dedication to our Nation's  ideals.

On this historic occasion, I congratulate and recognize Penny  Justice. I thank her for her dedication and leadership. May God bless  her and congratulations to her.
