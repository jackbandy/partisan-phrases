Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  100th anniversary of the Town & County Club in the historic Asylum Hill  neighborhood of Hartford, Connecticut. Over its storied 100-year  history, the club has grown into the premier location for members to  enjoy organized social, intellectual, and artistic gatherings.

On May 21, 1925, just five years after the 19th Amendment guaranteed  women's suffrage, 400 women founded the Town & County Club as  Hartford's first private women's club. The club's first President, Miss  Anne Eliot Trumbull, helped draft their Articles of Association. The  Articles state that the club was formed with the purposes of ``creating  an organized center for women's work, thought and action; advancing the  interests of women, promoting science, literature, and art; providing  an accessible place of meeting for its members, promoting social  intercourse by such means as the members of the corporation shall deem  expedient and proper for that purpose, and for acquiring and  maintaining and club house and grounds.''

The pioneering women who founded the Town & County Club at a time  when membership at most private clubs was exclusive to men created an  organization worthy of its storied 100-year history. It is my honor to  celebrate the Town & County Club of Hartford, Connecticut.
