Hands Off Our Social Security

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Stansbury) for yielding to me. Her work and effort are  exemplary.

Here is the data, the facts, Mr. Speaker: Over 70 million of our  fellow Americans rely on Social Security, and Social Security,  throughout its history, has never missed a payment.

Today, it is even more crucial as 10,000 baby boomers a day become  eligible for Social Security, and for more than 40 percent of all  Social Security recipients, this is the only benefit that they have.

Representative Stansbury is part of legislation that seeks to expand  benefits, not just protect Social Security. Congress hasn't acted on  Social Security and its expansion since 1971. Richard Nixon was  President of the United States.

Mr. Speaker, because of the initiative, energy, and enthusiasm of  Members of Congress like Representative Stansbury, people in New Mexico  and all across the country--Mr. Speaker, it might surprise even you, as  well, to know how many people in your district are equally served. More  than $300,000 comes in monthly to recipients in your district in the  great State of Virginia, but that hasn't changed in over 54 years.

Now is the time to act. Now is the time to get behind Representative  Stansbury's legislation that will be incorporated into the Committee on  Ways and Means' configuration on Social Security that will benefit the  people.

As Representative Stansbury has indicated, this is America's number  one antipoverty program for the elderly and number one antipoverty  program for children, and more veterans rely on Social Security  disability than they do the VA.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Stansbury for her efforts and initiatives.
