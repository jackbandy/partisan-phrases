Welcoming Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to  congratulate The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, His All- Holiness Bartholomew, who is traveling to the U.S. this month to  receive the prestigious Templeton Prize, on his achievements in  interfaith dialogue. As this year's Templeton Prize Laureate,  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew will join the esteemed ranks of past  recipients, including Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, and Archbishop  Desmond Tutu.

His All-Holiness has been a pioneer in merging spirituality with  science as a force for change. As head of the Eastern Orthodox church,  he has gathered scientists, scholars, politicians with Catholic,  Jewish, and Muslim clerics. He also became the first Christian hierarch  to visit countries like Libya, Syria, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Azerbaijan,  Qatar, and Bahrain, building on his church's 550-year history of  coexistence with Muslims.

In 1997, Ecumenical Patriarch Batholomew was awarded the  Congressional Gold Medal ``in recognition of his outstanding and  enduring contributions to religious understanding and peace.'' That  same year, he decried pollution, deforestation, and climate change as  ``ecological sins.'' His All-Holiness' dedication to preserving our  planet for future generations is an inspiration to us all.

I thank The Ecumenical Patriarch for his work on interfaith dialogue  and protecting the environment, congratulate His All-Holiness on being  recognized by the Templeton Prize, and welcome him back to the United  States.
