Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Nathan  Morris, current Superintendent of the Cross County School District. He  is a dedicated Arkansan, a passionate educator, and a strong leader.

On September 15, 2025, Dr. Morris received the prestigious honor of  2026 Arkansas Superintendent of the Year. This award is presented to  those who successfully lead learning in their districts, demonstrate  strength in both personal and organizational communication, show  continuous improvement in administrative knowledge and skills, and  actively participate in local community activities while maintaining a  deep understanding of regional, national, and international issues.

Dr. Morris' efforts have ensured a graduation rate of 98 percent with  a growing academic proficiency rating. Cross County High School has  been included in the lists by U.S. News and World Report for both Best  High Schools and Best Charter High Schools. At the elementary school  level, Cross County Elementary Technology Academy has been recognized  as Top 10 World's Best Schools for Overcoming Adversity while under Dr.  Morris' leadership.

Dr. Morris began his tenure as superintendent in 2018 and has since  guided Cross County through a significant transformation. He has  implemented programs that foster teacher leadership, professional  collaboration, and growth which have led to lowered office referrals,  boosted teacher effectiveness, and 20 percent growth in enrollment.

Dr. Morris exemplifies commitment, hard work, and an unwavering  passion for academic success. His recognition as Superintendent of the  Year is not only an incredible personal milestone, but a reflection of  the great community we have throughout the First District of Arkansas.

I want to offer my sincere congratulations to Dr. Morris, and I look  forward to his continued work in education.
