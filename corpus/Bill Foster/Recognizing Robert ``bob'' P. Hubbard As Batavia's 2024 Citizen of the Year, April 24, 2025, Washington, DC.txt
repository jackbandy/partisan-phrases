Recognizing Robert ``bob'' P. Hubbard As Batavia's 2024 Citizen of the Year


Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Robert ``Bob'' P.  Hubbard for receiving the 2024 Citizen of the Year Award in the City of  Batavia. The Citizen of the Year Award celebrates individuals who have  made a profound impact towards inspiring and uplifting the City of  Batavia.

As a native Batavian, Bob has lived a life rooted in the values of  compassion, civic engagement, and integrity. His contributions have  touched nearly every corner of the Batavia community and continue to  uplift countless lives.

Bob is a driving force behind the recruiting and funding work for the  INCubator Entrepreneurship Program. Since 2015, he has recruited and  coordinated dozens of volunteer mentors, coaches, and judges, providing  over 500 students with meaningful real-world business experience.  Through his leadership, the program has raised more than $80,000 and  secured $100,000 in grants, helping to build a lasting foundation for  future innovation.

As a longtime CASA Kane County volunteer, he has dedicated his  efforts to protecting the community's most vulnerable, serving as a  Court-Appointed Special Advocate and Guardian Ad Litem. In these roles,  he has been a steadfast voice for children in abuse and neglect cases,  offering critical guidance and advocacy. He has also provided  leadership to numerous community organizations, including TriCity  Family Services, the LivingWell Cancer Resource Center, the Community  Foundation of the Fox River Valley, and the Batavia Community Chest.  Notably, his tenure with the Rotary Club of Batavia has spanned nearly  four decades and includes service as club president, recognition as  Rotarian of the Year, and multiple Paul Harris Fellow honors.

Beyond formal roles, Bob embodies the essence of ``Service Above  Self.'' Whether he's packing food for the Northern Illinois Food Bank,  supporting families through CHIP IN Batavia, participating in roadside  cleanups, or doing yard work for neighbors in need, Bob is always the  first to volunteer.

He is also a steward of Batavia's legacy. As the third-generation  owner of Hubbard's Home Furnishings, his family's business served the  community for over 100 years.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent such an extraordinary citizen of  Batavia, Illinois, who exemplifies what it means to be a good neighbor  and a true public servant. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring  Robert ``Bob'' P. Hubbard for his remarkable lifetime of service and  congratulating him on being named the 2024 Citizen of the Year.
