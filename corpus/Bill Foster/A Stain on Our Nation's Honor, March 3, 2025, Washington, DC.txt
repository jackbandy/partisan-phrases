A Stain on Our Nation's Honor

Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, at the time of Ukraine's independence from  the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine held the third largest nuclear  arsenal in the world.

According to the Arms Control Association, this included  approximately 1,900 strategic warheads, 176 intercontinental ballistic  missiles, and 34 strategic bombers, an arsenal large enough to  annihilate every person on Earth.

By 1996, Ukraine had voluntarily given up that nuclear arsenal in  exchange for written guarantees of territorial integrity, signed by  America, Russia, England, and Europe. These were guarantees that were  reconfirmed by Russia under Vladimir Putin in 2009.

When JD Vance and Donald Trump stabbed Ukraine in the back in the  Oval Office last Friday by ignorantly repudiating those security  agreements and by failing to defend one of only two nations that has  ever voluntarily given up its nuclear weapons, it forever raised the  risk of an uncontrolled nuclear arms race and a nuclear holocaust. It  put a stain on our Nation's honor that will take generations to remove.
