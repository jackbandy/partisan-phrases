Bringing the Discount Window Into the 21st Century Act


Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which  requires the Federal Reserve to conduct a comprehensive review of  discount window operations, including its technological infrastructure,  cybersecurity, communications, real-time monitoring, and oversight  mechanisms across the Federal Reserve System.

In 2023, we witnessed the most significant banking turmoil since the  global financial crisis. During that period, record numbers of  institutions turned to the discount window, borrowing at unprecedented  levels with more than $150 billion borrowed during the peak period.

The system held in large part because of the reforms and regulatory  tools provided and implemented as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, but it  came under stress.

I also appreciate the willingness of the legislation's sponsor to  accept my amendment during the Financial Services Committee markup of  this legislation. With my amendment, this bill recognizes that bank  runs will now move at the speed of mobile online banking and instant  communications. Soon, they will move at the speed of agentic AI.

The bank failures of 2023 showed that liquidity pressures can  escalate in hours, not days, a speed that will only intensify with the  rise of artificial intelligence and autonomous financial agents.

This legislation will require the Federal Reserve Board to develop a  written plan to remedy deficiencies like those to be identified during  the review process. This review and remediation will lead to more  accessible, responsive, and secure discount window operations.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
