Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the free people  of South Korea for their commitment to democracy following today's  election of Lee Jae-myung.

Like us, the people of South Korea have witnessed the mortal danger  to democracy posed by lies, by corruption, and by illegal actions  directed by those at the very top.

The Korean people responded with courage and defended their democracy  through peaceful civil disobedience, through lawful impeachment, and,  now, through a free and fair election.

They have shown strength, unity, and a dedication to the rule of law  in a way that the rest of the world could do well to emulate.

Mr. Speaker, I say to the citizens of South Korea, the people of the  free world salute you.
