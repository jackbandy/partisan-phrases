Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Crystal Lake  Strikers for receiving the Carl E. Wehde Award. This award honors the  late Carl E. Wehde and celebrates outstanding contributions that  enhance the quality of life for the people of Crystal Lake.

The Crystal Lake Strikers are a drumline that seamlessly integrates  the arts and education. They perform year-round and offer a wide range  of programs in percussion, color guard, and other performing arts  disciplines. Their mission is twofold: to provide high-quality  entertainment to the community and to build confidence in students. By  expanding upon lessons taught in local schools, the Strikers meet the  educational needs of Crystal Lake, offering percussion experiences for  children at all grade levels through six distinct groups.

In recognition of their impact, the Strikers were previously honored  with the Illinois Park and Recreation Association's Outstanding Program  and Special Event Award for the creation of the Kingpins drumline, an  educational program designed specifically for children with special  needs.

The Strikers' commitment to serving the Crystal Lake community  extends beyond the classroom. They actively support aspiring performers  through college scholarships, fundraisers, and by providing a platform  for young talent in the perfomning arts.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the Crystal Lake Strikers, whose  contributions to the arts and education have had a profound and lasting  impact on the city. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating  the Strikers on receiving this well-deserved award and for continuing  to inspire the next generation of performers.
