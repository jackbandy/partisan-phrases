Crystal Lake Mental Health Program


Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand up for the community  of Crystal Lake, Illinois, which, along with over 100 communities  nationwide, just had a $5.6 million student mental health program  abruptly canceled by the Trump administration.

This funding, which passed with support of both Republicans and  Democrats under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, was created in  response to the Uvalde school shooting to address the growing youth  mental health crisis.

I think we all remember the Republican talking point at the time that  we don't have a gun problem. We have a mental health problem. Well,  fine. With this grant, the Crystal Lake District 47 was able to hire  trained mental health professionals and give 7,100 students access to  mental health care.

Canceling this grant will disrupt critical mental health care for  students who are already receiving support, weaken the district's  ability to identify and intervene in early warning signs of distress,  trauma, or potential violence. It undermines years of progress made in  breaking the stigma around mental health.

With suicide being the second leading cause of death for children  aged 10-14, gutting this funding will be life-threatening. Our kids'  safety and well-being should not be a partisan issue. I urge the  administration to reverse these harmful cuts.
