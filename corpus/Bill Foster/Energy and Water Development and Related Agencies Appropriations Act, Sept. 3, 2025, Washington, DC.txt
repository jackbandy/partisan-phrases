Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

Mr. Chair, I rise first with an acknowledgement that, due to the  efforts of the ranking member and chair of the Subcommittee on Water  and Energy Development and Related Agencies, this bill could have been  far worse. That is not the bar that we should set for ourselves.

I am particularly concerned about the 17 percent cut in the funding  for the Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation within NNSA.

This cut comes on top of last year's continuing resolution, where  this office was cut by 7 percent and was only one of a few accounts to  see its budget reduced by that bill.

The Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation is involved in  critical nuclear security work, which is actively keeping us safe, from  securing nuclear material worldwide to verifying that other countries  and various rogue actors are not developing nuclear weapons.

It would be nice if we lived in a world where a miraculous Golden  Dome could keep us safe from nuclear weapons, but we do not. We depend  on being able to detect and enforce violations of nonproliferation  agreements.

This bill leaves wide open opportunities for countries like Iran and  other nefarious actors to more easily get their hands on the materials  needed to build nuclear weapons. With tensions mounting in the Middle  East and the internet containing significant bomb-making instructions  which are much more accessible to terrorist groups, this is not the  time when America can afford to step back.

Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
