Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the  100th Anniversary of Family Counseling Service (FCS) in Aurora,  Illinois. For a century, FCS has been a pillar of compassion, support,  and guidance, providing critical mental health and social services to  individuals and families in need.

Since its founding in 1925, Family Counseling Service has remained  steadfast in its mission to strengthen communities through accessible  and comprehensive counseling, advocacy, and outreach programs. Over the  years, FCS has expanded its services to address the evolving needs of  the community, offering mental health counseling, financial empowerment  programs, crisis intervention, and support for survivors of domestic  violence.

Through its dedicated team of professionals and community  partnerships, FCS has transformed countless lives by ensuring that  everyone, regardless of background or financial status, has access to  the care and resources they need to thrive. Their century-long  commitment to mental wellness and family stability has made an  indelible impact on Aurora and beyond.

As they commemorate this remarkable 100-year milestone, I would like  to extend my deepest gratitude to the staff, counselors, and volunteers  of Family Counseling Service. Their unwavering dedication, compassion,  and expertise have been the driving force behind the organization's  success. Through their hard work, they have uplifted individuals,  strengthened families, and transformed lives, making our communities  stronger and more resilient.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent such an impactful organization  in my district. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Family  Counseling Service on its 100th Anniversary. Their tireless efforts  have enriched the lives of so many, and I am confident that their  legacy of service will continue for generations to come.
