Blood Transfusion Oversight

Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to yet  another decision by the Trump administration that puts Americans' lives  at risk.

On April 1, 2025, almost the entire Division of Blood Disorders and  Public Health Genomics, a department of the CDC established to combat  blood infections in the wake of the AIDS epidemic, was placed on  administrative leave.

This decision to eliminate this division was, of course, made by the  Elon Musk Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Now, people with blood disorders across the United States will have  to worry about contaminated blood transfusions. They will also be left  wondering whether critical research to prevent and treat their  conditions will be abandoned, and they will have to reckon with the  fact that the same government that swore to help them turned its back  on them, all so Republicans can find more money to give billionaires  new tax breaks.

Vital programs like the Division of Blood Disorders should not be  subject to political games, and those suffering from blood disorders  should not have to fear that a blood transfusion will kill them.

Defunding the CDC puts lives at risk, and staff put on administrative  leave should be reinstated immediately.
