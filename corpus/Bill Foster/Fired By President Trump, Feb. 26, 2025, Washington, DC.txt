Fired By President Trump

Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a Ph.D. physicist in Congress, who  spent most of his career in the national laboratories of the Department  of Energy, to share the story of a research engineer at a national lab  who was recently fired without cause by President Trump and Elon Musk.

This engineer's job was:

Co-leading a project developing software for critical       mineral and rare earth element extraction, while also playing       a lead technical role in computer modeling of desalination       and water treatment processes and supporting U.S. industrial       partners to use these tools to deploy and modernize their       systems.

Mr. Speaker, our country cannot afford to lose the talent of civic- minded scientists like this.

Moreover, if Donald Trump thinks that he is going to strike a deal  with Ukraine on rare earth minerals, then he is going to need real  experts in our government on critical mineral extraction. We don't get  that by firing them.
