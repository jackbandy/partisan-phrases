Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rhienna McClain  for receiving the ATHENA International Leadership Award. This award  celebrates the leadership of women who create opportunities for other  women. Ms. McClain exemplifies these qualities through her  entrepreneurial vision and commitment to her community.

As the owner of the 1776 Restaurant in Crystal Lake, Ms. McClain has  established a fine dining experience that prioritizes high-quality,  gluten-free, and allergy-safe cuisine. Through her leadership, she has  strengthened the local economy by fostering partnerships with local  businesses and sourcing ingredients from Illinois farms. Her restaurant  not only offers an upscale dining experience but also serves as a  community space that brings people together.

In addition to her entrepreneurial accomplishments, Ms. McClain is  deeply committed to her community. She previously served as the  chairperson of Big Brothers Big Sisters of McHenry County, an  organization that provides critical mentorship services to children,  helping them develop the confidence they need to succeed. Since 2018,  she has been a passionate advocate for the organization, opening doors  of opportunity for countless young people. Furthermore, Ms. McClain has  dedicated her time and expertise to various community development  efforts, including serving on the Economic Development Committee of  Crystal Lake, the McHenry County Department of Health, and the Gavers  Community Cancer Foundation.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent Rhienna McClain, whose  exceptional contributions have made a lasting impact on McHenry County.  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating her on receiving the  ATHENA International Leadership Award, a recognition that is truly  well-deserved.
