Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my dear friend, Andy  Collins, a lieutenant game warden retiring after 33 impressive years of  service to the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency.

Andy grew up in Knoxville and graduated from my alma mater, Bearden  High School. He attended the University of Tennessee and earned a  degree in fisheries and wildlife sciences. He began his career in  Hawkins County before moving south to Loudon County. His  responsibilities eventually expanded to include 11 counties in east  Tennessee, covering all of Tennessee's Second District.

Throughout his 33-year career, Andy has exemplified the mission of  preserving, protecting, and enhancing the State's fish and wildlife.  Andy knows more about wildlife than anyone I know. As a matter of fact,  he has forgotten more than I will ever know. When I run into a problem  on my farm, he is the first person I call. Whether it is with deer or  turkey or anything else, he is always quick to pick up my call.

Andy will spend his retirement days doing what he loves best:  spending time outdoors with his beautiful wife, Mary Jo; his son,  Wyatt; and his daughter, Emily.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Andy on his achievement. I thank him so  much for his service to our great country and to the beautiful State of  Tennessee. It is a much better place because of folks like him and the  great folks at TWRA.
