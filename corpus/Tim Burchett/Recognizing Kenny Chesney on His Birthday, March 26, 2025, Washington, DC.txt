Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize my friend, the  legendary musician, American, and east Tennessean, Kenny Chesney. Today  is his birthday, Mr. Speaker, and I can't think of a more fitting  birthday present for Kenny than the announcement that he will be  inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

He was born in Knoxville. Kenny is a graduate of Gibbs High School,  which is not a mile from my house, where he had a storied career in  baseball and football. He went on to graduate from East Tennessee State  University, Mr. Speaker.

Kenny has cemented himself in American history with his timeless  hits. While I know the accolades mean very little to a man of his  character, I am going to name a few of them anyway.

Kenny has won four Country Music Association Entertainer of the Year  awards. He has had 33 number one hits and has been nominated for  multiple Grammys.

I wish Kenny a happy birthday. I congratulate him on his induction  into the Country Music Hall of Fame. I thank him for making east  Tennessee proud.

I will always remember the first time he won Country Music  Entertainer of the Year. He took his momma up on stage. I thought that  was pretty cool. His dad, Dave, was a teacher at Bearden Junior High  School where I attended. His whole family has just been wonderful to  me.
