Meaning of Religious Freedom

Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 21 Christian men who  were murdered for their faith.

In 2015, ISIS dragged them onto a Libyan beach, forced them to kneel,  and beheaded them on video. In that horrific moment, they did not show  fear. They showed faith.

Mr. Speaker, 20 of these men were Coptic Christians from Egypt just  trying to earn a living for their families. The 21st man, Matthew, who  was from Ghana, wasn't even Coptic by birth. ISIS gave him a choice to  walk away or die. He chose to stand with his brothers, knowing exactly  what it would cost him. He knew it was better to die free than to live  under tyranny.

That is faith, Mr. Speaker. That is true freedom. For 45 days, ISIS  beat, starved, and tortured these men. They were offered food and money  if they would just deny Christ, but they never did. Instead, as the  terrorists raised their blades, their last word was the name of Jesus.

I remember my father had a Bible verse on his mirror that said if you  deny me before man, I will deny you before the gates of Heaven. They  did not deny their faith.

This month marks 10 years since their deaths. ISIS thought they were  making a statement of fear. Instead, they showed the world what  unshakeable faith looks like.

The Coptic and Catholic churches have honored these men as martyrs,  as they should. Just as these men refused to abandon their faith, their  faith has never abandoned them. One of the martyrs' widows said: Their  blood mixed together, and as a result, we the widows are united.

These men weren't just believers. They were immovable. Their story  should remind every American what real religious freedom means. May we  never forget them.
