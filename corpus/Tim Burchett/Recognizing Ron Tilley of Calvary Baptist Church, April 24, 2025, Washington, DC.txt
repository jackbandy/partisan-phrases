Recognizing Ron Tilley of Calvary Baptist Church


Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Ron Tilley for his  seventy plus years of ministry and service to East Tennessee. I've seen  some pretty impressive resumes in my time, but none may be as  impressive as Brother Ron's.

Sharing my love for cars, Ron owned Tilley Lane Chrysler Dodge  Dealership in Lenoir City where his business became a pillar of the  community. In addition to owning a beloved local business, he is also a  legend in sports as he was inducted into the Lenoir City Sports Hall of  Fame. He was also an original member of the Kingsman Quartet.

If you ask Ron, all of this pales in comparison to his walk with  Christ. In 1947, Ron was saved at the Broadway Baptist Church in  Maryville, Tennessee. He then went on to live a Christ-centered life  serving as the music director for a number of churches and Christian  organizations throughout East Tennessee. Since August of 2014, Ron has  served as the Minister of Music at Calvary Baptist Church, where he is  now retiring after seven decades of service.

I thank Ron for being a role model, friend to all, and most  importantly a good steward of Christ. While he may be retiring, I have  no doubt that he will continue his service to his community.

Please join me in congratulating Ron Tilley on his outstanding career  and life as he begins a new chapter.
