Tennessee Valley Authority Transparency Act of 2025

Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ezell for yielding me  time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan Tennessee Valley  Authority Transparency Act.

TVA is a congressionally chartered American public power company that  provides electricity to over 10 million people in Tennessee and six  surrounding States.

Despite TVA's significant role in our daily lives, it holds most of  its meetings behind closed doors. I believe Americans are sick and  tired of these dadgum backroom dealings, Mr. Speaker.

The TVA Transparency Act requires all board meetings to be held in  public and for TVA to provide at least 7 days' notice so that people  know when and where the meetings occur.

This bill provides greater accountability to the American people  while retaining reasonable FOIA--for those who don't understand what  ``FOIA'' is, that is the Freedom of Information Act--and Sunset Act  protections.

I have always advocated for more transparency at TVA, first in the  State legislature, then as a mayor, and now as a Congressman.

I thank my good friend, Representative Cohen, who I don't see in here  today, for his continued support. Steve and I were in the Tennessee  General Assembly together. We raised the speed limit in Tennessee. We  brought Isaac Hayes to the floor of the Tennessee State Senate. The  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) is the first person who ever fed  me lobster, oddly enough. He has been a great friend, and he also  called my momma when my daddy died. I am very close to Steve. Even  though our political allegiances are about as far apart as they can  get, he is still my good friend.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill and  restore public trust in TVA.
