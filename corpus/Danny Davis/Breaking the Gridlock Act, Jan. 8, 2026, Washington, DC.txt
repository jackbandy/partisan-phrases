Breaking the Gridlock Act

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, in Illinois, there are 465,000  people who depend on the Affordable Care Act to acquire health  insurance. For the past several years, the majority of them have used  enhanced Federal tax credits to lower the cost.

In my district alone, 19,000, or 57 percent, will see the cost of  their policy go up $696, without the Federal tax credits.

In Austin, Mary will pay an additional $300 per month. On the North  Side, Emily will pay an additional $150 a month, raising her cost to  $600. Beginning January 1, Rebecca will pay $796 a month.

This is totally unacceptable. All of these are too high. Let's make  healthcare available to the American people. Let's pass today, not  tomorrow, not the next day, the Federal tax credits.
