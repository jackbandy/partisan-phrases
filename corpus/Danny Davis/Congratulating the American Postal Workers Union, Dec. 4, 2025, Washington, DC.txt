Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the American Postal Workers Union  is a labor  union which represents 200,000 employees and retirees of the United  States Postal Service who belong to the clerk, maintenance, motor  vehicLe, and other services divisions. It was founded July 18, 1971 as  a former clerk in the Chicago post office, beginning in 1961, prior to  the APWU being organized and accepted. I congratulate the Chicago  leadership in the personage of Keith Richardson, President, Diatta  Grant, Director, Jackie Chambers, Vice President, and Michelle Johnson,  Secretary/Treasurer.

Labor unions function in many ways to generate fair equitable wages,  benefits, working conditions, and quaLity of life enhancements. They  are the bridges between employers and employees. Without labor unions I  often wonder what Life in this country would be? Therefore, I take this  opportunity to thank the leadership of the Chicago Local APWU 0001 for  leadership well provided and a job well done.
