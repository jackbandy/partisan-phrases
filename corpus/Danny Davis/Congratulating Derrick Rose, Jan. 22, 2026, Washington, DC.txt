Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Derrick Rose, an outstanding professional basketball player, whose  jersey is being retired today by the Chicago Bulls.

Derrick grew up on the South Side of Chicago and went to Simeon high  school. He played much of his professional basketball on the West Side  with the Chicago Bulls, which I represent. He played on the same floor  and joined the ranks of Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Bob Love,  Mickey Johnson, and Norm Van Lier. Mickey Johnson lives in the same  neighborhood as I do. Scottie Pippen and Bob Love both grew up in rural  America near where I grew up, and we are extremely proud of their  accomplishments. Scottie was born in Arkansas, and Bob was born in  Louisiana.

Congratulations to Derrick Rose, who is also actively involved in  community affairs with youth.

I also take the opportunity to congratulate Mr. Jerry Reinsdorf and  the Chicago Bulls and all of these superstars for what they have meant  to America.
