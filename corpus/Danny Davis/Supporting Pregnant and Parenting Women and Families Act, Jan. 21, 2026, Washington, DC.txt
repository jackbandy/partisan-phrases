Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as we begin 2026 with Trump and  Republican policies squeezing workers, spiking costs, tanking job  security, the Republican leadership advances this bill to divert money  intended for poor children to dangerous anti-abortion centers.

When my home State of Illinois and four other States are facing an  illegal reduction of about $8.9 billion in TANF and SSBG funds due to  political retaliation, the Republican leadership chooses to move a bill  restricting women's reproductive choices.

If Republicans really wanted to help parents care for their children,  they would work with Democrats to ensure that HHS follows the law and  immediately releases the childcare funds that HHS is illegally delaying  from States across the country.

Illinois receives about $400 million from the Child Care and  Development Fund and another $500 million from TANF that help low- income working families afford quality childcare.

Disruption to this funding will have substantial, immediate, and  destructive consequences to children, families, businesses, and  communities.

I am upset but not shocked that the Republican leadership rejected my  amendment to this bill that would penalize HHS for illegally  withholding payments of TANF, Child Care Entitlement to States, or SSBG  funding if the agency fails to pay an amount due to a State within 5  days by requiring the agency to make a monthly payment of the amount  due plus interest.

HHS should be held accountable for harming individuals, families, and  businesses.

I strongly oppose this bill that tramples on women's rights to choose  their own best health interests.
