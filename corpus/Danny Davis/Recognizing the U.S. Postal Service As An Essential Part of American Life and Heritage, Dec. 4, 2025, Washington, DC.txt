Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the U.S. Post  Office as one of the Nation's most enduring institutions and the role  it has played in keeping our Nation states federal government  responsible for providing postal service in the United States. It is  one of the few agencies authorized by the United States Constitution.

Since its beginning, the U.S. Postal Service has gone through and  will perhaps continue to  go through many change. However, its value of service to the American  people will remain a vital part in the United States of America.  Therefore, in recognizing December 4, 2025 as Postal Workers  Recognition Day, we say thank you to the workers who make it happen.
