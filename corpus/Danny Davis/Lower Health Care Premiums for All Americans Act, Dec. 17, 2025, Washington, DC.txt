Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I got this note this morning from  a constituent of mine who said: ``Dear Congressman Davis, I wish you  were voting to extend the tax credits for healthcare today. I am a  single mother with a daughter in college. Without these Federal tax  credits, we will be in an extremely vulnerable position. Accessing  healthcare would be virtually impossible, and the stability of our  lives would be at serious risk. These tax credits are not just helpful.  They are essential. I don't know what we would do without them.''

Mr. Speaker, I agree with Shameka.
