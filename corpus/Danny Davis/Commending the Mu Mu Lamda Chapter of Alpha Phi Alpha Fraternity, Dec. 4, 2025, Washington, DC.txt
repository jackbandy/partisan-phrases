Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the  following Proclamation commending the Mu Mu Lamda Chapter of Alpha Phi  Alpha Fraternity, Inc. on its 50th Anniversary.

Whereas, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., founded on       December 4, 1906, at Cornell University, stands as the first       intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for       African American men, committed to developing leaders,       promoting brotherhood and academic excellence, and providing       service and advocacy for communities nationwide; and

Whereas, the mission of the fraternity is to stimulate the       ambition of its members and prepare them for the greatest       usefulness in the causes of humanity, freedom, and dignity       through scholarships, leadership, service and advocacy; and

Whereas, for fifty years, the Mu Mu Lambda Chapter has       lived this mission with distinction--strengthening       communities, mentoring youth, awarding scholarships,       advancing civic engagement, shaping leaders, and uplifting       humanity through service, advocacy, and brotherhood; and

Whereas, the Mu Mu Lambda Chapter was charted on April 14,       1976 in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, by twenty-two visionary       brothers whose leadership established a lasting legacy of       excellence and impact; and

Whereas, the Mu Mu Lambda Chapter has demonstrated the       fraternity's motto ``First of All, Servants of All, We Shall       Transcend All,'' and it aims--Manly Deeds, Scholarship, and       Love for all Mankind--through five decades of transformative       programming, community partnerships, youth initiatives, and       leadership development activities; and

Whereas, the chapter's Golden Anniversary in April 2026       marks a momentous milestone for the Chicagoland community and       the broader fraternity; and

Whereas, the chapter's presidents from 1976 to 2026 are       recognized for their dedication and leadership in advancing       the mission and sustaining the chapter's legacy: Ernest       Gibson (1976), Mickey S.

As a proud member who share brotherhood with this outstanding group  of distinguished men, some of whom I met as a freshmen in college  (Kenneth R. Watkins and Ernest Gibson) and one (Isiah P. Ward) who was  my line brother when we joined Mu Mu Lambda.
