Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, my constituent, Debra, has this  to say about Medicaid, and I agree. She says: It is absolutely  essential.

She adopted two medically fragile children from foster care. Both  have Medicaid as their primary and only health insurance. They both  receive services through the Division of Specialized Care for Children  in Illinois.

Her daughter has a Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent waiver.  Together, they require 19 daily prescription medications. Her son  requires a nightly injection that is $4,000 a month. Her daughter  requires multiple pieces of expensive medical equipment.

She would never have been able to adopt or afford to keep them  without knowing they would receive Medicaid. She is so proud of them.  Medicaid is a vital, lifesaving program for thousands of children like  hers.

Mr. Speaker, I agree, and let's make it accessible to all who need  it. I thank Debra, and I thank her children.
