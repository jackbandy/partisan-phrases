Notice of Intention to Offer Resolution Raising A Question of the Privileges of the House


Mr. CASAR. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of Rule IX, I rise  to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the privileges of  the House.

The form of the resolution is as follows:

Resolution censuring Representative Cory Mills.

Whereas, Representative Cory Mills has on several occasions conducted  himself in a manner that reflects discredit upon the House of  Representatives;

Whereas, on February 19, 2025, Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police  Department officers were called to resolve a private matter at  Representative Cory Mills' residence, where officers were called to the  1300 block of Maryland Avenue, Southwest, around 1:15 p.m. for the  report of an assault;

Whereas, police reports obtained by NBC4 Washington confirmed that  the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department was investigating  Representative Cory Mills for an alleged assault of a 27-year-old woman  that took place on February 19, 2025, at the residence of  Representative Cory Mills.

Whereas, the first police report, provided to NBC4 Washington by a  source and confirmed by a second source familiar with the  investigation, said that the 27-year-old woman accused her significant  other for over a year of having grabbed her, shoved her, and pushed her  out of the door, and also said that the woman involved showed the  officer ``bruises on her arm which appeared fresh'';

Whereas, NBC4 Washington also reported that the Metropolitan Police  Department identified Representative Cory Mills as the significant  other of the alleged victim of assault--which alleged victim was a 27- year-old woman who was not the wife of Representative Cory Mills--and  that the alleged victim ``let officers hear Subject 1 [now identified  by MPD as Mills] instruct her to lie about the origin of her bruises .  . . Eventually, Subject 1 [who we now know is Representative Cory  Mills] made contact with police and admitted that the situation  escalated from verbal to physical, but it was severe enough to create  bruising'';

Whereas, on February 21, 2025, The Washington Post also confirmed two  D.C. police officials said that the alleged victim of assault initially  told 911 and police that she had been assaulted and that officers said  she also had what seems to be visible injuries, and that while a  supervisor initially classified the offense internally as a family  disturbance, police commanders later learned of the incident, reviewed  the reports and body camera footage and reclassified the case as  domestic violence assault;

Whereas, on February 21, 2025, NBC4 Washington also reported that the  Metropolitan Police Department determined that probable cause to arrest  Representative Cory Mills for misdemeanor assault existed and sent an  arrest warrant for Representative Cory Mills to the United States  Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia; however, then-Acting  United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Ed Martin refused  to sign the arrest warrant for Representative Cory Mills and instead  returned the case to the Metropolitan Police Department for further  investigation;

Whereas, on July 14, 2025, a different former romantic partner of  Representative Cory Mills, who was apparently in a relationship with  Representative Mills from November 2021 to February 2025, reported to  authorities in Florida that Representative Mills threatened to release  nude images and other intimate videos of her and threatened to harm her  future romantic partners in retaliation for her decision to end a  relationship with Representative Mills after seeing the public reports  described above concerning the alleged February 2025 physical assault;

Whereas, in August 2024, the Office of Congressional Conduct adopted  and transmitted to the Committee on Ethics of the House of  Representatives a report indicating that there was substantial reason  to believe that Representative Cory Mills may have omitted or  misrepresented required information in his financial disclosure  statements, accepted excessive contributions to his campaign committee  in the form of personal loans and contributions that may not have  derived from Representative Cory Mills' personal funds; entered into,  held, or enjoyed contracts with Federal agencies while he was a Member  of Congress; and may have accepted through his campaign committee in- kind contributions or other contributions not lawfully made;

Whereas, individuals who served with Representative Cory Mills have  called into question the veracity of the account of events which formed  the basis of a recommendation that Representative Cory Mills receive an  award of a Bronze Star, bestowed in 2021, for his service under enemy  fire in Iraq in 2003;

Whereas, in August 2024, Representative Mills provided the Daytona  Beach News with documents purporting to prove that he earned a Bronze  Star with heroism, including a Department of the Army Form 638  recommending Representative Mills for a Bronze Star, which includes a  signature from then-Army Brigade Commander Arnold N. Gordon-Bray;  however, Retired Brigadier General Bray told the Daytona Beach News- Journal in August 2024 that he did not sign a Bronze Star  recommendation for Congressman Cory Mills;

Whereas, five people who served with Representative Cory Mills,  including two men who were reported as having been personally saved by  Representative Mills at great risk to his own life as a basis for his  recommendation for his Bronze Star in the Department of the Army Form  638, disputed that Representative Cory Mills was involved in their  rescue or provided lifesaving care.

Whereas, one private first class cited as having been involved in one  of the listed achievements on Representative Cory Mills' Army Form 638  recommending him for a Bronze Star denied that Representative Cory  Mills provided him any aid and also denied that his injuries were life- threatening.

Whereas, one sergeant cited as having been involved in one of the  listed achievements on Representative Cory Mills' Army Form 638  recommending him for a Bronze Star called the account a ``fabrication''  and claimed that he ``was not involved in any claims that Cory Mills  makes about me''; and

Whereas, despite the numerous available contradictions of the  accounts forming the basis of the recommendation for his Bronze Star,  Representative Cory Mills described the legitimate factual disputes  raised by individuals he purportedly served with and rescued as  ``slander and defamation'' in a statement to the Daytona Beach News- Journal: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved, that--

One, Representative Cory Mills be censured;

Two, Representative Cory Mills forthwith present himself in the well  of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of the censure;  and

Three, Representative Cory Mills be censured with the public reading  of this resolution by the Speaker.
