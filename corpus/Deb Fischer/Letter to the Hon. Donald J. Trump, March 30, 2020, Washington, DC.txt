Letter to the Hon. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States - Nebraska Delegation Echoes Governor's Request for COVID-19 Major Disaster Declaration


Dear Mr. President:

We write in strong support of Governor Pete Ricketts's request for a major disaster declaration authorized by the Stafford Act for the State of Nebraska as a result of the COVID-19 emergency. 

As of March 30, 2020, Nebraska has 150 confirmed cases of COVID-19. State and local efforts to prevent and mitigate the spread of the virus have been met by overwhelming demand to increase access to timely needed resources. Significant impact to all sectors of industry throughout Nebraska is already being felt -- namely to small businesses, who employ 46.7 percent of our state's workforce. Federal assistance will better equip Nebraska to appropriately respond to this public health emergency and counteract its negative impact.

We respectfully request your expedited review and prompt action to ensure Nebraska's communities receive the immediate support needed to respond to this unprecedented public health emergency. Along with our fellow Nebraskans, we appreciate your attention to this request and stand ready to assist in any way possible.

Sincerely,                                                                                        

Deb Fischer
