  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mrs. FISCHER.  It does not cover all  respirators currently recommended by the CDC for healthcare  professionals who are treating patients with COVID-19. My colleagues  know that. This is inadequate. 

  The legislation that the senior Senator from Arizona and I have  offered covers all CDC-recommended respirators. Moreover, our bill is  not limited to this specific public health emergency but rather  responsibly addresses future public health respirator needs. We are  looking at what is going to happen in the future, and right here, right  now, the Senate does have this opportunity to address these current  emergencies and, yes, future emergencies by making sure that we can  provide lifesaving equipment to the American people. So, accordingly, I  object.

  Mrs. FISCHER. I would suggest the absence of a quorum.
