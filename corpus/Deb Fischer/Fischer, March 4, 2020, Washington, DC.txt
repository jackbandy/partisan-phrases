Fischer, Nebraska Delegation Meet with Agriculture Secretary Perdue


U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, met with U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue at a luncheon with the entire Nebraska delegation to discuss the state of Nebraska agriculture.

"I appreciated meeting with Secretary Perdue and the Nebraska delegation to discuss with him important issues for Nebraska's farmers and ranchers including the Renewable Fuel Standard, livestock biotechnology, and my legislation, the Real MEAT Act. As a strong advocate for Nebraska ag, I stressed the importance of providing predictability as our state works to overcome last year's extreme flooding and the effects of trade uncertainty," said Senator Fischer.

During the meeting, Senator Fischer and the delegation expressed their gratitude that USDA announced $285 million in disaster relief for sugar beet farmers impacted by flooding. Senator Fischer supported a provision in the FY 20 spending legislation which directed USDA to make this funding available to sugarbeet growers, and signed a bipartisan letter in January calling for this relief.
