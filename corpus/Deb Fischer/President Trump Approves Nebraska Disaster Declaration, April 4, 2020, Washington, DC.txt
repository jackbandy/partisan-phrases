On March 30th, Senator Fischer, along with Senator Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Representatives Jeff Fortenberry (NE-01), Don Bacon (NE-02), and Adrian Smith (NE-03), wrote a letter to President Donald Trump in support of the governor's request for a major disaster declaration for the state of Nebraska. The request follows the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nebraska, which the governor has warned is expected to see a continued rise in cases.
