Senator Fischer Attends White House Signing of China Trade Deal


U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, released the following statement today. She attended the White House signing of the first phase of a trade deal between the United States and China:

"I thank President Trump and his team for working hard to negotiate this deal between China and the United States. China has agreed to purchase, on average, $40 billion of agricultural products every year for the next two years. This deal will help expand market access for Nebraska and will bring much needed economic certainty to the manufacturing, agriculture, and energy sectors," said Senator Fischer.

More information:

This trade agreement reflects a commitment from China to purchase at least an additional $16 billion in agricultural products above the $24 billion purchased in 2017.  The agreement also includes provisions that address a multitude of non-tariff barriers for commodities like beef, dairy, animal feed and biotech products. 

In addition to agriculture, the trade agreement makes headway on intellectual property, technology, financial services, currency manipulation monitoring, and a process for dispute resolution.
