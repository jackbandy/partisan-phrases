Senate Passes Additional Coronavirus Relief Package with Fischer's Support


U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) released the following statement today after the U.S. Senate passed an additional relief package to combat the outbreak of novel coronavirus. Senator Fischer has worked with her colleagues in a bipartisan manner to pass this relief for Nebraska families, businesses, and communities affected by COVID-19.

"We are in a crisis. We must provide people with relief and get our economy on the road to recovery, and that is exactly what the bipartisan legislation we passed today does. It includes relief for individuals, families, businesses, and communities. For small businesses, it ensures that they can keep their employees working and don't have to shut their doors for good. For health care providers and first responders, it includes substantial hospital funding as well as my bipartisan bill with Rep. Bacon to help produce a sufficient supply of respirator masks. For communities, it creates a new coronavirus relief fund with $150 billion for state and local governments to help them address this pandemic.  And for agriculture, which provides one in four Nebraska jobs, it increases emergency response funding for producers impacted by COVID-19. We need to battle this virus, provide relief to our people through this stressful time, and get our economy stabilized," said Senator Fischer.
