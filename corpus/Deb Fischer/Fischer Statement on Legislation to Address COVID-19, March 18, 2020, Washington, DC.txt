Fischer Statement on Legislation to Address COVID-19


U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) today released the following statement regarding federal efforts in Congress to address the COVID-19 outbreak and the related economic downturn:

"Over the last several weeks, my staff and I have been in contact with many Nebraskans who have shared their concerns about this public health crisis and its economic impact. 

"The purpose of the federal government is to provide a national response during a national emergency like we are dealing with now. It is our job to provide relief and recovery to our people. That is why I support the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. This bill is part of a multi-step effort intended to combat this crisis that is already hurting Nebraska families. It makes COVID-19 testing free, bolsters the federal funding going to states to pay for unemployment insurance, and strengthens and expands food assistance for families who are in need. 

"In addition to this bill, I am continuing to work on other legislative efforts to stabilize the economy and provide the relief Americans need."
