Fischer Announces Military Academy Nominations for Class of 2024


Today, U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced the names of 33 Nebraskans she is nominating this year to attend U.S. service academies:

"It is my privilege to announce the names of the impressive Nebraska students I have nominated to attend our nation's prestigious military academies. These students are hard workers and proven leaders who will make our state and country proud. I thank all of them for their willingness to continue Nebraska's long-standing tradition of defending this nation."

Every year, U.S. senators nominate a select group of eligible individuals from their states for enrollment at the five U.S. Military Service Academies: the United States Air Force Academy, the United States Merchant Marine Academy, the United States Coast Guard Academy, the United States Military Academy, and the United States Naval Academy. Once a student receives a nomination, their application process within the respective service academy begins.
