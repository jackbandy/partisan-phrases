Fischer Thanked by National Guard Leaders, Discusses Guard Priorities for Coming Year


U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was recognized today for her efforts supporting the National Guard and securing the full funding amount requested by the National Guard to rebuild Camp Ashland. General Lengyel, Chief of the National Guard Bureau and Command Sergeant Major Kepner, Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chief, discussed with Senator Fischer several of the National Guard's priorities for the upcoming year, and presented Senator Fischer with the National Guard Bureau seal. 

"I was honored to meet with National Guard leadership today to discuss the many initiatives the Guard is working on. Through close coordination with the Nebraska National Guard and the National Guard Bureau, we were able to get the full amount needed in federal funding for FY 2020 to repair Camp Ashland after the damage caused by last year's bomb cyclone storm. I'm proud of the work we have done together to secure positive results for the Guard and the state," said Senator Fischer.
