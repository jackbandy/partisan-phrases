Trump Administration Announces Proposed Modernization of NEPA Regulations


U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Transportation and Safety, released the following statement today after the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) announced a notice of proposed rulemaking modernizing National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations:

"I applaud the administration for taking this first step to modernize NEPA regulations which have gone decades without a comprehensive update. The goal of this proposal is something I have long supported, and it's important for infrastructure across our state. More efficient and effective NEPA regulations will ensure better project decision-making without unnecessary burdens or delays on critical infrastructure projects. I encourage all Nebraskans to submit comments on this proposal."
