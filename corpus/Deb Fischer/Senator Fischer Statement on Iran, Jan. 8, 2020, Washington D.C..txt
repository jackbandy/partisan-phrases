Senator Fischer Statement on Iran


U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released the following statement today regarding recent tensions between the United States and Iran:

"This afternoon I received a classified briefing from members of President Trump's cabinet and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Milley. Based on the information presented, I believe the president acted appropriately and responsibly to protect American lives. The administration has made it clear to Iran that killing Americans has serious repercussions. We do not want to go to war with Iran, but the president has been and remains committed to doing what is necessary to keep American citizens safe."

At the classified briefing, Senator Fischer heard from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, and CIA Director Gina Haspel regarding Iraq and Iran.
