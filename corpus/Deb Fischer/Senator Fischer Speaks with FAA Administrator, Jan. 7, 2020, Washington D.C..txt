Senator Fischer Speaks with FAA Administrator, Provides Update on Drone Activity


U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), released the following statement today after speaking with FAA Administrator Steve Dickson regarding the recent sightings of unidentified unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), commonly known as drones, in Nebraska:

"Nebraskans are rightly concerned about recent drone activity. This morning, I spoke with FAA Administrator Dickson directly who informed me that, as of now, there are still no answers about who is using these drones. Yesterday, the FAA, FBI, the Nebraska State Patrol, and local law enforcement officials from Nebraska and Colorado met to discuss how to address this problem.

"An investigation is underway and the best thing Nebraskans can do right now is continue to report any drone sightings to law enforcement. I will continue to share information with the public as it becomes available."
