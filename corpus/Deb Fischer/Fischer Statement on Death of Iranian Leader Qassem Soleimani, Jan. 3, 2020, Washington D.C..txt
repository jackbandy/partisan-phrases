Fischer Statement on Death of Iranian Leader Qassem Soleimani


U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released the following statement today regarding the U.S. military operation that killed Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force:

"The president has authority and responsibility to protect American lives and interests when they are threatened. Over the past several months Iran has sharply escalated its pattern of aggression against the United States, our allies, and our partners. The United States does not seek a war with Iran; President Trump repeatedly demonstrated restraint, and Iran's leaders were given the opportunity to turn from the path of violence and escalation. They did not. Having seen the resolve of the United States to defend itself, I hope that Iran will end their destructive behavior and choose a more rational path."
