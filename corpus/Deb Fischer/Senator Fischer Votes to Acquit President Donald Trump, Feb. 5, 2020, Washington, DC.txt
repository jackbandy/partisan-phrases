Senator Fischer Votes to Acquit President Donald Trump


U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) released the following statement today after voting against both articles of impeachment:

"After presenting an extraordinary amount of information over the past two weeks, the House managers failed to make a compelling case that the president should be removed from office. Therefore, I voted for his acquittal on both charges. It is now time for the Senate to move forward, return to normal legislative business, and advance policies that will make life better for Nebraskans and all Americans."
