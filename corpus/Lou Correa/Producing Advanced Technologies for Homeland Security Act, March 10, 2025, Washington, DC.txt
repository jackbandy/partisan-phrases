Producing Advanced Technologies for Homeland Security Act


H.R. 1692 would once again allow the Department of Homeland Security  to use other transaction authority, or OTA, for 3 years.

Despite the efforts of Democrats in the House and Senate, DHS lost  its OTA authority last year because one Senator allowed it to lapse.  OTA was a vital tool that enabled DHS to work with nontraditional  government contractors to more quickly obtain cutting-edge emerging  technologies that addressed evolving threats.

Since September 2024, the lapse in OTA, 50 projects have been  disrupted, including 1 that led to identifying fraudulent documents,  improving passenger screening, and enhancing disaster response.

Furthermore, 26 projects with approximately $20 million invested in  them, taxpayer-invested money, are at the risk of being terminated by  OTA at this time. These projects include projects such as border  security, cybersecurity, counternarcotic security, and a few others.

The expiration of DHS' other transaction authority essentially will  mean inefficiency and waste, things that will impede the Department's  ability to develop solutions to keep our homeland safe.

It is past time, Mr. Speaker, to advance this legislation and bring  back DHS' ability to develop novel homeland security technologies.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives   Michael Guest and Shri  Thanedar for sponsoring this legislation. I urge all Members to restore  other transaction authority to the Department of Homeland Security, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
