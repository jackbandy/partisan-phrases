Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Santa Ana  High School girls wrestling team. They finished as Empire League  champs, Southern CIF champions, champions of the Division I dual, and  Eastern Division individual tournament champs. They finished fourth  place in the CIF Southern Section Masters.

Mr. Speaker, five of these wrestlers will be moving on to wrestle in  the State's championship tournament.

I thank Head Coaches Tim Byers and Fernando Serratos. I also thank  Assistant Coaches Liborio Salazar, Alex Becerra, Monica Serratos, Jose  Leon, and Stephanie Zamora for teaching our young Saints leadership  qualities, and what hard work and dedication can mean at the end of the  day.

These young ladies are wrestling champs all while maintaining a GPA  of 3.48.

Mr. Speaker, I offer congratulations to the Saints. Once a Saint,  always a Saint.
