Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to recognize  five young students who were taken too soon from the city of Santa Ana.  Recently, five students from Santa Ana Unified School District were  victims of a brutal car cash: Aurelia Robles, Arlene Robles, Natalia  Vidal Zarate, Jaqueline Torres Zarate, and Emanuel Gonzalez Martinez.  They were full of life, love, and adventure, and this tragic loss has  broken all of our hearts.

The families of these students are in our prayers. May the souls of  Arely, Arlene, Jaqueline, Natalia, and Manny rest in peace. Our  community will never forget them, and we will miss them dearly.
