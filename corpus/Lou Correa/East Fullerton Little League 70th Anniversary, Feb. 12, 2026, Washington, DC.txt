East Fullerton Little League 70th Anniversary


Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize East Fullerton  Little League's 70th birthday.

Little League's mission is to instill in children the values of  sportsmanship, honesty, loyalty, and courage, aiming to produce well- adjusted, stronger, and happier children.

The hundreds of volunteers who take the jobs of running a Little  League are usually the unsung heroes. That is why I am standing here  today to recognize the Little League volunteers who have stepped up to  the plate to demonstrate the benefits and values of volunteerism,  family, and sportsmanship.

Let's follow the example of our Little League parents and volunteers  by making a pledge to support youth in our community and to support the  people who spend countless hours teaching America's favorite pastime.

Let's play ball, Mr. Speaker.
