Recognizing Makiko Shirai


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690737/recognizing-makiko-shirai


Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career and service  of Makiko Shirai, a Japanese foreign service worker who worked to  strengthen the relationship between the United States and Japan.

On May 20, Makiko will be presented with Japan's Order of the Sacred  Treasure, Gold and Silver Rays, for 35 years of supporting the U.S.- Japanese relationship.

Throughout her career, Makiko served more than 90,000 Japanese  nationals in the Los Angeles area, and she played a large role in the  Consulate's emergency response to the 1994 Northridge earthquake and  again during the attacks of 9/11 on our country.

I thank my good friend and neighbor, Makiko. I thank her for being a  role model and showing us all what the power of relationships between  countries can do.

Congratulations to Makiko on a well-deserved honor.                          Recognizing Sophie Garcia

Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sophie Garcia, a  sophomore at Orange Lutheran High School in my district, who is making  school history as the first female wrestler to win a CIF Southern  Sectional individual wrestling championship.

Sophie's championship run included winning five matches in the 2-day  tournament, showcasing her exceptional skill, determination, and  competitive spirit.

Sophie trained very hard but studied even harder. She maintained a  4.2 GPA, earning recognition as a student-athlete scholar.

I am very proud of Sophie. I know she is going to do even better and  will keep up the good work.
