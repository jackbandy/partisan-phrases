Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to recognize  five young students who were taken too soon from the Santa Ana  community.

A few weeks ago, five students from the Santa Ana Unified School  District were victims of a devastating car crash: Aurelia Robles,  Natalia Vidal Zarate, Jacqueline Torres Zarate, Cynthia Torres Zarate,  and Emanuel Gonzalez Martinez.

This tragic loss has broken the hearts of our community.

Mr. Speaker, our prayers are with the families of these students. May  the souls of Arely, Jacqueline, Natalia, Cynthia, and Manny rest in  peace. Our community will never forget them. We miss them dearly. We  thank them for the time they spent with us.
