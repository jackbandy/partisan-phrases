Mr. CORREA.

Mr. CORREA. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of amendment No. 8  directing the Department of Veterans Affairs to make recommendations on  changes that are needed to its existing healthcare infrastructure so  veterans can receive psychedelic-assisted therapies upon FDA approval.

In December of 2024, the VA announced $1.5 million in funding for  clinical research on MDMA-assisted therapy for veterans with PTSD and  alcohol disorder, as well.

This is the first time the VA has funded research on psychedelic  compounds since the 1960s.

My fellow Psychedelics Advancing Therapies Caucus co-chair, General  Jack Bergman, and I are encouraged by the promising results so far that  we have seen in treating veterans with PTSD and other disorders.

However, these therapies are different from traditional therapies in  many ways. Psychedelic therapies involve hours-long sessions with  multiple therapists, additional safety issues, and special training  considerations for providers.

We introduced this amendment because we need to be ready and be  proactive to make sure that when the VA is ready to administer these  therapies they actually can.

While MDMA-assisted therapy did not receive FDA approval last summer,  approval of certain psychedelic therapies will likely come very soon.  We owe it to our veterans to make sure that they can access these  therapies upon approval.

Every day we lose nearly 20 veterans to suicide. One suicide is way  too many. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to make sure  that our veterans have the best care they need as soon as possible.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
