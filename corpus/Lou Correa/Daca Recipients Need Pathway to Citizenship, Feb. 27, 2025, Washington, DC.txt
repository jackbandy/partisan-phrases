Daca Recipients Need Pathway to Citizenship

Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share an incredible story of  one of my constituents, a proud DACA recipient, Martha Delgado.

Raised by a single mother who worked in the fields and cleaned  houses, Martha was determined to earn the American Dream. She graduated  with high honors from Godinez Fundamental High School in Santa Ana and  then went on to earn a bachelor's degree in public health from UC  Merced in 2019.

Martha's passion for innovation led her to University Lab Partners,  where she helps startup companies develop groundbreaking medical  devices and diagnostic devices. She helps bridge the gap between  research and real-world problems.

Martha's journey is a testament to the impact our youth can have when  they have the opportunity to earn the American Dream. I will not stop  fighting until she and other DACA recipients have a shot to earn  American citizenship.
