Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Law- Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act.

Simply put, Mr. Speaker, this legislation will save lives. It is  supported, as my colleague has said, by an unprecedented, historic  coalition. Support spans 95 bipartisan cosponsors across 35 States,  including the Fraternal Order of Police, Major County Sheriffs,  Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association, Peace Officers  Research Association of California, African American Mayors  Association, Moms Against Police Brutality, and the Prince Jones, Jr.  Foundation.

This collaboration, this coalition of law enforcement leaders and  community justice advocates, doesn't happen by accident. It is because  this legislation is sound policy, balanced, and needed.

Modern less-than-lethal devices like the latest taser systems fully  integrate with body-worn cameras, automatically capturing events and  improving oversight.

These tools reduce the risk and increase transparency, expanding the  evidence record around use-of-force incidents. It provides clarity for  agencies, manufacturers, and regulators without--let me repeat,  without--weakening gun laws.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this measure.
