Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the 90th birthday  of Irmgard Hermann Davis.

Irmgard grew up in Germany during World War II. After the war, she  came to visit her sister in Garden Grove, California, my district,  where her life changed forever.

She met Wally Davis. They got married and had seven beautiful  children. She never returned to Germany. Wally Davis was one of Orange  County's first Hispanic attorneys and a civil rights icon. Irmgard was  always there for him, and she was the story behind Wally's success.

I wish Irmgard a happy birthday. We love her and look forward to her  next few birthdays.
