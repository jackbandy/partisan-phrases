Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the Anaheim  High School girls' water polo team that just won the CIF Division 6  championship.

This victory represents hard work, determination, and perseverance on  behalf of the players and their coaches, and they did that the whole  season.

As an Anaheim High School alumnus myself, I congratulate our student  athletes, parents, coaches, and teachers. Again, they have made us  proud.

I ask my colleagues today to join me in celebrating this great  victory for the Anaheim High School girls' water polo team.

Remember, once a Colonist, always a Colonist.
