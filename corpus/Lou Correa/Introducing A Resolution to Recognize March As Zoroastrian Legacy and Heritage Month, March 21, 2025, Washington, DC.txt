Introducing A Resolution to Recognize March As Zoroastrian Legacy and Heritage Month


Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my Resolution to  recognize the month of March as ``Zoroastrian Legacy and Heritage  Month.''

Originating in ancient Persia, Zoroastrianism is one of the world's  oldest monotheistic religions. Its legacy includes significant  contributions to history and civilization, including influencing  democracy, universal human rights, and international trade and  commerce.

In fact, Cyrus the Great, a follower of Zoroastrianism, recorded the  first declaration of human rights, emphasizing freedom of religion,  equality, cultural and civil rights, and the abolishment of slavery.  These values were recorded on the famous Cyrus Cylinder in 539 B.C.E,  and remain an essential part of our values today--including being  enshrined in our own Constitution.

Zoroastrianism celebrates the spring festival of Nowruz during the  Spring Equinox in March, signifying the triumph of light, warmth, and  life over darkness. March is devoted to Mother Earth, symbolizing  peace, love, and harmony.

Today, Zoroastrians continue to contribute to our world and to the  United States. The Zoroastrian Association of California has made  Orange County it's home and serves as a house of worship and a place  for social gatherings.

I call on my colleagues to support my Resolution to recognize the  month of March as ``Zoroastrian Legacy and Heritage Month.''
