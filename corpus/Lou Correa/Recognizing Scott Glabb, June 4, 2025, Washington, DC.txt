Recognizing Scott Glabb


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691910/recognizing-scott-glabb


Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the achievements of  wrestling coach Scott Glabb, the saint in the city.

Scott took the Santa Ana High School coaching job in 1990 because  nobody else would apply for the job.

Mr. Speaker, 30 years later, he has produced national high school  wrestling champs, State champs, CIF wrestling champs, both boys and  girls.

Mr. Speaker, it is often said that, when a person tastes success, it  changes their lives forever. Coach Glabb has helped thousands of  students discover their inner youth and their strength, and helped them  to overcome tremendous adversity. It is this kind of leadership that  earned Scott the title ``Coach of the Year'' and a place in the  California Coaches Hall of Fame.

Only Coach Glabb could see that all that these kids needed was a  break and somebody who cared for them.

I thank Scott for the positive role model that he has presented to  our kids. We love him and wish him success in his retirement.
