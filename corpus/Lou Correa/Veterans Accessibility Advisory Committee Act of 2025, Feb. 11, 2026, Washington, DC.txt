Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025

Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, in California when you register to vote, you  do so under penalty of perjury. Then they cross-check your information  to make sure that you are eligible. Then we have a very active district  attorney in Orange County that says if you violated this under penalty  of perjury, we are going down on you.

Instead, I would ask my friends, my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle: Let's do everything we can to make sure that every eligible  American actually votes.

Why would you take away the right of a veteran to vote, of a senior  to vote, of somebody in the military to vote? Let's go the other way.

Democracy is stronger when we have stronger participation. Vote  ``no,'' and let's move on with democracy.
