Subterranean Border Defense Act


Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in strong support of H.R. 495 because we  need more oversight and information on the threat of tunnels going  under our border.

It is a fact that tunnels, clandestine tunnels, under our borders  have been an issue for not years but decades, and it is time we take  action. It is time that Congress be informed of our progress to prevent  such tunnels from happening. That is why I support H.R. 495.

Tunnels are used by transnational criminal organizations looking to  make a profit at the expense of our taxpayers. Over the last 30 years,  cartels have created illegal and sophisticated tunnels under our border  walls to smuggle drugs into our country, as well as money and weapons  out of our country.

This bill creates an annual reporting requirement to keep Congress  informed on the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to counter  illicit cross-border tunnels and hold the bad actors accountable.

This information will help us, Congress, address the issue at the  border and let us, as Members of Congress, better respond to the  challenges.

Mr. Speaker, I believe this bill is an important step in the right  direction. Receiving information from the Department of Homeland  Security on an annual basis will improve Congress' efforts to counter  illicit cross-border tunnels and hold bad actors accountable. I support  this bipartisan piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
