Raising A Question of the Privileges of the House


Mr. SCHMIDT. Mr. Speaker, I was absent from the house to attend the  funeral of Kansas City, Kansas, Police Officer Hunter Simoncic, who was  killed in the line of duty last month. Had I been present, I would have  voted YEA on Roll Call No. 221, YEA on Roll Call No. 222, and NAY on  Roll Call No. 223.
