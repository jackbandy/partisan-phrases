Mr. SCHMIDT. Mr. Speaker, 20 years ago this spring, there was a  Cinderella moment in southeast Kansas. The Iola High School girls'  basketball team, known as the Fillies, won the 2006 Kansas State High  School Activities Association Class 4A State basketball championship.  This came on top of a remarkable 24-2 season.

As a Kansas State senator at the time, I had the privilege of  sponsoring a resolution in our State legislature to commend the team's  win and to host the team at the Kansas State House to see the  resolution's unanimous adoption.

A week ago, on the 20th anniversary, the community in Iola came  together and inducted that 2006 team into the Iola High School's Don  Bain Hall of Fame. Believe me, Mr. Speaker, the community has not  forgotten what they accomplished.

The auditorium was packed. Former classmates and teachers came home  to join in the celebration. Back in 2006, the student members of this  outstanding basketball team received statewide recognition for their  fine sportsmanship and athletic accomplishments. At the Hall of Fame  induction last week, the team was also recognized for the ongoing  camaraderie and success of its members in the years since.

As I said in the Kansas State House back in 2006, the team did an  outstanding job of representing Allen County and southeast Kansas in  the State tournament. I am very proud of their achievements, and I am  honored to say in the United States Capitol today, 20 years later, I  continue to be very proud of this team, the young women who composed  it, and the community who supported it.

Congratulations, Fillies.
