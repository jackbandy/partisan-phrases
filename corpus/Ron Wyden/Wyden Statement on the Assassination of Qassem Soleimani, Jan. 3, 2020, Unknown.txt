Wyden Statement on the Assassination of Qassem Soleimani


U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement on the assassination of Qassem Soleimani:

"Qassem Soleimani was a bad man with a lot of blood on his hands, but Donald Trump's decision to assassinate him was a reckless escalation that will take us further down the road to ruinous war. A president has the responsibility to ensure that all necessary steps have been taken to protect vulnerable American military and civilian targets before taking such a precipitous act. Given Trump's awful record on foreign policy I'm extremely concerned that he has not prepared for the fallout, which could put more American lives at risk."
