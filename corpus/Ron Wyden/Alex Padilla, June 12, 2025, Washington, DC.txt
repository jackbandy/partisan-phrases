Alex Padilla


Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I was on my way to the floor to talk about  clean energy policy this afternoon, but I have to join my colleagues in  addressing the shocking video out of Los Angeles. I have now looked at  it. If you are following at home, our colleague Senator Padilla was  carrying out his constitutional responsibilities to conduct oversight  and defend the people he represents. At that time, he was physically  accosted and shoved out of a press conference, pushed to the ground,  and handcuffed at a press conference being held by Kristi Noem.

It is a horrifying video, truly horrifying. And I am of the view--why  I especially wanted to come to the floor--it is not about it happening  to a U.S. Senator. Here is what it is about: If they will do this to a  sitting U.S. Senator in front of a room full of media, imagine what is  being done to powerless people in secret.

In Portland, in my hometown, we have had firsthand experience with  this kind of activity--faceless, unidentifiable agents with guns  staring down peaceful protesters. In Portland, it was a ``wall of  moms.'' My neighbors--we all said then it is un-American, and I say it  again this afternoon: What we have seen on our screens is un-American.  It doesn't have the support of the American people, this kind of anti- democratic conduct.

I will close simply by saying this: This has to change. Peaceful  Americans cannot have this kind of abuse rained down on them for the  next 3\1/2\ years. It has to end now.
