Wyden Votes to Hold Trump Back from Rushing U.S. to War with Iran


U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement on the U.S. Senate's vote on the war powers resolution to prevent further escalation of hostilities with Iran:

"Donald Trump started the year racing our country toward war with Iran like it was his New Year's resolution. With this vote, the Senate is exercising its constitutional role to check an unstable and dangerous executive.  

"My vote was informed by the late Senator Wayne Morse, the Oregonian whose seat I'm proud to hold today. He voted against the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, and he spent the mid-1960s as a lonely voice against the war in Vietnam. In 1966 he gave a speech warning that the Senate had surrendered too much control over foreign policy to the president, allowing military escalation that would cost tens of thousands of American lives and vast sums of money. The same is true today.  

"Today's vote signals the Senate keeping its solemn obligation to hold Donald Trump back from rushing our country into another forever war. Wayne Morse would be proud."
