Wyden Statement on Latest Jobs Report


Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement in reaction to the latest jobs report from the Labor Department:

"The unemployment rate is now higher than since the Great Depression, and Trump's decision to wave the white flag against the virus means the economy will remain in a ditch for years to come. The Republican Party has learned nothing since Herbert Hoover.

"Our continued response to this catastrophe must meet the moment, and that means putting programs like expanded unemployment benefits on autopilot so help to workers is based on economic conditions-not the political climate. Families will face unprecedented and unnecessary economic pain and suffering if Congress fails to take this action."
