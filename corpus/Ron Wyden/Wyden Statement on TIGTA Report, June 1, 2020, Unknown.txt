Wyden Statement on TIGTA Report


Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement in response to a report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration:

"As a result of Republicans' years-long effort to gut the IRS and protect their donors from scrutiny, wealthy tax cheats stole nearly $46 billion in just three years by refusing to even file their taxes. What's worse, the IRS did little to nothing to pursue these tax cheats. Investments in health care, infrastructure and education will be perpetually short-changed if paying taxes is essentially voluntary for those at the top. The IRS needs historic investments to address this crisis."
