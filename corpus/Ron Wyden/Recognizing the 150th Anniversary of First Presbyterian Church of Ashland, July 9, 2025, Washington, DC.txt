Recognizing the 150th Anniversary of First Presbyterian Church of Ashland


Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Rev. Dan Fowler and  First Presbyterian Church of Ashland on 150 years of commitment to  welcoming and accepting people through all walks of life into your  community of faith. Ever since Rev. Moses Allen Williams organized the  First Presbyterian Church of Ashland on August 18, 1875, this church in  southern Oregon has remained dedicated to--in their own words-- ``honoring the teachings of Jesus and being a safe haven for all who  walk through its doors.'' First Presbyterian Church celebrates its  150th anniversary as a diverse church family that includes families,  professionals of all kinds, including artists, college students, and  people struggling with homelessness, all of whom come together to walk  with God and serve their community.

Since 1875, First Presbyterian Church of Ashland has been committed  to serving the local and global community and has prided itself on  being a welcoming and affirming place for all. Their specific forms of  aid include overnight parking spots for those facing homelessness, a  free pantry, emergency transportation and food aid, and free answers to  medical questions. The church's continued service to our community  represents the very best of Oregon's spirit of commitment, service, and  dedication.

First Presbyterian Church of Ashland's impact extends far beyond just  the people they have directly helped; it ripples outward to make Oregon  a better place for all of us to call home. The church's willingness to  remain engaged and active in service exemplifies the values that we, as  Oregonians, hold dear.

It is an honor to represent First Presbyterian Church of Ashland in  the U.S. Senate and congratulations again to the church on its 150th  anniversary.
