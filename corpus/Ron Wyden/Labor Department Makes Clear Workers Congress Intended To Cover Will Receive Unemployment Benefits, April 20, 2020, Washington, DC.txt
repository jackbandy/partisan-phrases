Labor Department Makes Clear Workers Congress Intended To Cover Will Receive Unemployment Benefits


Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today announced that the Department of Labor has made clear, after a confusing start, that workers Congress intended to be covered by the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program will receive the benefits they deserve. 

"Workers have been hit by an economic wrecking ball, with 22 million filing for unemployment benefits in the past month. Supercharged unemployment benefits are critical to getting workers through this unprecedented economic crisis and they can't be allowed to fall through the cracks," Wyden said. "I appreciate the Labor Department making crystal clear that workers Congress intended to cover get the assistance they need to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads."

In response to a request led by Senators Wyden and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the department clarified a number of points:

-Gig workers are eligible for unemployment benefits if they are facing reduced demand for their services, but are not barred from offering them.-Workers are eligible for unemployment benefits if they have symptoms of COVID-19 and seek a diagnosis--a positive COVID-19 test is not required.-Workers are eligible for unemployment benefits if they are diagnosed with COVID-19 and are forced to take unpaid time off work.-Workers are eligible for unemployment benefits if their child care facility is closed after school was scheduled to adjourn for the year.  -Workers are eligible for unemployment benefits if they are subject to stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders that prevent them from working.-Workers are eligible for unemployment benefits if they are advised to quarantine by a health care provider. -Workers remain eligible for unemployment benefits if their reason for eligibility changes--they do not need to file a separate application.-Workers in U.S. territories are eligible for the additional $600 per week in unemployment benefits.
