Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3173

  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the majority party's anti-women healthcare  agenda has certainly been on display in the last few days here in the  U.S. Senate: two votes on Tuesday, more votes and debate today. Every  time it is the same basic proposition on offer: legislation that  squeezes Republican politicians in between women and their doctors. 

  I have said the old GOP slogan used to be ``a chicken in every pot.''  These days it is ``a Republican in every exam room.'' 

  Not only does this legislation discount the fact that reproductive  healthcare, including abortion, is healthcare; it would make women's  healthcare services more expensive. This would head this country back  to the days when the healthcare system was just for the healthy and the  wealthy. 

  My view is decisions about the healthcare of women, especially  reproductive healthcare--including abortion--are enormously personal.  They ought to be decisions made between women and their physicians.  Politicians ought to stay away. They ought to stay out of it all. That  is what the Roe v. Wade case is all about, and it is the law of the  land.
