Wyden Statement on Donald Trump's New Campaign Ad Falsely Taking Credit for Supercharged Unemployment Benefits


Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement in reaction to Donald Trump's new campaign ad, which falsely takes credit for supercharging unemployment benefits:

"Donald Trump is the new chairman of the chutzpah caucus, attempting to take credit for supercharged unemployment in his whopper of a campaign ad. To be clear, Donald Trump had nothing to do with boosting unemployment benefits. Supercharging unemployment benefits was a top priority of Senate Democrats, and Donald Trump's administration fought against it. Going forward, Donald Trump's plan is to cut off the boost in unemployment benefits he's falsely claiming as his own and shower his wealthy buddies with more tax cuts. It's telling how unpopular Donald Trump's economic agenda is that he's touting unemployment benefits and not the tax breaks for multinational corporations and wealthy real estate investors that were Republican priorities."
