Wyden Supports War Powers Resolution to Prevent War With Iran


U.S. Senator Ron Wyden today joined Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., to support a war powers resolution to force a debate and vote in Congress to prevent further escalation of hostilities with Iran.

"At each of my town halls this past weekend, I heard from Oregonians concerned that Donald Trump is racing our country towards war. Today I cosponsored a Senate Resolution to prevent this reckless administration from launching a war against Iran," Wyden said. "We cannot allow Trump's rash approach to foreign policy continue to put American lives in danger at home and abroad. Congress must act now."

Wyden voted against the Iraq war and has consistently opposed risking American soldiers in unnecessary foreign wars. For years, Wyden has raised concerns over presidents' efforts to expand the use of military force without congressional authorization. In 2019, Wyden also supported the Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act and voted against the National Defense Authorization Act in December, to oppose runaway defense spending and endless foreign wars.

War powers resolutions are privileged, meaning that the Senate will be forced to vote on the legislation. The resolution underscores that Congress has the sole power to declare war, as laid out in the Constitution. The resolution requires that any hostilities with Iran must be explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force, but does not prevent the United States from defending itself from imminent attack. The resolution will force a public debate and vote in Congress as intended by the framers of the Constitution to determine whether United States forces should be engaged in these hostilities.
