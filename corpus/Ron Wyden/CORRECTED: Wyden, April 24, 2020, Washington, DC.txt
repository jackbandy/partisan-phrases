CORRECTED: Wyden, Merkley: OHSU to Receive $2.7 Million in COVID-19 Aid


U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced that OHSU will receive about $2.7 million in grants to help provide quality rural health care during the COVID-19 crisis.

"Our state's health care heroes caring for Oregonians need all possible federal resources to keep themselves and their patients safe in the middle of this public health crisis," Wyden said. "I am glad OHSU has earned these grants to support their life-and-death work, and will continue to fight for funds to help medical providers in rural Oregon and statewide battle the coronavirus."

"As our medical system is strained from treating coronavirus patients, especially in rural areas, it is vital that we provide them the resources they need to keep staff and patients safe," Merkley said. "These grants are a start, and I'll continue to do everything I can to fight for the resources our rural medical systems need to provide Oregonians access to quality health care through this crisis, and on the other side."

OHSU will receive almost $2.7 million from HRSA to combat COVID-19 in rural communities -- including further expansion of telehealth, purchases of personal protective equipment, and boosting testing capacity. OHSU also got a $79,594 grant for its poison control centers. 

"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable strain on our rural hospitals. Federal support is essential for their long-term viability," said Robert Duehmig, Interim Director of the Oregon Office of Rural Health at OHSU. "We very much appreciate this funding and look forward to identifying additional support to keep Oregon's rural hospitals functioning."

Mosaic Medical in central Oregon also will get nearly $3.5 million in its annual Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) grant to provide primary care services in underserved areas.
