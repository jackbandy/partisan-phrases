Wyden, Klobuchar Statement on Funding to Secure our Elections Included in Coronavirus Response Legislation


U.S. Senators Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., released the following statement regarding election funding included in the latest COVID-19 emergency package. 

"In times of crisis, the American people cannot be forced to choose between their health and exercising their right to vote. While this funding is a step in the right direction, we must enact election reforms across the country as well as secure more resources to guarantee safe and secure elections. We will continue to fight to pass the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act of 2020 to ensure every eligible American can safely and lawfully cast their ballot."
