Wyden Statement on Trump Opposition to Extending Unemployment Benefits


Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement in reaction to Washington Post reporting that Donald Trump does not support extending the $600 boost in unemployment benefits: 

"With nearly 1 in 5 Americans out of work, Donald Trump's plan is to cut off the boost in unemployment benefits and shower his wealthy buddies with more tax cuts. This is the worst economic crisis in 100 years and Donald Trump is doubling down on Herbert Hoover's economic playbook, and pushing workers to risk their health for his political benefit."
