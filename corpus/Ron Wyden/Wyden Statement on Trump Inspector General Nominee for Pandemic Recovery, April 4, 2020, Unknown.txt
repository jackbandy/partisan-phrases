Wyden Statement on Trump Inspector General Nominee for Pandemic Recovery


Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today issued the following statement on the nomination of Brian Miller to be special inspector general for pandemic recovery: 

"The special inspector general needs to be independent above all. Someone who currently works in the White House counsel's office, serving a president who has tried to silence other inspector generals and announced his intention to silence this one, is not independent. It's no wonder President Trump announced this nomination late on a Friday evening."

"While Mr. Miller has requisite experience for this position, he must clear a high bar to show the Senate he would protect the interests of the American people over the political interests of this administration."
