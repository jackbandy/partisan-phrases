Wyden Statement on Final Dark Money Rule


Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement in response to the final dark money rule, which repeals nonprofit donor reporting requirements:

"The Trump administration has opened the flood gates to dark money pouring into our election system just months before Donald Trump is on the ballot. We're in the midst of a global pandemic and once-in-a-lifetime economic crisis and the Trump administration is prioritizing boosting the president's political prospects with shady cash. In finalizing this rule, the Treasury Department ignored the concerns of election security experts--anything to allow hostile foreign interests and groups like the NRA to further undermine our democracy."
