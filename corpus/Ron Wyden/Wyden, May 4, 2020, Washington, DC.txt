Wyden, Merkley: Oregon Public Housing Authorities to Receive More than $5.7 Million in COVID-19 Aid


U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced that 21 public housing authorities throughout Oregon will receive more than $5.7 million in grants to help with tenant-based rental assistance needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Oregonians battling the multiple economic challenges triggered by this public health crisis need to know there's support available when they're staying at home and fighting to keep a roof over their heads," Wyden said. "I am gratified these local housing authorities are receiving this much-needed assistance to help the renters counting on them in Oregon."

"Oregon's housing crisis is being made all the more urgent by a public health emergency, during which Oregonians are facing economic uncertainty and should stay home as much as possible to keep our communities safe," said Merkley. "I'm glad we're getting these grants out to help renters keep roofs over their heads during this pandemic, but let's make no mistake--this problem predates the pandemic and will be with us until we put in place bold solutions that ensure every Oregonian has a decent place they can afford to live."

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and. Economic Security (CARES) Act provided $1.25 billion nationally for tenant-based rental assistance, which funds the housing choice voucher program -- including $400 million for increased subsidy costs and $850 million for administrative and other expenses incurred by public housing authorities.

"We very much appreciate Senators Wyden and Merkley for considering housing needs for Oregonians who have suffered financially because of this pandemic," said Northeast Oregon Housing Authority Executive Director Dale Inslee. "We are also privileged to be just a part of those who can help in any way possible.  These funds will be greatly appreciated by landlords, tenants and all agencies working to assist those who are displaced or financially strapped because of this public health crisis."

"The City of Salem and its housing authority are grateful for the CARES funding," said Salem Mayor Chuck Bennett. "The funding will help keep residents housed, residents who are among the most hurt by COVID-19's economic damage. "
