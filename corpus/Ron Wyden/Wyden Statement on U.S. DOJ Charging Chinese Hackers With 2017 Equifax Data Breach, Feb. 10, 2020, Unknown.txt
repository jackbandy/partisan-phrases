Wyden Statement on U.S. DOJ Charging Chinese Hackers With 2017 Equifax Data Breach


U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement on the U.S. Justice Department charging Chinese Military hackers in the 2017 Equifax data breach:

"There's no separating privacy and national security. When companies like Equifax amass vast stores of sensitive personal information and then cut corners on security, they become irresistible targets for unfriendly regimes like China. Passing strong privacy legislation like my Mind Your Own Business Act is essential for our national security and our individual safety."
