Wyden on FERC Nominee Vote: "The Trump administration appears determined to overthrow any semblance of independence at the FERC"


U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., released the following statement opposing today's U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources vote advancing the nomination of James P. Danly to be a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC):

"The Trump administration appears determined to overthrow any semblance of independence at the FERC. For months, the agency has operated without a full and bipartisan commission, throwing into question whether its decisions are partisan in nature. That the administration is working to advance the Danly nomination without a Democratic nominee only tilts the scale further," Wyden said. "The American people deserve a FERC that will ensure fair, open, fact-based and non-political consideration of projects--and that requires a full and bipartisan FERC."

There are currently two vacancies on the commission. Should the Senate confirm Danly, a Republican, three of the four confirmed commissioners would be Republicans, leaving one Democratic vacancy and running counter to the commission's longstanding tradition of balance and bipartisanship.

Wyden, a senior member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, in January called for Donald Trump to appoint a full and bipartisan commission before the commission rules on complex projects, such as the Jordan Cove Energy Project in Oregon.
