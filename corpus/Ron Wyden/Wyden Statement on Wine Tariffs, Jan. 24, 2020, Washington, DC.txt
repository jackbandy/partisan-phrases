Wyden Statement on Wine Tariffs


U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden today released the following statement on wine tariffs:

"All across our state I've heard from constituents, small business owners, and wine growers how harmful tariffs would be to Oregon's economy. I'm encouraged by a recent conversation I had with Ambassador Lighthizer about the impact of additional tariffs on the Oregon wine economy. 

It would be to everyone's benefit to resolve these trade disputes with Europe quickly.  I discouraged an escalation in our trade tensions, and I am hopeful that there will be a pause on additional tariffs on wine imports."
