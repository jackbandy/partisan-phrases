Wyden Statement on Trump Budget Slashing Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security and Proposal to Privatize BPA


U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement on the Trump budget:

"For a president who makes himself out to be a champion of typical working Americans, Donald Trump has run the same old Republican playbook of giving tax handouts to the wealthy and slashing the safety net that supports everybody else. He started this con with his 2016 campaign promises not to touch Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, and now he wants to cut them by more than $1.5 trillion. Bottom line, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are on the chopping block as long as Donald Trump is president."

Wyden also condemned the Trump proposal to privatize Bonneville Power for the third consecutive year. Wyden said:

"Too many families in Oregon are already balancing the food bill against the utility bill and do not need the administration to come in like a wrecking ball and make things worse. Yet, Trump is once again threatening to sell off Bonneville Power and raise the monthly utility bills for Oregon families and businesses. This misguided scheme would be felt by everybody in the Northwest."
