Wyden Statement on Appointment of Richard Grenell as Acting DNI


U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today issued the following statement on Donald Trump's appointment of Richard Grenell as acting Director of National Intelligence:

"If there was any doubt that Donald Trump values unquestioning obedience over the safety of the American people, this appointment settles the question. The Director of National Intelligence's job requires expertise in intelligence, a clear-eyed understanding of the threats facing the country and the ability to work with allies against those threats. Mr. Grenell's endorsement of the European far right, his gratuitous conflicts with our German allies and his lack of intelligence experience disqualify him on all counts. Senators who take their oath of office seriously must oppose Trump's practice of dodging Senate confirmation practices to place unqualified individuals into highly sensitive national security posts."
