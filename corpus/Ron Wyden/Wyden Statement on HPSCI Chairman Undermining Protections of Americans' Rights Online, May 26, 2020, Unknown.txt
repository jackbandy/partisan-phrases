Wyden Statement on HPSCI Chairman Undermining Protections of Americans' Rights Online


U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., issued the following statement in response to HPSCI Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff's statement undermining an amendment to protect Americans from warrantless collection of internet browsing history and searches.

"The House Intelligence Committee chairman's assertion that the Lofgren-Davidson amendment does not fully protect Americans from warrantless collection flatly contradicts the intent of Wyden-Daines, and my understanding of the amendment agreed to earlier today. It is now clear that there is no agreement with the House Intelligence Committee to enact true protections for Americans' rights against dragnet collection of online activity, which is why I must oppose this amendment, along with the underlying bill, and urge the House to vote on the original Wyden-Daines amendment," Wyden said. 

The Wyden-Daines amendment required a warrant to collect Americans' internet searches and browsing history under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. It garnered 59 Senate votes last week.
