Wyden Statement on Unemployment Assistance Affected by GOP Governors "Reopening" States


Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today issued the following statement regarding the effect of Republican governors "reopening" their states and workers' access to pandemic unemployment assistance:

"Republican governors are casting public health aside and forcing their states to "reopen'. The effects of these reckless decisions will trickle down to vulnerable workers, making them ineligible for pandemic unemployment assistance even though businesses may remain closed and customers may stay home because they're afraid of getting sick. Everyone wants to find a new normal and get back to our lives, but pretending the crisis is over when it's not over will make it much harder to contain the virus and for workers to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads."
