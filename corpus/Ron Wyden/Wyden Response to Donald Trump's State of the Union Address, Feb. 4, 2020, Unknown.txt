Wyden Response to Donald Trump's State of the Union Address


Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement in response to Donald Trump's State of the Union address:

"If you want to see what Donald Trump would do with four more years, look back at his record of ignoring the problems typical families face over the last three.

"Trump's key legislative accomplishment is a tax handout for multinational corporations, special interests and the wealthy, and he expects working families to praise him for it. With another term, he'll send those working families and seniors the bill for his $2 trillion tax giveaway and claw back their hard earned health care and Social Security benefits. Americans are still getting mugged by drug companies every time they walk up to the pharmacy counter, but Trump hasn't lifted a finger to lower drug prices, and has even discarded his campaign promise to let Medicare negotiate. His administration's recent attack on Medicaid is just the latest example of how it's shredding the safety net and making it harder for millions of Americans to get ahead.

"Bottom line, the Trump administration has been a terrific success at helping the powerful and wealthy build on their power and wealth, but it has failed at addressing the key kitchen table issues that keep typical Americans up at night."
