Wyden Statement on Trump's Removal of Pandemic Response Accountability Committee Chair


Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement on the removal of Acting Inspector General Glenn Fine as chair of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee:

"Donald Trump will stop at nothing to obstruct oversight and install his yes-men in these key positions. Donald Trump is clearly executing a systematic purge of inspectors general who have done their jobs and refused to bend to political pressures. Every Republican who voted against removing the president paved the way for these authoritarian moves."
