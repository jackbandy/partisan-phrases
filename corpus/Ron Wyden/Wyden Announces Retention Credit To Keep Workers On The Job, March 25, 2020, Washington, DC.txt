Wyden Announces Retention Credit To Keep Workers On The Job


Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today announced an employee retention credit to prevent further mass layoffs is included in the bipartisan agreement to respond to the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the Trump administration's failure to ensure widespread testing.

"Our goal is to prevent as many layoffs as possible and keep workers on the job. If workers are kept on the payroll they will be able to pay their bills and stay connected to their health care and other benefits," Wyden said. "Small businesses are being hit especially hard. Without additional support, many will be permanently shuttered by this crisis."
