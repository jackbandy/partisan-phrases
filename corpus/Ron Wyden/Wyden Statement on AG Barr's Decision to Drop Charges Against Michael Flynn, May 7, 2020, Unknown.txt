Wyden Statement on AG Barr's Decision to Drop Charges Against Michael Flynn


U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement after the Justice Department said it will drop charges against former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn:

"AG Barr has destroyed the credibility of the Justice Department to help someone who was working on behalf of a foreign government while serving as the National Security Advisor. If Barr's Justice Department will drop charges against someone who twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and who the White House publicly fired for lying to the vice president, there's nothing it won't do, no investigation it won't taint. There's no doubt left: William Barr won't stop undermining the rule of law to punish Trump's rivals and shield his friends from justice."
