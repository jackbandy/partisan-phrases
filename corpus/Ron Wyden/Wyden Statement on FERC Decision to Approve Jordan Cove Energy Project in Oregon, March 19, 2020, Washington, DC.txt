Wyden Statement on FERC Decision to Approve Jordan Cove Energy Project in Oregon


U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., opposed today's decision of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to approve the controversial and complex Jordan Cove energy project in Oregon over the objection of all three of Oregon state environmental regulatory agencies and while the Commission remains imbalanced and the country is in the midst of a public health crisis.

Wyden released the following statement:

"A few days ago, Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell stacked the decks when yet another Republican commissioner was confirmed to FERC, leaving the Commission unbalanced. This is despite current law that says the FERC should be an independent and bipartisan commission.

"Today, a stacked and incomplete FERC approved the controversial and complicated Jordan Cove project. There was no rush. A balanced and full FERC should have made the decision.

"If that's not bad enough, the Commission has decided to disregard local private property rights and environmental concerns identified by Oregonians. Both shortcomings and additional ones have been documented in the strong objections to the Jordan Cove project by three Oregon state regulatory agencies. All this adds up to a clearly rigged process designed to advance Trump-McConnell corporate interests over Oregonians.

All these violations are contrary to everything the Oregon Way stands for -- fairness, transparency and accountability. I now have to oppose this project." 

Wyden, a senior member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, in January called for Donald Trump to appoint a full and bipartisan commission before the Commission rules on complex projects, such as the Jordan Cove Energy Project in Oregon.
