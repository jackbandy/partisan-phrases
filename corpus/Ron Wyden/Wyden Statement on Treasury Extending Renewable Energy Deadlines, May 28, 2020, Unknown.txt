Wyden Statement on Treasury Extending Renewable Energy Deadlines


Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement on the Treasury Department's decision to extend deadlines for renewable energy projects:

"The Treasury Department made the right call in granting my request to extend the deadline to complete new wind and solar projects delayed by the pandemic. This common sense move will help protect these projects and the jobs created by them. While this is a good first step, further action will be necessary to ensure our progress toward a clean energy future."
