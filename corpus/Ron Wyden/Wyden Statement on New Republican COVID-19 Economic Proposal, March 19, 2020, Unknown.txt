Wyden Statement on New Republican COVID-19 Economic Proposal


Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released the following statement on the new Republican economic proposal in response the novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) pandemic:

"The pandemic is spreading, economic collapse is looming, and Republicans seem to be prioritizing the corporate tax wish list over the economic well-being of people who are losing their livelihoods at this very moment. Their proposal would do nothing to expand unemployment assistance for those who have lost their jobs overnight. While broad economic stimulus is needed, the first priority must be those who have no way to pay their bills for potentially months down the road."
