Merkley, Wyden Announce Nearly $14 Million in HHS Grants for Oregon Health Facilities


Oregon's U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced that over $14 million in grant funding will be distributed among 15 health facilities in Oregon to help with response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"We have a responsibility to make sure that the Oregonians working on the front lines of this public health crisis have the resources they need to do their jobs safely and effectively," said Merkley. "These grants will help us make sure that our health facilities and their dedicated employees have what they need to stay safe and take care of our communities during this challenging time--and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure those urgent resources keep coming."

"Oregon's health care heroes working 24-7 to protect communities during the coronavirus pandemic deserve support for their life-and-death work," Wyden said. "Much more needs to be done, but I am gratified these grants will help medical providers to keep Oregonians safe in every nook and cranny throughout our state."
