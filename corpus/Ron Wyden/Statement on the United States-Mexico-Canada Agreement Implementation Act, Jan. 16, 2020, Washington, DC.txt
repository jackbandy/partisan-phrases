Statement on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when the Trump administration unveiled  their  original version of this proposal, it was stunning to see how weak it  was in terms of trade enforcement. When you write a proposal with weak  trade enforcement, particularly on labor and environmental issues, you  sell out American workers and you launch a corporate race to the bottom  of cheap wages and the treatment of labor. 

  Senator Brown and I decided that was unacceptable, and we were going  to create a trade enforcement regime with real teeth. We worked with  Senators here; we worked with Senators on the other side of the aisle  and in the other body. To give you an example of what this means with  respect to enforcing trade law, we sped up the timeline by more than  300 percent. 

  The second point--just very quickly--what this proposal does is bring  technology and trade policy into the 21st century. When the last North  American Free Trade Agreement was considered, nobody had a smartphone.  So what we did is protect intellectual property; we prohibited  shakedowns of data belonging to innovative companies; and on something  I care deeply about, we drew on established U.S. law to defend small  tech entrepreneurs working to build successful companies in a field  dominated by Goliaths. 

  I urge my colleagues to support this proposal and once again thank  Bob Lighthizer, the hardest working man in the trade agreement  business. 

  I urge a ``yes'' vote.
