Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, international trade is critical to the  resilience and functioning of global supply chains, with goods and  services--including industrial inputs and manufacturing equipment being  imported and exported along the way. The trade policies and trade  actions of the U.S. Government impact the structure, operation,  efficiency, and security of U.S. supply chains, and the Office of the  U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) plays a key role in developing and  coordinating the implementation of those trade policies and actions.  USTR can provide valuable input to the Supply Chain Resilience Working  Group, and the committees with jurisdiction over trade--the Senate  Committee on Finance and House Committee on Ways and Means--can  likewise provide valuable oversight. I look forward to working with my  colleagues who sponsor this bill to bring those trade interests into  the fold. In addition, I look forward to working to clarify the  definition of ``ally or key international partner nation'' to ensure  that this bill will focus on supporting more secure and resilient  supply chains in the United States and reliable partner nations, while  limiting our critical supply chains' exposure to foreign countries that  may not be aligned with the economic or security interests of the  United States. I thank my colleague Senator Cantwell for her work on  this bill and her willingness to work with me on these issues.
