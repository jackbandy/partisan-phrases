Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Dinah Whipple  of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in celebration of Black History Month  Dinah Whipple was a monumental figure for educational equality in the  State of New Hampshire.

Dinah was enslaved until her emancipation at the age of 21. On  February 12, 1781, Dinah married Prince Whipple, who for many years was  enslaved by William Whipple, one of the signers of the Declaration of  Independence.

Dinah Whipple conducted the Ladies African Charitable School for  several decades, providing education for formerly enslaved people and  their children.

Over two centuries later, her legacy still lives on in New Hampshire  with the Dinah Whipple STEAM Academy at the University of New  Hampshire. This program offers underrepresented young teens of color  the opportunity to explore science, technology, engineering, arts,  math, and black history in America for no cost. In addition, the  location of Dinah Whipple's trail blazing school is now a stop on the  Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire.

On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional  District, I recognize Dinah Whipple for her selflessness to New  Hampshire's community and history. Now more than ever, it is important  to honor and celebrate the lives of individuals who gave back to our  communities, and Dinah Whipple's legacy and memory must be honored.
