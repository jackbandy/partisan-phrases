Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of David  McCormack as he retires after 34 years of service to the U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services agency. Over the course of his  tenure, David has been a tremendous public servant in his role as a  district congressional lead.

David has hosted numerous congressional outreach meetings to bring  together staffers and federal agency representatives, to keep our  government engaged at the local level with trends in immigration cases.  Throughout the course of his career, David consistently ensured Granite  Staters received the support  they deserved and was able to help with any inquiries that came his  way.

David is not only a diligent public servant, but a man of outstanding  character. For instance, when congressional liaison tragically passed  in 2023, it was David who compassionately stepped in to coordinate  communications to congressional staff and provide details regarding  funeral arrangements.

In all, David McCormack represents the very best of America's public  servants--dedicated, thoughtful, and unwavering in his commitment in  service to others. On behalf of a grateful district, I want to  congratulate David on a well deserved and restful retirement.
