Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Patricia Ann  Miller's outstanding service as a Surviving Spouse Liaison at the  Military Officers Association of America. Pat has approached her work  as a liaison with immense passion and commitment, exemplifying the  virtues of service to her community and Nation.

Pat has continuously shown the highest standard of care to veterans'  surviving spouses, advocating for legislation that supports them,  helping them access healthcare benefits, and reaching out on a routine  basis to encourage them in their daily life. Pat has represented the  MOAA on numerous occasions and spearheaded events to honor surviving  spouses. In one case, Pat established a memorial fund that donated to  family charities identified by each surviving spouse in memory of their  loved one.

Pat showcases exceptional personal care for the people she helps,  immediately contacting newly surviving spouses to support them in their  time of grief and inform them of available resources. Every holiday,  Pat contacts each surviving spouse personally with well-wishes and  comfort.

On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional  District, I thank Pat for her thoughtfulness and dedication to the  surviving spouses she has supported. Granite staters are grateful that  the spouses of our brave veterans may receive attentive care from  professionals like Pat, and I wish her only the best in the years to  come.
