Recognizing the Gibson Center for Senior Services Serving Two Million Meals


Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Gibson  Center for Senior Services for serving their two millionth meal to  seniors in the Mount Washington Valley.

Founded in 1973, the Gibson Center for Senior Services provides a  wide range of programs for residents of the Mount Washington Valley,  including meal delivery, transportation. social programs, exercise  classes, home repair, and even a thrift store that provides affordable  adult clothing and housewares for persons in need. With the help of  over one hundred dedicated volunteers, the Gibson Center serves 47,000  meals a year to seniors in the Mount Washington Valley. For many of  these residents, these meals also provide an opportunity to interact  with members of the community and give them the peace of mind that  someone will be checking in on them regularly.

The Gibson Center showcases exceptional care for the senior residents  of the Mount Washington Valley. Every day, they provide invaluable  services to those in need and make our Granite State communities better  and stronger.

On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional  District, I want to congratulate the Gibson Center for Senior Services  for achieving this incredible milestone. Granite staters are grateful  for organizations such as the Gibson Center, and I wish them continued  success in the years to come.
