Food Assistance for Working Families At Risk

Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the Republicans' budget  scheme pushed through in the middle of the night last month is putting  school meals for hungry kids and food assistance for working families  at risk.

A constituent of mine, Martha, from Somersworth is raising her 15- year-old grandson and battling breast cancer while living on a fixed  income. Without SNAP, she wouldn't be able to keep food on the table.

Another constituent, Catherine, is a veteran from Manchester who has  type 2 diabetes. She wouldn't be able to afford the diet she needs to  keep herself healthy without SNAP and fears losing her benefits could  put her life at risk if she is unable to manage her blood sugar.

People across my district, from Newmarket to Gilford, tell me they  wouldn't be able to afford groceries without some help.

It is a betrayal of working families for Republicans to take away  food so they can give tax breaks to billionaires.

My colleagues must continue speaking out against these cuts and do  everything they can to stop a reckless, cruel budget from moving  forward.
