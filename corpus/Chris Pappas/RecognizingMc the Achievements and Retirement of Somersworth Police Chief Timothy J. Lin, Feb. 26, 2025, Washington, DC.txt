Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy and career  of Somersworth Police Chief Timothy J. McLin.

After 33 years in law enforcement Chief McLin is embarking on a well- earned retirement. For more than three decades, he has served as a  member of Somersworth Police department, rising from patrol officer to  Chief of Police in 2022. Throughout his career Chief McLin has played a  crucial role in supporting Granite Staters through the Adverse  Childhood Experiences Response Team (ACERT) and Comprehensive Opioid,  Stimulant, and Substance Use Program (COSSUP).

In addition to his decades in law enforcement service, Chief McLin is  a proud veteran of the United States Navy, serving from 1984 to 1990 in  Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Upon his completion  of military service, he returned to Somersworth where he began his 33  years of public service to his hometown.

On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional  District, I wish Chief McLin well in his retirement, thank him for his  commitment to the people of Somersworth, and congratulate him on a job  very well done.
