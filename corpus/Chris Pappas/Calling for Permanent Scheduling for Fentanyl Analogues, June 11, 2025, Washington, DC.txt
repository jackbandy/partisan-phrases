Calling for Permanent Scheduling for Fentanyl Analogues

Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support the HALT Fentanyl Act when it comes to the floor tomorrow.

For the past 5 years, I have engaged with law enforcement, public  health experts, and colleagues across the aisle to ensure the  scheduling of fentanyl analogues doesn't lapse and is finally made  permanent.

Permanent scheduling will ensure that law enforcement retains  important tools they need to tackle the opioid crisis and hold  traffickers accountable. These are tools that have helped drive down  drug-related deaths in New Hampshire to the lowest levels in 10 years.

This is thanks to New Hampshire's all-hands-on-deck approach, pairing  enforcement with treatment to bring down both the supply of opioids  reaching our communities as well as the demand for them.

There is still work to be done, including getting this bill across  the finish line and restoring vital funding that was cut by the current  administration for treatment and recovery.

I will continue fighting to ensure that our communities have the  support that they need to save lives and confront addiction head-on.
