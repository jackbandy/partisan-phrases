Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today because the House has a  critical opportunity to support families and small businesses who are  struggling to afford healthcare for 2026.

I am thinking of the parents I have talked to who will drop coverage  for their families because their premiums are doubling and tripling,  the nonprofits who won't be able to cover employees anymore, the  manufacturer that is now paying more for health insurance than most of  their raw materials.

The impacts of this healthcare debate are real and they are  immediate.

This week Congress can solve the problem and actually make people's  lives better.

Everywhere I go across New Hampshire, I hear the same thing: Money is  tight, and people are worried about their futures.

The millions of families who rely on the Affordable Care Act tax  credits for health insurance have waited long enough for Congress to do  the right thing.

I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation to ensure that  hardworking Americans can maintain their coverage and have the health  and financial security that they deserve.
