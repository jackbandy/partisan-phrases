Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of APRN Janette  Gibb of the Manchester VA Medical Center. Her commitment to going the  extra mile and providing the highest standard of healthcare to veterans  in Manchester exemplifies the virtue of service to community and  country.

One story in particular highlights Janette's positive impact. In  August, 2021, a veteran was at the Manchester VA for routine cardiac  tests, administered by Janette. During the tests, the veteran entered  sudden cardiac arrest and collapsed in the hallway. A MERT team was  called, but Janette immediately took action. She understood what the  veteran was experiencing and administered CPR until the veteran started  responding and the MERT team arrived. This veteran credits Janette with  saving their life.

On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional  District, I thank Janette Gibb for her selflessness and dedication to  the veterans she has cared for. By giving so much to those who served  our Nation, she has made her community a better place. Granite staters  are grateful that our brave veterans may receive care from  professionals like Janette, and I wish her all the best in the years to  come.
