Bennet Announces Over $24 Million in CARES Act Funding for Colorado Community Health Centers


Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded over $24 million to 20 community health centers across Colorado. Bennet pushed for the community health center funding to be included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. 

"This is welcome news to community health centers across Colorado whose budgets have been buckling as the coronavirus spreads into more of our counties. This funding will provide our health care workers on the front lines with the resources necessary to ramp up prevention, diagnosis, and treatment," said Bennet. "Although these funds are desperately needed, they are just the start of what Colorado needs to fully respond to the pandemic. I'll continue pushing to ensure that our health care providers -- both rural and urban -- have the support they need to care for Coloradans affected by the virus."

The more than $24 million will be distributed to 20 health centers across the state. More information on the funding awards from HHS' Health Resources and Services Administration is available HERE.

In addition to advocating for Colorado's community health centers, Bennet is leading the push to provide immediate assistance to rural hospitals, clinics, and providers with legislation to provide economic stabilization and relief for rural communities. He also called on HHS to use CARES Act funds to sustain rural health providers.
