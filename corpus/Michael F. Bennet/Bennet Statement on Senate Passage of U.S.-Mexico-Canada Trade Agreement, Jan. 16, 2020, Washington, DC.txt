Bennet Statement on Senate Passage of U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement


Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, released the following statement after the Senate passed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Implementation Act, which will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA): 

"I've long said that we should modernize NAFTA as our economy evolves, and the final USMCA brings our trade policies into the 21st century. This agreement will maintain key export markets for Colorado and provide some certainty for our farmers and ranchers. I appreciate the efforts by Democratic negotiators to secure new resources and tools to hold our trading partners accountable for the stronger labor and environmental standards.   

"While passing USMCA is a step in the right direction, it does not make up for the enormous pain and instability caused by three years of reckless trade policy from this administration. Going forward, we must do more to advance trade policies that put American businesses, producers, and consumers first. If the president's superficial "Phase One' agreement with China is any indication, he is clearly more focused on staging the next photo opportunity than delivering the long-term reforms needed to lift up American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses."
