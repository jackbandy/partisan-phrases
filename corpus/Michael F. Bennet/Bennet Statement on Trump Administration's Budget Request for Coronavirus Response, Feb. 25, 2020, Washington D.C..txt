Bennet Statement on Trump Administration's Budget Request for Coronavirus Response


Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet issued the following statement on the Trump Administration's request for $1.8 billion in supplemental funds to address the coronavirus. Earlier today, Bennet attended a closed-door briefing with administration officials to discuss the crisis and the funding request. 

"The Trump Administration's response to this global crisis has been pitiful. It is clear that the administration lacks a clear and comprehensive strategy to address this challenge and the amount of funding requested is woefully insufficient to the scale of this emergency. To make matters worse, President Trump has left critical positions sitting empty at the very agencies charged with protecting our national security and public health. The Trump Administration must treat this emerging threat with the urgency it demands."
