Bennet Welcomes Medicaid Waiver to Give Colorado More Flexibility to Respond to COVID-19 Crisis


Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet welcomed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) announcement that it has approved Colorado's 1135 waiver, which will provide the state's Medicaid program more flexibility to serve Coloradans during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The announcement comes just days after Bennet and the Colorado Congressional Delegation sent a letter to HHS Secretary Alex Azar requesting a prompt review of the state's application for an 1135 waiver. 

"Our state's health care system is facing unprecedented strains as it navigates this public health crisis. It is critical that we take steps now to remove any unnecessary bureaucracy hindering our ability to provide Coloradans with swift and effective care," said Bennet. "I thank the Department of Health and Human Services for moving expeditiously to approve this waiver and give our health care providers the resources and flexibility needed during this crisis."
