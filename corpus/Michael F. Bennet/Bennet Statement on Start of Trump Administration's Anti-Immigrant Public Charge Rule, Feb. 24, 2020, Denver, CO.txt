Bennet Statement on Start of Trump Administration's Anti-Immigrant Public Charge Rule


Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet issued the following statement on the start of the Trump Administration's public charge rule. The rule would make legal immigrants -- including those on student and work visas -- ineligible for permanent residence if they use or are likely to use certain safety-net programs, and aims to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States based on their wealth, family size, age, skills, level of education, or ability to speak English: 

"The Trump Administration's public charge rule reaches a new low in its all-out assault on America's immigrant tradition. Since coming to office, President Trump has made a policy of cruelty and has stoked fear across immigrant communities. This rule isn't about securing our borders or more efficient spending. The sole purpose is to punish immigrants who only seek to make a better life for their families and themselves. 

"We are a nation of immigrants, and forcing people to make an impossible choice between the health and well-being of their families and their future immigration status runs counter to everything our nation stands for. We will not stand for yet another blatant attack on our immigrant communities and will continue to fight this cruel policy."

Bennet has been an outspoken critic of the administration's public charge rule. In September, Bennet joined his colleagues in introducing the Protect American Values Act, which would block implementation of the rule. He also penned an opinion piece warning about the damage this rule could have on Colorado in October.
