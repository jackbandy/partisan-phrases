Bennet Statement on House Vote to Send the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate


Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet released the following statement after the House of Representatives voted to send the articles of impeachment of President Trump to the Senate:

"There's clear and growing evidence that President Trump abused the power of his office for personal, political gain and blocked Congress from obtaining access to witnesses and documents. As the Senate moves forward, a fair trial requires that we hear from relevant witnesses and fully assess all of the available evidence. That is what the Constitution requires and what Americans expect of the Senate. 

"Instead of fulfilling our constitutional responsibilities, Leader McConnell has made it his sole objective to protect the president by limiting potential witnesses and evidence. I remain hopeful that 51 senators will reject these arbitrary, partisan restrictions and join us in demanding a fair and thorough trial."
