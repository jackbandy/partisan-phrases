Bennet Statement on President's Budget Proposal


Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet issued the following statement in response to President Trump's budget proposal: 

"After signing a tax cut into law that handed out millions to the wealthiest of Americans and exploded deficits by almost $2 trillion, President Trump is proposing deep cuts to critical programs that affect children, seniors, and the most vulnerable among us. This budget shows, yet again, that the president's policies favor the wealthy and well-connected over hard-working American families. The president's budget includes cuts to health care, including Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, while he continues to fight in court to dismantle protections for people with pre-existing conditions. His budget also slashes funding for our nation's schools, public lands, anti-hunger efforts, and more.    

"While I'm pleased the president's budget includes $8 million in additional funding for the Arkansas Valley Conduit, an investment I've fought for to deliver clean drinking water to Southeastern Colorado, I'm concerned that his proposal fails to meet other priorities for our state, including cutting superfund cleanup and agricultural conservation.   

"Congress should work in a bipartisan way to fund our government and invest in priorities that matter to working families."
