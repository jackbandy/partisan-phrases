Bennet Reiterates Call on Secretary of State to Take Urgent Action to Help Americans Stranded Abroad


Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet released the following statement calling on Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to take immediate action to ramp up the State Department's efforts to help stranded Coloradans and other American citizens return home amid the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Last week, Bennet called on Pompeo to stand up a dedicated task force focused on the repatriation of American citizens. A few days later, Pompeo announced the creation of the State Department's Repatriation Task Force. 

"Secretary Pompeo must provide guidance and clarity today for the hundreds of Coloradans and thousands of Americans stranded abroad. The Secretary must do everything in his power to direct the necessary resources to address the plight of Americans who feel their government has abandoned them, including providing additional staff for the State Department's Repatriation Task Force and increasing resources for our embassies as they work to address this challenge. We greatly appreciate the tireless efforts of our consular officers and civil servants in D.C. and around the world who are diligently working to bring Americans home, but they need more support to carry out this enormous task.

"American citizens in Peru, Honduras, Guatemala, Ecuador, Argentina, and elsewhere need to know today that they will not be left behind. It is long past time for Secretary Pompeo to provide that assurance." 

Coloradans who are stranded overseas are encouraged to immediately register with the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), contact the local U.S. embassy, and reach out to Bennet's office HERE for assistance.
