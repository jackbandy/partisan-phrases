Bennet Welcomes Over $34 Million in Housing Assistance Grants for Colorado Amid Coronavirus Pandemic


Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet welcomed the announcement that Colorado will receive more than $34 million in grants for housing assistance programs from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Bennet pushed for the housing assistance funding to be included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law last week. 

"I'm glad to see these funds have been quickly awarded to help address the housing and economic challenges that Coloradans are facing across the state," said Bennet. "While these funds will bring some much-needed relief to many communities across Colorado, much more needs to be done to help our cities and towns that are stretched thin because of this crisis. I will continue working to ensure federal assistance from the CARES Act reaches Coloradans as soon as possible."

The HUD grants have been awarded through the Community Development Block Grant program, the Emergency Solutions Grant program, and the Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS program.
