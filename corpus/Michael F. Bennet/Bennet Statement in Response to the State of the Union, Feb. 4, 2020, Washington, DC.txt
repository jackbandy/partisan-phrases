Bennet Statement in Response to the State of the Union


Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet released the following statement in response to President Trump's State of the Union Address:

 "Not surprisingly, tonight's speech was full of half-truths and outright lies. In his boasts about the economy, the president ignored that the American economy is creating jobs at a slower rate than when Barack Obama was in his second term. He ignored that farm bankruptcies are at an eight-year high as a result of his reckless trade policies. He bragged instead about his tax cut that gave $37 billion to the wealthiest Americans and large corporations.

 "Everywhere I go in Colorado, people tell me they can't afford some combination of housing, health care, child care, or higher education -- in other words, a middle-class life. They're worried about their children's future. Political rhetoric and inflated statistics will do nothing to solve the real challenges they face every day."
