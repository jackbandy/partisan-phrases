Bennet Statement on House Passage of Coronavirus Relief Package


Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet issued the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, legislation that will provide free testing, paid sick, family, and medical leave for workers, stronger unemployment benefits, food assistance for vulnerable children and families, and enhanced Medicaid funding to help state and local governments combat the crisis:

"The Families First Act will provide families in Colorado and across the country with the health coverage, food assistance, and financial support needed during this time of immense uncertainty. Now that the House has passed this much-needed legislation with President Trump's backing, it is time for the Senate to move swiftly and vote on this bill. American families, local public health agencies, and first responders on the frontlines of this crisis cannot wait another day."
