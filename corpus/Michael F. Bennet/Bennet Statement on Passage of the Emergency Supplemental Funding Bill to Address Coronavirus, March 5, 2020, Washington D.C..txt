Bennet Statement on Passage of the Emergency Supplemental Funding Bill to Address Coronavirus


Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet today released the following statement after the Senate passed the bipartisan, bicameral emergency supplemental funding bill to respond to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019). The package includes a $9.3 million emergency grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for Colorado. The bill, which passed the House yesterday, will now head to the president's desk for approval.

"With strong bipartisan support, Congress has allocated the needed resources to ensure states, communities, and federal agencies can provide the robust, coordinated response this outbreak demands. It was critical that Congress move swiftly to enact this emergency funding bill, and I urge the president to sign it as quickly as possible so Colorado can have the resources it needs to address this urgent public health threat."
