Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the safe return of  New Jersey native Edan Alexander. This was a moment of profound relief  and gratitude for his family, our community, and our Nation.

My constituent Edan Alexander, from Tenafly, New Jersey, is an all- American kid who graduated from Tenafly High School and swam on the  swim team. He could be anyone's son.

After being kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on October 7 and held for  584 days, I am thrilled to announce that Edan has finally come home.

Through it all, the strength of the Alexander family and the New  Jersey community has been a guiding light in an incredibly dark period.  The family never gave up hope and neither did we.

We must not rest until every last hostage is returned, including the  remains of the two Americans who were murdered by Hamas terrorists.

In America and New Jersey, we never leave anyone behind.
