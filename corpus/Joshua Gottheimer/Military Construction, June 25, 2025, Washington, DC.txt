Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the en bloc package  which includes three amendments I offered to the FY 2026 Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations  bill.

My first amendment requires a resident advocate in every veterans  home across the country. This advocate will be a direct line of contact  for our veterans and their families, ensuring that they have someone  who can immediately help with any concerns and respond without delay.

In my home State of New Jersey, 190 veterans tragically lost their  lives because of the COVID outbreak at the veterans homes in Paramus,  New Jersey, and Menlo Park. This tragedy was preventable and  unacceptable. My amendment will help ensure catastrophes like that  never happen again.

My second amendment will help VA hospitals provide kosher meal  options for Jewish veterans. Right now, many Jewish inpatient veterans  are only served frozen, prepackaged kosher meals that severely lack  quality nutrition.

We must ensure that no veteran has to choose between their religion  and their health.

Finally, my third amendment will encourage continued funding for the  Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program,  which has delivered millions in grants for mental health services to  help prevent veteran suicide. Without additional funding, this critical  program will expire later this year. We cannot and must not let that  happen.

After sacrificing so much, our great veterans should never struggle  to get the care, recognition, and respect they have rightfully earned.  That is why I strongly urge my colleagues to support the en bloc  package.
