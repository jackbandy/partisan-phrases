Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 50th anniversary  of Bruce Springsteen's ``Born to Run,'' a legendary album that is still  inspiring generations today. Since its release, Bruce Springsteen and  the E Street Band have captured not just the American spirit, but also  the Jersey values that unite us.

Bruce is Jersey, and Jersey is Bruce. Just when a 25-year-old kid  from Freehold thought about giving up, his hard work paid off with an  album that shared the Garden State with America and America with the  world.

Every song on the album is a timeless classic: From ``Thunder Road''  to ``Jungleland,'' to ``Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,'' to ``She's the  One,'' not to mention, of course, the title track.

Whether from a turntable, cassette, the radio, or your phone, ``the  Boss'' sings for us all when chasing after that ``runaway American  Dream,'' ``baby, we were born to run.''
