Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism

Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.

Democrats just had a huge win across the country because we focused  on what hardworking families care about: lowering food and healthcare  prices, cutting childcare costs, and lowering utility bills.

What do socialists stand for? Tax-raising, job-killing policies like  defunding the police, shuttering prisons, massive unfunded spending  increases, and even government-run grocery stores.

In New York, job-killing comptroller, socialist, and reckless spender  Brad Lander refuses to condemn anti-Semitic language like globalize the  intifada, which calls for the death of the Jewish people. Many of  Mayor-elect Mamdani's policies are radically at odds with both the  Democratic Party and American values.

After all, socialists aren't Democrats. They are socialists.  Democrats are about common sense, problem-solving ideas that promote  public safety, opportunity for all, and lower costs for all Americans.

I urge all Republicans to work with us on those pressing issues.

America is the land of opportunity. Capitalism, American innovation,  and the American worker are what built our great country. We cannot let  socialism tear it down.
