Improving Access to Small Business Information Act

Mr. Speaker, the Paperwork Reduction Act mandates all Federal  agencies receive approval before putting forth a paper form or survey  that will impose an information collection burden on the general  public.

Although well-intentioned, the Paperwork Reduction Act often prevents  Federal agencies like the SEC from obtaining data from the public. This  is the very data that assists the agencies in carrying out their  missions.

This bill streamlines the ability of the SEC's Office of the Advocate  for Small Business Capital Formation to carry out its mission by  exempting it from the requirements of the act in the same way the SEC's  Office of the Investor Advocate is exempted. In effect, it enables the  small business advocate to properly do its job by providing it with the  information and data it needs to draft regulations that actually help  small businesses raise capital without imposing costly demands.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim) for  her bipartisan leadership, her friendship, and all she does. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important bill.

Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, which will reduce the paperwork burden on SEC staff and,  therefore, their ability to advocate for the needs of small businesses  within the agency's rulemaking and regulatory process.
