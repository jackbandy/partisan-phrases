Cleaning Up Medicaid Rolls


Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, evidently, this is what gutting Medicaid  looks like. You see it goes up 25 percent over 10 years. This only  happens in Washington, D.C.

Mr. Speaker, the difference between the last administration and the  current one is the last administration restricted the States from  cleaning up the Medicaid rolls and verifying eligibility. I don't know  what coalition in the House of Representatives is for that. Apparently,  it is the same one that is for over $100 billion lost annually to  improper payments.

There is a coalition here, Mr. Speaker, that wants to take tax  dollars and pay $100 billion, losing it annually to improper payments.  What we are asking the States to do is verify eligibility  and issue payments to protect people in poverty, pregnant women, the  disabled, and children.

Mr. Speaker, what the Republican plan is doing is saving Medicare for  the people it was intended to be there for.
