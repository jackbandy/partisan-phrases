Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to recognize Mr. Brian Wisler on  his well-earned retirement after 35 years.

Mr. Wisler was hired by the Central York School District in 1990 as  an elementary physical education teacher--where he shortly after, in  May of 1991 was the creator of the Central York School District  Elementary Track meet--which was later renamed in honor of long-time  principal Jefferey Fox (who supported the initiative), to the Jefferey  Fox Track Meet. Starting with just five events the track meet has grown  to now include myriad events including dozens of runs, javelin throws,  high jump, long jump, tug of war, softball and foxtail throws and  others--that sometimes feature entire classrooms on the field.

The incredible day of sportsmanship directed by Mr. Wisler has  positively impacted thousands of students over the years--proving his  dedication to the students of North Hills and Sinking Springs  elementary schools. After 35 years of teaching and engaging students,  and 33 track meets, Mr. Wisler's service sets the standard by which we  should all be judged.

Mr. Speaker, I'm privileged and honored to recognize Mr. Brian Wisler  on his retirement. I wish him and all his students Godspeed on their  future adventures.
