Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arizona and the  chairman of the committee for his hard work on this bill.

Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment because you think about the  National Endowment for Democracy, you think the United States is  working productively in places like Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela. If we  are, let's face it, we have been an abject failure.

Let me tell you where your taxpayer dollars are really going. Where  they had been going is to pressure advertisers to demonetize and  suppress American political speech by naming the ten riskiest cites to  include the New York Post, the Federalist, Newsmax, The Blaze, The  Daily Wire, RealClearPolitics, Reason, One America News Network, The  American Spectator, and The American Conservative.

Mr. Chair, 98 percent of the political donations coming from the  National Endowment for Democracy go to the Democrat Party. This is your  taxpayer dollars paying for socialists and communists to subvert the  American system, and it ought to be stopped.
