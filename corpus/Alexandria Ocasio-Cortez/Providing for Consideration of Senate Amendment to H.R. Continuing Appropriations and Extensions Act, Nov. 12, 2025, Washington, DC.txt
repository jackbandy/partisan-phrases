Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, it is great. It is great that  Democrats have a line of people who are willing to fight for working- class Americans from coast to coast in this country.

Mr. Speaker, God forbid that we have a Member of the Republican  caucus who stands up and actually wants to extend the Affordable Care  Act so that people with cancer, need insulin, and all sorts of  healthcare issues across this country have their health insurance  protected and extended throughout 2026.

It is unconscionable that what we are debating right now is  legislation that will give eight Members of the United States Senate  over $1 million apiece. We are robbing people of their food assistance  and of their healthcare to pay for it.

How is this even on the floor? How can we, as Members of Congress-- Republican or Democrat--vote to enrich ourselves by stealing from the  American people? That is what this legislation does. In fact, Senator  Graham went before the press earlier today, and he said he was going to  seek well over $1 million from the American people from this.

Mr. Speaker, we cannot support it, and we cannot stand for it.
