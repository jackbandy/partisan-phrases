Blunt Cosponsors Bipartisan Bill to Address Medical Supply Vulnerability due to Coronavirus


Amid the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) today joined U.S. Senators Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) and Dick Durbin (Ill.) in introducing the Commission on America's Medical Security Act, bipartisan legislation to safeguard America's medical supply chain and address shortages due to the United States' dependence on foreign-made medical equipment. Approximately 40% of finished drugs and 80% of active pharmaceutical ingredients are manufactured overseas--primarily from China and India. The ongoing global coronavirus outbreak has highlighted broader public health and national security vulnerabilities stemming from our nation's reliance upon foreign manufacturing and the shortcomings in our regulatory oversight of global supply chains. On February 27, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the first coronavirus-related drug shortage, and on March 10, the FDA halted its routine overseas inspections of drugs and devices.

"Protecting our nation's medical supply chain is a public health and national security priority," said Blunt. "This bill establishes a commission that will assess weaknesses in the U.S. supply chain and put forward a comprehensive strategy to prevent shortages of vital, life-saving medical supplies."

In December, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission sounded the alarm on the "growing reliance" on drugs and precursors produced, in many cases exclusively, in China. This week, state health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have raised concerns about a looming shortage of coronavirus extraction kit reagents needed to conduct diagnostic testing.

The bill was led by Alexander and Durbin and, in addition to Blunt, cosponsored by U.S. Senators Patty Murray (Wash.), Mitt Romney (Utah), Doug Jones (Ala.), Tina Smith (Minn.), Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Jack Reed (R.I.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), and Richard Blumenthal (Conn.).

A House companion bill will be introduced by U.S. Representatives Raul Ruiz (Calif.), Lauren Underwood (Ill.), and Phil Roe, M.D. (Tenn.).

The bipartisan Commission on America's Medical Security Act would direct the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to:

Assess the dependence of and vulnerabilities to the United States, including the private commercial sector, states, and federal agencies, on critical medications, medical devices, and medical equipment that are sourced from or manufactured in foreign countries;

Provide recommendations and an action plan to improve the resiliency of the supply chain for critical drugs, devices, and equipment, including to increase domestic manufacturing capabilities, supplies and stockpiles, and improve information collection and contingency planning; and

Consult, in the development of its report, with federal agencies--including the Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Defense, Commerce, State, Justice, and Veterans Affairs--as well as public health, medical, and commercial industry stakeholders.
