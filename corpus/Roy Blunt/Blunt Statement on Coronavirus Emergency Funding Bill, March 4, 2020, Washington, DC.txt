Blunt Statement on Coronavirus Emergency Funding Bill


Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.), Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, released the following statement on the coronavirus emergency funding bill:

"Our number one priority in the Congress is keeping Americans safe. As the coronavirus continues to spread, we have to be sure we have the resources in place to respond quickly and effectively. Congress has increased funding for preparedness programs by more than 40% over the past five years. The initial funding we provided in the Infectious Disease Fund has worked as intended, providing flexible support for immediate response efforts. We must now act on the need for additional funding.

"State and local health providers are the first line of defense. The supplemental provides funding to support response efforts at all levels of government, including the purchase of personal protective equipment and other necessary supplies that can be distributed to areas with the greatest need. The bill ensures the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have what they need to improve surveillance systems, to help trace the contacts of people with confirmed infections, and to provide a clear message to the public and health care professionals on how to prevent further spread of the disease. Finally, the bill supports efforts to move vaccine candidates through clinical trials, scale up production as necessary, and purchase vaccines. I encourage all of my colleagues to come together and get this bill to the president's desk quickly."
