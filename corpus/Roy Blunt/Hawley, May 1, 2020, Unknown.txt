Hawley, Blunt Recognize Silver Star Service Banner Day


Today, Missouri Senators Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt marked Silver Star Service Banner Day, which honors our nation's wounded and ill service members and veterans, and their families. The senators will introduce a resolution designating May 1st as Silver Star Service Banner Day.

"We will never forget the sacrifices made by the brave men, women, and their families who answered the call to serve and secured the freedoms we enjoy today. These heroes selflessly put themselves in harm's way, and I hope all Americans will take a moment to honor those wounded and ill service members and veterans every May 1st for Silver Star Service Banner Day."

"We owe an incredible debt of gratitude to the men and women who have made countless sacrifices to secure the freedoms we enjoy as Americans," said Blunt. "These heroes put themselves in harm's way, and those who suffered injury or illness from their service may carry their wounds for the rest of their lives. I encourage all Americans to take a moment to honor these men and women, and their families who share in their sacrifice, for all they have done to defend our freedoms and keep our nation safe."
