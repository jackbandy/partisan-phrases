Blunt-Alexander "Shark Tank" Covid-19 Testing Plan Gets Underway at NIH


Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.), Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, and U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, applauded an announcement from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that it has begun implementing a new public-private partnership to accelerate the development of COVID-19 testing technologies. Blunt and Alexander worked together to include this "shark-tank"-like effort in the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act that was signed into law last week.

"Dramatically increasing our coronavirus testing capacity will give people the confidence to get back to school, work, and daily life," said Blunt. "I'm glad to see the National Institutes of Health moving quickly to get this new effort up and running so we can get the most promising new technologies into the hands of health care providers as soon as possible. This program will bring together public and private-sector partners to help tackle the biggest global health challenge we have seen in generations. America has long been a leader in developing life-saving innovations and we will do it again."

"We now have at the National Institutes of Health a $1 billion competitive "shark tank' led by Dr. Francis Collins, one of the nation's leading scientists, that will lead the effort to create new technologies to produce the tens of millions of diagnostic tests we will need to contain this virus and restart the economy," said Alexander. "In such a bold effort there will be failures, but all we need are a few successes to get our country back work and back to school."
