Blunt Statement on First Presumptive Positive Coronavirus Case in Missouri


U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) released the following statement on the first presumptive positive case of coronavirus in Missouri:

"While Missourians will understandably be concerned about today's announcement, there is no need to panic. Governor Mike Parson and St. Louis County Executive Dr. Sam Page are well prepared to meet this public health challenge. Yesterday, the president signed emergency funding legislation that will make resources immediately available to state and local health agencies. Under the law, Missouri will receive at least $9.9 million to support response efforts, including additional test kits, protective equipment, and other necessary supplies. I will remain in touch with Governor Parson, Dr. Page, and local officials to ensure they have what they need to respond."
