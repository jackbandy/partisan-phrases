Blunt Votes to Protect Life


U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) released the following statement after voting in favor of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act:

"Today reminds us that the fight for life is unfinished. There should be no question as to whether babies born alive in the course of a botched abortion attempt deserve the same treatment as any other patient. Melissa Ohden, who leads the Abortion Survivors Network based in Kansas City, Mo., was born alive after an unsuccessful abortion attempt. She received the care she needed, but the law did not guarantee care for her and still does not guarantee care for abortion survivors like her.  

"There should also be no question as to whether federal law must guarantee protections for pain-capable unborn children. The majority of Americans support banning elective abortion after 20 weeks. And, the United States is one of only seven countries in the world to allow it, including China and North Korea.    

"Neither of these bills should be controversial. They would both bring federal law in line with the mainstream. Sadly, our law still does not reflect these values. I am grateful for the thousands of Missourians who have marched at the March for Life in D.C., who have taken a stand for life at home, and who persist in giving a voice to the voiceless. I'm proud to stand with you and I will continue the fight."
