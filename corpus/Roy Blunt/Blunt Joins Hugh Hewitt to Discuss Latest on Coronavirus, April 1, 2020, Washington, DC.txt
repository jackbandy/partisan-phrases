Blunt Joins Hugh Hewitt to Discuss Latest on Coronavirus


Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.), Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, joined Hugh Hewitt to discuss the latest on the coronavirus.

Following Are Excerpts of Blunt's Interview with Hugh Hewitt:

On the Impact of the House-Led Impeachment Effort:

Blunt: "Well, I think there's no question it was a huge distraction. The House had not made the case. They came to the Senate and presented the same 40 minutes of information about 40 times in the time they were there, and there was no way it didn't take everybody's attention off everything else that was going on in the world to some extent. Now it doesn't mean we weren't paying any attention to what was happening in China or other places, but there's no doubt it was a huge distraction."

On a Phase 4 Coronavirus Relief Package:

Blunt: "Well, I think phase four needs to first of all be focused on what we find are the shortcomings in phase three. There had to be some. There was no way we could put a package together that quickly, though we needed to put it together that quickly, and have not left some gaps. And we need to fill those gaps. That needs to be our first focus. And frankly, let's let things move on for a little while and see what we need to do next. But job one is to clean up what we did in phase three, and we understood during phase three that there'd be some gaps that need to be filled, and we need to fill those gaps."
