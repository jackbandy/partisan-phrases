The latest coronavirus relief package extends funding for Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, which provide a wide range of services like 24/7/365 crisis support, immediate screenings, risk assessments, and diagnoses.

This funding extension ensures these centers will be able to keep their doors open and continue providing care to thousands of patients in Missouri."
