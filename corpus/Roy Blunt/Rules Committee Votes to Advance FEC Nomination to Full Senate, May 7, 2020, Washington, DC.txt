Rules Committee Votes to Advance FEC Nomination to Full Senate


Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, released the following statement after the committee voted to advance to the full Senate the nomination of James E. (Trey) Trainor III to serve as a member of the Federal Election Commission:

"The FEC has been without a quorum since August of last year. Without a quorum, the FEC cannot fulfill its most important functions, including providing formal guidance to federal candidates as they work to address the unique challenges they face during the coronavirus pandemic. Trey Trainor's confirmation would fill a vacancy, balance party representation, and, most importantly, allow the FEC to do its job. Mr. Trainor is undoubtedly qualified for this position and I urge all of my colleagues to support his confirmation."
