"We are facing an unprecedented emergency with #COVID19. We need to ensure families and individuals are able to meet their needs.

We must help small businesses stay afloat, keep their employees on the payroll, and bounce back when this crisis is over.

We need to ensure patients can get tested for #coronavirus and health care providers have the personal protective equipment they need.

Let's do what the American people expect us to do and treat an emergency like it's an emergency, not like it's an opportunity."
