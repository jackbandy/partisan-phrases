"This week, I joined my colleagues in urging @USDA to work quickly to get #coronavirus relief to dairy farmers in Missouri and across the nation.

As someone who grew up on a dairy farm, I'm committed to making sure these hardworking men and women have the support they need in these very challenging times."
