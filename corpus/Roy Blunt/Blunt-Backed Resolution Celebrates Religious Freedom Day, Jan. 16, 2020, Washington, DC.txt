Blunt-Backed Resolution Celebrates Religious Freedom Day


Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) cosponsored a resolution recognizing the 234th anniversary of the enactment of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom and establishing January 16, 2020 as Religious Freedom Day."America was the first nation founded on the principle of religious liberty - the first freedom in the First Amendment to the Constitution," Blunt said. "Today, we reflect on this unique aspect of our nation's history and recommit ourselves to protecting and promoting this fundamental freedom and human right at home and abroad."
