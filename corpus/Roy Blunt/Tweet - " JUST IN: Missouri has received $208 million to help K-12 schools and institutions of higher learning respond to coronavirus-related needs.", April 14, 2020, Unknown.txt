" JUST IN: Missouri has received $208 million to help K-12 schools and institutions of higher learning respond to coronavirus-related needs."

" This funding will allow @GovernorParsonMO to continue tackling some of the education challenges that have come with the coronavirus response in a way that best fits local needs."

" Our state is facing an unprecedented challenge when it comes to keeping students safe while keeping their education on track.  I'll continue working with the administration to ensure that additional support for states that was in the #CARESAct is out the door ASAP."
