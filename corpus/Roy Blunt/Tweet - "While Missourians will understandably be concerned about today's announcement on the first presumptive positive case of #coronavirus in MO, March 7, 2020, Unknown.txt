Yesterday, the president signed emergency funding legislation that will make resources immediately available to state and local health agencies.

Under the law, Missouri will receive at least $9.9 million to support response efforts, including additional test kits, protective equipment, and other necessary supplies.

I will remain in touch with @GovParsonMO, Dr. Page, and local officials to ensure they have what they need to respond. Additional information on the coronavirus and how people can help protect themselves is available here: http://health.mo.gov/coronavirus"
