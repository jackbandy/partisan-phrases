"Today is a heart-wrenching day for thousands of people awaiting a liver transplant, especially in my home state of Missouri and across the Midwest.

Changes to the liver allocation policy that take effect today could burden nearly half the country with increased costs and waitlists, while doing little to increase the total number of transplants or reduce mortality rates nationwide.

These changes were made through a process that lacked transparency, overruled transplant experts, and failed to take into account all of the comments submitted to the board charged with determining the liver policy.

HHS should not be moving forward with these changes. This is the wrong policy to implement and I will keep fighting it:"
