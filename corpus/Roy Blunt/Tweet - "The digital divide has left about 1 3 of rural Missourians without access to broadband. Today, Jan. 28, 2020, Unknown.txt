"The digital divide has left about 1/3 of rural Missourians without access to broadband. Today, @USDA announced that Missouri will receive more than $60 million to expand broadband in rural areas across the state.

I'm proud to support this important USDA program, which will expand rural broadband to health care facilities, schools, businesses, farms and thousands of households across the state.

I'll continue working to ensure every Missouri community has access to high speed internet."
