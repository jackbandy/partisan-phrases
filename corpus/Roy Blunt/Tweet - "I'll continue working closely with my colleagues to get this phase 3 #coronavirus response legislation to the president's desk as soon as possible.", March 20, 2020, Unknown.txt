"I'll continue working closely with my colleagues to get this phase 3 #coronavirus response legislation to the president's desk as soon as possible.

I'm pleased that bipartisan legislation I helped introduce to protect the nation's medical supply chain was included in the comprehensive coronavirus package, which was introduced last night.

The #coronavirus pandemic is a direct reminder that protecting our nation's medical supply chain is a priority for public health and national security."
