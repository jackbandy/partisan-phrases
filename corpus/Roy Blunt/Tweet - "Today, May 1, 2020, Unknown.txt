"Today, Missouri rural hospitals and health care providers received additional emergency funding to keep their doors open through the #coronavirus pandemic."

"The funding also targets resources toward hospitals and health care providers with a high number of low-income and uninsured patients, and hospitals that have provided inpatient care for a large number of COVID-19 patients."

"I appreciate the Department of Health and Human Services for moving quickly to get this funding out to hospitals and health care providers that urgently need it."
