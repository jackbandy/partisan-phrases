"My thoughts are with the loved ones of all of the victims of last night's attack in Springfield. I am grateful for the courage our law enforcement officers demonstrated as they rushed to the scene, and saddened by the loss of Springfield Police Officer Christopher Walsh.

Officer Walsh lived a life of service to his country and his community. As a police officer and U.S. Army veteran, Officer Walsh exemplified the best of our nation. My thoughts are also with Officer Josiah Overton and the civilian victim who are being treated for their injuries.

We are forever indebted to our law enforcement officers and their families for the tremendous sacrifices they make every day to keep us safe."
