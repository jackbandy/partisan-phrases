Blunt Commends Labor Department for Investing $6 Million in Missouri IT Apprenticeship Program


Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.), Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies (Labor/HHS), commended the Department of Labor (DOL) for investing $6 million to expand IT apprenticeship opportunities through the Missouri Chamber Foundation. Blunt sent a letter to DOL Secretary Eugene Scalia last year supporting the grant application.

"One of the things I hear most from Missouri employers is that they're having trouble finding qualified candidates to fill the open jobs that come with a growing economy," said Blunt. "This grant will help close the skills gap by expanding apprenticeships in the fast-growing and good-paying Information Technology field. I appreciate the Missouri Chamber Foundation's efforts to develop innovative workforce training opportunities like this one, and thank Secretary Scalia for supporting their work with this grant."
