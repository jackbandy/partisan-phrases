Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, President  Trump is once again keeping his promises to the American people. He  promised he would stop the largest tax increase in America history. He  promised he would make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent. He promised  he would deliver the largest tax cut for hardworking taxpayers in  American history, and he promised to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime,  and Social Security benefits.

President Trump is keeping his word. He is delivering much-needed  relief for the American people, and this will produce an investment  surge, driving real median incomes up by $10,000 relative to the  scenario in which the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is allowed to expire.

To my friend from California, if he cares about fiscal  responsibility, stopping a $4.5 trillion tax increase stops a  recession. You cannot balance the budget without growth.
