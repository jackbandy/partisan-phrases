Mr. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate  the 350th anniversary of the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur, the  revered Ninth Guru of Sikhism--the world's fifth-largest religion, with  nearly 30 million followers worldwide, including one million here in  the United States.

A champion of religious freedom for all, Guru Tegh Bahadur  courageously confronted the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb's campaign of  religious persecution, defending the right of every individual to  freely practice their faith. For this act of unwavering conviction, he  was publicly executed in 1675 in Delhi, India, and is fondly remembered  as Dharam Di Chadar, or, ``Shield of the Religions,'' for his ultimate  sacrifice to protect the rights of others and uphold the universal  principles of human dignity, freedom of conscience, and the right to  worship according to one's beliefs.

Pennsylvania's Sikh community, whose roots trace back to the State of  Punjab in India, began immigrating to our Nation more than a century  ago. These remarkable Americans have played a vital role in the growth  and vitality of the Keystone State and have enriched their communities  through their commitment to tolerance, service, and civic engagement.

These extraordinary ideals reflect the Sikh tradition of seeking  peace through equality, fraternity, and respect, while striving to  overcome division through sacred teachings and the admirable tenets of  honest work, charity, volunteerism, and sharing with those in need.

Mr. Speaker, it is altogether fitting that the House recognize Guru  Tegh Bahadur's supreme sacrifice for human rights and religious  freedom, and encourage all Americans to join in its observance on  November 24, 2025.
