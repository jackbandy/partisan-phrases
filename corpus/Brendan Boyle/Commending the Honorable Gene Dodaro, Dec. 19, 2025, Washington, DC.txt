Mr. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  fellow Pennsylvanian, the Honorable Gene Dodaro, whose term as U.S.  Comptroller General comes to an end this month.

For 52 years, Gene Dodaro has served the American people as part of  the Government Accountability Office. During his 17-year tenure as head  of the agency, he has embodied GAO's core values of accountability,  integrity, and reliability, leading work that has resulted in more than  $1 trillion in taxpayer savings and other financial benefits. His  dedication to fighting fraud, waste, and abuse has helped shape the  federal civil service for more than half a century.

Gene joined GAO as an entry-level analyst in 1973 after graduating  from Pennsylvania's Lycoming College with a bachelor's degree in  accounting. He went on to lead GAO's Accounting and Information  Management Division, which focused on financial management, computer  technology, and budget issues. He served in that role until 1999, when  he became GAO's Chief Operating Officer, the agency's number-two  position, helping guide the direction and long-term vision of the  workforce.

After 35 years of service, when many might have chosen to step away,  Gene accepted an appointment as Acting Comptroller General in 2008. He  was later confirmed by the Senate in 2010 to serve a 15-year term as  Comptroller General. Under his leadership, GAO continued its impactful  work on the federal government's long-term fiscal outlook, efforts to  reduce overlap and duplication across agencies, and the High-Risk List,  which highlights programs and operations vulnerable to waste, fraud,  abuse, mismanagement, or in need of transformation. As Comptroller  General, Gene also spearheaded the creation of GAO's Innovation Lab,  which has strengthened oversight capacity through the use of data  science, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies.

Throughout his career, Gene has been a steadfast defender of  Congress' power of the purse. His work has been especially important to  the Budget Committee, including oversight of Impoundment Control Act  reviews. He also directed the first-ever audit of the consolidated  financial statements of the federal government, an annual effort that  has significantly improved transparency and accountability.

Gene Dodaro is widely respected on both sides of the aisle as a  principled, nonpartisan public servant. He has been recognized by  numerous organizations, including the American Society for Public  Administration, the Association of Government Accountants, and the  National Academy of Public Administration. Earlier this year, he was  inducted into the Government Hall of Fame for his lasting impact on  accountability, fiscal responsibility, and public trust in government.

As Gene's term as Comptroller General concludes, his legacy at GAO  and in public service is secure. The standards he set, the integrity he  brought to the job, and the respect he earned across Congress will  continue to shape the institution he devoted his career to  strengthening. I thank Gene Dodaro for his extraordinary service to our  country and wish him continued success in the next chapter of his  public service.
