Brown Visits Air Route Traffic Control Center In Oberlin


Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) visited the Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center (the Cleveland Center) in Oberlin to learn about the center and to meet with local workers. The Cleveland Center is one of the busiest of the nearly two dozen air traffic control centers in the United States. Brown toured the traffic management unit, the weather monitoring area, the air traffic controllers' station and the training center.

"Air traffic controllers in Oberlin are among the best in the world at what they do," said Brown. "These workers keep Ohioans safe as we travel across the country and around the world. I enjoyed meeting with these experts today and seeing the first-rate technology and innovation that Ohio is proud to call our own."

Brown is a strong champion for Ohio workers, including federal workers like those he met today in Oberlin. 

Last year, Brown blasted President Trump's government shutdown, which harmed federal workers like those at the Cleveland Center in Oberlin. Brown joined a group of Senators to introduce the Federal Employee Civil Relief Act. This legislation would protect federal workers and their families from foreclosures, evictions, and loan defaults during a government shutdown.
