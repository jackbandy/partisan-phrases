Brown: McConnell Should Reconvene Senate Immediately, Pass Families First Coronavirus Response Act


Today, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to reconvene the Senate immediately and pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. The House passed the legislation late last night and the bill must be passed by the Senate before heading to the President's desk to be signed into law.

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act includes emergency paid sick days language and provisions that would establish free testing for coronavirus, provide additional resources to states to help address coronavirus, invest in frontline health workers and strengthen food assistance benefits for Ohio children and families and seniors.

"We have a responsibility to the American people to take swift, meaningful action to keep Americans healthy and safe. The Senate should reconvene immediately and pass this comprehensive package, which provides critical resources to families, healthcare workers and state and local officials. Leader McConnell must put the package up for a vote and the President should sign it into law."  

The package builds on the $8.3 billion Supplemental Coronavirus Spending bill signed into law earlier this month that includes at least $15.6 million in immediate funding to help Ohio prepare for the coronavirus. 

Brown worked with his colleagues to ensure Ohio and local communities around the state have the funding they need to prevent and manage any potential cases of the coronavirus. The final package includes $8.3 billion in total funding, with $7.8 billion for immediate help to combat the coronavirus, and an additional $500 million authorization to enhance telehealth services.
