Brown Statement On HUD and FHFA Extending Foreclosure Moratoriums for Homeowners During The Coronavirus Pandemic


U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) -- ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs -- today released the following statement following the announcement that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) would extend the suspension of foreclosures on Federal Housing Administration-insured (FHA) and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-backed mortgages through June 30, 2020:

"I applaud the FHFA and HUD for recognizing the significant public health and economic risks we still face and making the responsible decision to extend the foreclosure moratorium passed under the CARES Act. But there's still much more work to do to protect homeowners and renters. No one should be kicked out of their home during this pandemic."
