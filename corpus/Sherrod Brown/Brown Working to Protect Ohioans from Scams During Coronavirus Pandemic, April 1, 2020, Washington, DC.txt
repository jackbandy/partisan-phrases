Brown Working to Protect Ohioans from Scams During Coronavirus Pandemic


Today, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) hosted a news conference call as he encourages Ohioans to remain vigilant against financial scams and other misinformation related to the coronavirus and calls on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to do more to protect Ohioans from scams. 

Last week, Brown wrote to FTC Chair Joseph Simons urging the Agency to better inform older Americans about coronavirus scams and assist victims in understanding their recourse options if they are scammed."Ohioans should be focused on their health and keeping their loved ones safe, not worried about a scammer going after their hard-earned money," said Brown.

Brown was joined on the call by Cindy Farson, Executive Director of the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging (COAAA). Reports indicate scammers are targeting older Americans specifically for scams related to coronavirus and Ms. Farson discussed the importance of protecting older Americans and Ohio families. 

"COVID-19 fraud seems to just be getting started, and we appreciate Senator Brown's letter to the FTC bringing light to these scams and asking for information on remedies," said Ms. Farson.

Ohioans can take several steps to protect themselves from scammers including: hanging up on robocallers, fact checking information that seems too good to be true and researching charities asking for donations during the coronavirus epidemic.
