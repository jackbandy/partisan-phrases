Brown Blasts President Trump's Willingness to Cut Medicare, Social Security to Pay for His Tax Scam


Today, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) released the following statement after President Trump said he would be open to cutting earned benefits like Medicare or Social Security to pay for his tax scam, which has been a handout to corporations at the expense of workers. Despite Republican claims that the bill was a tax cut for working people, it has proven to be nothing more than a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy.

"President Trump wants to betray Ohio seniors to pay for a tax bill that abandons working families. As President Trump continues fighting for corporations that ship jobs overseas, I'll keep fighting for Ohio seniors, workers and families and stand up to any attempts by this President to cut Medicare or Social Security. The cost of President Trump's tax scam failure shouldn't be paid for by robbing the earned benefits of hardworking Ohioans."
