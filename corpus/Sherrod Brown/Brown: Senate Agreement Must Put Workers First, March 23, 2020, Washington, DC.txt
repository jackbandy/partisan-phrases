Brown: Senate Agreement Must Put Workers First


Today, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) released the following statement on Senate Republicans' coronavirus stimulus proposal. Brown continues working to negotiate a package that puts workers, not Wall Street, first and one that supports frontline health workers. 

"Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans had an opportunity to draft a bipartisan relief package that would help the people who are suffering the most in this pandemic -- American workers and their families. Instead, they chose to do what they did in 2008 and 2009 and give Wall Street a blank check with taxpayer money. I look forward to continuing to negotiate with my colleagues on an agreement that puts workers first. We should be focusing on a plan to put cash in people's hands, expand tax credits to help families moving forward, include a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, provide rental and mortgage assistance, and support our frontline health care providers. We have to provide real relief to workers and hold corporations accountable. That means no corporate bailouts without investing in the Dignity of Work."
