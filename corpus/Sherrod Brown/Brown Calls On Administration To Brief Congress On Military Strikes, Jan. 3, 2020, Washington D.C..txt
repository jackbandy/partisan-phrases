Brown Calls On Administration To Brief Congress On Military Strikes, Present Plan To Keep Americans Safe


Today, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) released the following statement after the U.S. conducted airstrikes that killed Iranian military officials and Iraqi militia leaders late last night.

"Our highest priority now must be to keep Americans and U.S. servicemembers out of harm's way, and prevent further escalation. With increased tensions in the region, and the likelihood that Iran will respond in some way to this strike, the Administration must immediately brief Congress on last night's strike, its apparent lack of coordination with Iraq's government and any plans it has made to keep Americans safe. We can't let this Administration's chaotic foreign policy lead to another war in the Middle East. The U.S. must do all it can with our allies to de-escalate the situation."
