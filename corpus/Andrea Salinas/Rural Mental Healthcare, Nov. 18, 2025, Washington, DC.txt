Rural Mental Healthcare

Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the growing  mental health care crisis in rural America.

Nearly one in five adults live with a mental illness, yet rural  communities lack the providers, facilities, and resources to meet their  needs. In my own district, an entire county has only one child and  adolescent psychiatrist. For families seeking timely specialized care,  that is not just an inconvenience. It is a barrier that can mean the  difference between preventative help and a crisis.

Communities across the country face the same impossible math: too  many needs and too few providers.

That is why I have introduced legislation to support clinicians who  commit to practicing in rural areas and to expand telemental health  services tailored to farmers, fishers, and foresters, the people who  power our rural economies.

Access to quality care should not depend on your ZIP Code. I urge my  colleagues to join me in ensuring rural Americans are no longer  overlooked or underserved.
