Mental Health of Farmers


Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, September is National Suicide Prevention  Month. That is why I rise today to highlight the urgent need to support  the mental well-being of our rural communities.

The suicide rates among farmers, ranchers, and agricultural managers  stand at nearly 44 deaths per 100,000 people, which is significantly  higher than the national average.

Despite this crisis, my Republican colleagues recently passed their  big, ugly bill, which guts Medicaid. Medicaid provides access to the  care many in our rural communities need. Because of these cruel cuts,  Oregonians will lose out on lifesaving mental and behavioral health  care, and the mental health crisis will only get worse.

As a founding member of the Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus, I know  that our rural neighbors often travel long distances to access care.

I have a bill, the Home-Based Telemental Health Care Act, that would  expand access to remote mental health and substance use services in  rural America, specifically for individuals working in the farming,  fishing, and forestry industries.

Mr. Speaker, it is time we come together to pass legislation that  will address our Nation's growing mental health crisis and provide  farmers and people in rural communities the care they deserve.
