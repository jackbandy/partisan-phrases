Illegal Firings Could Devastate Oregon

Ms. SALINAS. Madam Speaker, I rise to sound the alarm about the Trump  administration's reported plans to fire nearly 7,000 workers in the  U.S. Forest Service.

These illegal firings could have devastating consequences for Oregon.

Wildfire season is just around the corner, and there is concern that  the Forest Service won't actually have enough staff and resources to  fight these deadly blazes, putting countless Oregonians at risk.

Fewer workers also means fewer people to care for our public lands  and less money coming into our local economies. It means taxpayer  dollars, which go to recruit and train these highly skilled  individuals, will lose out on their investment.

That is why my colleagues and I sent a letter to Secretary Rollins  and President Trump, demanding the reinstatement of all Forest Service  personnel who have been illegally fired. Luckily, our letter resulted  in some workers being reinstated, but the threat of more terminations  remains.

Our public servants deserve better. The American people deserve  better.

Madam Speaker, I won't be silent as the administration continues to  wreak havoc on our country, on our forest, and on our people. With or  without my Republican colleagues, I will continue to fight for our  vulnerable communities.
