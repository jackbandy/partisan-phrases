Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose President Trump's  disastrous tariffs and shine a light on the real harm they are causing  families and businesses in my district.

My district is home to some of the best wineries in the world, and  Canada is our single largest foreign market. After Trump imposed his  tariffs, Canada responded with their own tariffs that lasted for  months. Many Canadians continue to boycott our products, all while our  growers and producers pay the price. They are facing higher costs,  shrinking export opportunities, and real economic pain for real  families.

In October, wine sales to Canada were down 84 percent when compared  to last year. If we fail to act, this Congress will be complicit in  enabling President Trump to destroy the hard-fought relationships my  community has brokered. Wineries in my district built their  relationships across the border over decades, and in one day, President  Trump destroyed them.

These tariffs hurt American farmers and American consumers alike. We  must act and protect the American people from the volatile whims of the  petulant President.

Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.
