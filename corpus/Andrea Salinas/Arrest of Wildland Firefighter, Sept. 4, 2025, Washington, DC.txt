Arrest of Wildland Firefighter

Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call out the Trump administration  for their arrest and unconstitutional treatment of my constituent.

Last week, my constituent was working as a wildland firefighter to  combat the Bear Gulch fire when CBP stopped his crew and arrested him.

He was brought to the United States when he was just 4 years old. The  United States is the only home he knows.

For the past 3 years, he has bravely served as a wildland  firefighter, putting his life on the line to protect us.

Arresting a firefighter who is actively fighting a wildfire does not  make our community safer. For roughly 48 hours after his arrest, the  Trump administration violated my constituent's constitutional rights.  Despite requesting a phone call and his attorney, he was denied.

Let me be clear. Immigrants deserve to be treated with dignity. The  Constitution deserves to be followed. Communities deserve safety from  wildfires. First responders deserve to do their jobs unimpeded.  Anything less is a slap in the face to the values we share as  Americans.
