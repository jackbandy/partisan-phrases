One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, with this bill, my Republican colleagues  are betraying the American people.

In the dark of morning, they are trying to ram through legislation  that will raise costs, strip away healthcare, take food off the tables  of working families, and increase energy costs for all Americans, all  to give tax breaks to billionaires and corporations.

Cuts to Medicaid will shutter rural hospitals, nursing homes, and  health centers, leaving families with higher costs and nowhere to turn  for care.

As millions of families right now are struggling to put food on the  table, this bill cuts funding for nutrition assistance, forcing  children, veterans, and seniors to go hungry.

This bill raises costs on everything, from energy bills to  prescription medications.

This bill is a grave mistake. If it passes, my Republican colleagues  may pay for it at the ballot box, but countless Americans will pay for  it with their lives.

I urge my colleagues to have the moral courage to oppose this bill.
