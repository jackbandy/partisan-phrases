Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize West Salem High  School for its commitment to inclusivity in sports.

The Titans recently earned two national awards for their inclusive  basketball program. In addition to being named a Unified Champion  School by the Special Olympics, West was also added to ESPN's Honor  Roll, a distinction awarded to only one school in every State per year.

Their unique program includes combined gym classes where students  with disabilities are paired with other students who can help guide  them through activities, as well as special equipment and necessary  modifications, like shorter hoops for athletes using wheelchairs.

I am so proud of the students and faculty at West for their  dedication to ensuring that every one of their peers can participate  and make friends through sports, regardless of their abilities.

Again, congratulations on these incredible and well-deserved  achievements. Keep up the good work, and go Titans.
