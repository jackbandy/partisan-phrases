Breaking the Gridlock Act

Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to pass  this legislation to prevent families' healthcare costs from  skyrocketing.

I will share just a few messages from my hardworking constituents who  will be impacted.

Kelly from Salem wrote: ``My policy is going to increase from $40 to  $191. I will have no wiggle room in my budget, no room for  emergencies.''

Rachel from Amity says that her plan will increase from $511 to  $1,328 per month. She wrote: ``We will probably choose to only insure  our child. We cannot afford 25 percent of our income going to health  insurance.''

Janice from Salem said that her monthly costs will go from $465 to  $1,100. ``I will go without health insurance if I can't bring it way  down to no more than $500 a month. I am 5 years away from retirement.''

Mr. Speaker, these are just three stories from about 16,000 in my  district, and there are millions just like these across our country.  Our constituents are counting on this body to lower their costs and  save their healthcare.

Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.
