Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share an excerpt of a letter from  a child who was detained at the Dilley ICE facility: ``My name is  Ariana . . . I am 14 years old, and I am from Honduras. I've been  detained for 45 days. Since I got to this center, all you will feel is  sadness and mostly depression. I've been in this country for almost 7  years, and in those 7 years, my mom and I found a home and made a  bigger family. I have never been separated from my siblings, and it's  honestly sad because they are little, and they need their mom and  sister.''

She goes on to say: ``I haven't been getting any school time. There  are various viruses. People are always sick. Serious situations happen,  and the officers can't take them seriously enough. There are no  consequences. They don't care.''

Mr. Speaker, children are being traumatized by what this  administration is doing to them. We must ask ourselves: Is this right?  Is this moral? Is this the Nation we want to be?
