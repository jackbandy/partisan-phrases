Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Vasquez for yielding  time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 356, the Secure Rural Schools  Reauthorization Act, my bipartisan legislation with Representatives  LaMalfa and Neguse in the House and Senators Crapo and Wyden in the  Senate.

In central and southern Oregon, my district, the Federal Government  owns over 3 million acres of forestland that pays no taxes to our local  government. Generations of families built their lives and livelihood  around Federal timber harvest, and counties relied on revenue shares  from those sales to fund public services. When the timber industry  collapsed, the revenue shares also disappeared.

Congress made a commitment to support rural communities and the  critical infrastructure to make sure they did not get left behind.  However, in the Republican budget bill, H.R. 1, the timber revenues  from Federal lands to counties were eliminated, adding insult to  injury.

The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for our rural  communities. It supports basic public services like keeping roads  paved, schools open, and emergency services running. Secure Rural  Schools was meant to be a bridge and not the final answer for our rural  communities.

Mr. Speaker, we still have a long way to go to deliver on the  investments and job opportunities that rural America needs and  deserves. I know it is one of my top priorities in Congress, along with  many of my colleagues.

Letting this program expire and pulling the rug out from under our  rural counties is simply not an option. We owe it to our rural  communities and our timber-dependent counties to keep this commitment.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support it, as well.
