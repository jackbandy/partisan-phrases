Ms. SALINAS. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the city of Beaverton  and Mayor Lacey Beaty for being selected as 1 of 50 finalists in the  2025 Bloomberg Mayors Challenge.

Selected from over 630 global applicants, Beaverton's bold initiative  reimagines housing through community-led, intergenerational models that  put homeownership within reach for more Oregonians.

Imagine a walkable neighborhood with vibrant shops, restaurants, and  community-led events for all residents, a neighborhood that sets up  families with the resources and support they need to own a home, a  neighborhood where sustainability and accessibility are priorities.

This is Beaverton's dream, and they are making it a reality. At a  time when too many families are priced out, this idea addresses  unnecessary barriers, high costs, zoning limits, and a lack of housing  options through a new and innovative plan to create more starter  housing.

I congratulate Mayor Beaty and the entire city of Beaverton for this  remarkable achievement and for showing the world what is possible.
