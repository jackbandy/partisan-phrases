Raising A Question of the Privileges of the House

Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my friend and  colleague, Congressman Garcia.

Over the past 3-plus years, I have had the pleasure of working with  Chuy Garcia. I have known him to be a dedicated public servant  committed to serving his community and his country. Day in and day out,  he has shown up for his constituents and for the American people.

I contrast this with Speaker Johnson, who, for the last month and a  half, kept the House out of session, stopped this body from working on  behalf of the people who sent us here, and manufactured a healthcare  crisis.

We just ended the Republicans' government shutdown, and this is our  first order of business? We need to get back to work to address the  issues impacting the American people. We should be united in addressing  the Republicans' looming healthcare crisis and the rising cost of  living.

This debate does nothing to lower costs for people in Oregon or  across this country. This is a debate that should be held by  Congressman Garcia's constituents, not by Members of Congress who do  not represent them.

We have more important work to do than to express displeasure at a  Member of Congress who has spent his entire life serving the people of  Illinois and people across this country.

Now, please, let's get back to the real work on behalf of the  American people. I urge my colleagues to reject this reprimand.
