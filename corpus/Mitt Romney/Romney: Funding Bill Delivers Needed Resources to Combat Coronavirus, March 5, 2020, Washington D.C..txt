Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), member of the Senate Health Committee, today released the following statement regarding the bipartisan Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, legislation to provide $7.8 billion in new emergency funding to fight coronavirus. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 1. "This bill will deliver necessary resources to combat the spread of the coronavirus, providing funding for patient monitoring, the acquisition of test kits and protective equipment, and research into vaccines," Senator Romney said. "As a member of the health committee, I will continue working to ensure that Congress provides the resources our federal, state, and local governments need to respond. We must do everything in our power to keep families in Utah and across the country safe, and that begins by getting this bill to the president's desk for signature."
