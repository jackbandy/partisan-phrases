Romney: War Powers Resolution Sends Wrong Message to Iranhttps://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-war-powers-resolution-sends-wrong-message-iran


U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and chairman of the subcommittee dealing with the Middle East, today announced that he will vote against Senator Tim Kaine's (D-VA) war powers resolution. "During this time of heightened tensions with Iran, I believe this resolution would undermine our deterrent capability and send the wrong message to Iran. As it is currently drafted, this resolution would tie the President's hands in responding to further potential Iranian aggression. The balance of powers between the executive and legislative branches related to the use of military force is a longstanding issue of debate, and it is a debate we should have. However, with American troops in harm's way, now is not the proper time and this resolution is not the right approach."
