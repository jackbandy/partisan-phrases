Romney Applauds BLM Conveyance to Cache County


U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today released the following statement after the Bureau of Land Management Salt Lake Field Office published a Notice of Realty Action in the Federal Register for conveyance of public lands to the City of Hyde Park located in Cache County, Utah. The 80-acre parcel is within the Hyde Park city limits and isolated from other BLM-managed lands. "During negotiations on the public lands package, Congressman Bishop and I worked to ensure local needs were heard and addressed," Senator Romney said. "Among the wins secured for our state was legislation directing the BLM to transfer 80 acres from federal control to Hyde Park in order to improve the city's water supply and provide additional recreational opportunities for Cache County residents. I appreciate the efforts of Secretary Bernhardt and the BLM to move this land conveyance forward in a professional and timely manner." "The BLM values its partnership with the City of Hyde Park and looks forward to the community's development of these lands for recreation and public utilities," said BLM Salt Lake Field Manager Matt Preston. The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, the public lands package signed into law at the beginning of this session of Congress, directs BLM to convey this parcel of land to Cache County, which will support Hyde Park's interest to increase recreational opportunities and provide for important public purposes. The conveyance includes surface and mineral interests.
