Romney Praises Senate Agreement on Relief Package


U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today praised the agreement made on the Senate package that includes several proposals he fought for to provide relief to workers, families and small businesses--including direct cash payments to Americans. The Senate is expected to vote on the legislation later today.  "I am pleased that this agreement includes several important provisions I pushed for, including direct cash relief for workers and families, grants and loans for small businesses to keep their employees, and an expansion of unemployment insurance to immediately assist laid-off and furloughed workers. The agreement also includes much-needed relief for our medical personnel on the frontlines and a bipartisan measure I helped introduce to strengthen the supply chain in order for hospitals to have the necessary equipment and supplies. With each passing day, hundreds of thousands of hardworking Americans are being laid off and employers are shutting down as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Congress cannot afford to wait any longer to deliver relief to those who need it. We must get this bill across the finish line without further delay."
