Romney Applauds Passage of Funding to Restart PPP


U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today released the following statement after the Senate passed an additional $484 billion in funding for small businesses, their workers, and the public health. "The package passed by the Senate today will restart the Paycheck Protection Program, which is critical to ensuring workers keep receiving paychecks, and it affirms that our farmers and ranchers will qualify for these loans. Businesses will receive additional help through increased funding for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program. The bill also delivers additional funds for our hospitals and healthcare providers, sends money to states for expanded COVID-19 testing, and supports the valuable research that the CDC and the NIH are conducting to respond to this pandemic."
