Senate Passes Romney Bill to Confront Rise of China


U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today released the following statement after the Senate last night unanimously passed the Indo-Pacific Cooperation Act of 2019, legislation he introduced with Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Todd Young (R-IN), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Chris Coons (D-DE), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) that would require the U.S. to partner with allies in the Indo-Pacific region, Europe, and elsewhere, to develop a unified approach to address the rise of China. "Addressing the threat that China poses to our fundamental values of freedom, human rights, and free enterprise is the central challenge facing us in the 21st century," Senator Romney said. "As the leader of the free world, America must link arms with our allies and partners to confront the rise of China. Senate passage of this legislation represents a first step in developing a unified approach and comprehensive strategy with our allies in Asia, Europe, and around the world to combat China's growing aggression."
