Romney's Statement Regarding State of the Union Address


U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) released the following statement regarding the president's State of the Union address:       "I appreciated welcoming Governor Herbert to the Capitol and spending time with him ahead of the State of the Union address. Under his leadership, Utah continues to see economic prosperity, job growth, and our unemployment rate is at a record low. "Our nation has experienced similarly strong economic growth, with rising wages, more job creation, and low unemployment for the past few years. The President rightfully recognized that success and also highlighted several policy areas in which both parties should work together. Going forward, I am urging Congress and the President to urgently address our nation's runaway debt, which threatens our retirement programs like Social Security and Medicare. The TRUST Act, which I've introduced with a bipartisan group of senators, would rescue our government trust funds and address our debt crisis, and passing this legislation is my top priority this year."
