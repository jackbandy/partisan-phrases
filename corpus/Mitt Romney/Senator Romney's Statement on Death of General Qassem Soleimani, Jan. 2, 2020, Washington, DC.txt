Senator Romney's Statement on Death of General Qassem Soleimani


U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and chairman of the subcommittee dealing with the Middle East, released this statement following the announcement that Iranian Quds Force General Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. airstrike: "Qassem Soleimani was a depraved terrorist who had the blood of hundreds of American servicemen and women on his hands, and who was doubtlessly planning operations to further harm our citizens and allies. "We remember and honor the sacrifice of those servicemen and women, and we commend our brave troops and intel officers who carried out this successful mission. At this time of increased tension in the region, the U.S. must take necessary steps to protect our personnel there and beyond. "With ever increasing challenges confronting us in the Middle East, it is imperative that the U.S. and our allies articulate and pursue a coherent strategy for protecting our security interests in the region. I will be pressing the Administration for additional details in the days ahead."
