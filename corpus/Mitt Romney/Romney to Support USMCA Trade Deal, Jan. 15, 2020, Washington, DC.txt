Romney to Support USMCA Trade Deal


U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today released the following statement regarding the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal, which revises and modernizes the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Romney today voted at the committee level in support of advancing the agreement, and the USMCA now awaits a final vote from the full Senate. "This trade deal creates more balanced and reciprocal trade, raises labor standards, and protects our technology and intellectual property from those who don't play by the rules," Senator Romney said. "While I'm disappointed that protections for our biologics industry were not ultimately included in the final deal, Utah's dairy farmers will benefit from access to new markets for exports into Canada and Mexico. The agreement also supports communities that have been disproportionately harmed by the effects of NAFTA. While not perfect, this deal represents a long overdue update to NAFTA, and overall will benefit workers and farmers in our state and across the country."
