Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, it is really devastating to listen to the other side  talking about how we somehow were not supposed to be told when boots  went on the ground before. Somehow, we were lucky enough, by God's  grace, that  nothing bad happened to the men and women in the service of our Nation.  Yet they actually were injured, seven of them.

The U.S. military is being used against Venezuela without  congressional authorization, without transparency, and in ways that  appear only designed to benefit the very powerful amongst us--the oil  companies--and not the Venezuelan people, and certainly not our  American people to whom we are obligated to represent. It is as simple  as that.

The American people don't want their sons or their daughters sent  into harm's way for their missions to Venezuela or to Greenland or to  anywhere else that are undertaken just to enrich corporations and the  most wealthy amongst us and cronies of the President's, and to do  nothing in the process to lower the cost of living, to help families  afford housing or healthcare, or to secure a future for our children.

Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I am struck by the fact that we are at a  place where we have maligned others in the past for brutish  isolationism and for colonial instincts that we have long condemned in  our own adversaries.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of this aisle to vote  ``yes,'' to do our jobs so that we may reaffirm our authority and rein  in reckless action.
