Recognizing Paul Redman

Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Paul Redman, the  visionary leader behind the world-renowned Longwood Gardens, which is a  fixture of my community in the Philadelphia area.

Since 2006, Paul's masterful leadership has helped Longwood navigate  modernization, a global pandemic, and even an escaped convict hiding on  the grounds. Under his direction, Longwood has grown physically and  programmatically, becoming a go-to destination for events, employing  hundreds across southeastern Pennsylvania, and bringing 1.6 million  people to our community last year.

I have been proud to honor hosts like the Japanese Ambassador to  Longwood Gardens, and I am always grateful for Paul's graciousness and  hospitality.

This week, for his steadfast dedication to our community and to  Longwood, Paul is being inducted into the Chester County Economic  Development Council Hall of Fame. He has made innumerable contributions  to our region, and this honor is beyond well-deserved.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Paul. I am so proud to have an  extraordinary leader such as him in our community and at the head of  our Longwood Gardens.
