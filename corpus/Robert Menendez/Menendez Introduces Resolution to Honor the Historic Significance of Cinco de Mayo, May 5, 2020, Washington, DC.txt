Menendez Introduces Resolution to Honor the Historic Significance of Cinco de Mayo


U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the highest-ranking Latino in Congress, introduced a Senate resolution to recognize the cultural and historical significance of the Cinco de Mayo -- a holiday to commemorate Mexico's victory over France during the Battle of Puebla in 1862, which was part of Mexico's long and brave fight for freedom and independence. 

"Despite confronting a pandemic of historic proportions, today we come together to recognize that Mexican-Americans are a vital part of American society, enriching our culture, boosting the economy and serving communities to the betterment of our nation," said Sen. Menendez.  "As a nation of immigrants, we must continue to celebrate the history of all communities living in the United States and strive for a more inclusive agenda that resembles the diversity of our great country by building bridges of hope instead of wasteful walls of hate. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that in challenging moments we strive by embracing our diversity and working together."

The bipartisan resolution, cosponsored by Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas), recognizes the historic struggle of the people of Mexico for independence and freedom, which Cinco de Mayo commemorates, and serves as a reminder that the foundation of the United States was built by people from many countries and diverse cultures who were willing to fight and die for freedom.
