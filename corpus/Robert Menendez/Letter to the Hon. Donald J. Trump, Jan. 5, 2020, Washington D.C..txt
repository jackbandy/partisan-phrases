Letter to the Hon. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States - Menendez and Schumer Call on President Trump to Declassify War Powers Act Notification Letter


Dear Mr. President:

We write to request and urge you to immediately declassify in full the January 4, 2020 war powers notification you submitted to Congress following the U.S. military operation targeting Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani.

It is critical that national security matters of such import be shared with the American people in a timely manner. An entirely classified notification is simply not appropriate in a democratic society, and there appears to be no legitimate justification for classifying this notification. 

Thank you for your consideration of this request.
