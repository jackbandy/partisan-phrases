Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jack Link of  Link Snacks, Incorporated, on his induction into the Wisconsin  Manufacturing Hall of Fame.

Born and raised in Minong, Wisconsin, Mr. Link learned the  fundamentals of meat processing at an early age in his family's butcher  shop.

By the mid-1980s, after the family meatpacking business closed, Jack  identified an opportunity to improve the quality and consistency of  meat snacks available in the marketplace.

These efforts led to the creation of Jack Link's Beef Jerky. What  started as a small Wisconsin operation has now grown into the world's  largest manufacturer of jerky in the world. Through it all, the company  has remained 100 percent family owned.

Jack Link's induction into the Wisconsin Manufacturing Hall of Fame  is a well-earned recognition of a man who built a manufacturing  powerhouse while staying true to Wisconsin ingenuity and values.

Jack has also been a strong supporter of education in the Northwoods,  contributing to the Northwood Foundation and funding Jack Link's  Aquatic and Activity Center. The center provides the Minong area with  its first space for swimming, fitness, and youth programming.

Madam Speaker, I thank Jack Link for strengthening America and  Wisconsin's manufacturing, and offer congratulations to Jack, Mary Jo,  and the entire Link family on this honor.
