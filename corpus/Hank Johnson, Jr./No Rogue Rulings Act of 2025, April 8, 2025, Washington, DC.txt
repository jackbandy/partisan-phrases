No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1689713/no-rogue-rulings-act-of-2025


Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the judicial branch ensures that  people, corporations, and even other branches of government follow the  law, and if a President does something illegal, which this President is  famous for, the only way for the courts to prevent thousands of people  from being harmed is to order a nationwide injunction that stops him  from doing that illegal thing.

It is essential to our democracy that the courts can serve as a check  on a President who is trampling people's rights.

While proponents of the bill say that each aggrieved person should  bring their own case, that just does not make sense. There is no way  that each of the thousands of people harmed could pay for their own  lawyer, get into a courtroom, and try their own case.

Aside from the difficulty and cost to everyone, our courts could  never handle that volume of cases. With dockets already bursting at the  seams, justice would be delayed. It would be so delayed that it would  be denied. It would be inefficient, cost prohibitive, and unfair.

That is what Republicans want because Federal courts keep ruling  against Trump's unlawful and unconstitutional executive actions.  Therefore, they are trying to hamstring the courts so that Trump can't  be stopped.

We need our courts to continue to serve as a bulwark of democracy  against the Trump administration's flood of illegal actions. That is  why I rise today in opposition to this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an April 2, 2025, letter  addressed to Pam Bondi from 500 law firms and lawyers across the  Nation.                                                      April 2, 2025.      Hon. Pamela Bondi,      Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice,           Washington, DC.

Dear Attorney General Bondi: We are members of the legal       profession and entities that provide legal representation and       work in law. We do not agree on all matters and, in fact, at       times have been or are adverse to each other in court or       other professional settings. Despite our differences, we all       share a commitment to the United States Constitution, the       rule of law, and the role of the legal system in protecting       the rights of all people and ensuring all of us can have our       day in court. This commitment to the Constitution and the       rule of law requires that lawyers be able to operate with       independence, without fear of retaliation for bringing       lawsuits in good faith, and without attempts to deter       recourse to the legal system.

We write to you, as the nation's highest ranking legal       official, out of deep concern regarding a number of actions       that the President of the United States and his       administration have taken and a number of statements       targeting lawyers and the legal profession.

The following are illustrative examples of the concerning       actions and statements:

On February 25, 2025, the President issued a memo titled       ``Suspension of Security Clearances and Evaluation of       Government Contracts'' targeting Covington & Burling LLP.

On March 6, 2025, the President issued a memo titled       ``Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP.''

On March 11, 2025, the President issued a memo titled       ``Ensuring the Enforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure       65(c),'' aiming to make it harder for organizations,       communities, and individuals to enforce their rights.

On March 14, 2025, at the Department of Justice, the       President called his courtroom opponents ``scum,'' judges       ``corrupt,'' and prosecutors ``deranged.''

On March 14, 2025, the President issued a memo titled       ``Addressing Risks from Paul Weiss.''

On March 22, 2025, the President issued a memo titled       ``Rescinding Security Clearances and Access to Classified       Information from Specified Individuals.''

On March 22, 2025, the President sent a memo to Attorney       General Pam Bondi titled ``Preventing Abuses of the Legal       System and the Federal Court.''

It is your responsibility, as the lawyer ultimately       entrusted with the representation of the United States in       legal matters, to oppose attacks on the legal profession, on       judges, and on the rule of law and to ensure that the       Department of Justice uses its full power to protect the       legal profession and equal justice under law for all people.

Attacking legal advocates based on the positions they take       in good faith litigation or based on who their clients are or       have been is inconsistent with our nation's values and with       the Constitution's contemplation of the functioning of the       judicial branch. Indeed before the founding of the United       States, John Adams, an ardent supporter of American       independence and someone who opposed King George III,       famously represented the British crown's own soldiers       involved in the Boston Massacre--driven by an unwavering       commitment to fair process and equal justice.

During your confirmation hearings earlier this year before       the United States Senate, you pledged to ensure that there       was ``confidence and integrity'' in the United States       Department of Justice and stated that you opposed the       ``partisan weaponization'' of the Department. It is incumbent       on you to use all of the tools available to you to preserve       and protect the independence and integrity of the legal       profession, including opposing the use of the federal       government to attack lawyers, law firms, and legal       organizations for engaging in good faith representation of       their clients.            Respectfully yours,                           ORGANIZATIONS AND FIRMS
