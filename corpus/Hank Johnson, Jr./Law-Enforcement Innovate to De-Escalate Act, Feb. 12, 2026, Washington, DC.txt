Law-Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act


Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  bill because it would make us less safe. Police already have access to  less-than-lethal weapons like tasers. They don't need a change in  the law. That is not an excuse for changing the law.

This bill expands access to dangerous, prohibited individuals by  stripping away Federal safeguards. Tasers may not shoot bullets, but  they are still dangerous in the wrong hands.

This bill would mean that anyone can buy them without a background  check including people convicted of serious violent crimes and domestic  abusers with restraining orders against them.

This bill would also eliminate serialization, making these dangerous  devices untraceable. H.R. 2189 is a reckless expansion of the gun  industry.

Mr. Speaker, because we all care about public safety, I urge my  colleagues to stand with me and my colleagues in opposition to this  dangerous piece of legislation.
