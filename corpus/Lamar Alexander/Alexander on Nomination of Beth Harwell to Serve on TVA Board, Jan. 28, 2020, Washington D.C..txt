Alexander on Nomination of Beth Harwell to Serve on TVA Board


United States Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today released the following statement after President Trump announced his intent to nominate Beth Harwell of Tennessee to serve on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Board of Directors:

"I have encouraged and admired Beth Harwell and her style of leadership since she began her career in public service. Throughout her time in the Tennessee House of Representatives, and as Speaker of the House, Beth has worked with the TVA on several issues. She understands that TVA's mission is to continue to provide cheap, clean and reliable electricity throughout the Tennessee Valley, and I know her leadership will be a valuable asset to the TVA board. I am glad President Trump nominated her, and I look forward to her confirmation by the United States Senate."
