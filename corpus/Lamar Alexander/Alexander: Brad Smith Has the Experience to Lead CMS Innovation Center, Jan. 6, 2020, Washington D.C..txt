Alexander: Brad Smith Has the Experience to Lead CMS Innovation Center


U.S. Senate health committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today released the following statement on the appointment of Brad Smith to serve as the director for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' innovation center:  

"Brad has exactly the right experience to lead a center charged with coming up with innovative ways to lower health care costs and improve quality. He has founded a successful health care company and knows how state and federal governments work, having served under Governor Bill Haslam and Senator Bob Corker, and at the White House. I look forward to working with Brad to give Americans better health care outcomes, better experiences, at lower costs."
