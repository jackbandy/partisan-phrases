Alexander Statement on Title IX Final Rule


U.S. Senate education committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today released the following statement after the U.S. Department of Education made final its rule clarifying Title IX -- a federal law protecting students from sex discrimination in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance, so that schools will more fully understand their roles and responsibilities to better comply with the law:

"This final rule respects and supports victims and preserves due process rights for both the victim and the accused," Alexander said. "For example, the rule ensures victims get the support they need to change classes or dorms if they allege they have been sexually assaulted or sexually harassed and the rule ensures the victim and the accused get a fair hearing to resolve such allegations. I am glad Secretary DeVos undertook this rulemaking to help give more certainty to victims, the accused, and college administrators."

"Under the previous administration, a single official at the U.S. Department of Education was issuing edicts, without the proper public input, to 6,000 colleges and universities about how to handle the complex and sensitive problem of sexual assault on college campuses," Alexander continued. "To resolve this, Secretary DeVos undertook the appropriate public rulemaking process beginning in November 2018, including the opportunity for individuals, groups and educational institutions to review and submit comments."
