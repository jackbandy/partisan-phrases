Alexander Statement on "Nation's Report Card" Results


United States Senate education committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) made the following statement on the 2018 results released today from the "Nation's Report Card:"

"These results from the "Nation's Report Card' are sobering. They remind us that the worst scores for American high school students often are not in science and math, but in United States history. And, if our children do not learn United States history, they will not grow up learning what it means to be an American.

"America is an idea that has nothing to do with race, region and background," Alexander continued. "It has to do instead with believing in shared principles--such as liberty, equal opportunity and the rule of law. One reason our public schools were created was to teach those principles to our children."   

In 1986, at the request of U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett, Alexander chaired the study group that produced the Alexander-James report recommending the creation of the National Assessment Governing Board, which oversees "The Nation's Report Card." Alexander spoke today at the National Assessment Governing Board's virtual event where the "Nation's Report Card" 2018 results were released.
