Alexander Statement on Nomination of Tyreece Miller to Serve as the United States Marshal for the Western District of Tennessee


United States Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today released the following statement after President Trump announced his intent to nominate Tyreece Miller to serve as the United States Marshal for the Western District of Tennessee:

"Deputy Chief Miller has served in the Jackson Police Department for more than 20 years, overseeing law enforcement operations and conducting criminal investigations involving both violent crimes and drug cases. He knows how to get results and how to get local, state and federal agencies to work together. West Tennesseans will be well-served by Deputy Chief Miller, and I hope the Senate will quickly consider his nomination. I look forward to his confirmation."
