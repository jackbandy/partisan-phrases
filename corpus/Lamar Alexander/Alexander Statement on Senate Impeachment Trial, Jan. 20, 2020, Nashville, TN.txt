Alexander Statement on Senate Impeachment Trial


United States Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said today that he will vote for a resolution governing procedures in the impeachment trial of President Trump that begins on Tuesday in the United States Senate. He issued the following statement:

"Just because the House proceedings were a circus that doesn't mean the Senate's trial needs to be.

"We have a constitutional duty to hear the case. That means to me, number one, hear the arguments on both sides, and not dismiss the case out of hand. Number two, ask our questions, consider the answers and study the record. Number three, be guaranteed a right to vote on whether we need additional evidence. Evidence could be documents; it could be witnesses; or there could be no need for additional evidence.

"The resolution I am supporting guarantees a vote on whether we need additional evidence at the appropriate time. Except for not including a motion to dismiss after senators have asked questions, the resolution establishes fundamentally the same rules that the Senate approved by a vote of 100-0 for the Clinton impeachment trial in 1999."
