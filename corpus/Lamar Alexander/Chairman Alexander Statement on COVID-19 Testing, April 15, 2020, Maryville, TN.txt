Chairman Alexander Statement on COVID-19 Testing


Senate health committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement on COVID-19 testing:

"Without more tests with quick results, it will be difficult to contain this disease and give Americans confidence to go back to work and back to school. In the last month, Congress has given federal agencies up to $38 billion to develop tests, treatments, and vaccines. Nothing is more important than finding a new diagnostic technology that will make it possible to test tens of millions of Americans, something our country has never tried to do before. We should start by using the money Congress has already provided, put politics aside, and work together on more tests with quick results."
