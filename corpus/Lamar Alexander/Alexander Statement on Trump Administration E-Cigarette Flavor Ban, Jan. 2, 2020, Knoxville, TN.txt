Alexander Statement on Trump Administration E-Cigarette Flavor Ban


Senate health committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) released the following statement after the Trump Administration announced a plan to ban flavored e-cigarette pods with the exception of tobacco and mint flavors:

"This flavor ban coming a month after Congress raised the legal age to purchase e-cigarettes and tobacco products from 18 to 21 reflects bipartisan alarm about the epidemic of teenage vaping. One in four high-schoolers use vaping devices and are at risk of becoming addicted to nicotine with damaging consequences to their health. The Food and Drug Administration has substantial authority to do more and should use it. A good next step would be for the FDA to announce polices to help store owners enforce the new age restriction and flavor ban." 

In November 2019, Alexander chaired a hearing to hear from Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials on the investigation and public health response to the outbreak of lung injuries linked to the use of electronic cigarettes, vapor products, and other electronic nicotine delivery systems, and the response to the increase in youth use of these products.
