Alexander Statement on Tennessee's First Confirmed Coronavirus CaseAlexander Statement on Tennessee's First Confirmed Coronavirus Case


United States Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today released the following statement after Governor Bill Lee announced Tennessee's first confirmed case of coronavirus in Williamson County:

"The United States is among the countries that are best prepared to keep Tennesseans -- and all Americans -- safe from the coronavirus and to prepare for additional cases. Today, the Senate will be voting on nearly $8 billion in funding, including $950 million for state and local governments. Those dollars, along with screening and travel restrictions on people coming from China and other affected places, and a speed up in making diagnostic kits available to detect coronavirus are all a part of that effort. The Trump Administration is using the resources and tools that Congress has provided to respond to the coronavirus. I will work with Governor Lee to ensure the federal government is doing everything we can to assist Tennesseans."

Alexander, as chairman of the Senate health committee, held a hearing Tuesday where he heard from "respected professionals with decades of experience" about both what individuals can do and what the federal government is doing to respond.
