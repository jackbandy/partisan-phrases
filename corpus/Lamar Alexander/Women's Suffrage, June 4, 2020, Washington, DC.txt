  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Alaska  for her eloquent remarks, and I am glad I was here to have a chance to  listen to them, both on equal rights, really, for all Americans. It is  not possible for us to speak on any subject today without recognizing  what is going on in the country. 

  A couple of comments that come to my mind as I think what happened as  a result of the incident with George Floyd in Minneapolis were, first,  the comment of the leader of the peaceful protest in Nashville. There  were more than 1,000 there. She said, the next day, that she was  disappointed by the rioters and looters because they dishonored the  memory of George Floyd and dishonored the peaceful protest against  racial discrimination. I thought she said that well and expressed the  feeling of most Tennesseans. 

  The other comment I thought about was that of our colleague Senator  Tim  Scott of South Carolina, who is one of three African-American Members  of the U.S. Senate. He told us a couple of years ago in a private Bible  study--and I asked him later if I could mention it--that he was stopped  7 times--an African-American man--in his hometown, Charleston, SC, for  being a Black man in the wrong place, even while he was the vice mayor  of his hometown. 

  I asked him about that again this week. He said: Yes, it happened  again last month. I think most of us don't know that. We don't think  about that--those of us who aren't African American, aren't Black. To  think about that, I think, helps us begin the process of understanding  the feelings that are going on in the country right now, most of which  can't be solved by laws. They will have to be changed by attitudes.
