Alexander on Nomination of Brian Noland to Serve on TVA Board


United States Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today released the following statement after President Trump announced his intent to nominate Dr. Brian Noland of Tennessee to serve on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Board of Directors:

"Brian is a respected leader in East Tennessee, and during his tenure as president, he has helped transform Tennessee's fourth largest university, East Tennessee State University. His administrative experience makes him the right person to help keep TVA on a good path -- to continue to provide clean, cheap, reliable electricity at the lowest possible rates for homes and businesses through the seven-state Tennessee Valley region. I hope the Senate will quickly consider his nomination and look forward to his confirmation."
