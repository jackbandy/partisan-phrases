Alexander Statement on Election of Senator Collins to Chair the Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety


Senate Labor Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today released the following statement after Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) was elected as Chair of the Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety replacing former Senator Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.):

"Having one of the Senate's ablest and most respected members chair the important subcommittee on Employment and Workforce Safety is good news for the Senate and even better news for the American people," said Senator Alexander. "Our committee's jurisdiction includes workforce education and training, worker health and safety, wage and hour laws, and workplace flexibility. Senator Collins will lead our efforts to help ensure that workers can succeed in our rapidly changing economy."

 "I look forward to chairing the HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety to continue to build on my efforts to support and protect workers," said Senator Collins. "I am particularly interested in examining strategies to increase job training to help Americans obtain good-paying jobs.  Workforce development will also help address the severe shortage of employees in critical fields like health care, manufacturing, and other skilled trades in Maine and across our country.  I am grateful that Chairman Alexander and my committee colleagues have given me this opportunity."
