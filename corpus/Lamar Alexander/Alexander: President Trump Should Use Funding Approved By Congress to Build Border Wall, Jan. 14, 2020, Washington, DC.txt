Alexander: President Trump Should Use Funding Approved By Congress to Build Border Wall


United States Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today reiterated that the president has sufficient funding authority to build the wall he wants on the Southern border without resorting to a "dangerous national emergency precedent."

"I support the president's efforts to secure the border, and in December, I voted to give the President $1.375 billion to continue building the border wall and clear authority to transfer up to $4 billion from the defense budget.  This is the right way to fund the border wall -- by asking the Congress for funding, allowing Congress to consider the request, and working with Congress to achieve a result.  Declaring a national emergency to build the border wall is unnecessary, sets a dangerous precedent and is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution."

For fiscal year 2020, President Trump requested $8.6B to build the border wall.  Congress provided the president with authority to spend up to $5.375 billion on the border wall.  The declaration of a national emergency would allow the president to transfer funding that was not provided by Congress from military construction projects and other parts of the federal government.
