Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today welcomed U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, after she was sworn into the Senate replacing former Senator Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.):

"I welcome Senator Kelly Loeffler to the Senate and look forward to working with her to lower what Americans pay out of their own pockets for health care and to make a college education worth students time and money. Sen. Loeffler has the background and skills to immediately become an effective member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which according to former chairman Senator Ted Kennedy, has 30 percent of the legislative jurisdiction of the Senate."
