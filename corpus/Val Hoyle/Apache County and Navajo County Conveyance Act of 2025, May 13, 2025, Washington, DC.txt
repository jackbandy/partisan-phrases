Apache County and Navajo County Conveyance Act of 2025

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 1829, the Apache County and Navajo County Conveyance Act of 2025,  a commonsense bill that will help rural Arizona communities meet an  essential public service need.

This legislation would direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey  small parcels of land within the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest to  Apache County and Navajo County for the expansion of existing  cemeteries.

These cemeteries are running out of space. Without this bill, local  families face serious barriers in accessing burial services close to  home.

This bill would ensure the land remains dedicated to cemetery use. It  also protects Federal interests through a reversion clause and places  the costs of surveys and environmental review on the counties.

This is a respectful, efficient solution that reflects both local  priorities and responsible Federal land management.

Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
