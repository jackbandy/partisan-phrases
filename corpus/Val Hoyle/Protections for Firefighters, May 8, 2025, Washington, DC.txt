Protections for Firefighters

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Madam Speaker, 2 days ago I got a text from a  firefighter in my district saying: Get a rare blood cancer and find out  there is no firefighter cancer registry. The cancer registry is hosted  by NIOSH, and on April 1 and last week, the agency was gutted.

In Gresham, Oregon, there was an investigation because we had a  firefighter who spent months in the hospital after surviving a flash  fire, and the investigators were fired in the middle of the  investigation.

I come from a family of firefighters, one of whom just got diagnosed  with Parkinson's after spending months at the World Trade Center.

The fact of the matter is, on 9/11 my Republican colleagues will fall  all over themselves to thank firefighters and say how they will never  forget. I will tell you something, we are going to never forget the  deafening silence and the inaction as these investigators and  protections for firefighters who put their lives on the line, they did  nothing and let them die. We will never forget.
