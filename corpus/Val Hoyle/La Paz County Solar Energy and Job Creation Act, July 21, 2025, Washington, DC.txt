La Paz County Solar Energy and Job Creation Act

I rise in support of H.R. 1043, the La Paz County Solar Energy and  Job Creation Act, introduced by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).

This bill would allow the Department of the Interior to convey  approximately 3,400 acres of BLM land in La Paz County in Arizona for  renewable energy generation and energy storage. La Paz County has  significant solar energy potential and is working to develop the  largest solar installation in the United States.

This project represents a step toward our clean energy future and  underscores the support for renewable energy development and  infrastructure, particularly at the State and local level.

H.R. 1043, led by Congressman Gosar and Arizona Senators Gallego and  Kelly, reflect the kind of bipartisan cooperation we need more of in  Congress.

After Republicans' reckless budget bill rolled back critical  renewable energy programs, I hope this bill signals at least a partial  recognition that in America we must keep building, not dismantling our  clean energy capacity where possible.

The legislation will help power thousands of homes with affordable,  reliable energy, support the creation of good-paying jobs, and boost  local economy all while reinforcing our commitment to energy  independence.

Importantly, this bill ensures that the Colorado River Indian Tribes  and the Tribal Historic Preservation Office are actively consulted to  protect any culturally significant artifacts. This is the right way to  approach land transfers: collaborative, respectful, and forward  thinking.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bipartisan,  future-focused bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
