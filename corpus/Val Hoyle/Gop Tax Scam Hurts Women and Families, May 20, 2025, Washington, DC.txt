Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, Medicaid is a critical and  important safety net and a provider of affordable, accessible,  appropriate healthcare, especially in the rural communities I  represent.

Today, I will share a story of Florence from North Bend, Oregon. She  is a mother, a caregiver, and a fighter. She lives with a rare  neuromuscular disease, myasthenia gravis, a rare form of angioedema.

For her, Medicaid isn't just a safety net, it is a lifeline. It  covers the critical treatment and specialist care that keep her out of  the ER and out of the ICU. Beyond that, it allows her to be there for  the people who count on her most. Because Medicaid helps her manage her  health, Florence is able to raise her 10-year-old daughter and care for  her elderly parents. Her mother who has heart failure and COPD, and her  father, who has serious health challenges of his own, were able to age  in their homes.

Without Medicaid, this entire support system would collapse.  Taxpayers would pay more to support all of them, and their family would  be broken. This is what is at stake.

Mr. Speaker, Medicaid isn't just about individual coverage. It is the  backbone of family stability across the country; for Florence, for her  daughter, for her parents, and for millions of families like theirs. We  must protect and strengthen Medicaid. Lives and futures depend on it.
