Amendment to Kaweah Project Provision


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693462/amendment-to-kaweah-project-provision


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1044 introduced by my  colleague Representative Valadao of California.

This bill would allow the Secretary of the Interior to issue  additional permit renewals for the Kaweah Project, a hydroelectric  facility that operates within the boundaries of Sequoia National Park.  The Kaweah Project has been generating clean, renewable energy since  1907. Although it was originally granted a 50-year permit, the  boundaries of the Sequoia National Park were later expanded in 1943,  bringing portions of the project, such as flow lines and diversions,  within park lands. Since the project predated the park, it was allowed  to continue operating.

In 2004, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to issue  up to three permit renewals with reasonable safeguards to ensure the  project's continued operation wouldn't harm the park.

These include prohibiting any expansion of the project within the  park, requiring safety assessment, and appropriate compensation for the  use of public resources.

H.R. 1044 would build on that responsible approach. By allowing the  Secretary to continue renewing permits for the Kaweah Project under the  same protective conditions, this bill allows continued hydropower  generation while upholding our responsibility to protect the park for  future generations.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
