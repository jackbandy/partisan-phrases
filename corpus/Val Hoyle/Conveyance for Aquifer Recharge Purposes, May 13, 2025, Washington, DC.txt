Conveyance for Aquifer Recharge Purposes


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1691130/conveyance-for-aquifer-recharge-purposes


Mr. Speaker, H.R. 331 would amend the Aquifer Recharge Flexibility  Act to allow third parties to utilize an existing right-of-way,  easement, permit, or other authorization for aquifer recharge without  further authorization from the Secretary of the Interior.

Underground aquifers play a key role in sustaining water supplies for  groundwater-dependent irrigation, municipal water use, and ecosystems.  This is especially important in areas experiencing drought and  constrained surface supplies.

This bill will support aquifer recharge projects, in turn,  strengthening water security.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
