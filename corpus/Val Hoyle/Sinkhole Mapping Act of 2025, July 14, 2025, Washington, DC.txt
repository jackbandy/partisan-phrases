Sinkhole Mapping Act of 2025

I am excited to see Representative Darren Soto's Sinkhole Mapping Act  on the floor today. This bipartisan legislation will direct the U.S.  Geological Survey to study both the short- and long-term causes of  sinkholes, including extreme weather events, droughts, and groundwater  depletion.

Right now, there is no national, comprehensive mapping to track and  predict sinkholes, leaving communities across the country more  vulnerable to sudden and serious damage. Sinkholes can open without  warning and wreak havoc on our infrastructure, damaging roads, bridges,  buildings, and utilities and putting people's lives and livelihoods at  risk.

We have seen this firsthand on the Oregon coast at Cape Kiwanda,  where ocean wave erosion has carved into the sandstone. In 2023, two  sinkholes appeared there measuring up to 25-feet wide and 30-feet deep  each.

Thankfully, State and local officials acted quickly, identified the  problem, and put safety precautions in place to protect the public.

With effective sinkhole mapping, we can do even more. We can identify  at-risk areas before disaster strikes and take preventive action, like  ground stabilization, to protect lives and reduce the cost of damage.

This bill is a commonsense, forward-looking investment in our  communities and infrastructure, especially as climate change increases  the risk of sinkholes across the country.

I thank my colleagues, Representatives Soto and Bilirakis, for  introducing this bill and their leadership on this issue.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 900, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
