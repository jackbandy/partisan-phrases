We Will Not Back Down

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. This weekend, President Trump put out a social  media post conflating the actions of a small group of people who broke  a window, broke a couple of windows, at the Federal building, with the  thousands of peaceful protesters that were exercising their  constitutional right to fight against fascism, their constitutionally  protected right to assemble, to free speech, and stated that he would  send in his Federal goons to Eugene.

Let me tell you: Eugene, Oregon, has a long tradition of speaking  out, speaking out and showing up for peace. We will continue to do so.

I would ask President Trump, Kristi Noem, and the DOJ to follow their  own rules and not use the excuses of a couple of people who did wrong  to tear gas and attack peaceful protesters, not in Eugene. We will not  back down.

Thank you, President Trump. We don't need Federal help. We have got  it. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
