Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act


Mr. Speaker, H.R. 504 would amend the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act to  expand the boundaries of the Miccosukee Reserved Area within the  Everglades National Park. This expansion would ensure that the  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida can access the Osceola Camp, a  historic Tribal village that was, unfortunately, excluded from the  original reserved area, without requiring the Tribe to obtain special  use permits.

H.R. 504 would also direct the Department of the Interior to  implement needed flood control measures to protect homes and structures  within this village.

For centuries, the Miccosukee Tribe's way of life has been challenged  through forced relocation, damage to wetland drainage projects, and the  need to acquire special use permits to reside in their own villages.

In 1998, Congress established the Miccosukee Reserved Area, granting  the Tribe rights to much of their ancestral lands within the park while  supporting environmental restoration. However, not all of the Tribe's  villages were included within the reserved area.

H.R. 504 would correct this oversight by incorporating Osceola Camp  into the reserved area, a critical step toward honoring Tribal  sovereignty, addressing ongoing governance concerns and environmental  challenges.

This bill underscores the importance of righting historical wrongs  and supporting Tribal communities.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
