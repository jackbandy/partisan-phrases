I rise today in support of H.R. 410, a bill that would extend the  Alaska Native Vietnam era veterans land allotment program until 2030,  giving those brave men and women who served in the Vietnam war  additional time to apply for and claim the land allotments that they  were promised.

In 1906, Congress passed the Alaska Native Allotment Act to provide  individual Alaska Natives up to 160-acre allotments. However, this law  was later repealed with the passage of the Alaska Native Claims  Settlement Act in 1971. While many Alaska Natives were able to apply  for allotments prior to the ANCSA, others were unable to due to their  active military service at the time.

To correct the issue, Congress established the Alaska Native Vietnam  era veterans land allotment program in 2019. Under the program, Alaska  Native Vietnam-era veterans who served between 1964 and 1971 and had  not previously received an allotment, or their heirs, were deemed  eligible to apply.

Despite the number of veterans still eligible to apply, the program  is set to expire in December of this year. By extending the program  through 2030, Congress will reinforce our support for Native  communities and give eligible Alaska Native veterans the time they need  to apply for the land that they are entitled to.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
