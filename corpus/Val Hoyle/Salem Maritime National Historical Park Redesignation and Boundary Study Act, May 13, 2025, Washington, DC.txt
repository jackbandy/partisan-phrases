Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Salem Maritime National  Historical Park Redesignation and Boundary Study Act introduced by the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).

This bill would redesignate the Salem Maritime National Historic Site  in Salem, Massachusetts, as the Salem Maritime National Historical  Park, and it would require a study into including additional sites and  resources.

The Salem Maritime National Historic Site preserves more than 600  years of our history, documenting the development of international  maritime trade and the journey to American economic independence  following the Revolutionary War.

Due to the importance of preserving the maritime history of New  England, Congress chose to designate a piece of the Salem waterfront as  the country's first national historic site in 1938. The site has since  grown to nine acres of land, 12 historic structures, and a visitors  center hosting an average of over 300,000 visitors per year.

The bill before us today would redesignate the site to more  accurately reflect the scope, scale, and significance of the resources  managed there by the National Park Service.

Mr. Speaker, this is an important update to an important historical  resource, and I thank Representative Moulton for his leadership on this  bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
