Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, S. 1596 will codify the renaming of  the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge in Texas to honor the memory of  12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray.

Wildlife refuges are more than places to protect our environment.  They are places where so many young people are inspired to build a  lifelong connection to nature and develop a sense of stewardship for  the world around them.

Jocelyn Nungaray was one of those young people. She loved animals and  the outdoors. Her life was tragically taken far too soon. This  legislation ensures that her love for wildlife and the natural world  will be remembered and honored forever at one of our Nation's most  important coastal conservation areas.

Spanning 39,000 acres along Texas' Gulf Coast, this refuge is a vital  sanctuary for migratory waterfowl, endangered species, and countless  other wildlife. Now, it will also stand as a lasting tribute to  Jocelyn's spirit and the values she held dear.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 1596  and help preserve Jocelyn's legacy in a place that reflects the beauty  and wonder she saw in the world. I hope that this will bring her family  some semblance of peace.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
