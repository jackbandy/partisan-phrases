Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1612, the Flatside Wilderness  Additions Act, introduced by my colleague from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).

This bill would expand the boundaries of the Flatside Wilderness Area  in the Ouachita National Forest by approximately 2,212 acres and  redesignate the area as the Flatside-Bethune Wilderness.

Representative Bethune represented Arkansas here in the House of  Representatives, and he was a strong champion for conservation. He  sponsored the first bill to designate the Flatside Wilderness back in  1984, so the redesignation included in this bill is a fitting tribute.

Wilderness areas hold immense importance for a variety of reasons.  They support and provide essential ecosystem services, including clean  air, water, carbon sequestration, and critical wildlife habitat.

Protecting the wilderness is not just about preserving pristine  environments. It is also about safeguarding our national heritage and  ensuring a healthy planet for future generations.

I thank Representative Hill for his work on expanding the wilderness  area in his State. I and many of my Democratic colleagues also have  bills we would like to advance to provide conservation protections for  special areas in our congressional districts. This bill demonstrates  that we can and should work in a bipartisan manner to protect and  conserve public lands.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
