Benefits That Endure for Lifetimes of Service Act

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1682, a crucial measure that  would guarantee free access to our national treasures for all Gold Star  families.

To honor the sacrifice and service of their loved ones, Congress has  provided Gold Star families with a free America the Beautiful pass that  covers entrance fees and standard day-use fees for national parks and  other Federal recreation sites.

However, eligibility for this program is limited and leaves some  families out because of a technicality. This bill would fix that  oversight by broadening access to include families of servicemembers  who died during inactive or Active-Duty training, as well as travel to  and from training or duty stations.

These families have already made the ultimate sacrifice for our  country, and they deserve for us to fix this technicality. I thank  Representative Evans for bringing this forward and everyone who worked  on this in a bipartisan way to make this happen.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
