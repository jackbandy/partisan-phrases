Protect Children's Innocence Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1698358/protect-childrens-innocence-act


Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Madam Speaker, today, we are not voting to  reduce the cost of healthcare or make groceries or housing more  affordable or to take back the power of Congress from the executive  branch in determining tariffs or deciding whether or not we should  invade a sovereign nation.

We are voting today on inserting government into private medical  decisions. To listen to my Republican colleagues, you would think there  is an epidemic of children being forced into unnecessary gender- affirming care. There is not.

The epidemics killing our children are drug addiction, overdoses, gun  violence, and preventable diseases like measles. Let's work on that.

Banning doctors from providing healthcare to transgender young people  has serious unintended consequences. Politicians are getting in the way  of doctors, who have years of training and experience and are  practicing according to professional standards of care. They know what  is best for their patients. This is their area of expertise, not ours.

Providing care and advice is a doctor's job. Taking care of your  children  is a parent's duty. Let's keep it that way.

I am proudly voting ``no.'' I ask my colleagues to do the same.
