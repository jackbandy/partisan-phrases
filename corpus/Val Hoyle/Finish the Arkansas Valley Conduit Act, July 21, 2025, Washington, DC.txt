Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693877/finish-the-arkansas-valley-conduit-act


H.R. 131 seeks to address a longstanding water challenge in  southeastern Colorado. The Arkansas Valley Conduit is a 130-mile  pipeline first authorized in 1962 to deliver water from the Pueblo  Reservoir to communities facing ongoing water supply and quality  issues. Despite decades of work, the project remains unfinished,  primarily due to financial constraints.

This bill would revise certain repayment terms to provide additional  flexibility for local stakeholders to help finance the project and  begin delivering clean, reliable water to rural communities.

My Democratic colleagues and I are committed to addressing the  barrier that rural communities face in securing clean water. That is  why we passed historic water infrastructure investments under the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.

Since 2022, the IIJA has provided $500 million for the Arkansas  Valley Conduit. These investments are critical for ensuring communities  across the West have reliable access to clean drinking water,  especially as climate change is continuing to make drought conditions  worse.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Boebert, for  bringing this forward. I urge support for H.R. 131, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
