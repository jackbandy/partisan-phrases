Expanding Social Security

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, my district has more Social  Security recipients than 87 percent of the congressional districts  nationwide. Back home I heard a clear, urgent message from seniors.  They are scared because Social Security and Medicaid are not luxuries.  They are lifelines.

They are earned benefits, not handouts, and now they are at great  risk because DOGE-led staff cuts are making it impossible to get  through and are breaking the agency.

I introduced the Social Security Expansion Act with Representative  Schakowsky, Senator Sanders, and Senator Warren because we believe in  protecting the promise of Social Security is our duty.

Our bill would increase benefits by over $2,400 a year and extend the  life of the program by 75 years, all without costing 91 percent of  Americans one cent more.

We owe that to the seniors who built this country and to future  generations who deserve the same dignity in retirement.
