Recognizing 2025 As ``A Chorus Year''

Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to speak in celebration of a  group of workers and artists who entertain live audiences in every  state across the country: the theatrical chorus. I am pleased to  recognize 2025 as ``A Chorus Year.''

From Oklahoma! to Hamilton, some of the greatest art to come out of  the United States has been musical theatre, and a staple of this art  form is the chorus.

The chorus has always been more than a group of singers and dancers  filling up a stage. It is an integral part of theatrical storytelling,  as well as a major player in labor history. The historic actors strike  of 1919 that established union protections for live performers  succeeded in large part because of the women and men of the chorus who  formed their own union and walked off Broadway stages in large numbers  to join the fight.

And 2025 is a particularly auspicious year to celebrate the chorus.  This year marks the 70th anniversary of the merger between Chorus  Equity Association and Actors' Equity Association into the Equity that  exists today, protecting the rights of actors and stage managers in  live theatre across the U.S.

I want to recognize not only the talent of chorus performers, but  their great skilled labor and tireless work ethic. They make it all  look easy, but their ongoing contribution to American culture and a  healthy entertainment industry is born of fierce commitment and  dedication to their craft. They exemplify the best of America: many  people working as individuals to build something amazing together.
