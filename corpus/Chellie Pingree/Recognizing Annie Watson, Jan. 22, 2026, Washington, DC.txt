Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize Annie  Watson as the 2026 recipient of the Maine Department of Agriculture,  Conservation and Forestry Commissioner's Distinguished Service Award.  This recognition honors Annie's remarkable leadership and service in  Maine's agricultural community.

Since opening an organic dairy farm in Whitefield with her husband,  Michael Moody, in 2013, Annie has dedicated her life to building strong  and resilient local food systems in our state. She is currently  President of the Maine Dairy Industry Association and has served in  leadership roles of the Northeast Organic Family Farm Partnership,  Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, and the Agricultural  Council of Maine.

There are many challenges that come with operating a small farm-- brutal physical work, tight budgets, long hours, unpredictable  weather--the list goes on. This work demands adaptability,  determination, and resilience. Annie exemplifies all these traits and  more. She is a leader. She has not only grown a successful dairy  business but uplifted the voices of farmers across Maine and the  Northeast through her advocacy.

Annie recognizes the interconnectedness of our farms and communities,  and has steadfastly devoted herself to strengthening these ties,  carrying on Maine's agricultural legacy, and bolstering our food system  and economy.

In the words of Annie herself, ``Maine farms are not just part of our  scenery--they are part of our soul.'' We are so lucky to have her  leadership in our state. I thank Annie for all her work to empower our  farming community and feed Maine's soul.
