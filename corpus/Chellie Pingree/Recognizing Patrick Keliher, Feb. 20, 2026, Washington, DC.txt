Recognizing Patrick Keliher


Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize  Patrick Keliher as the 2025 recipient of the Atlantic States Marine  Fisheries Commission's Captain David H. Hart Award. This recognition  honors Pat's remarkable leadership and contributions toward improving  Atlantic Coast marine fisheries.

As former Commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources,  Pat spearheaded countless initiatives--from restoring passage for sea- run fish species like Atlantic salmon to rebuilding working waterfront  properties after historic storms ravaged our coast. His efforts have  strengthened our environment, commercial fisheries, and coastal  communities.

While Commissioner, Pat engaged stakeholders on some of the toughest  issues facing our state. He worked diligently to understand the  concerns of Maine's fishing communities and translate those concerns  and recommendations into public policy. He skillfully facilitated a  pause on federal whale regulations and continuously explored  opportunities to protect Maine's heritage lobster industry, while  securing funding for broader fisheries and marine mammal research.  Further, he helped steer Maine's fisheries and marine economy through  crisis during the pandemic.

Pat embodies transformative public service. His tireless work ethic,  commitment to the health of our coast and coastal economy, and  collaboration across industries have made our state a better place in  innumerable ways. I could not imagine a more deserving recipient of  this honor.

I commend Pat for his unparalleled career of service and congratulate  him on this award.
