Warning to Scarlett Wilson


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1695274/warning-to-scarlett-wilson


Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, when solicitors don't prosecute crimes, when  judges and rogue magistrates let thugs out on the streets of America,  cases like Iryna Zarutska happen, murders like Iryna Zarutska happen.

I want to pay special attention to a certain solicitor in South  Carolina who is not doing her job, who is lying to South Carolinians,  and that is Solicitor Scarlett Wilson of the Ninth Judicial Circuit.

Scarlett, I want you to know that I am watching. When you leak  evidence, when you politicize rape, when you leak evidence of rape  victims, and when you leak evidence of victims who are being stalked or  who have been beaten, South Carolina is watching. I am watching. If you  don't do your job to protect South Carolinians, there will be  consequences.
