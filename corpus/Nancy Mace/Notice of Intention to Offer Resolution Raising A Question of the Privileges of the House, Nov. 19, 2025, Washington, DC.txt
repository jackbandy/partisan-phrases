Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I rise  to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges of  the House.

The form of the resolution is as follows:

Censuring Representative Cory Mills of Florida and removing him from  the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

Whereas prior to serving in the House of Representatives,  Representative Cory Mills founded PACEM Solutions International, LLC,  and PACEM Defense, LLC, and acquired AMTEC Corporation, now renamed as  ALS, Inc., companies which engage in security and military contracting  with the United States Government, as well as foreign nations;

Whereas in August 2024, the Office of Congressional Conduct found:  From January 2023 to present, PACEM Defense/ALS has been actively  contracting with the Federal Government, securing close to $1 million  in Federal contracts for munitions and weapons, distributed to prisons  across the country. Specifically, since January 9, 2024, 94 contracts  have been awarded to entities owned by Representative Mills and went on  to conclude that there is substantial reason to believe that  Representative Mills may have entered into, held, or enjoyed contracts  with Federal agencies while he was a Member of Congress in violation of  House rules, standards of conduct, and Federal law;

Whereas in August 2024, the Office of Congressional Conduct noted:  According to its website, PACEM Solutions is currently registered and/ or partnered  with trusted local firms to work in the following countries: United  States, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, UAE, Australia, Kenya, Malaysia,  and Kuwait. Public reports indicate companies owned by Representative  Mills sought or entered into contracts to sell munitions to foreign  nations while serving as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs  and on the Committee on Armed Services;

Whereas entities owned by Representative Mills seeking or entering  into contracts to sell munitions to the United States Government as  well as foreign nations while he serves as a member of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs and Committee on Armed Services represents a clear and  troubling conflict of interest;

Whereas in August 2024, the Office of Congressional Conduct further  adopted and transmitted to the Committee on Ethics of the House of  Representatives a report indicating that there was substantial reason  to believe that Representative Cory Mills may have omitted or  misrepresented required information in his financial disclosure  statements, accepted excessive contributions to his campaign committee  in the form of personal loans and contributions that may not have  derived from Representative Cory Mills' personal funds, and may have  accepted through his campaign committee in-kind contributions or other  contributions not lawfully made;

Whereas individuals who served in the military with Representative  Cory Mills have called into question the veracity of the account of  events which formed the basis of a recommendation that Representative  Cory Mills receive an award of a Bronze Star, bestowed in 2021 or  afterwards, for his service under enemy fire in Iraq in 2003;

Whereas in August 2024, Representative Cory Mills provided The  Daytona Beach News with documents purporting to prove that he earned a  Bronze Star with heroism, including a Department of the Army Form 638  recommending Representative Cory Mills for a Bronze Star, which  includes a signature from then-Army Brigade Commander Arnold N. Gordon- Bray;

Whereas Retired Army Brigadier General Arnold N. Gordon-Bray has  stated he did not personally write, read, or sign the Department of the  Army Form 638 recommending Representative Cory Mills for a Bronze Star;

Whereas five people who served with Representative Cory Mills,  including two men who were reported as having been personally saved by  Representative Cory Mills at great risk to his own life as a basis for  the recommendation for his Bronze Star in the Department of the Army  Form 638, disputed that Representative Cory Mills was involved in their  rescue or provided lifesaving care;

Whereas one private first class cited as having been involved in one  of the listed achievements on Representative Cory Mills' Army Form 638  recommending him for a Bronze Star denied that Representative Cory  Mills provided him any aid and also denied that his injuries were life- threatening;

Whereas one sergeant cited as having been involved in one of the  listed achievements on Representative Cory Mills' Army Form 638  recommending him for a Bronze Star called the account a fabrication and  claimed that he was not involved in any claims that Cory Mills makes  about me;

Whereas Representative Cory Mills' employment application to DynCorp  International stated he served in the United States Army 75th Ranger  Regiment and attended United States Army Sniper School, claims which  are not corroborated in his military records;

Whereas on February 19, 2025, Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police  Department officers were called to resolve a private matter at  Representative Cory Mills' residence, where officers were called to the  1300 block of Maryland Avenue, SW, around 1:15 p.m. for the report of  an assault;

Whereas police reports obtained by NBC4 Washington confirmed that the  Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department was investigating  Representative Cory Mills for an alleged assault of a 27-year-old woman  that took place on February 19, 2025, at the residence of  Representative Cory Mills;

Whereas the first police report provided to NBC4 Washington by a  source and confirmed by a second source familiar with the investigation  said that the 27-year-old woman accused her significant other for over  a year of having grabbed her, shoved her, and pushed her out the door,  and also said that the woman involved showed the officer bruises on her  arm which appeared fresh;

Whereas NBC4 Washington also reported that the Metropolitan Police  Department identified Representative Cory Mills as the significant  other of the alleged victim of assault, which alleged victim was a 27- year-old woman who was not the wife of Representative Cory Mills, and  that the alleged victim let officers hear Subject 1--now identified by  MPD as Mills--instruct her to lie about the origin of her bruises.  Eventually, Subject 1 made contact with the police and admitted that  the situation escalated from verbal to physical, but it was severe  enough to create bruising.

Whereas on February 21, 2025, The Washington Post also confirmed two  D.C. police officials said that the alleged victim of assault initially  told a 9/11 operator and police that she had been assaulted and that  officers said she also had what seemed to be visible injuries, and that  while a supervisor initially classified the offense internally as a  family disturbance, police commanders later learned of the incident,  reviewed the reports and body camera footage from the responding  officers, and reclassified the case as a domestic violence assault;

Whereas on February 21, 2025, NBC4 Washington also reported that the  Metropolitan Police Department determined that probable cause to arrest  Representative Cory Mills for misdemeanor assault existed and sent an  arrest warrant for Representative Cory Mills to the United States  Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia;

Whereas on July 14, 2025, a different former romantic partner of  Representative Cory Mills, who was apparently in a relationship with  Representative Mills from November 2021 to February 2025, reported to  authorities in Florida that Representative Mills threatened to release  nude images and other intimate videos of her and threatened to harm her  future romantic partners in retaliation for her decision to end a  relationship with Representative Mills after seeing the public reports  described above concerning the alleged February 2025 physical assault;

Whereas on October 14, 2025, the Circuit Court of the Third Judicial  Circuit in Columbia County, Florida, issued a Final Judgment of  Injunction for Protection Against Dating Violence against  Representative Cory Mills, based on a finding that his former romantic  partner was a victim of dating violence or had reasonable cause to  believe she was in imminent danger of becoming a victim of an act of  dating violence; and

Whereas such conduct by Representative Cory Mills affects the dignity  and integrity of the proceedings of the House and brings discredit upon  the House: Now, therefore, be it resolved, that:

(1) Representative Cory Mills be censured;

(2) Representative Cory Mills forthwith present himself in the well  of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure;

(3) Representative Cory Mills be censured with a public reading of  this resolution by the Speaker; and

(4) Representative Cory Mills be, and is hereby, removed from the  Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the  House.
