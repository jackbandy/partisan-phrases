Federal Contractor Cybersecurity Vulnerability Reduction Act of 2025


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688359/federal-contractor-cybersecurity-vulnerability-reduction-act-of-2025


Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and the distinguished  chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer), for yielding. I thank both the  chairman and the ranking member, Mr. Connolly, for their leadership on  this critical issue, not only in this congressional session but the  last one, as well.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 872, the  Federal Contractor Cybersecurity Vulnerability Reduction Act.

In 2020, the Office of Management and Budget directed Federal  agencies to implement cybersecurity vulnerability disclosure policies.  These policies enable third-party researchers and white hat hackers to  work with the Federal Government to proactively identify and patch  vulnerabilities in information systems before a cyberattack takes  place.

Mr. Speaker, we all know how critically important it is, particularly  with systems that are older than some of us in this room, that these  vulnerability disclosure policies require these third parties to notify  the Federal agency of any sensitive data they encounter, like  personally identifiable information, financial information, proprietary  information, or trade secrets.

This allows cybersecurity vulnerability to be addressed and data to  be secured before it is exploited by malign actors, including our  adversaries. My colleagues know that malign actors affiliated with  China, Russia, Iran, and others are after us all day, every day, 365  days a year.

These vulnerability disclosure policies are critical to preventing  cyberattacks on Federal systems.

This is an important step in Federal cybersecurity, but the work of  Federal agencies is supplemented by millions of contractors working on  behalf of Federal departments and agencies. The Federal Government  awards over 11 million contracts annually, with many of those  contractors having access to Federal systems and vast amounts of  sensitive information, including personally identifiable information of  American citizens.

My bill, the Federal Contractor Cybersecurity Vulnerability Reduction  Act, will require the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, to  oversee updates to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to ensure that  Federal contractors with access to Federal systems or who work with  Federal data adopt these vulnerability disclosure policies, as well.

My bill also requires the Secretary of Defense to update the Defense  Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to require the same  cybersecurity vulnerability disclosure policies, safeguarding the  personal information of our servicemembers and the information vital to  our national security.

These updates shall be done consistent with the guidelines and best  practices developed by the National Institute of Standards and  Technology and simply require contractors to abide by the same  cybersecurity standards as Federal agencies.

Federal contractors with access to government systems and data should  have the same safeguards in place as the government itself, ensuring  that Federal systems and data are protected and that security  vulnerabilities are addressed.

Adoption of vulnerability disclosure policies by government  contractors will help protect the sensitive data of American citizens  and our national security.

My bill would close a crucial vulnerability and protect our Nation  from malicious actors who seek to steal our data and harm our citizens.

Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to see this bill passed out of the  Oversight and Government Reform Committee unanimously last year by a  vote of 42-0. It is long past time we get this done. Until these  vulnerability disclosure policies are adopted across the entire Federal  digital ecosystem, our Nation's data and security are at risk.

Mr. Speaker, before I urge my colleagues to support this bill, I will  say I walked into the Chamber this afternoon moments ago, and I saw a  tweet or a post on X from South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson,  who said his protecting South Carolinians from sexual predators is a  top priority. Protecting citizens of this country has been my top  priority since the day I was ever sworn into office, particularly my  constituents whom I represent.

I recently gave a speech on this floor where I was very detailed  about horrific abuses I have experienced. When you talk about  vulnerabilities, I know about being vulnerable.

When you talk about cybersecurity, I sit awake in my bed every single  night wondering if anyone has ever seen those videos of me or any of  the other women in the tapes that I outlined in my speech.

In the last 3 weeks since I came forward and gave that speech on the  floor, my attorney general, Alan Wilson--and I am going to make sure  every South Carolinian knows your name forever, not just for what you  did but for what you have not done, your inaction on vulnerabilities of  my own constituents in my district in South Carolina. You have done  nothing in the last 3 weeks except attack me, a Member of Congress,  who, in my duty, did my duty to protect her constituents.

I will keep fighting for every American citizen whether it is in this  bill about vulnerability disclosure policy and Federal Government. I  will do it for rape victims not just in my district, but in my State  and in my country. I will do it because I care. I swore an oath to the  Constitution to serve my constituents, to serve my State, and to serve  my Nation every possible way that I can.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to take cyber threats by malign  actors seriously. I urge my colleagues to protect the security of  Americans' data. I urge my colleagues to do whatever we can in this  Chamber to protect people who are vulnerable, whether we are talking  about data or we are talking about rape victims, sex trafficking, all  those things.

Victims should not be attacked ever, and I am one of those victims. I  am tired of being attacked by the attorney general. I am tired of being  blamed for being a rape victim and being a victim of Peeping Toms and  voyeurism, same with these other victims. I am tired of it. I will not  stand for it, not in this Chamber, not in my State, and not back home.

Attorney General Alan Wilson, I hope you have your No. 2 pencil out,  and I hope you are taking notes. I hope that pencil is sharpened  because, once I get my teeth stuck in you, I am not letting go. I will  fight for every woman and girl across this country all day every day  always.
