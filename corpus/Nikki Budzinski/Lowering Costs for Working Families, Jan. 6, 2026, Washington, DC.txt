Lowering Costs for Working Families

Ms. BUDZINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of lowering costs  for working families in my district who deserve better than to be  ripped off by big corporations.

Last month, the Guardian exposed dollar stores for quietly  overcharging customers. The report found evidence of a systematic scam  where companies like Dollar General and Family Dollar leave the wrong  price tags on products and hope that customers don't notice when it  rings up higher at the register.

That is just wrong, especially when dollar stores are sometimes the  only nearby option for everyday items.

States have tried to crack down on this practice, but often the  penalties aren't enough to deter the practice.

That is why I led 29 Members of Congress in a letter to Dollar  General and Family Dollar to hold them accountable.

Because when inflation is crushing families, we won't let big  corporations squeeze people who are just trying to get by.
