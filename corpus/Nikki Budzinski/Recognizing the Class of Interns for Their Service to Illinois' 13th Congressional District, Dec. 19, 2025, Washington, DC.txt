Recognizing the Class of Interns for Their Service to Illinois' 13th Congressional District


Ms. BUDZINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the wonderful  class of interns who served in my office during the fall 2025 semester.  Their incredible dedication to public service and commitment to  learning has been truly inspirational, and the contributions they have  made to Illinois' 13th Congressional District have left a significant  impact.

In my Washington Office, I was honored to work alongside Henry  Scriven-Young, Carter Wood, Maurice Mueller, Ally Denton, and Ethan  J.S.H. Reed. These five interns have worked tirelessly to support my  staff and have done an excellent job navigating the turbulent nature of  Congress. Especially during a government shutdown, when their time with  my office was cut short, these five individuals have shown an immense  desire to learn and serve others, regardless of the circumstance.

Back in Illinois, I was proud to work with Keziah Gragg in my  Springfield Office and Addison Merritt and Ryan Miller in my Champaign  Office. Especially following a turbulent government shutdown, these  three interns played an integral role in supporting constituents from  Central and Southern Illinois to obtain much needed assistance from the  federal government. Their commitment to constituent service by  assisting my casework team has been amazing to see, and I am so proud  of the work they have accomplished serving the people of Illinois' 13th  Congressional District.

The impact that these individuals had on my office will be felt for  years to come, and we will be very sad to say farewell to this amazing  group of interns. I thank Henry, Carter, Maurice, Ally, Ethan, Keziah,  Addison, and Ryan, for their service. I wish them all the best as they  continue their professional and academic journeys.
