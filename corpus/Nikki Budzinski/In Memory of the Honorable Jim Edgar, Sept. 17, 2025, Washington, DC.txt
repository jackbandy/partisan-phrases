Ms. BUDZINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the incredible life  of former Illinois Governor Jim Edgar.

Governor Edgar was a mentor and a true public servant, but most of  all, he was a dear friend.

As a graduate of the University of Illinois' Edgar Fellows Program, I  had the privilege of seeing firsthand how Governor Edgar brought people  together. He had a rare gift for bridging divides, encouraging voices  from all perspectives, and helping us discover common ground on even  the most difficult issues.

Governor Edgar led Illinois with integrity, compassion, and an  unwavering commitment to the people of our State.

Governor Edgar was a voice of reason, a champion of civility, and an  unwavering advocate for collaboration.

In today's era of division and political turmoil, his example of  steady leadership and his voice of wisdom will be profoundly missed.  His passing is a loss felt across the political spectrum and throughout  Illinois.

Mr. Speaker, my thoughts are with his wonderful family, especially  Brenda, Brad, and Elizabeth, along with our entire State, as we mourn  his passing and celebrate his extraordinary life.
