Ms. BUDZINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Clear  Communication for Veterans Claims Act, bipartisan legislation that  would simplify the Department of Veterans Affairs' correspondence for  our Nation's heroes. I am proud to lead this bill with Chairman  Tom  Barrett, who I serve with on the House Veterans' Affairs Technology  Modernization Subcommittee.

Every day, my office hears from veterans who are struggling to get  the benefits that they earned because of overcomplicated documents and  bureaucratic red tape. Correspondence from the VA regarding benefits  decisions, often called notice letters, usually contain complex legal  jargon, which can be confusing, frustrating, and stressful for veterans  and their families.

The Clear Communication for Veterans Claims Act is a commonsense  solution to this problem. This legislation would require the VA to  study and provide recommendations for simplifying VA notice letters.  The goal is to make these letters shorter, easier to understand, and  more comprehensive so veterans have the information they need for the  next step in their claims process.

Our veterans have sacrificed so much in service to our Nation, and we  must do more to improve access to the critical services they need and  deserve. Right now, our veterans are facing great uncertainty and  anxiety. This bill would make a real change in their lives. We owe it  to them now more than ever before.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important  bill.
