Ms. BUDZINSKI. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship Opportunity Act.

With the start of the new school year, the time is now to pass this  bipartisan legislation that will help student veterans who are training  for high-demand STEM fields.

I thank my colleague on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Congressman  Hamadeh, for his collaboration and partnership on this bill. I also  thank our veterans for their service and sacrifice.

Madam Speaker, this bill removes barriers for student veterans  seeking a STEM education by modifying eligibility requirements for the  Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship.

This scholarship has proven crucial to getting more veterans involved  in STEM fields, but feedback from veterans in a 2022 GAO report has  shown that current eligibility requirements are barriers for many of  our student veterans.

The Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship Opportunity Act would  address these barriers by lowering the minimum number of credit hours  required. It would also allow student veterans to apply for the  scholarship before their post-9/11 GI Bill benefits run out.

This would allow for a smooth transition of funding for their  education. They have so greatly served us. It is time for us to serve  them.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
