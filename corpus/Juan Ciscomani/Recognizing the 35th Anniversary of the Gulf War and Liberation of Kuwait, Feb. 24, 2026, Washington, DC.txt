Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and recognize the 35th  anniversary of the Gulf War and liberation of Kuwait.

Each year, a ceremony to commemorate this anniversary is held at the  Arizona Heroes Memorial in Oro Valley.

While I cannot join in person this year, I would like to take this  time to honor those who served in our armed forces in the Gulf War and  fought to bring peace to the nation of Kuwait.

I thank each veteran who served in these operations. Their dedication  to our Nation and the fight for peace is remembered every day and will  never be taken for granted.

It is because of men and women like themselves that we are able to  live in a free country.

We know that freedom is not free. Our freedom has been fought for by  countless men and women who have answered the call.

I thank every veteran who served in the Gulf War, including Desert  Storm, or the liberation of Kuwait for their fearless and selfless  decision to fight so that freedom may reign.

I thank each man and woman who lost their life fighting in these  operations for their love of country and willingness to lay it all on  the line to keep our Nation safe. They paid the ultimate price, and  their sacrifice will not be forgotten.

Saying ``thank you'' is nowhere near sufficient, but these two words  are our best attempt at expressing our utmost gratitude for their  heroic acts in service to our Nation.
