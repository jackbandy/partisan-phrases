Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  3579, the Veterans Readiness and Employment Program Integrity Act. This  bipartisan bill ensures that veterans have the tools and resources they  need to successfully transition to civilian life.

This legislation does so by providing much-needed oversight over the  VA's Veteran Readiness and Employment program, which offers specific  job training and counseling to veterans with a service-connected  disability. This bill requires the VA to track employment outcomes and  wait times for participants in order for us to know if this program is  fulfilling its core mission, and it enables better evaluation of all  tracks in the VR&E so that we can do a better job in understanding what  is working and also what is not working.

Far too many veterans wait for months just to meet with a program  counselor. I have heard this over and over again in my district. Far  too many leave programs without confidence that they have the skills to  have a stable civilian career. This bill fixes that.

It is not about giveaways, it is about getting return on our  investment in veterans, in dignity, in opportunity, in real jobs. It is  about ensuring our veterans transition with the resources that they  need, not just to survive, but to thrive.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote  in support of H.R. 3579. Stand behind our veterans not just with words  but with this important oversight, with accountability, and especially  with action.
