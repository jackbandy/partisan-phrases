Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  3951, the Rural Veterans' Improved Access to Benefits Act of 2025.

This bipartisan bill aims to ensure rural veterans have access to  quality and timely physician examinations so that they are able to  receive the care they are entitled to, regardless of where they live.

This legislation does this by permanently allowing VA providers to  perform cross-State disability exams and expanding the pool of  providers who can perform medical disability examinations for the VA to  include all licensed healthcare professionals.

These changes will help to address the shortage of qualified  examiners in rural areas, specifically thereby reducing wait times and  increasing the timely release of benefits to our veterans.

I have witnessed firsthand the challenges rural veterans in Arizona's  Sixth Congressional District face in getting their medical exams  completed in a timely manner.

This bill takes an essential first step toward eliminating these  regional healthcare disparities and ensures that all veterans receive  the quality care they deserve.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to vote in support of H.R.  3951. We owe it to our servicemen and -women to make this commitment to  timely healthcare access.
