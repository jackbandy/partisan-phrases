Removing Our Unsecure Technologies to Ensure Reliability and Security Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 866, the Removing Our Unsecure  Technologies to Ensure Reliability and Security Act, or the ROUTERS  Act.

This legislation is an important step to provide Americans with the  confidence to trust that the devices they use in their homes to connect  to the internet are free from the influence of our foreign adversaries.

H.R. 866 accomplishes this objective by requiring the Secretary of  Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for  Communications and Information, to study the national security risks  and cybersecurity vulnerabilities in American homes posed by routers  and modems manufactured or sold by entities with ties to our foreign  adversary countries. The Secretary must also deliver a report to  Congress of this study within 1 year.

It is crucial that we understand the cybersecurity and national  security risks networks face from equipment that originates from our  foreign adversaries. This is especially true given that our Nation's  communication networks are an integral component of nearly every facet  of American life, which also makes them prime targets for attack.

This legislation will help us better protect American families and  our country from bad actors who want to carry out malicious attacks.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Kelly and Latta for their  bipartisan work on this legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 866, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to protect  American citizens and support the ROUTERS Act.
