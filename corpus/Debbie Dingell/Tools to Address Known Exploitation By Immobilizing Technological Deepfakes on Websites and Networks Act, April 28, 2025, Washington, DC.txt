Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Guthrie. I thank Ranking  Member, Frank Pallone, who often puts up with my intensity on this  subject. I also thank Chairman Bilirakis and my co-leads,  Representatives Salazar, Dean, and Pfluger, as well as Senator Cruz and  Senator Klobuchar, my compatriot many days, who works to prioritize  violence against women.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a strong and unwavering advocate for  women, children, and survivors of abuse and in support of a bill that I  helped lead, S. 146, the TAKE IT DOWN Act.

The rise of deepfake pornography and nonconsensual intimate images is  a growing crisis that demands urgent action now. We need to work  together to protect women and children from these evolving threats. New  generative artificial intelligence tools are being weaponized to  humiliate, silence, and terrorize women and children.

We have seen it used against children as young as middle school as a  tool to create revenge porn. We have seen it used against women in  public life, on both sides of the aisle, including our own colleagues.

None of my colleagues think this is acceptable, and it is a crisis  that demands immediate action. We have a responsibility to act now and  not tomorrow, not next year, not after more damage is done. The TAKE IT  DOWN Act gives victims a clear, fast pathway to have these images  removed from online platforms, hold perpetrators accountable, and  ensure that tech companies do their part. They have responsibility.

This is just one piece of a broader fight. It is one I have been in  for years, and I will not stop fighting. We will end violence against  women, address coercive control, and stop the misuse of technology to  harm survivors.

Let me be clear. This bill should already be law. It passed the  Senate unanimously. It was included in Congress' year-end package last  year until it was stripped out at the end. I won't get political on  that because I want everybody to vote on it right now. It should never  have happened.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the TAKE IT DOWN Act.  Let's get this across the finish line and deliver for the women and  children who are counting on us.
