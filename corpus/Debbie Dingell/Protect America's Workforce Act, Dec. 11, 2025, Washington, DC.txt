Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, first, I thank Congressman Golden for  bringing us together on this important bill.

As co-chair of the Congressional Labor Caucus, I know how critical  labor rights are not only for workers in unions but for all American  workers. We are all better off because of unions. Healthcare,  retirement, safe workplaces, holidays, the length of the workweek, and  vacations were negotiated for all of us. We have them because unions  negotiated them.

We are here because President Trump signed an executive order seeking  to end collective bargaining rights for  unionized Federal employees across several agencies. Congress granted,  not the executive branch, collective bargaining rights for Federal  employees decades ago, and they have been upheld for years by the  administration of both parties and now thousands of workers have had  those rights taken away.

Let's get one thing clear: Our Federal employees are absolutely  essential to keep our country running.

Mrs. DINGELL. They are firefighters, nurses, doctors, air traffic  controllers, food inspectors, law enforcement, and public safety  officials. They impact every part of our lives, and we take them for  granted. We cannot hurt them. We must support them.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my Republican colleagues who have joined us on  this bill and encourage those who have not yet recognized this is an  opportunity for all of us to work together. Let us show government  employees we have their backs.
