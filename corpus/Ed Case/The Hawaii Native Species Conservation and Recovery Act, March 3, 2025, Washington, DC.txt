The Hawaii Native Species Conservation and Recovery Act


Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my Hawaii Native  Species Conservation and Recovery Act, a critical piece of legislation  to protect and preserve the unique and irreplaceable native plant and  animal species of our precious and endangered Hawaii. I am introducing  this bill in conjunction with my Hawaii colleague, Senator Brian  Schatz.

Our Hawaii is one of the most biologically unique and diverse places  on the planet. The islands are home to over 10,000 native species, many  of which are found nowhere else in the world, making Hawaii an  extraordinary natural treasure unparalleled in biological diversity.  From the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, one of the few seal species  that thrives in tropical waters, to the endemic 'alala (Hawaiian crow),  a bird with deep cultural and ecological significance, Hawaii's native  wildlife plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of its  ecosystems. The striking silversword plant, which grows only on the  volcanic slopes of Hawaii's highlands, is another example of the  island's extraordinary flora, having evolved to withstand harsh,  isolated conditions.

These species, and so many others, also represent an irreplaceable  part of Hawaii's heritage, not only contributing to the islands'  ecological integrity but also holding cultural and spiritual value for  Native Hawaiians. The unique biodiversity found in Hawaii is not only a  source of pride for its people but also a global treasure that must be  preserved for future generations.

A growing crisis driven by a range of interconnected threats to our  native species is unfolding in Hawaii. Habitat destruction has  significantly reduced the space where native plants and animals can  thrive. Forests, wetlands and coastal ecosystems--critical habitats for  native species--are being cleared or degraded, leaving these species  increasingly vulnerable. As these ecosystems are altered or destroyed,  the species that depend on them are at risk of extinction.

In addition to habitat loss, Hawaii's native species are also facing  the impacts of climate change. Rising sea levels, higher temperatures  and changes in rainfall patterns are already beginning to alter the  habitats and food sources that these species rely on. For example,  higher temperatures push native species to higher altitudes, leaving  them with increasingly limited habitats. These environmental changes  further stress the islands' delicate  ecosystems and compound the challenges posed by invasive species and  diseases. The combination of habitat loss and climate change has  created an urgent need for coordinated conservation efforts to ensure  the survival of Hawaii's extraordinary biodiversity.

Another major threat to Hawaii's native species is the introduction  and spread of invasive species. Non-native plants, animals and insects,  whether intentionally or accidentally introduced, have caused  significant ecological damage. Invasive species such as the mongoose,  rats and predatory insects have decimated native bird populations.  Invasive plants like the fireweed and strawberry guava overwhelm native  vegetation, altering habitats and disrupting the food chain. These  invaders not only outcompete native species for resources but also  introduce diseases, further endangering the delicate balance of  Hawaii's ecosystems. Effective control of invasive species is crucial  for the long-term survival of Hawaii's native flora and fauna.

Together, these interconnected threats create a complex and urgent  challenge for the conservation of Hawaii's native species, making  coordinated, science-based efforts more critical than ever.

To address these pressing challenges, our Hawaii Native Species  Conservation and Recovery Act proposes a competitive grant program to  support the conservation and recovery of these species. This grant  program will provide vital funding to local organizations, government  entities and academic institutions to develop and implement science- based, coordinated conservation strategies that protect Hawaii's native  species. This includes efforts to prevent the spread of invasive  species, restore critical habitats and engage communities in the  conservation process.

These communities of interest include the Native Hawaiians, who  stewarded our natural resources successfully through generations pre- contact as a matter of both kuleana (responsibility) and survival. By  providing a pathway for collaboration across local, state and federal  stakeholders, this bill empowers Native Hawaiian communities to  actively participate in the recovery of their native species. It also  recognizes the critical role of Native Hawaiian organizations, many of  which possess traditional ecological knowledge that is vital for  successful conservation outcomes.

I urge my colleagues to support this important bill that will help  secure the future of Hawaii's native species for generations to come.  By working together, we can protect one of the world's most exceptional  natural environments and ensure its remarkable biodiversity remains a  source of pride and inspiration for all.
