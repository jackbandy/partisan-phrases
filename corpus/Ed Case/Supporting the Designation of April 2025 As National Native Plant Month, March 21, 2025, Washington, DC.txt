Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to invite my House colleagues to  join Congressman Joe Neguse of Colorado and me in recognizing the  critical importance of the native plants of our country by cosponsoring  our resolution designating the month of April as Native Plant Month.

Native plants are not just a vital part of our natural landscape;  they are integral to the environmental health of our Nation. From  supporting biodiversity to enhancing local ecosystems, native plants  play a crucial role in promoting sustainability and resilience in our  environment. They provide critical habitats for wildlife, including  pollinators like bees and butterflies, which are essential for  agricultural productivity. They also help reduce our reliance on  chemical fertilizers and pesticides, prevent soil erosion and improve  water quality. Beyond their environmental benefits, native plants are  foundational to the cultural heritage of many indigenous communities,  who have long depended on these plants for food, medicine, shelter and  spiritual practices.

In my home state of Hawaii, our kuleana (responsibility) is to care  for over 1,400 native plant species, nearly 90 percent of which are  endemic, meaning they are found nowhere else on Earth. These plants are  not only critical to the islands' biodiversity but also serve as living  treasures that reflect the resilience and adaptation of life in an  isolated, often harsh environment. The plants that thrive in Hawaii's  diverse ecosystems--ranging from rainforests and drylands to volcanic  craters and coastal areas--have adapted in remarkable ways to the  unique conditions of the islands. They play an essential role in  maintaining the delicate balance of these ecosystems, providing food,  shelter and crucial support for the diverse wildlife that depends on  them, such as native birds, insects and other species that are also  found nowhere else in the world.

Beyond their ecological value, native plants in Hawaii hold profound  cultural and historical significance for Native Hawaiian communities.  For centuries, Hawaiians have relied on these plants for a variety of  essential purposes, including as staple foods like taro (kalo) and  breadfruit (`ulu), which were central to their diet and agricultural  system. These plants also provided medicinal benefits, with species  like `a`ali`i (hopbush) and mamaki (pipturus) integral to the holistic  health practices of Native Hawaiians. Additionally, many plants were  used to create tools, clothing and materials for daily life. The fibers  of hala (pandanus) and ki (cordyline) were woven into mats, baskets and  garments, while the wood of native trees like koa was essential for  building canoes and homes. These practices reflect the deep,  sustainable connection that Native Hawaiians have long had with their  land, or `aina, underscoring the importance of preserving these plants  for both ecological and cultural continuity.

However, the survival of these plants is increasingly threatened by  invasive species, habitat destruction and the shifting environmental  conditions brought on by climate change. The native flora of Hawaii and  other parts of our Nation face constant pressure from non-native plants  that crowd out indigenous species, diminishing the richness of our  ecosystems. Additionally, extreme weather events, rising temperatures  and unpredictable rainfall patterns continue to jeopardize the health  and viability of these plants.

If we are to preserve the irreplaceable native plants that have  evolved over millennia, it is critical that we take action to protect  them. Recognizing April as Native Plant Month will not only provide an  opportunity to celebrate the diverse and invaluable plants across our  country but also help raise awareness about the challenges they face.  By designating this month, we can shine a spotlight on the importance  of native plants in maintaining the ecological balance of our  communities and encourage the public to take steps to protect and  conserve these species.

As we face the ongoing challenges of habitat loss and invasive  species, it is more important than ever that we recognize the role that  native plants play in sustaining the health of our ecosystems. We must  act now to raise awareness, promote conservation efforts and educate  future generations about the importance of preserving these plants for  the benefit of our Nation's biodiversity and cultural heritage.

I encourage all my colleagues to support this important initiative.  Mr. Speaker, I ask for your cosponsorship of this resolution and for  your partnership in raising awareness about the conservation and  appreciation of native plants across our great Nation. Together, we can  make a lasting difference.
