Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my Promoting  Regional Opportunities for Sustainable Prosperity and Economic  Resilience in the Pacific Act, or PROSPER in the Pacific Act, to  advance the U.S.-Pacific Islands relationship to include an economic  partnership built on shared values and principles.

The Pacific Islands, spread across the vast Pacific Ocean, have a  collective maritime area that exceeds the land area of Russia and China  combined. These jurisdictions are key partners in maintaining a free  and open Indo-Pacific and meeting vital security and economic  challenges. It is imperative that we develop, maintain, and grow these  relationships.

Recognizing this, successive administrations have committed to  deepening U.S. engagement in the region, including through trade and  investment. Most recently, the 2025 National Security Strategy asserts  that ``the Indo-Pacific is already and will continue to be among the  next century's key economic and geopolitical battlegrounds,'' reaffirms  our commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific and prioritizes winning  the economic competition over the long term in the region.  Additionally, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission's  2025 Annual Report to Congress recommended that we strengthen economic  assistance to Pacific Island countries to support U.S. national  security interests and the priorities of partner countries.

However, our economic toolkit for achieving our goals in the Pacific  Islands needs to be strengthened, Many Pacific Island countries enjoyed  preferential treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences  (GSP) when it was authorized, but the program lapsed in 2020. Some of  the Pacific Islands' top exports to the U.S., including tuna, cane  sugar, ginger and taro, would be eligible for duty-free treatment under  GSP but for this lapse.

The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), the leading multinational political  organization for the Pacific Islands region, has prioritized the  region's need to build trade capacity and infrastructure and has  specifically advocated for preferential trade agreements given its lack  of competitiveness due to its small national markets, isolation from  the global market, and high cost of operating and land and labor  constraints. The PIF has encouraged the U.S. to extend duty-free  treatment under the GSP beyond preferences for Least Developed  Beneficiary Developing Countries.

Implementing such a program would come at a low cost to the U.S.  while delivering a high strategic return, especially given the People's  Republic of China's (PRC) increased focus on expanding its influence in  the region. My bill, PROSPER in the Pacific, would provide a visible  alternative to the PRC by emphasizing economic partnership over debt- trap diplomacy, all while encouraging private-sector-led development,  market-based economies, and goodwill towards the U.S.

The PROSPER in the Pacific Act would authorize the President to  designate certain articles imported from eligible Pacific Island  countries for duty-free treatment, extending to them the same  preferential access that is afforded to least developed beneficiary  developing countries under GSP. By doing so, my legislation aims to  stimulate export opportunities for Pacific Island economies while  encouraging U.S. businesses to source more goods from the region. In  addition to expanding market access, the bill would direct the  President to develop a comprehensive plan for negotiating free trade  agreements with Pacific Island countries that express interest, laying  the groundwork for deeper, long-term economic integration. Finally, my  bill would create a dedicated trade facilitation and capacity-building  program for the Pacific Islands to help partner governments strengthen  customs procedures, meet U.S. product standards, and improve overall  export readiness, ensuring they can fully realize the benefits of  enhanced trade ties.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to  sustain and expand U.S. economic and security engagement in this  critical region.
