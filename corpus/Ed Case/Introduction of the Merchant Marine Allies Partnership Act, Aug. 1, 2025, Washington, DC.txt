Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleague Congressman  Jim Moylan of Guam, in highlighting the urgent need to modernize U.S.  maritime policy through our Merchant Marine Allies Partnership Act,  which we have introduced to realign federal incentives in our domestic  shipping industry away from adversaries, such as the People's Republic  of China (PRC), and toward our trusted allies with proven mainline  capacity, such as Japan and South Korea.

Our measure directly responds to the real-world consequences of  gaping loopholes in the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, better known as  the Jones Act, which restricts domestic shipping including routes  between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii to vessels that are U.S.-built,  U.S.-flagged, U.S.-owned and U.S.-crewed. The rationale for this  ancient and outdated restriction has always been argued as national  security, to maintain a strong U.S. shipbuilding industry and merchant  fleet capable of supporting the military in times of conflict.

But today that argument, if it has any merit at all, is being  dangerously undermined, and not by our adversaries, but by the very  companies benefiting from the monopolistic protections of the Jones  Act.

Specifically, Jones Act loopholes allow for supposedly minor parts  fabrication and supposedly minor repairs to be conducted in foreign  shipyards using foreign workers with no condition or restriction as to  country. But these are not minor parts but whole sections, and not  minor repairs but full retrofits. And the preferred source of this  fabrication and these repairs in the People's Republic of China (PRC).

Jones Act vessels such as the Daniel K. Inouye, Kaimana Hila and  Manukai have undergone major structural conversions, including  liquefied natural gas (LNG) engine retrofits, at PRC-based shipyards  like COSCO's Nantong facility, which has known ties to the Chinese  government and military-industrial complex. These modifications are  frequently reclassified as mere ``major modifications'' to avoid  triggering the 50 percent U.S. import duty intended to disincentivize  foreign work. But AIS data, company filings, U.S. Coast Guard  correspondence and even photographs confirm that these are anything but  routine.

This poses a significant and immediate national security concern.  First, by enabling vessels critical to U.S. domestic supply chains to  undergo major upgrades in foreign-controlled shipyards of adversaries,  we introduce unnecessary strategic risk. These ships support domestic  commerce, but they also arguably constitute the backbone of sealift  capacity that would be required during any military mobilization.  Second, the continued outsourcing of vessel modification and  construction undermines the U.S. shipbuilding and repair base, leaving  us with fewer than 100 Jones Act--compliant vessels in active service  nationwide, many of which are aging or specialized. And third, it sends  U.S. dollars, jobs and technological investments directly into the  hands of a strategic competitor identified by out National Defense  Strategy as the most significant long-term challenge to U.S. interests.

Nowhere are the consequences of this policy failure more acute or  more strategically dangerous than in my home state of Hawaii. Located  in the middle of the Indo-Pacific, Hawaii is not just a remote island  economy dependent on maritime commerce. It is the linchpin of U.S.  power projection and force posture across the Indo-Pacific. Any  disruption to Hawaii's shipping system is not only an economic risk to  our residents but a direct vulnerability in America's strategic  readiness.

Moreover, while Jones Act supporters continue to claim the law  protects U.S. jobs, the evidence says otherwise. According to the  Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, maritime employment in the U.S.  shipbuilding and repair sector has declined by 15 percent over the past  23 years. This steady erosion is not due to foreign competition alone,  but to deliberate business decisions by Jones Act carriers who choose  to take advantage of legal loopholes that let them outsource high-value  work overseas while still reaping the benefits of domestic  protectionism.

Despite these clear defects in the law, Hawaii and other islands and  noncontiguous parts of our country remain a fully captive market, with  no viable alternatives to a Jones Act duopoly that prioritizes profit  over preparedness. We see no meaningful return on this federal maritime  policy. The economic burden of this broken system, including inflated  shipping costs driven by duopoly protections and foreign outsourcing,  is borne daily by Hawaii's families and businesses. We have previously  introduced three separate measures to address these specific  consequences.

The overall answer for our country to this national security risk is  not to force any and all fabrication, repair and operation exclusively  into our country since that just compounds a problem we can't  effectively fix. It is instead to cease rewarding our adversaries and  start incentivizing our international friends and allies to assist us  with our domestic merchant marine and related defense sealift needs.

Our Merchant Marine Allies Partnership Act addresses these problems  through a targeted, security-conscious realignment of incentives.  Specifically, the bill exempts the current 50 percent import duty on  major vessel modifications only if the work is performed in shipyards  located in allied or partner countries, such as Japan and South Korea-- nations with world-class maritime industries and deep national security  alignment with the United States. It allows ships constructed in those  allied countries to qualify for the U.S. domestic (coastwise) trade  under a limited Jones Act exemption, thereby expanding access to  modern, secure and cost-effective vessels without subsidizing  adversarial economies. Finally, the legislation establishes a regulated  pathway for foreign-built, foreign-crewed vessels operated by companies  from allied nations to participate in the U.S. coastwise trade under  clearly defined national security safeguards.

This legislation does not repeal or abandon the Jones Act. It  restores the law to its intended purpose--to serve as a foundation for  national resilience, industrial strength and strategic security, rather  than being hijacked by the hypocritical umbrella of national defense at  the expense of increased costs of consumer goods across the country. It  recognizes that modern maritime commerce is global, but that global  alignment must be rooted in trust, shared values and common defense. By  partnering with our allies and closing loopholes that empower our  adversaries, this bill protects the U.S. supply chain, reduces security  vulnerabilities and ensures that the Jones Act serves our people, our  economy, and our military, not just corporate bottom lines.

Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to continue defending a system that  fails to defend us. The Merchant Marine Allies Partnership Act is a  bipartisan, commonsense step toward maritime policy that reflects 21st- century challenges and opportunities. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation and update our maritime policy to modern world  reality.
