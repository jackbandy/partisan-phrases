Supporting the Partner Act

Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the PARTNER Act,  introduced by Congressman Castro of Texas, and cosponsored by myself  and seven of our colleagues who  are particularly invested in advancing our country's relationships with  crucial international organizations.

This bill extends diplomatic privileges and immunities to five  multilateral organizations. I am grateful that Congressman Castro  included a section from my Pacific Partnership Act, which extends  diplomatic privileges and immunities to the Pacific Islands Forum  (PIF), the region's premier multilateral organization with eighteen  members across Oceania, in the hopes that the PIF will establish a  mission to the U.S.

Scattered across the three traditional Pacific subregions of  Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia are over two dozen jurisdictions  collectively known as the Pacific Islands, including twelve independent  states, countries in free association and territories. Though small in  land area and population, the land plus maritime exclusive economic  zones of all these jurisdictions combined exceed the land areas of  China and Russia combined, comprising a significant part of the vast  Pacific Ocean and our Earth's surface.

The Pacific Islands region remains critical to our national security  interests in the Indo-Pacific and advises greater U.S. engagement to  advance our shared interests and values, particularly in the context of  growing geopolitical competition and threats by our shared adversaries  to endanger the pursuit of a free and open Indo-Pacific.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to  sustain and expand U.S. engagement in this critical region.
