Letter to Steven Mnuchin, Sec. of the Treasury, Robert Wilkie, Sec. of Veterans Affairs, Charles P. Rettig, Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, Andrew Saul, Commissioner of the Social Security Administration - Collins, Sinema Lead Push to Allow Veterans, SSI Recipients to Receive Rebate Checks Automatically


Dear Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Wilkie, Commissioner Rettig, and Commissioner Saul:

We write to urge the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Veterans Affairs, theInternal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Social Security Administration to work together andwith relevant federal partners to eliminate the barriers certain seniors, individuals withdisabilities, and veterans still face in accessing the economic impact payments established in theCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. During this time of crisis,America's seniors, individuals with disabilities, and veterans should not be asked to navigatebureaucratic hurdles to receive a rebate they are entitled to.We are encouraged by the April 1st IRS guidance indicating that seniors and individualswith disabilities who receive Social Security benefits will receive their economic paymentsautomatically instead of having to file a tax return. Although this is certainly a step in the rightdirection, it leaves out our nation's veterans who receive pensions from Veterans Affairs andlower-income seniors and individuals with disabilities who receive Supplemental SecurityIncome (SSI).Requiring veterans and SSI recipients to file a tax return in order to receive their stimuluspayment adds an additional burden on those most vulnerable to this pandemic and increases therisk they will not receive these much-needed payments. It also makes these individuals morevulnerable to scammers who will try to steal their personal information and hard-earned savingsin exchange for helping them access their economic impact payments.Our nation's veterans and SSI recipients deserve better. We urge you to continue to worktogether to allow these individuals to receive their economic impact payment automatically. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. If you have any questions about thisrequest, please do not hesitate to contact us or have your staff contact 

Sincerely,
