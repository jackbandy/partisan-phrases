Following Senator Collins' Advocacy, HHS Releases Nearly $18 Million for Maine Nursing Home Providers


U.S. Senator Susan Collins announced today that Maine nursing homes will receive a total of $17.9 million that will help protect the health of residents and staff and support nursing homes struggling with significant expenses or lost revenue due to COVID-19.

 

The funding released today was included as part of the CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.  At an Aging Committee hearing yesterday that was focused on keeping seniors safe in long-term care facilities, Senator Collins, the Chairman of the Committee, criticized the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for not acting quickly enough to release these funds.

 

"Yesterday, I chaired an Aging Committee hearing on how to protect seniors in long-term care facilities from COVID-19, and the need for additional resources was apparent," said Senator Collins.  "As we seek to implement measures such as universal testing in nursing homes, this funding will be crucial to helping protect residents' health and support facilities that are under increasing financial pressure."

 

Each Maine nursing home will receive $50,000 plus a distribution of $2,500 per bed.  All certified skilled nursing facilities with six or more beds are eligible for this targeted distribution.
