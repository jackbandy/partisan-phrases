Senators Collins, King Announce $2.6 Million for Maine Head Start Programs Amid COVID-19


U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced that Maine Head Start programs have been awarded a total of $2,650,659 to support low-income families during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This funding was awarded through the CARES Act.

 

"During this public health crisis, Head Start programs throughout our state have continued to provide children with key educational tools and resources, as well as access to healthy meals and health screenings," said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  "We welcome this important investment in Maine families, ensuring that students continue to have the strong foundation they need to grow and succeed."

 

Head Start was established in 1965 to promote school readiness and provide a comprehensive array of health, nutritional, and social services to eligible four- and five-year-old preschoolers and their families.  Head Start services include early learning, health, and family well-being.
