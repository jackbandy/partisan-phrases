Senator Collins Announces More Than $6.1 Million for Maine Airports


U.S. Senator Susan Collins, the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that four Maine airports have received a total of $6,121,002.  This funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Transportation's Airport Improvement Program (AIP). 

 

Senator Collins was instrumental in securing $3.75 billion for AIP, including $400 million in supplemental AIP grants, in the fiscal year (FY) 2020 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill that was signed into law in December.  Senator Collins also co-authored a section of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES Act) that directed $48.5 billion to support transportation and housing programs. The CARES Act allows the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to eliminate the local share for airports, which are currently facing financial challenges. 

 

"Just like airports around the world, Maine airports are struggling to make ends meet given the sharp downturn in passenger traffic caused by the COVID-19 pandemic," said Senator Collins. "These investments in airport infrastructure will help ensure that airports across the state will continue to serve as engines of job creation and essential pieces of our transportation network after this crisis has passed."

 

The funding was allocated as follow:

 

-Wiscasset Airport received $3,260,906 to rehabilitate the runway. 

-Portland International Jetport received $2,294,690 to construct and rehabilitate the taxiway. 

-Augusta State Airport received $300,000 to update the airport's master plan. 

-Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport received $190,406 to rehabilitate the airport apron as well as seal the apron pavement surface and pavement joints. 

-Bethel Regional Airport received $75,000 to remove obstructions.
