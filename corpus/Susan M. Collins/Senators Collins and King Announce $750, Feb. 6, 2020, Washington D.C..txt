Senators Collins and King Announce $750,000 to Help Mainers with Substance Abuse and Mental Illness


U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME) announced today that the Maine Department of Corrections has been awarded $750,000 to support individuals in the criminal justice system who have mental illness or co-occurring mental illness and substance use issues.  The funding, which was awarded through the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program, is intended to increase collaboration between law enforcement and treatment services.

"Mainers deserve access to quality health care, including services to assist individuals with mental health and substance use disorders," said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  "This important funding will support treatment programs to help incarcerated Mainers who are struggling with these issues to achieve recovery and reintegrate into their communities."

The Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program awards funds to state and local governments to improve services for individuals with mental health and substance use issues within the criminal justice system.
