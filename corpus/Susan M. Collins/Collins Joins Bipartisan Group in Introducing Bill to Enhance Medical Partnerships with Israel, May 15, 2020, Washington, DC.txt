Collins Joins Bipartisan Group in Introducing Bill to Enhance Medical Partnerships with Israel, Lessen U.S. Dependence on China


U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) joined a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing legislation to enhance partnerships between companies in the U.S. and Israel to develop innovative medical projects aimed at detecting, treating, and curing COVID-19. The Expanding Medical Partnerships with Israel to Lessen Dependence on China Act also aims to lessen U.S. reliance on China for life-saving medications and treatments.

 

"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the significant risk of overreliance on any one country for lifesaving medical products," Senator Collins said. "We should redouble our efforts to work with friendly nations to diversify our medical supply chains.  This bipartisan bill would strengthen our partnership with our ally Israel and combine our research and manufacturing efforts to develop new medications and medical products that will help fight COVID-19."

 

The bill was also introduced by Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX), Chris Coons (D-DE), Martha McSally (R-AZ), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).
