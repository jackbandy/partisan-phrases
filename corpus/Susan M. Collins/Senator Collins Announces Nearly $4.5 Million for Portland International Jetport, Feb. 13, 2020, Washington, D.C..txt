Senator Collins Announces Nearly $4.5 Million for Portland International Jetport


U.S. Senator Susan Collins, the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that Portland International Jetport has been awarded a total of $4,494,330 to construct a 1,225 foot Taxiway to provide access from Runway 36 to Runway 29.  This funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Transportation's Airport Improvement Program (AIP).

 

"As Maine's largest airport, the Portland Jetport is an important gateway that connects our state to the rest of the world and supports economic growth and job creation," said Senator Collins.  "This funding will allow the Portland Jetport to make improvements to their airfield, enhancing the safety and efficiency of operations and benefitting residents and visitors alike."

 

As Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Collins was instrumental in securing $3.75 billion for AIP, including $400 million in supplemental AIP grants, in the fiscal year 2020 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill that was signed into law in December.
