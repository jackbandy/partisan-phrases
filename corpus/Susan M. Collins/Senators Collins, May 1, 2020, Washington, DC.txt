Senators Collins, King Announce 121 Rural Maine Health Providers to Receive $131.5 Million to Support Fight Against COVID-19


U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced today that 121 Maine rural health care providers--including hospitals, clinics, and community health centers--will receive $131,501,672 through the CARES Act that they voted for.  Senators Collins and King have previously announced a total of $187,806,676 for Maine hospitals and other health care providers to help respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

"Keeping the doors open to rural hospitals is critical to helping protect the health of residents in the surrounding communities.  This funding will provide crucial support to rural medical providers at a time of enormous stress on our health care system," said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  "We will continue our efforts to provide doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals on the front lines with the resources they need to safely treat patients."

 

Rural hospitals, many of which were operating on thin margins prior to COVID-19, have been particularly devastated by this pandemic. As healthy patients delay care and cancel elective services, rural hospitals are struggling to keep their doors open.  

 

Rural acute care general hospitals and critical access hospitals will receive a minimum $1,000,000, with additional payment based on operating expenses.
