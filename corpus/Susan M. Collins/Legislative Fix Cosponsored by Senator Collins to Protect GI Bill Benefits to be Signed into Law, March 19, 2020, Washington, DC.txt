Legislative Fix Cosponsored by Senator Collins to Protect GI Bill Benefits to be Signed into Law


As universities in Maine and across our country suspend in-person classes and shift to online operations due to the coronavirus pandemic, a legislative fix cosponsored by U.S. Senator Susan Collins now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law after passing both the Senate and the House unanimously.  This legislation will allow veterans on the GI Bill to continue receiving full benefits. 

 

"As our colleges and universities move to online classes to combat the spread of COVID-19, student veterans should continue to receive the benefits that they earned through their service to our country," said Senator Collins.  "This bipartisan legislation will help to ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs can continue to provide GI Bill benefits to student veterans as they continue their studies online."

 

The GI Bill determines student veterans' benefits based on whether or not they attend a physical university in person versus an online program.  As colleges and universities shift to online learning to prevent the spread of COVID-19, veterans on the GI Bill could lose their benefits or have their benefits cut.  This bill would allow these student veterans to continue to receive full benefits even if the universities they attend move classes online due to COVID-19.
