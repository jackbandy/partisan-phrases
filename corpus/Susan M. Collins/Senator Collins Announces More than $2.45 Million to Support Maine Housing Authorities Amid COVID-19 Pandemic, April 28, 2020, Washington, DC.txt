Senator Collins Announces More than $2.45 Million to Support Maine Housing Authorities Amid COVID-19 Pandemic


U.S. Senator Susan Collins, the Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, announced that 19 Maine housing authorities received a total of $2,458,784 to help them prevent, prepare, and respond to COVID-19 in public housing.  This funding was allocated through the supplemental appropriations bill as part of the Phase 3 coronavirus emergency response package, which included a section Senator Collins co-authored directing $48.5 billion to support housing and transportation programs.

 

"The dedicated staff at housing authorities throughout Maine work hard to provide seniors, individuals with disabilities, and low-income families with access to an array of programs that help them improve their living conditions and achieve economic independence.  As the Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, I worked hard to secure these vital resources for Maine's communities to assist their efforts to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19," said Senator Collins.  "The coronavirus is taking an unprecedented toll on communities across the country.  This investment will help ensure that our state continues to be able to provide critical assistance during this difficult time."
