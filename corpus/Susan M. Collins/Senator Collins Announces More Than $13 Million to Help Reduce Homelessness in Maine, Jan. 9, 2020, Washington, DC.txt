Senator Collins Announces More Than $13 Million to Help Reduce Homelessness in Maine


U.S. Senator Susan Collins, the Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded a total of $13,121,653 to the City of Bangor; Community Housing of Maine, Inc.; Maine State Housing Authority; Preble Street in Portland; Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS); and Through These Doors in Portland.  This funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Continuum of Care (CoC) Program.

 

"This important funding supports our state's efforts to help the most at-risk Mainers by providing them with additional resources to promote their health, independence, and overall wellbeing," said Senator Collins.  "As the Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, I have championed funding for this important grant program, and I will continue to work to prevent and end homelessness."

 

The funding will be allocated as follows:

 

·         City of Bangor will receive $1,001,378.

 

·         Community of Housing of Maine, Inc., will receive $26,117.

 

·         Maine State Housing Authority will receive $788,366.

 

·         Preble Street will receive $1,084,835.

 

·         Maine Department of Health and Human Services will receive $9,941,063.

 

·         Through These Doors will receive $279,894.

 

As the Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Collins worked to secure more than $2.8 billion in the fiscal year (FY) 2020 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill to help communities design and implement local solutions to end homelessness.  This legislation was signed into law last month.

 

The CoC Program is designed to promote a community-wide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness; to provide funding for efforts by nonprofit providers, States, and local governments to quickly re-house homeless individuals, families, persons fleeing domestic violence, and youth while minimizing the trauma and dislocation caused by homelessness; to promote access to and effective utilization of mainstream programs by homeless individuals and families; and to optimize self-sufficiency among those experiencing homelessness.
