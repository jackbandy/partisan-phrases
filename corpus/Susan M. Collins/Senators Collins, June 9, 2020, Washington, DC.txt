Senators Collins, King Announce Nearly $43 Million Contract Awarded to Bath Iron Works


U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced today that the U.S. Navy has awarded Bath Iron Works (BIW) a $42,772,449 contract modification to a previously awarded contract for lead yard services for the DDG-51-class destroyer program.  Senator Collins is a senior member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator King is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

 

"From maritime security patrols in the North Atlantic to freedom of navigation missions in the Pacific, Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51s) are the workhorses of the Navy.  This contract reflects the Navy's ongoing confidence in Bath Iron Works to support and deliver high-quality ships that are essential to our national security," said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  "We will continue our efforts to ensure that the highly skilled men and women at BIW have the resources they need to continue building these destroyers and support our military." 

 

This funding is a cost-plus-award-fee modification to a previously awarded contract for lead yard services. The modification provides engineering and technical assistance for the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, and tasks include planning and DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class Flight III upgrade design efforts.
