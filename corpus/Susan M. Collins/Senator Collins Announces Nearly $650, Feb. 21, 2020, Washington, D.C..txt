Senator Collins Announces Nearly $650,000 for Ellsworth, Brewer, and Bangor Housing Authorities


U.S. Senator Susan Collins, the Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that housing authorities in Ellsworth, Brewer, and Bangor will receive a total of $639,264 through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Resident Opportunity and Self-Sufficiency (ROSS) Grant Program.

 

"The dedicated staff at housing authorities throughout Maine work hard to link seniors, individuals with disabilities, and low-income individuals and families with access to an array of programs that help them improve their living conditions and achieve economic independence.  With this funding, housing authorities in Ellsworth, Brewer, and Bangor will continue their work with the local communities to ensure that the needs of their residents are met," said Senator Collins. "As the Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked diligently to ensure that housing authorities have the resources to meet the housing and supportive service needs of our most vulnerable neighbors."
