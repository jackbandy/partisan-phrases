Letter to the Hon. Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture - Maine Delegation Fights to Keep School and Community Meal Sites Open to Prevent Child Hunger


We write today in support of the Maine Department of Education's Child Nutrition AreaEligibility Waiver application and request for an extension. This request, which was submittedon May 7, 2020, is critical to maintaining children's access to meals during the COVID-19pandemic. We ask the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food andNutrition Service to continue providing much-needed flexibility throughout USDA's childnutrition programs so that a nutrition gap is not created by the absence of traditional schoolmeals and summer activity programs.As we wrote in March when encouraging expanded flexibility around the low-incomearea eligibility requirement for the Summer Food Service Program and the National SchoolLunch Program Seamless Summer Option, roughly 80,000 children in Maine rely on free andreduced-priced lunch programs during the school year. Allowing all meal sites to operatewithout barriers is critical to ensuring that no child goes hungry as a result of the pandemic. Thecurrent waiver importantly allows meal sites to serve free meals to children in all areas, ratherthan only those in areas where at least half of students receive free or reduced-price meals.Without an extension, however, the Maine Department of Education estimates that more than 60percent of children currently receiving meals will lose access to this critical nutrition.With summer quickly approaching, schools and organizations that operate summer mealsites--such as local YMCAs--are looking for answers and guidance about how to proceed, andthe ability for many to operate summer meal service depends on this waiver being extended. Weurge you to review promptly Maine's request. For your convenience, we have attached a copy ofthe waiver request submitted by the Maine Department of Education.Thank you for your consideration of this request. We look forward to working with theDepartment to prioritize the nutrition needs of children during this challenging time.
