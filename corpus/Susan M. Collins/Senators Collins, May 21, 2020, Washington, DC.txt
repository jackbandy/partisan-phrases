Senators Collins, King Announce Nearly $2 Million to Boost COVID-19 Testing Efforts at Maine Rural Health Clinics


U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced that Maine has received a total of $1,928,995 to support COVID-19 testing efforts at 39 rural health clinics throughout the state. The funding was awarded through the Paycheck Protection Program & Health Care Enhancement Act that was signed into law on April 24, 2020.  This legislation, which Senators Collins and King supported, included $52.7 million for the Maine Department of Health and Human Services and $4.7 million for 18 Community Health Centers in Maine to support COVID-19 testing.   

 

"Rural health clinics provide high-quality health care to many seniors and low-income families throughout Maine," said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  "This important funding will support Maine rural health clinics' ongoing efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through increased testing."

 

Rural health clinics are a special designation given to health care practices in underserved rural areas by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that help ensure access to care for rural residents.
