Senators Collins, King Announce More than $1.3 Million for Maine Hospitals to Fight COVID-19


U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced that Maine hospitals have been awarded a total of $1,355,641 to support their efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.  This investment is part of the second tranche of $350 million allocated by HHS through the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act and the CARES Act to bolster the U.S. health care system's response to COVID-19.  In total, Maine has received $2,991,576.

"This investment will support the tireless efforts of the doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals who are on the front lines working to keep our communities safe and healthy during the pandemic," said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  "We will continue our efforts to help provide health care providers throughout Maine with the resources they need to respond to COVID-19 and treat patients."

This funding, awarded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Hospital Preparedness Program, will support hospitals and other health care providers to train their workforce; expand telemedicine and the use of virtual health care; procure supplies and equipment; and coordinate effectively across regional, state and jurisdictional, and local health care facilities to respond to COVID-19.  In addition, this funding will advance the mission of the National Special Pathogen System to enhance national capacity and capability to respond to highly infectious diseases now and in the future.
