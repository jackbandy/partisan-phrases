Senate Passes Legislation That Includes At Least $16 Million for COVID-19 Testing in Maine


U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, announced today that Maine would receive at least $16,295,844 for COVID-19 testing under the Paycheck Protection Program & Health Care Enhancement Act that passed the Senate last night.  The legislation provides a total of $25 billion for COVID-19 testing efforts, augmenting the $38 billion in funding for testing, treatments, and vaccines provided through prior congressional action.  This agreement now moves to the House for consideration.

 

"Widespread testing will be essential for helping medical professionals determine when it is safe to reopen the economy and for giving people the confidence to go back to school, sporting events, and other public forums," said Senator Collins.  "Increasing testing should be a joint effort, but the federal government must play the leading role, especially when it comes to sourcing supplies.  States like Maine simply lack the resources to conduct the necessary number of tests on their own.  We need to act now to scale up production."

 

In addition to funding for testing, the Paycheck Protection Program & Health Care Enhancement Actprovides $320 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program co-authored by Senator Collins, which includes $60 billion for smaller lenders.  This brings total funding for the program so far to $670 billion.  It also provides $60 billion for Economic Injury Disaster loans and grants Senator Collins advocated for as well as $75 billion for hospitals, and $25 billion for COVID-19 testing.
