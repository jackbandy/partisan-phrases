Senator Collins Announces More Than $83 Million to Help Maine's Transportation System Respond to COVID-19 Pandemic


U.S. Senator Susan Collins, the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has awarded $83,372,447 to help Maine's public transportation systems respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  This funding was provided through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.  Senator Collins co-authored a section of the CARES Act that directed $48.5 billion to support transportation and housing programs. 

 

"Many Mainers in both urban and rural communities depend on public transit, but these systems are facing financial pressures due to the ongoing pandemic.  This investment will help ensure that public transportation remains strong and reliable so that people can access medical care, grocery stores, pharmacies, and other necessities during this difficult time," said Senator Collins.  "As the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I worked hard to secure these vital resources for Maine."

 

The U.S. Department of Transportation is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other federal partners to provide guidance to the public transportation industry in response to the coronavirus.  FTA has posted Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) regarding COVID-19 on its website.
