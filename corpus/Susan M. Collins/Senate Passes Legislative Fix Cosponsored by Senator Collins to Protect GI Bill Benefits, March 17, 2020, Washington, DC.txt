Senate Passes Legislative Fix Cosponsored by Senator Collins to Protect GI Bill Benefits


As universities in Maine and across our country suspend in-person classes and shift to online operations due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Senate passed a legislative fix cosponsored by U.S. Senator Susan Collins that would allow veterans on the GI Bill to continue receiving full benefits.  The legislation now awaits consideration by the House of Representatives.

 

"As our colleges and universities move to online classes to combat the spread of COVID-19, student veterans should continue to receive the benefits that they earned through their service to our country," said Senator Collins.  "This bipartisan bill would help to ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs can continue to provide GI Bill benefits to student veterans as they continue their studies online."

 

The GI Bill determines student veterans' benefits based on whether or not they attend a physical university in person versus an online program.  As colleges and universities close campuses to prevent the spread of the COVID-19, veterans on the GI Bill could lose their benefits or have their benefits cut.  This bill would allow these student veterans to continue to receive full benefits even if the universities they attend move classes online due to COVID-19.
