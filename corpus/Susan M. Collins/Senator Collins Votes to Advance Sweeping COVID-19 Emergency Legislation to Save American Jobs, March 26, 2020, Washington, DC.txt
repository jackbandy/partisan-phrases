Senator Collins Votes to Advance Sweeping COVID-19 Emergency Legislation to Save American Jobs, Support Workers, and Strengthen our Health System


U.S. Senator Susan Collins joined an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of her colleagues in voting 96-0 last night to advance a $2 trillion emergency economic relief package that will protect the health and the livelihoods of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

Senator Collins also included a provision that will help keep grocery store shelves stocked and speed the supply of emergency medical supplies by allowing states to issue special permits for overweight vehicles and loads.  These permits are allowed during most emergencies and disasters, but pandemics were not included in current law.

 

"For American workers, American small businesses, and American families, relief is on the horizon. This legislation will bolster our health care system, strengthen our medical professionals and first responders, shore up our economy and American workers and businesses, support those who are unemployed, and help prevent millions of Americans from losing their jobs," said Senator Collins.  "I am pleased that the Senate has come together in a bipartisan fashion to advance this critical bill that will provide desperately needed relief to the American people."

 

The legislation includes a $377 billion emergency economic relief plan co-authored by Senator Collins to allow small businesses to continue to pay their workers.  The provision, which Senator Collins developed as a leader of the Small Business Task Force along with Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Cardin (D-MD), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), would provide federally guaranteed emergency loans to small businesses that are experiencing a sharp drop in revenue due to COVID-19.  These loans would be forgiven so long as employers keep their workers on payroll.  Click HERE for a fact sheet on the provision.

 

In addition, the bill includes two bills Senator Collins authored that will support our health care system.

 

First, it contains provisions from the Mitigating Emergency Drug Shortages (MEDS) Act, legislation Senator Collins introduced that will help prevent the shortage of vital medications. 

Second, it includes the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act, legislation Senator Collins introduced that will allow nurse practitioners, physician assistants and others to certify patients for home health services. 

The $2 trillion COVID-19 emergency relief package will help Americans by:

 

Putting cash directly into the hands of Americans who are hurting;Delivering rapid relief to small businesses so Americans can continue to receive much-needed paychecks and these small businesses stay afloat;Stabilizing key industries to avoid massive layoffs;Sending new resources to our medical professionals who are on the frontlines delivering care for Americans.
