Letter to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture - Maine Delegation Calls on USDA to Fix Shortcomings of Food Box Program, Support Maine Farmers and Low-Income Families


Dear Secretary Perdue,We appreciate the commitments that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has made inthe midst of the COVID-19 pandemic to help farmers who have lost revenue, fortify our foodsupply chain, and address rising food insecurity. We are writing to draw your attention to theconcerns and recommendations that have been relayed by Commissioner Amanda Beal of theMaine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry in regards to USDA's Farmers toFamilies Food Box Program, a component of the broader Coronavirus Food Assistance Program(CFAP).Maine has a proud farming heritage and a thriving agriculture industry. Our farmers, producers,and distributors are dedicated to helping feed their communities -- especially in times of crisis.As such, many Maine companies desire to participate in the Farmers to Families Food BoxProgram. Given timing and other logistical challenges, thus far no Maine distributors have beenselected to participate in this program. Furthermore, those distributors who were awardedcontracts outside of Maine were only able to provide an extremely limited number of produceboxes to Maine-based partners, due to limited capacity and food safety concerns.We understand that of the $3 billion allocated for the Farmers to Families Food Box Program,only $1.2 billion has been awarded thus far, with an additional $1.8 billion expected to beawarded by September 2020. As Maine farmers and families continue to weather this storm ofuncertainty without the help of CFAP's food box program, we urge USDA to reopen this biddingprocess in order to fill the glaring regional gaps that have resulted.In addition to reopening the bidding process, we request that USDA allow for increasedflexibility of the design and assembly of boxes. Greater flexibility of box design and assemblyrequirements would enable local partners to participate more easily, and would allow nutritious,local food to be distributed across rural communities nationwide, including those in Maine.We thank USDA for its work on behalf of our nation's farmers and producers, and look forwardto working with you to ensure Maine is able to reap the benefits of the Farmers to Families FoodBox Program.
