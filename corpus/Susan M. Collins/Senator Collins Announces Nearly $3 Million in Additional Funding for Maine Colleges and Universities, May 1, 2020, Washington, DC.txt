Senator Collins Announces Nearly $3 Million in Additional Funding for Maine Colleges and Universities


U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a member of the Education Committee, announced today that Maine institutions of higher education will receive an additional $2,947,301 in funding through the CARES Act.  Last month, Senator Collins announced more than $41 million for Maine's colleges and universities. 

 

With the additional funds, colleges and universities can offer direct aid to students to help them pay for items such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care and child care. They may also use their funding to purchase technology to expand remote learning.

 

"This important funding will help Maine's institutions of higher education offset the economic harm they and their students have experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ensure faculty have the tools they need to continue to provide quality instruction, and support students," said Senator Collins.  "As a member of the Education Committee, I strongly advocated for this funding to help Maine students continue to achieve their educational goals during this difficult time."
