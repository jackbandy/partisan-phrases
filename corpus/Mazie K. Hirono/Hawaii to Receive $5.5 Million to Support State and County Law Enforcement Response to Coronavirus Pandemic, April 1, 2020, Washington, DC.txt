Hawaii to Receive $5.5 Million to Support State and County Law Enforcement Response to Coronavirus Pandemic


Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) announced today that Hawaii will receive $5.5 million in funding under the Byrne-Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program to support state and county law officials as they combat the coronavirus outbreak. Congress passed an increase in JAG grant funding as part of the third coronavirus relief package to help police officers and other first responders who are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 as they combat the coronavirus outbreak.

Under the terms of the grant program, state and county governments may use JAG funding to support purchases of personal protective equipment, hire additional officers, pay overtime for officers working long hours, conduct training for officers, and address the medical needs of inmates in state and local prisons, among other critical uses. 

"Our state and local law enforcement and first responders have been on the front lines with our health care professionals in confronting this pandemic, and they need the appropriate tools, equipment, and resources to keep themselves safe as they assist others," Senator Hirono said."This funding will help ensure that these first responders are able to continue protecting our community during this challenging time."
