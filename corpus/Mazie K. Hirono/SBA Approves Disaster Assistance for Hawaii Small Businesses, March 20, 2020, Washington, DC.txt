SBA Approves Disaster Assistance for Hawaii Small Businesses


Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, announced today that the Small Business Administration (SBA) has approved an economic disaster declaration for the state of Hawaii due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With this disaster declaration, Hawaii businesses affected by the outbreak can now apply for SBA's Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL).

"The SBA's decision today unlocks much-needed assistance for Hawaii small businesses,"Senator Hirono said. "This interim step will provide urgent support while I continue fighting to secure additional relief in any new stimulus package."
