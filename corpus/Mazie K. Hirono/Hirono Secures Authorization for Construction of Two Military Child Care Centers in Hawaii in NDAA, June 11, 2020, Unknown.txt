Hirono Secures Authorization for Construction of Two Military Child Care Centers in Hawaii in NDAA


Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) announced today that two child care centers for Hawaii were authorized for construction in the Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that passed the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday on a 25-2 vote. Both the Aliamanu Military Reservation and Schofield Barracks are the anticipated sites for these child care centers, which are expected to serve hundreds of children and military families. The NDAA authorized $110 million to meet the increasing needs in the local community.

"Our country's service members are dedicated and focused on delivering for our country. Many of them are also parents. While they remain focused on their mission, they shouldn't have to worry about their children's safety," Senator Hirono said. "As we unfortunately learned, underinvestment in this critical support for military families can have tragic consequences. I am proud that this legislation builds on the work to expedite hiring for qualified child care providers that was included in last year's NDAA."

Last year, the Senate passed legislation authored by Senator Hirono that would significantly reduce the lengthy hiring process for qualified child care providers on military installations by expanding direct hire authority. This legislation followed the news of an infant dying at an unlicensed home daycare at Aliamanu Military Reservation.
