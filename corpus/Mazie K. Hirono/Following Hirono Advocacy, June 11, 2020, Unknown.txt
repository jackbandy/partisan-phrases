Following Hirono Advocacy, Senate Armed Services Committee Reinstates Full Funding Authorization for HDR-H During NDAA Markup


Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) announced today that the Senate Armed Services Committee added full funding authorization for the Homeland Defense Radar-Hawaii (HDR-H) during its markup on the Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The inclusion of the $162 million authorization reverses the Trump Administration's decision to zero-out funding in its budget request for the project -- which will be a critical component of the United States' ballistic missile defense system when completed. This funding will support construction of HDR-H following the Missile Defense Agency's completed siting process -- a process that should include meaningful community engagement.

The committee-approved NDAA text also directs the Department of Defense (DOD) to execute all its Fiscal Year 2020 support of HDR-H, requires the Director of the Missile Defense Agency to provide a revised plan with a timeline for completion of the project, and routine briefings to the Senate Armed Services Committee on the project.

"HDR-H is part of our country's critical, layered defense. As the United States continues to confront a range of strategic threats in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, it is imperative that all Americans are protected by our ballistic missile defense system," Senator Hirono said. "Securing full funding authorization for HDR-H was my top priority in the NDAA this year because it will help keep Hawaii safe from external threats. I will continue to advocate for its inclusion in the final, approved package."

Earlier this year, Senator Hirono pressed Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to justify the proposed elimination of HDR-H funding during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Department of Defense's budget request.
