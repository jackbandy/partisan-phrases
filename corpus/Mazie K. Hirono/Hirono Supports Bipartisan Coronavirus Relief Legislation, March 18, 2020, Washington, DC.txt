Hirono Supports Bipartisan Coronavirus Relief Legislation, Urges More Action to Help Workers, Families, and Most Vulnerable


Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) issued the following statement after voting in favor of the Families First Coronavirus Act that passed the U.S. Senate 90-8:

"While this legislation provides free coronavirus testing, expands paid leave, enhances unemployment benefits, and increases food assistance, we will need to do much more to help American families, workers, and small businesses," Senator Hirono said. "I will continue to fight to ensure workers, families, and the most vulnerable in our society remain at the forefront of our continuing efforts to confront this public health and economic emergency."
