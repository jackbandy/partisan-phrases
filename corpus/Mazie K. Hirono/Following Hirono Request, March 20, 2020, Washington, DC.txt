Following Hirono Request, Trump Administration Moves Tax Day to July 15


Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) released the following statement after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that Tax Day would move from April 15 to July 15 for businesses and taxpayers: 

"As Americans continue to confront the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the last thing they need to worry about is the looming tax deadline," Senator Hirono said. "This delay provides much needed flexibility for taxpayers so that we can all focus on the essential task of confronting this public health emergency."

Senator Hirono and 19 of her Senate colleagues called for the Internal Revenue Service to extend the filing deadline to provide taxpayers additional flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic.
