Senator Hirono Statement on Additional Funding for the Paycheck Protection Program


Senator Mazie K. Hirono issued the following statement about providing additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program:

"Small businesses I've heard from in Hawaii appreciate the action by the federal government to provide relief, but now find themselves frustrated by the confusing rollout of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Congress enacted the program to support businesses during the current pandemic so the last thing we need is more uncertainty for our small business owners -- many of whom are confronting hard decisions about their future operations and their employees. The lack of clear and timely guidance from the Trump Administration is making it difficult for local financial institutions to fund PPP loans. I am now deeply concerned that small businesses and those in traditionally underserved communities will be left behind.

"Like all of my Democratic colleagues, I want to provide much more assistance to small businesses across the country and particularly here in Hawaii. However, based on the feedback I've received from our business community, we need to make sure the program is working for the small businesses it was designed to help before providing additional funding. I will continue to listen and advocate for Hawaii's small businesses to ensure the Paycheck Protection Program is fair and works for them."
