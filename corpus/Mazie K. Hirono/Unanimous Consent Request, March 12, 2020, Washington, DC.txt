  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, so, once again, I repeat that this has  nothing to do with stopping these respirators for this particular  crisis to be included as necessary equipment under the current statute.  I do think we ought to be able to come together to come up with a  reasonable approach that can be supported in a bipartisan way.
