Hirono Statement in Support of Bipartisan, Compromise Coronavirus Response Package that Bolsters Response, Helps Families, Workers, and Small Businesses


Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) voted in favor of H.R. 748 -- the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This wide-ranging legislation will inject $2 trillion into boosting funding to our medical system, providing economic support to workers, small businesses, and state and local governments that are bearing the brunt of the necessary but difficult measures being put in place to combat the coronavirus.

"The coronavirus pandemic is a challenge that will require not just a whole of government, but a whole of society effort to overcome. Governors and Mayors in Hawaii and across the country have had to make difficult but necessary decisions to protect public health in order to contain this virus--decisions that are changing our way of life and deeply impacting Hawaii's economy,"Senator Hirono said. "This legislation, while not perfect, is an ambitious effort to bolster our health care system, provide much-needed relief to workers and families across the country, and support small businesses in our communities. I encourage the House of Representatives to join us in passing this urgently-needed legislation, and for the President to sign it as soon as possible."
