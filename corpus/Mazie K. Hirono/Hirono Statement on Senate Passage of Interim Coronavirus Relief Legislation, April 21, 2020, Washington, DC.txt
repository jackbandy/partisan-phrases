Hirono Statement on Senate Passage of Interim Coronavirus Relief Legislation


Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) issued the following statement about Senate passage of interim coronavirus relief legislation (COVID 3.5):

"Since the passage of the CARES Act in March, I have been focused on making important reforms to the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses that need it most, providing additional funding to support our hospitals and health care providers fighting the pandemic, and ensuring that immigrants and other vulnerable communities are able to access care and benefits. It has also become clear that we need robust, flexible funding to assist our state and local governments with their budget shortfalls.  

"While this legislation does not include every priority I've been fighting for, it is the product of extensive bipartisan negotiations and includes provisions made possible by the unity of Congressional Democrats -- notably by ensuring that financial assistance will be available to small businesses in underserved and minority communities.

"As Congress works on a fourth coronavirus relief bill, I will continue to fight for Hawaii workers, families, and small businesses whose lives and livelihoods have been deeply impacted by this pandemic."
