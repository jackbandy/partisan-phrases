Recognizing Dan Driscoll


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1688244/recognizing-dan-driscoll


Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an exemplary North  Carolinian who was just confirmed by the United States Senate as the  next Secretary of the Army, Dan Driscoll.

Dan grew up in Boone, North Carolina, and graduated from Watauga High  School. He then went on to graduate from UNC-Chapel Hill and then Yale  Law School. He has strong roots in North Carolina's Fifth District, and  I am confident that many of our area's future, as well as the current  leaders, will look up to him as a shining example of a salt-of-the- earth public servant who acts upon principle.

I consider myself immensely fortunate to know Dan. I can attest to  this simple fact: His previous service to the Nation in the military,  as well as his track record and acumen within both law and business,  are essential assets that he brings with him to the helm.

He is someone we can count on to lead the Army in the right way and  for the right reasons. His confirmation adds to a growing list of wins  not only for President Trump but also for the entire country, and those  wins are not stopping anytime soon.

I congratulate Dan on his confirmation. I, along with many, many  others, are incredibly proud of him. I look forward to following his  work and hearing of the strides he will make in his new position.

May God continue to bless Dan, his wonderful wife, Cassie, and their  children, Daniel and Lila.
