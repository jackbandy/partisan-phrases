Recognizing Members of the Chriscoe Family


Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to take the opportunity today to  recognize members of the Chriscoe family for their outstanding  generosity, service, and dedication to their faith. I had the pleasure  of meeting the Chriscoes during their visit from Summerfield to the  Capitol and was amazed by their commitment to using their gifts to  celebrate and share the message of the Lord through their work in the  Only God Choir and Ministries.

Music has been a touchstone of faith for the Chriscoe family through  generations, and daughters Laura and Claire have sung in the Only God  Choir for years, sharing God's message through beautiful music that has  touched listeners across the country and the world.

Mr. and Mrs. Chriscoe, Ajay and Trish, have blessed countless  students by opening their home and their hearts, offering their talents  to provide the crucial support that makes the vision of ministry a  reality. With tens of thousands of miles of travel and countless hours  of service behind them, the Chriscoe family has helped the message of  the Only God Choir and Ministries reach over 2 million people.

As they are closing this chapter of their service with the Only God  Choir and Ministries, I am confident that they will remain a living  testament to the value of heeding the command to store our treasures  not on earth, but in heaven. I wish them the best in all their future  endeavors.
