United States Capitol Historical Society Recognizes Patrick McHenry


Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize a dear friend and former  colleague, Patrick McHenry.

This week, the United States Capitol Historical Society is  recognizing Patrick as a recipient of the Freedom Award.

The award serves to recognize and honor individuals and organizations  that have advanced greater public understanding and appreciation for  freedom as represented by the U.S. Capitol and Congress.

Madam Speaker, there is no question in my mind that Patrick McHenry  deserves this award and continued praise for his service to the Nation  and to North Carolina.

I congratulate Patrick on this recognition for his patriotism, for  being a wonderful role model, and for his overall service to the  Nation.

May God continue to bless Patrick, and may He continue to bless his  wonderful family.
