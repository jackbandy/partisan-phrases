Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize James Min who will be  departing the people's House after 25 remarkable years of service.

Within the California delegation, he served in a variety of roles for  three separate Members: Representatives Bill Thomas, Kevin McCarthy,  and Vince Fong.

His unwavering dedication in service to countless Californians over  his 25 years in the people's House is extremely admirable, and I know  there are many other people who agree.

This institution and the world needs more people like James Min in  it.

Mr. Speaker, I thank James for his many years of service to this  great institution and for his friendship. May God continue to bless him  as he turns the page and begins a new chapter in his life.
