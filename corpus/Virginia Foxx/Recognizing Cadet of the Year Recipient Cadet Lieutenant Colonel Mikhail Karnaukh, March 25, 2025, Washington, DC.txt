Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Cadet Lieutenant Colonel  Mikhail Karnaukh who was named as a recipient of the General Ira C.  Eaker Award. This award is the second most prestigious honor in the  Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program. Fewer than 1 percent of cadets are  selected to receive it.

Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for those in the Civil Air Patrol.  Their selfless commitment to duty and country deserves the highest  praise from their elected leaders.

We congratulate Mikhail on this special accomplishment. He has earned  it. I very much look forward to hearing more about his progress and  accomplishments in the coming months and years. May God continue to  bless him and his family.
