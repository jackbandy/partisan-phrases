Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, Congress is charged with upholding the solemn  constitutional mandate of providing for the common defense of the  Nation. We must guarantee that the men and women of the Armed Forces  are equipped with the capabilities and resources to remain the most  resilient and lethal fighting force on the planet. If we do not make  good upon that guarantee, our Nation's warfighters and defense  apparatus will be ill-equipped to confront all manner of threats to the  homeland.

The bipartisan FY26 NDAA is our answer, and it contains the necessary  provisions needed to ensure that the Armed Forces can carry out their  mission unimpeded.

From pay raises for servicemembers to furthering innovation, slashing  bureaucratic red tape to doubling down on President Trump's America  First posture by authorizing the collection of funds to offset the cost  of U.S. forces in Eastern Europe, this legislation meets the mark and  then some.

It also makes ironclad commitments to deter aggression from foreign  adversaries that pose a serious threat to America's national security  and our way of life.

Ensuring the safety and security of the homeland will always be the  top priority of Republicans in Congress.

Mr. Speaker, I support the rule, the underlying legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to do the same.
