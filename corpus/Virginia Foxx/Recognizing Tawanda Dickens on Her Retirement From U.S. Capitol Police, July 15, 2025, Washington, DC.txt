Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Tawanda Dickens, who is a  civilian employee with the United States Capitol Police.

Ms. Dickens, as most of us call her, will be retiring in August after  many years of remarkable service. Her work is often unseen, as she  covers the late-night shift within the Capitol complex, but I, along  with many others, agree that her work makes a real positive difference  to those of us who know her.

I am so fortunate that Ms. Dickens not only helped me often, but, as  she did with many, many others, she befriended me. She is someone who  is a friend to many here in the people's House, and she is respected by  all who know her.

I congratulate Ms. Dickens on her well-deserved retirement. May God  continue to bless her and her family as she enters this new and  exciting chapter of her life.
