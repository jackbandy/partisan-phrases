Sen. Rand Paul Receives Declassified Names from DNI Regarding Obama Administration Officials, Including Joe Biden, Unmasking Gen. Michael Flynn


In response to a letter U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), chairman of the Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management (FSO) Subcommittee, sent yesterday to Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, Senator Paul today revealed stunning new information concerning high-ranking Obama administration officials involved in the unmasking of former National Intelligence Director General Michael Flynn. The list of names the NSA reported "who may have received Lt. Gen Flynn's identity in response to a request processed between 8 November 2016 and 31 January 2017 to unmask an identity" includes former Vice President Joe Biden, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan, former FBI Director James Comey, and more. "I am greatly disturbed by the shocking information my office received today that gives a window into possible abuses of power motivated by political decisions, by individuals at the highest levels of government, including Vice President Joe Biden. It is imperative we get to the bottom of this. I call upon the Senate to immediately hold hearings. Clapper, Comey, Brennan, and even Joe Biden owe it to the American people. They should testify under oath," said Sen. Paul.
