Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, it is good to see that fake outrage is alive  and well in the Senate. We have Democrats coming to the floor worried  about the government being shut down, although they are the ones that  have shut the government down.

Ironically, every Democrat in this body voted for the exact same  spending levels that are in this continuing resolution. Last December,  these Biden spending levels were put forward by Democrats. Now, you  have every Democrat who voted for the spending levels now voting  against them without any rhyme or reason or explanation. So, really, to  come to the floor and complain about the government shutting down a  program when the Senator has every ability to vote in a few minutes to  open the government back up is quite fake outrage.
