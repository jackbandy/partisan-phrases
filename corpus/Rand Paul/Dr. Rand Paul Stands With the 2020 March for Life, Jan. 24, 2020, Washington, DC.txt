Dr. Rand Paul Stands With the 2020 March for Life


Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) released a special video standing with the 2020 March for Life:

"Today, thousands of Americans are gathering in the most powerful city in the world to defend the weak and the most helpless. Our nation cannot expect to fully protect and maintain our other rights if we do not respect the fundamental right to life, and I'm grateful for the tireless commitment of those marching to stand up for the unborn," said Dr. Paul.

In January 2019, Dr. Paul reintroduced his Life at Conception Act (S. 159), which would guarantee equal protection under the law for the unborn. The bill does not amend or interpret the Constitution but simply relies on the 14th Amendment, which specifically authorizes Congress to enforce its provisions.

In addition, Dr. Paul reintroduced standalone legislation last year (S. 158) to prohibit federal dollars from going to Planned Parenthood. The bill would not reduce federal funding for women's health services, which would continue to be provided by other entities. 

In 2015 and 2018, Dr. Paul forced votes in the U.S. Senate on ending taxpayer support for Planned Parenthood.
