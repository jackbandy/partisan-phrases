Dr. Rand Paul Supports Johnson Amendment


Today, U.S. Senator and physician Rand Paul (R-KY) released the following statement in support of Senator Ron Johnson's amendment to the U.S. House-passed coronavirus response bill:

"I support expanding unemployment benefits to include workers laid off because of the pandemic. I also support making those benefits immediate."

The Johnson amendment, which would help address concerns Dr. Paul has heard from Kentuckians about the House bill, would remove the paid leave mandate that will crush small businesses. Instead, the amendment allows for temporary enhancements to States' unemployment programs so that Americans who cannot work due to the coronavirus are protected with expanded unemployment benefits.
