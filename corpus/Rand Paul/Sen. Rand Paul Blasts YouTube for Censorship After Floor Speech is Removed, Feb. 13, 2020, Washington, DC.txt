Sen. Rand Paul Blasts YouTube for Censorship After Floor Speech is Removed


Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) released the following statement after YouTube removed the video of his floor speech from last week from public view:

"It is a chilling and disturbing day in America when giant web companies such as YouTube decide to censor speech. Now, even protected speech, such as that of a senator on the Senate floor, can be blocked from getting to the American people. This is dangerous and politically biased. Nowhere in my speech did I accuse anyone of being a whistleblower, nor do I know the whistleblower's identity. Apparently, YouTube has taken it upon itself to decide what questions can even be asked in the public debate, including on the Senate floor." 

Senator Paul's speech, given during the allotted time for senators to express their thoughts on the impeachment trial, focused on the surveillance state's abuse of its powers. Senator Paul read the following question: "Manager Schiff and Counsel for the President, are you aware that House Intelligence Committee staffer Shawn Misko had a close relationship with Eric Ciaramella when at the National Security Council together, and are you aware and how do you respond to reports that Ciaramella and Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the President before there were formal House impeachment proceedings?"
