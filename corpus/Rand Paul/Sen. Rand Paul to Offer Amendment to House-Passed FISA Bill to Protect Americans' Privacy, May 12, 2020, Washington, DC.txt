Sen. Rand Paul to Offer Amendment to House-Passed FISA Bill to Protect Americans' Privacy, Reform System


Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) announced he will introduce an amendment to H.R. 6172, the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act of 2020, to protect every American's privacy, ensure due process, and reassert the Fourth Amendment. "It flies in the face of our Constitution that a secret court can authorize invading an innocent American's privacy. Recent months have once again made all too clear how such a system leads to abuse. It's time for Congress to stop paying lip service to reform and pass real safeguards that respect Americans' rights. What happened to General Flynn and President Trump should never be allowed to happen again," said Sen. Paul. Senator Paul's amendment would still allow the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to order surveillance of non-Americans and our enemies, but it would require the government to obtain a warrant from a traditional federal court to surveil an American. The amendment would also prohibit the federal government from introducing into evidence any information gained from warrantless surveillance on an American, while guaranteeing an American's ability to use such evidence in their defense.
