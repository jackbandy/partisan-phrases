Dr. Rand Paul to Dr. Fauci: "As Much as I Respect You, I Don't Think You're the End-All. I Don't Think You're the One Person That Gets to Make a Decision.'


During today's U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on "Safely Getting Back to Work and Back to School," U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) reiterated his call for power to be disbursed as much as possible among states instead of instituting a "one-size-fits-all," national plan on reopening America. Dr. Paul additionally questioned why so many states are deferring to Dr. Anthony Fauci exclusively on when states should reopen without any considerations for economic impact and local conditions. "I think we ought to have a little bit of humility in our belief that we know what's best for the economy. And as much as I respect you, Dr. Fauci, I don't think you're the end-all. I don't think you're the one person that gets to make a decision," said Dr. Paul.
