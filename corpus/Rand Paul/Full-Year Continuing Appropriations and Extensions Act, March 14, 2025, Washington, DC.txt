Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025

Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1266 and ask that  it be reported by number.

Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I compliment President Trump and DOGE for  exposing waste and abuse in foreign aid spending. It boggles the mind  to think that some in Congress defend spending $2 million on sex  changes in Guatemala, thousands on an LGBT opera in Colombia, and  thousands on a trans comic book in Peru. This is the low-hanging fruit.  If Congress can't vote to cut this egregious, crazy, leftwing lunacy,  will Congress ever have the courage to tackle entitlements?

Yet there does remain a significant constitutional question as to  whether these cuts need a congressional vote to give them permanence.  Today, with my amendment, Congress can make these foreign aid cuts the  law.
