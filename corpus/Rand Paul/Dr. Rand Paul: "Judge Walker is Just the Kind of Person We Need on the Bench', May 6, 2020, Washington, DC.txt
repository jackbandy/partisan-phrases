Dr. Rand Paul: "Judge Walker is Just the Kind of Person We Need on the Bench'


Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced fellow Kentuckian Judge Justin Walker to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee before its hearing on his nomination to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Previously, Dr. Paul had recommended Judge Walker to the Trump administration for his current seat on the Western Kentucky District Court. "I'm very pleased that President Trump reached outside the Beltway-to-New York bubble to elevate a judge who is committed to our Constitution," said Dr. Paul in his introduction. In particular, Dr. Paul praised Judge Walker's actions to defend churchgoers in Kentucky before Easter and make sure drive-in services could be held in Louisville, saying that "it demonstrates his fidelity to our Constitution, even when it is hard, and even in times of crisis." "Judge Walker is just the kind of person we need on the bench. I proudly support him and urge you to swiftly send his nomination to the floor," Dr. Paul stated.
