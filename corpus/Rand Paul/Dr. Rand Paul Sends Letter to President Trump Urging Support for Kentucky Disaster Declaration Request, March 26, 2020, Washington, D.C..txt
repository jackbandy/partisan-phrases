Dr. Rand Paul Sends Letter to President Trump Urging Support for Kentucky Disaster Declaration Request


Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) sent President Donald Trump a letter urging him to approve Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear's request for a major disaster declaration for Kentucky as it responds to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Paul is also joining other members of Kentucky's federal delegation in sending a separate letter on the aid to President Trump. "The COVID-19 pandemic threatens -- and will continue to threaten -- lives and the public health throughout Kentucky. Accordingly, on March 6, 2020, Governor Beshear declared the Commonwealth of Kentucky to be in a State of Emergency for purposes of mobilizing state response and relief resources, including the Kentucky National Guard," Dr. Paul stated in his letter. "I respectfully urge you to promptly consider this request by Governor Beshear. Additionally, I ask that you work to expedite delivery of the 100,000 test kits and 5,000 swabs that have been requested by the Commonwealth of Kentucky," he continued. On March 16, Dr. Paul sent President Trump a letter asking him in advance "to promptly consider any and all requests for federal aid that are made by Governor Beshear" to assist Kentucky in its response efforts. In addition to his work to ensure a swift and decisive response to the novel coronavirus pandemic, Dr. Paul has released a wide-ranging list of federal agency actions and resources on his website to help Kentuckians quickly find information on topics such as unemployment benefits, small business loans, scams related to the pandemic, H-2A/agriculture labor, guidance for Medicare recipients and Medicare providers, and more.
