Dr. Rand Paul Responds to Paradise Coal-Fired Plant Closing


Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) released the following statement in response to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) shutting down Unit 3, the last coal-fired unit at the Paradise Fossil Plant, this weekend. 

"I am deeply disappointed with TVA's decision to close Paradise Unit 3 and prolong the War on Coal, especially after Kentuckians in the affected community, elected officials like myself, local leaders, and even the president all spoke up in opposition to its retirement. Though many details are still unknown, my staff and I are actively monitoring this situation, are in direct contact with TVA officials, and stand ready to assist during this confusing and difficult time for the hardworking Kentuckians of Muhlenberg County," said Dr. Paul.

Throughout the debate over Unit 3's future, Dr. Paul and his staff actively engaged local Kentuckians and officials in Muhlenberg County and conveyed their concerns to the TVA. In December 2018, Dr. Paul submitted official comments to the TVA regarding its environmental assessment on the then-potential retirement of the plant, and he also advocated for the plant to stay open in a video message to TVA's Board of Directors in February 2019.
