Dr. Rand Paul Joins Legislation to Help Medical Community Fight the Coronavirus


Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), member of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, signed on in support of S. 3372, the Health Care Workforce Protection Act of 2020. The bipartisan legislation extends current limited liability protections to help guarantee the availability of respirators as government, businesses, and local communities respond to the coronavirus.

"The Health Care Workforce Protection Act makes a small but common-sense and critical change to existing law. As a physician, I am proud to support legislation that encourages an increased supply of respirators to protect more Americans and aid our medical professionals in fighting the coronavirus," said Dr. Paul.

Introduced by Senators Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), S. 3372 is also cosponsored by Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Ben Sasse (R-NE), and John Thune (R-SD).
