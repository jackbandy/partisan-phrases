Dr. Rand Paul Joins Effort to Procure More Masks


Today, U.S. Senator and physician Rand Paul (R-KY) joined Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) on an effort to repurpose existing funds to get critically needed equipment to those on the frontlines of the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic, continuing his efforts to ensure a comprehensive response without increasing the burden on Americans. The Ernst bill would abolish the Presidential Election Campaign Fund (PECF), which has seen a massive drop in taxpayer contributions over the years and is now virtually ignored by presidential candidates, and direct its balance of over $350 million to the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Strategic National Stockpile for more masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE). "Here's our choice: we can let hundreds of millions of dollars collect dust, or we can send more resources to those working hard to stem the tide of this virus. I am proud to support legislation that also implements exactly the kind of practical approach I have been fighting for in using money we already have to strengthen our response. I urge my fellow senators to quickly pass this reform," said Dr. Paul. There is precedent for the action, as, within the last ten years, the federal government has taken money from the PECF to put toward pediatric research.
