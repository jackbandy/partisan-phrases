Dr. Rand Paul: "America Deserves Better in the Future'


Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) released the following statement after the U.S. Senate voted to acquit President Donald Trump of the U.S. House's charges:

"Since President Trump's election, some members of the Democrat Party have been determined to impeach him. First, it was so-called "Russian collusion,' and when the Mueller Report didn't satisfy their desires, Democrats cooked up two articles of impeachment to accomplish their goal and even attempt to prevent future ballot access. This has been a flagrant abuse of power by the U.S. House, and it took the Senate to end this charade. America deserves better in the future, and I hope we won't go down such a partisan-driven path again."
