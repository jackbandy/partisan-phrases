Dr. Paul Sponsors Resolution Allowing Senate to Dismiss Articles of Impeachment


Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) cosponsored U.S. Senator Josh Hawley's (R-MO) resolution, introduced yesterday, to update the U.S. Senate's rules on handling impeachment. Should the U.S. House of Representatives fail to send the Senate articles of impeachment within 25 calendar days of adopting them, the resolution would regard such articles as "exhibited before the Senate" and would empower any senator to introduce a motion to dismiss the articles "with prejudice for failure by the House of Representatives to prosecute such articles." "House Democrats desperately tried to convince the American people that President Trump had to be impeached, but they have demonstrated their lack of seriousness and respect for the constitutional process they claim to be guarding by withholding the articles from the Senate until they get the trial they want. It is time to put an end to a witch hunt that started based on a hoax. Passing this resolution would not only break the current deadlock, but it would help prevent such partisan games from being played again in future Congresses," said Dr. Paul.
