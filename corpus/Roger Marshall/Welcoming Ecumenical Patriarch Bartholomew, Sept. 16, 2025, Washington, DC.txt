Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I rise today to welcome to our Nation's  capital His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the  Spiritual Head of the second-largest Christian Church in the world. His  All-Holiness serves as the current Archbishop of Constantinople and  leads over 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide.

His All-Holiness is visiting Washington, DC, from September 15  through September 17 and will meet with President Trump at the White  House. This visit coincides with his receipt of the Templeton Prize, a  prestigious award previously bestowed upon renowned figures such as  Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

For decades, His All-Holiness has been a steadfast advocate for  religious freedom and unity among Christians worldwide. He has  consistently called for the protection of religious minorities and has  championed the rights of Orthodox Christians to worship freely. His  efforts to promote dialogue between the Orthodox Church and other  Christian denominations have significantly strengthened interreligious  understanding.

In my home State of Kansas, we are honored to have a strong and  active Greek Orthodox community, with more than 4,300 Orthodox  Christians and two parishes: St. Dionysios in Overland Park and Holy  Trinity in Wichita. These churches embody the deep spiritual connection  that Kansans share with the Ecumenical Patriarchate and Orthodox  Christians around the world.

I now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this historic visit  and in honoring His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew for  his unwavering commitment to faith and the common good.
