Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an important  provision in the big, beautiful bill.

I was proud to introduce the Endowment Tax Fairness Act, which would  tax the endowment profits of private, elite universities at 21 percent,  raising an estimated--listen to me--$70 billion to $100 billion over 10  years.

The Senate gutted this provision and reduced it to under $1 billion  annually to protect elite universities that take hundreds of millions  of dollars annually in Federal tax dollars.

We were given instructions to generate revenue to pay for President  Trump's wonderful priorities. We are not taxing the endowment itself.  Harvard has $53 billion. We are not taxing that. We are just going to  tax the net earnings on their investments at 21 percent, which is equal  to the corporate tax rate.

What did the Senate do? They reduced it to 8 percent, just under 8  percent.

It is about time that we get these universities to pay the same that  corporate America pays.
