Rotorcraft Operations Transparency and Oversight Reform Act

Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the legislation  before us, the ROTOR Act.

The ROTOR Act seeks to fulfill a longstanding recommendation from the  National Transportation Safety Board to require ADS-B In technology on  aircraft operating in our national airspace system. That recommendation  reflects years of accident investigation and careful analysis.

But we must also recognize that this bill does not alone close the  book on aviation safety. The NTSB recently released its final report on  the DCA midair collision, which contains 50 safety recommendations.  There is much more work to be done to address them comprehensively and  thoughtfully.

We must also be cognizant of the feasibility of implementing the  ROTOR Act for all national airspace system users. Safety mandates must  be achievable in the real world. Small aircraft operators and regional  jet operators could face significant challenges integrating new  equipment, particularly if the Federal Aviation Administration were to  insist on a fully integrated control panel solution. Costs, downtime,  and certification hurdles are not abstract concerns. They are real  burdens for operators working on tight margins.

Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, flexibility will be crucial to ensure that  all operators can be equipped with available situational awareness  tools, including portable technologies and electronic flight bag  solutions. I believe this will achieve the broadest implementation and  the greatest safety benefits in the most efficient and effective manner  possible.

The ROTOR Act isn't perfect. No bill ever is. But I remain committed  to working with my colleagues to strengthen aviation safety without  placing unnecessary burdens on those we depend on to keep America  flying.
