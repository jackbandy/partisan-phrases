Recognizing Derrick Van Orden

Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor a good friend and  colleague, Representative Derrick Van Orden, a former Navy SEAL, combat  medic, and fellow Wisconsinite.

While traveling in Iowa, Mr. Van Orden's combat training kicked in to  help save an 11-year-old boy. He and his wife, Sara, were on Interstate  35 outside of Osceola when they heard a large boom. A minivan had  collided with a semitruck attempting to reenter the interstate. They  immediately turned around and rushed to the scene.

Upon arrival, Mr. Van Orden found a young boy with severe injuries.  The young boy's calf was completely ripped apart, and he had an  arterial bleed on his right wrist.

Without hesitation, Mr. Van Orden pulled from his suitcase two pairs  of socks, which he fashioned into makeshift tourniquets to stop the  bleeding in the boy's arm and leg.

With the assistance of two other people who were at the scene, Mr.  Van Orden was able to cut seatbelts, a windshield wiper, and a piece of  metal to make makeshift tourniquets to stop the bleeding of the young  boy until the ambulance arrived.

Without the swift actions of Mr. Van Orden, along with those also on  the scene, the young boy probably would have died.

May the actions of Mr. Van Orden and the folks who assisted in saving  the young boy inspire all Americans to lend a helping hand to those in  need. You truly never know how far an act of kindness, big or small,  can go.

Mr. Speaker, Derrick, Representative Van Orden, is with us here. He  should have a cape. He is Superman. I applaud Derrick. Well done.
