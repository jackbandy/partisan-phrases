Mr. GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank our acting ranking  member for his leadership here and to honor our incredible ranking  member.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill, which of course, supports  our fight against cancer and to improve healthcare for all Federal  workers.

This is such an important way to honor the legacy of our colleague,  our Ranking Member Gerry Connolly.

Gerry was a dedicated public servant, a fighter, and a mentor to all  of us on the Oversight Committee. Gerry worked to hold our government  accountable for over 30 years and was dedicated to improving the lives  of all Americans.

He was a champion of our Federal workforce, of transparency, and in  making government work for all the people that we serve.

He believed in the power of Congress and in fighting tirelessly for  the constituents that he served and, of course, for the rule of law and  our Constitution.

He served as a county executive where he fought to expand affordable  housing and to invest in infrastructure, and he always supported public  workers. He delivered for his community. He delivered for the country,  and he left a proud legacy.

Now, Gerry represented the best among us in public service, which is  why we strongly support this bill. We all miss him greatly, and I know  every single member of our committee will work to carry on his legacy.

Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to honor Gerry by supporting this  bill.
