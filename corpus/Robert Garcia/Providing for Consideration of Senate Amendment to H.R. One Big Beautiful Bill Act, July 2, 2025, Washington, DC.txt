Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, my Democratic colleagues and I  believe in a country where we take care of our fellow Americans and the  wealthiest pay their fair share. However, Republicans are fighting for  the biggest rip-off in American history and the biggest attack on our  social safety net in decades.

If this bill passes, 16 million people are going to lose their health  insurance. They will take away basic food assistance from millions of  veterans, seniors, and kids. The poorest 10 percent of Americans are  going to lose $1,600 per person on average while the richest only get  richer because of this bill. It is a transfer from the poor and the  middle class to the wealthiest. It does all of this while increasing  debt over $3 trillion.

What happened to fiscal responsibility?

That means that our grandkids will fund a tax cut for Elon Musk. Now,  while I am proud that we are defeating a number of extremely concerning  provisions in this House bill, this is our last chance to stand up for  our values.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this big BS bill.  The American people are watching.
