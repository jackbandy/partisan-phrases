https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1694121/recognizing-mark-murphy


Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the legacy and  esteemed career of Green Bay Packers president and CEO Mark Murphy, who  is set to retire at the end of this week after serving in the role for  more than 17 years.

Mark Murphy is a Green Bay Packers legend and a highly respected  figure throughout Wisconsin and among NFL fans across the country.

During his tenure as president and CEO, the Green Bay Packers won the  Super Bowl in 2011, made 5 NFC Championship Game appearances, secured 8  NFC North division titles, earned 13 playoff appearances, and posted a  172-101 regular season record, which was the second best in the league  over that span.

Off the field and under his guidance, the Green Bay Packers invested  more than $700 million in the Lambeau Field campus and Titletown  development without the use of public money and increased charitable  giving across Wisconsin.

Most recently, the Packers hosted the immensely successful 2025 NFL  Draft, which drew an official attendance of 605,000 and delivered a  major economic boost in our region in northeast Wisconsin.

Mr. Speaker, as the Representative from northeastern Wisconsin and as  a lifelong Packers fan, I want to thank Mark Murphy for his many years  of dedicated leadership with the Green Bay Packers and wish him the  very best in his retirement.
