Recognizing Gerald ``jerry'' Danforth


Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Gerald ``Jerry'' Danforth, a distinguished Tribal leader, a decorated  Navy veteran, and a beloved husband, father, and grandfather, who  passed away on the morning of June 1, 2025, at the age of 78.

Born on December 24, 1946, in Oneida, Wisconsin, to Leslie and Eva  Schuyler Danforth, Jerry devoted his life to service--first to his  country, and then to his people. He served honorably in the United  States Navy for over three decades, retiring in 1994 with the esteemed  rank of Force Master Chief, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet.  He was a veteran of both the Vietnam War and Desert Storm, embodying  courage, commitment, and leadership throughout his military career.

Jerry brought the same conviction and discipline to his leadership  within the Oneida Nation. He was elected Chairman of the Oneida  Business Committee in 1995 and again in 2005, where he advocated  tirelessly for policies that advanced Indian gaming, economic  development, healthcare, higher education, and the preservation of the  Oneida language. His long-term vision was to build a strong,  sustainable economy not solely reliant on gaming and to enhance  communication between tribal governance and the General Tribal Council.

A public servant in every sense, Jerry also served his Nation as a  judge on the Oneida Judiciary, where his wisdom, fairness, and devotion  to justice left a lasting impact.

Beyond his public service, Jerry was a man of deep personal warmth  and abiding family values. He is survived by his loving wife, Pamela  Johns Danforth, and their children Paul Jameson (Virna), Steve Jameson  (Cathy), Tanya Wood (Steve), Gerald Danforth Jr. (Chitra), Patrick  Danforth, and stepson Keith Bimosae Johns Herman. He is also survived  by his brother James Danforth (Joanne), sister Joanne Smith (late Bruce  Smith), and many grandchildren who brought him great joy. He was  preceded in death by his son Thomas Danforth and his parents.

Jerry lived a life rich with passion and purpose--he loved fishing,  golf, entertaining with his prized green egg grill, red wine,  chocolate, and pie. He cherished winters spent in South Padre Island  with Pam and was happiest when surrounded by family and friends.

Mr. Speaker, Gerald ``Jerry'' Danforth's life was defined by service,  leadership, and love. He exemplified the highest ideals of his people  and of this Nation. His legacy will endure in the lives he touched, the  institutions he shaped, and the Nation he served so faithfully. I offer  my deepest condolences to his family, his community, and the entire  Oneida nation. May his memory be a blessing.
