National Blood Donor Month

Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of January as  National Blood Donor Month. Each winter, blood centers across the  Nation experience reduced donor turnout, while the need for blood  remains constant.

In the United States, someone requires a blood transfusion every 2  seconds to treat patients facing trauma, surgeries, childbirth  complications, cancer, chronic conditions, and so much more, yet our  blood supply remains critically low.

Because of the urgent and ongoing need for blood donations, I  recently introduced H.R. 5791, the Boosting Lifesaving Operations,  Opening Donation Centers Act, or the BLOOD Centers Act, alongside my  Democratic colleague, Congresswoman Schrier.

This commonsense, bipartisan legislation would streamline the  bureaucratic burdens of opening a new blood center while still ensuring  oversight and safety in donation facilities and of the blood they  collect.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the BLOOD Centers Act so  we can expedite the ability of blood centers to open new locations and  collect lifesaving blood for those who need it.

Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, I also want to encourage everyone  listening today to consider taking the time to donate blood if you are  able to. First-time donors are always welcome, and every donation has  the power to save a life.
