Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional man  who recently celebrated 30 years of dedicated service to Waupaca County  and the citizens of northeast Wisconsin.

Last week, Waupaca County Sheriff Timothy Wilz reached a milestone of  three decades of service in law enforcement. From his time as a jailer  and dispatcher to his current role as sheriff, Timothy Wilz's  dedication to public service is an inspiration to us all.

It is especially fitting that his 30-year anniversary fell during  National Police Week, a time when we honor the hard work of our law  enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day to keep  our communities safe.

Throughout his impressive career, Sheriff Wilz has served in multiple  roles that have been essential to maintaining the safety of Waupaca  County residents.

Sheriff Wilz began his career in law enforcement with the Manawa  Police Department in 1991 and became a corrections officer in 1995 with  the  Waupaca County Sheriff's Office. Given his leadership, he was promoted  to patrol sergeant in 2007, where he also served as a training  coordinator.

In 2018, he was elected to serve as the sheriff of Waupaca County due  to his wide-ranging skill set, ample knowledge, and unwavering service  to the people of Waupaca County.

I had the privilege of getting to know Sheriff Wilz personally over  the last year, and I know that he is a man of integrity who is  committed to upholding the rule of law and protecting the people of  Waupaca County.

On behalf of the people of Waupaca County and Wisconsin's Eighth  Congressional District, I thank Sheriff Wilz for his decades of  honorable service.
