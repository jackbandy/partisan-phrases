Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a Green Bay local  legend, Bill Jartz, who is retiring from WBAY after more than four  decades, including 27 years at the evening anchor desk.

Bill grew up right in Wisconsin's Eighth Congressional District in  Clintonville and started his career with WBAY as a sports reporter in  1983. He made the jump to evening news in 1998.

Bill's legacy extends far beyond the newsroom. It lives in his  warmth, wit, and unwavering dedication to our community. In fact, Bill  is known for not being able to say no to any charitable cause where he  can make a difference.

He has been a familiar voice emceeing, speaking, or judging countless  local fundraisers and events for charitable organizations, including  the CP Telethon and Make-A-Wish's Gourmet Wishes. Throughout his  career, it is estimated that he dedicated more than 5,000 hours of  community service.

While all of us in northeast Wisconsin will miss Bill's news  coverage, thankfully, we will still get to hear the voice of Lambeau  Field during Green Bay Packer home games.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Bill for his many years of service to northeast  Wisconsin and congratulations on his retirement. May this next chapter  be as fulfilling as the legacy he leaves behind.
