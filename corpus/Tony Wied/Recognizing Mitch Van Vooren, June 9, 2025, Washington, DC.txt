Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a standout college  senior from my district who just achieved his dream of being signed to  play in the NFL.

Last week, it was announced that Peshtigo native and St. Norbert  College senior Mitch Van Vooren signed with the Seattle Seahawks as a  tight end.

Mitch graduated from Peshtigo High School. After graduation, he  attended Marquette University on a Division I track and field  scholarship. Despite his success in this field, he never gave up on his  goal of playing in the NFL.

Last year, he joined the St. Norbert College Green Knights football  team, where he had a standout season, scoring 13 touchdowns and gaining  over 1,000 receiving yards. His performance earned him First Team All- Conference honors.

Mitch's journey is a powerful reminder that we should never give up  on our dreams. Through dedication, determination, and hard work he made  his vision a reality.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mitch on being signed to the NFL. I wish  him the best of luck and continued success with the Seattle Seahawks,  of course, except when he plays the Green Bay Packers. He has made all  at St. Norbert, St. Norbert alumni, and everyone in Wisconsin's Eighth  Congressional District incredibly proud.
