Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the  outstanding USA Men's Deaf Basketball team that recently earned the  gold medal while competing at the 2025 Deaflympics in Tokyo.

The team bested every other competing country, culminating in an  electrifying 69-59 victory over Ukraine in the finals.

I give special recognition to one of my constituents, Patrick Danen  of De Pere, who was a key member of this team and brought the gold  medal home to Wisconsin's Eighth District.

Patrick, who attended my alma mater, St. Norbert College, had to  learn to adapt to basketball after becoming deaf as a result of  contracting meningitis at 6 months old. Despite this, he never let this  stop him from excelling as a standout player in high school, college,  and now the international level.

Patrick Danen and the rest of his teammates showed incredible skill,  determination, and fortitude, and their victory was well deserved.

I also recognize the USA Women's Deaf Basketball team, who earned the  silver medal in Tokyo, further demonstrating the strength of American  athletes on the world stage.

While these games may not have gotten the attention from the media  they rightfully deserve, it is my honor to stand here today on the  House floor to recognize their achievement and ensure that they know  just how proud they have made our country.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me once again in  congratulating the USA Men's Deaf Basketball team for their outstanding  gold medal victory at the Deaflympics, and I look forward to their  future success.
