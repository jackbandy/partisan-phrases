Recognizing Josie Pethan and Brenda Dawes


Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary  young woman from northeastern Wisconsin who recently saved her mother's  life by performing CPR.

While at home sick from school, 11-year-old Josie Pethan was  confronted with a nightmare scenario that no child should have to  experience. Josie had been reading on the couch next to her mother when  her mother had a sudden medical emergency. Josie quickly realized  something was very wrong.

Without hesitation, Josie jumped into action, calling nearby family  members for help and then contacting 911. She soon spoke with  dispatcher Brenda Dawes, who started guiding her on how to perform CPR.

Brenda was able to walk Josie through the proper CPR technique while  they waited for EMTs to arrive. When asked about who was in her mind  during this traumatic experience, she responded: Jesus.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this  remarkable young woman. Because of her decisive actions, her mother is  alive today and doing much better.

I also want to recognize and thank Brenda Dawes for her service to  our community. Because of her calm guidance and sound advice, a tragedy  was prevented. Northeast Wisconsin is blessed to have such  compassionate and dedicated 911 dispatchers just like her.

Josie's quick thinking and faith in God will carry her very far in  life. On behalf of everyone in Wisconsin's Eighth District, I want her  to know how proud we are of her and how happy we are that her mother is  doing okay.
