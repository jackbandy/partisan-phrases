Mr. DELUZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the career and  honorable public service of Indiana Township Police Chief Steven  Colucci, who retired after 29 years on the force this summer.

Chief Colucci first put on a badge in 1996 as a part-time patrolman.  He rose through the ranks of detective, sergeant, lieutenant, and  eventually earned the top job as chief, where he served for over 3  years.

Chief Colucci was a mentor to many. His legacy includes training a  good chunk of the current force, including the new chief, Marc Myers.

I had a chance to work directly with Chief Colucci last year in an  effort to upgrade a 130-year-old railroad tunnel in the community that  was falling apart and was a real public safety risk. We worked together  to push the railroad to make the repairs, and I got a chance to see  firsthand his dedication to his community's safety.

Chief Colucci is a true public servant. Indiana Township and western  Pennsylvania were lucky to have his decades of service.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Chief Steven Colucci on his well-deserved  retirement. I wish him the best in his next chapter and thank him for  his service.
