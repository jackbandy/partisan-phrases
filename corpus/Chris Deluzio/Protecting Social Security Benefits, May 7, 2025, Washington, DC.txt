Protecting Social Security Benefits


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1690821/protecting-social-security-benefits


Mr. DELUZIO. Mr. Speaker, I represent more than 180,000 people in  western Pennsylvania who receive Social Security benefits. Those are  earned benefits. My constituents receive more than $350 million of  those monthly benefits.

I join my colleagues in sounding the alarm on this administration's  attacks on the bedrock national promise of Social Security, which Mr.  Musk called a Ponzi scheme. We have already seen firings in the Social  Security Administration, threatening to close field offices, a website  crashing several times in March, a plan to end paper checks as an  option, and DOGE accessing sensitive data systems.

All of this puts people at risk, and the impact will be clear. It  means longer waits and travel times to get the benefits people have  earned, putting those benefits at risk.

My office has gotten hundreds and hundreds of calls from constituents  who are worried about their Social Security benefits. My Social  Security telephone townhall had nearly 18,000 people. More than 2,000  folks responded to my survey about these problems. Why? People are  worried about their earned benefits,

Mr. Speaker, I will continue to stand strong against these attacks on  Social Security.
