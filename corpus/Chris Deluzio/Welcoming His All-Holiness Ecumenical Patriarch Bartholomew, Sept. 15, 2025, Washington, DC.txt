Mr. DELUZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome His All-Holiness  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, D.C.

As the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, His All-Holiness  Bartholomew, is the spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians  worldwide, including thousands living in Western Pennsylvania. Since  his election as the 270th Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome in  1991, His All-Holiness has continuously worked to promote religious  freedoms, human rights, and stronger environmental protections.

Through the tireless work to promote international peace and  religious tolerance, His All-Holiness was awarded the Gold Medal of  Congress during his visit in 1997. During this current visit to the  United States, His All-Holiness will receive the Templeton Prize, the  prestigious award honoring contribution in religion and science.

I welcome His All-Holiness to Washington, D.C. and I congratulate him  on his great achievement.
