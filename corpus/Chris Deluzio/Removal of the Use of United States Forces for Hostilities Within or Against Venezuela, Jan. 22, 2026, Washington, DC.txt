Mr. DELUZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for the  time.

Mr. Speaker, to respond to the notion of hypocrisy, that we should  rely on the Secretary of State's notification when required, we were  not notified--the Congress did not receive notification--or asked for  authorization before Americans were sent to fight and to bleed in  Venezuela.

Seven Americans were wounded in that military operation. There is a  functional blockade of Venezuelan oil. As others have pointed out here,  Mr. Speaker, an aircraft carrier strike group sits nearby, poised to  again send Americans into Venezuela should the President order it.

Let's talk about hypocrisy. In the 118th Congress, this body voted on  two War Powers Resolutions to remove Americans from hostilities that  had not been authorized by the Congress. In those two votes, 52  Republicans and 47 Republicans, respectively, thought that Congress  ought to have a say about our war powers. What has changed? The party  of the occupant of the White House. Be consistent, Mr. Speaker.

I support this resolution.
