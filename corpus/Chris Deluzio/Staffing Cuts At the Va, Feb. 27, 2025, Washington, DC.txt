Staffing Cuts At the Va

Mr. DELUZIO. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago we saw more than 1,000 staff  being fired at the VA. Then, this week, 1,400 more staffers were fired  at the VA.

Who are these folks?

They support the veterans' crisis hotline. They take care of medical  research, studying cancer, mental health, you name it, and burn pit  exposure.

Mr. Speaker, remember that the Federal Government is the largest  veteran employer in the United States. Around one-third of all VA  employees are veterans themselves.

Yesterday, we learned the Trump administration is canceling more than  800 VA contracts.

Do you know what these things fund, Mr. Speaker?

Getting toxic exposed veterans access to their records to prove their  claims, cancer care for veterans, and calibrating radiation detection  equipment. I could go on and on.

It is a betrayal to attack veterans' care. We do not send young  Americans off to fight wars and then when they come back to this  country, we betray them by attacking the VA.

Mr. Speaker, do you want to talk about fiscal responsibility?

Then go look at the fraud, waste, and abuse at the Pentagon. Go tax  billionaires and offshoring corporations. We don't do it on the backs  of veterans.

This is unacceptable, and we are going to fight this every way we  can.
