Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in tribute of our friend and  colleague, Doug LaMalfa.

When I arrived in Congress in 2015, I noticed a large man with long  hair. He was a big man, but the biggest thing about Doug LaMalfa was  his heart.

As Secretary, I got the opportunity to tour his district that had  been devastated by wildfires. I walked with him and looked at the  devastation, the despair of people losing their lives and everything  they had, and Doug knew them by name.

He cared. He cared about every Member of this institution, but, more  importantly, he cared about the people he represented. He cared about  their life, their values, and represented them as well or better than  anyone that has ever served in this great body.

Mr. Speaker, today, we mark the passing but also the privilege of  knowing a great man. It is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that we all learn from  Doug LaMalfa and understand that we represent the people. We give  prayer to his family, but take solace to know that Doug is with his  maker.
