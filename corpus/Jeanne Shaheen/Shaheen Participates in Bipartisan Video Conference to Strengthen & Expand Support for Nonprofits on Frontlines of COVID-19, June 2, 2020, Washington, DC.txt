Shaheen Participates in Bipartisan Video Conference to Strengthen & Expand Support for Nonprofits on Frontlines of COVID-19


Today, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) joined U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), Chris Coons (D-DE), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and James Lankford (R-OK) in a bipartisan video conference with a coalition of national nonprofits to call for the passage of a universal charitable deduction in upcoming COVID-19 relief legislation.

Nonprofits have been on the frontlines of this public health emergency, helping to feed, care for and provide medical assistance to the most vulnerable communities in New Hampshire and across the United States. However, as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, nonprofits have faced a decline in donations.  During the call, Senator Shaheen and her colleagues highlighted their support for the universal charitable deduction, which would encourage charitable donations from Americans and help ensure nonprofits have the financial resources they need to continue their vital work. 

"The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated serious issues in our communities, from access to affordable health care to food insecurity, making the services of our non-profit organizations more vital than ever. Increased demand coupled with a fall in donations from the economic impact of this crisis means many nonprofits are now facing significant hardships. They need financial relief and they need it now," said Shaheen. "I appreciate the input today from organizations across the country that are working every day on the frontlines. The universal charitable deduction would increase charitable giving and help ensure nonprofits have the resources they need to continue their important work. This, and robust financial assistance for our non-profits, will be among my top priorities in upcoming COVID-19 relief legislation."
