Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 1602 and  ask that it be reported by number.

Mrs. SHAHEEN. This bipartisan amendment supports extending vital  healthcare tax credits for working families.

Twenty-two million Americans rely on premium tax credits to get the  healthcare they need, but those tax credits are supposed to expire this  year. Without our action, people will see the cost of their premiums  increase by $3,000 next year, and millions will lose their healthcare.

I want to thank my colleague Senator Murkowski for her work on this  issue.

I urge adoption of this amendment and ask for a voice vote only if  everybody votes yes--just seeing if you are awake.
