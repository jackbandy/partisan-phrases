Shaheen Encourages Granite Staters to Visit New IRS Website to Enroll in Direct Deposit & Get Information on COVID-19 Recovery Payments


Today, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury launched a new IRS website enabling Granite Staters and Americans who do not normally file tax returns to enter their direct deposit information, allowing them to receive their CARES Act stimulus relief check as quickly and securely as possible.

"Americans in New Hampshire and across the country are hurting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and need any and all relief that is available to them right now," said Shaheen. "That's why I'm glad the U.S. Treasury and the IRS launched a new website to help more Americans access the direct assistance payments as quickly as possible. The administration must continue to work around the clock to improve implementation of the new economic relief law to ensure financial help gets to everyone who needs it. I encourage Granite Staters who do not normally file tax returns to visit this new page and follow the directions so they will receive their relief payment as quickly and securely as possible."

Shaheen has worked to ensure all eligible Americans are able to receive these payments automatically. Last week, she sent a letter calling on the administration to issue stimulus checks automatically to Social Security beneficiaries. As a result of Shaheen and her colleagues' letter, the Trump administration relented. Shaheen also sent a letter with colleagues urging the administration to send these payments to recipients of VA benefits and those on the Supplemental Security Income program.
