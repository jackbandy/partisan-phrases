Shaheen Voices Strong Opposition to Trump Administration Guidance to States that Allows for Block Granting State Medicaid Programs


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement after the Trump administration opened the door for all states to apply to block grant their respective Medicaid programs, which would cap the funding that states receive for this program:   

"The current funding model for Medicaid programs allows for the program to adapt based on local need," said Shaheen. "Nearly 75 million Americans and 180,000 Granite Staters rely on Medicaid to access the health care they need to live healthy, productive lives. Imposing block grants would cap funding for this program and would lead to reduced access to care for Granite Staters, particularly those who have received coverage through Medicaid expansion provided by the Affordable Care Act. As New Hampshire battles the worst public health crisis in its history, Medicaid expansion has been one of our best tools for getting treatment coverage to those who need it most--this is not the time to be undermining this vital program. I will continue to stand for the long-term strength of the Medicaid program and resist efforts by the Trump administration to erode health care coverage."   

Senator Shaheen has requested that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Alex Azar disclose the legal authority that is being used to authorize block grants for state Medicaid programs. She has yet to receive a detailed answer from HHS.
