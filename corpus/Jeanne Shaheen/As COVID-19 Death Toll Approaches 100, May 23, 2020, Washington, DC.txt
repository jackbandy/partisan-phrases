As COVID-19 Death Toll Approaches 100,000 in U.S., Shaheen Joins Call for National Moment of Silence to Honor the Lives Lost


As more Americans tragically lose their fight to the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) introduced legislation with Senators Schatz (D-HI), Blackburn (R-TN), Coons (D-DE) and Murkowski (R-AK) this week to pay tribute to the victims of COVID-19 with a moment of silence at 12:00 pm on Monday, June 1, 2020. More than 4,000 Granite Staters have tested positive for COVID-19 and over 200 have lost their lives to the virus. 

"Every life lost to this virus is heartbreaking and represents another family and community in mourning. The human toll of the COVID-19 emergency is tragic, and to get through it, we must stand together. This bill helps us do that by recognizing the Americans who have succumbed to this virus and showing solidarity with their loved ones in honoring their memory," said Shaheen. "Together, we will fight through and overcome this unprecedented crisis."   

The bill is also cosponsored by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Tina Smith (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Patty Murray (D-WA) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).
