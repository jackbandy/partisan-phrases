  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am so pleased to be able to join  Leader Schumer and my colleague and ranking member of the small  business committee, Senator Cardin. I am grateful for his leadership  and for the partnership that we had back in March with Senators Rubio  and Collins. It truly was a bipartisan partnership to try and address  the challenges that small businesses are facing across this country. 

  In New Hampshire small businesses are our lifeblood. They were going  under because of this pandemic, so the Paycheck Protection Program has  been a lifesaver. But we know there are things that need to change  about it in order for it to continue to help those businesses. 

  In New Hampshire we have 22,000 small businesses and nonprofits that  have received over $2.5 billion in forgivable loans under the program. 

  But we have also heard from many of those businesses that there are  improvements and fixes that are necessary, businesses like The Little  Grille, a New Hampshire restaurant with locations in Littleton and  Woodsville. They said that PPP has been a lifesaver. But they have only  2 weeks remaining on their forgivable term, and if the terms of the  loan are not addressed, the owners of The Little Grille told us that  they will be back in the same position they were at the start of the  pandemic, and they may be forced to lay off staff. 

  We have heard from the Portsmouth Brewery, which received their PPP  loan, and they want to rehire their 28 employees but they need more  flexibility and extensions to the program to resume operations. 

  Then, of course, we have heard from Big Dave's Bagels & Deli in North  Conway. His 32-year-old bakery was predominantly takeout before the  pandemic, but he was able to keep his employees on and offer hazard pay  because his approval for the PPP loan came through at the very end of  April. Now he needs flexibility and loan terms if he is going to keep  his employees on the payroll. 

  I could go on and on with example after example, but the important  thing is, as Senators Schumer and Cardin have said so eloquently, those  first loans are about to end, and if we don't do something to help  those businesses, they are going to be back in the same place that they  were in in March when the shelter-at-home and the stay-at-home orders  began in New Hampshire and across this country. 

  So we need to do something. This legislation addresses the concerns  that people have expressed. I think we also need to provide additional  funding or additional help over the next month until things open back  up in the economy. 

  But, in the short term, the legislation addresses the concerns that  we have been hearing from small businesses, and I hope we are going to  see our colleagues pass it by unanimous consent so that there is some  certainty for those businesses as they try and open back up in this  very difficult environment.

  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Will my colleague from Wisconsin yield for a question? 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Do I understand that you think you will have some  resolution of this by this afternoon, so you expect at that point to  come back in with another UC request to pass this bill?

  Mrs. SHAHEEN. That is my understanding of the bill; it doesn't allow  you to apply for the loan through December.
