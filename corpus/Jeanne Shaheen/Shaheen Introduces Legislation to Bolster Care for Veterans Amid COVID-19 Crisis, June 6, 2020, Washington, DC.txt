Shaheen Introduces Legislation to Bolster Care for Veterans Amid COVID-19 Crisis


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen introduced two pieces of legislation this week to bolster care for veterans amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The bills -- the Emergency Care for Veterans During the COVID-19 Pandemic Act and the Debt Relief for Veterans During the COVID-19 Pandemic Act -- would ensure New Hampshire veterans can access emergency care without incurring massive medical bills during this crisis and would temporarily suspend Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) debt collection efforts. Congressman Chris Pappas (NH-01) introduced companion legislation in the House for both bills in April. 

"Ensuring New Hampshire veterans have access to medical care -- COVID-19 related or not -- and prioritizing their financial security during this crisis must be top priorities. That's why I've introduced this legislation," said Shaheen. "Our country owes veterans a debt we can never truly repay, but the least we can do is work together to secure their health and well-being, especially during this unprecedented crisis. I urge members on both sides of the aisle to join me in this effort so together we can deliver relief and peace of mind to our veterans during these troubling times." 

The Emergency Care for Veterans During the COVID-19 Pandemic Act would allow veterans accessing emergency medical care and services and COVID-19 care during the pandemic to receive reimbursement from the VA for those services regardless of their disability status or the provider they visit. The Debt Relief for Veterans During the COVID-19 Pandemic Act would prohibit the VA from seeking repayment from veterans on outstanding debts until the COVID-19 health emergency is over.
