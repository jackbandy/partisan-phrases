Shaheen Statement on USMCA Trade Agreement Being Signed into Law


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement after the President signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law: 

"International trade has long spurred New Hampshire's economy, creating good paying jobs and opportunities for small businesses," said Shaheen. "This trade deal makes improvements to NAFTA that will help empower Granite State businesses while protecting American workers and safeguarding our environment. I was very pleased that this agreement was substantially improved by the priorities pressed by Democratic leaders in Congress in negotiations with the Trump administration. I hope Congress can build on this bipartisanship by working across the aisle to address the many other critical concerns impacting middle-class families throughout the country." 

Senator Shaheen has long supported trade agreements and programs that increase opportunities and growth for New Hampshire businesses. Shaheen helped create the State Trade Expansion Program (STEP) as a pilot program in 2010 to help small businesses enter new markets, access export financing and attend trade missions. The program was fully authorized by Senator Shaheen's small business trade amendment, which was signed into law in 2016. Senator Shaheen has prioritized efforts in Congress to help small businesses boost their exports. Shaheen was also the first New Hampshire Governor to lead trade missions outside of North America.
