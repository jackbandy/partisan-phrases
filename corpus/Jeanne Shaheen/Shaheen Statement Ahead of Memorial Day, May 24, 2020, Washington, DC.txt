Shaheen Statement Ahead of Memorial Day


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement in observance of Memorial Day:

"Generations of Granite Staters have answered the call to serve, and I join with everyone across our state in remembering those who gave their lives to protect our security and our freedoms. Memorial Day this year comes at a time when many Americans are being asked to sacrifice for the greater good. One way we can pay tribute to our fallen heroes is to renew our commitment to take care of our fellow Americans during our current crisis, especially the veterans who made it home. I encourage all Americans to find time to pause today to honor our fallen service members, and to continue to look out for your friends, family members and neighbors during these trying times."
