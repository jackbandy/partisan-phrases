Shaheen Statement on War Powers Resolution


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, issued the following statement after voting in favor of a Senate War Powers resolution that would require the President of the United States to stop military action targeting Iran within 30 days unless Congress consents. The bill passed 55 to 45 with bipartisan support. 

"The Constitution is clear: the power to declare war resides in Congress, and we need to have a discussion and debate on future armed conflict operations against Iran," said Shaheen. "This resolution passed on a bipartisan basis and sends a clear message to the Executive that Congress' duty to provide oversight needs to be upheld. Our nation has been embroiled in costly wars for two decades in the Middle East -- the American people should have a say in the United States' involvement in any long-term decision to go to war with Iran or any other country. It's time for the President to step back from the brink and engage with Congress, our diplomats and U.S. allies to find a path forward to de-escalate the tension with Iran and ultimately develop a serious strategy in the Middle East."
