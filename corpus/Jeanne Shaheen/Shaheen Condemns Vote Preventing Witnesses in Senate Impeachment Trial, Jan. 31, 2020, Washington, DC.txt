Shaheen Condemns Vote Preventing Witnesses in Senate Impeachment Trial


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement after a Senate vote to allow witnesses in the Senate impeachment trial failed to garner enough votes. Senator Shaheen voted in favor of witnesses testifying in the trial. 

"Congress has an obligation to the Constitution and the American people to conduct a fair trial and examine all the evidence. Witnesses have been a part of every Senate impeachment trial in history and this vote sets a very dangerous precedent," said Shaheen. "In no way can this be understood as a fair trial. John Bolton's testimony, and that of other members of the administration, can provide further evidence of the fundamental charges. This vote rewards the Trump administration's stonewalling of Congress, a co-equal branch of government, as it exercises one of its most serious constitutional responsibilities."
