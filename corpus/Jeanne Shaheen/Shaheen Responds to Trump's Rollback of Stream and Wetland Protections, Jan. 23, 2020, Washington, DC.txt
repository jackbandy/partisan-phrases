Shaheen Responds to Trump's Rollback of Stream and Wetland Protections


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement in response to the Trump administration's decision to move forward with plans to roll back critical Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations that protect New England's streams and wetlands. On Sunday, Shaheen slammed the administration's proposal to reject the advice of the EPA's own scientific advisors and revoke key environmental protections as "reckless" and a "direct threat to water quality in New Hampshire." 

"I am deeply disappointed that this administration continues to sideline and muzzle scientific evidence -- this is having a detrimental effect on our environment. Rolling back these critical environmental protections puts New England wetlands, streams and water supplies at risk," said Shaheen. "The Trump administration's misguided rule will enable more pollutants to enter New Hampshire's valuable wetlands and is a direct threat to water quality in our state, adding to the challenging remediation efforts our state already faces. Families in New Hampshire need to have confidence that their tap water is safe and this rule takes us in precisely the wrong direction."
