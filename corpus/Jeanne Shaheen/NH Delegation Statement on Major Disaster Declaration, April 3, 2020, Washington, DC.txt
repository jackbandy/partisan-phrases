NH Delegation Statement on Major Disaster Declaration


Today, U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and U.S. Representatives Annie Kuster and Chris Pappas released the following statement after President Donald Trump approved Governor Chris Sununu's request for a Major Disaster Declaration for New Hampshire in response to COVID-19: 

"We are glad that President Trump heeded our call to swiftly approve Governor Sununu's request for a major disaster declaration, which unlocks additional funding from the latest bipartisan legislation Congress passed to respond to this crisis. People, health care facilities, and small businesses across our state need relief now, and we will keep doing everything in our power to ensure that the administration delivers emergency resources quickly and effectively."

Earlier this week, the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation called on President Trump to approve the major disaster declaration. The CARES Act, which Congress passed and the president signed last week, includes an additional $45 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund. Now that the president approved New Hampshire's request for a disaster declaration, the state will be eligible for reimbursements from the Disaster Relief Fund for expenses related to COVID-19.
