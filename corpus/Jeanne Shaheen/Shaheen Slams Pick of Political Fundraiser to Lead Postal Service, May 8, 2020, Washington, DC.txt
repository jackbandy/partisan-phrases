Shaheen Slams Pick of Political Fundraiser to Lead Postal Service, Threat to Rural Delivery


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement on the selection of Louis DeJoy, a top fundraiser for Trump and the Republican Party, to serve as Postmaster General:

 "Granite Staters want to be assured that the Postal Service will continue to provide them with reliable, affordable service, especially now as mail delivery is even more vital during social distancing," said Shaheen. "However, President Trump has made it clear that he wants postage rates to be quadrupled and for the Postal Service to be privatized, which is a direct threat to rural delivery, and now he has a political operative to advance this agenda. I'm going to fight this agenda with everything I've got. Granite Staters, particularly seniors and those in remote rural areas, rely on the Postal Service for delivery of medication, stimulus checks, tax refunds, absentee voting and many other essentials. Our nation's founders intended for the Postal Service to serve the entire nation equally and fairly--under no circumstances should the Postal Service be radically restructured for political purposes."

 Last month, Senator Shaheen led the New Hampshire congressional delegation in a letter to congressional leadership, urging them to include relief for the U.S. Postal Service in future COVID-19 relief legislation, calling President Trump's plan to quadruple rates "outrageous."
