Shaheen Statement on Roe v. Wade Decision Anniversary


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement on the 47th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision: 

"The Roe v. Wade decision was a landmark case that determined legal and constitutional safeguards for what many of us already morally believed to be true: women's reproductive health care decisions belong to them, not their government," said Shaheen. "In addition to reducing the number of dangerous back-alley abortions, the impact of Roe has been felt dramatically over the last 47 years. Roe v. Wade ushered in a new era for women's health that expanded family planning services and contraceptives, which have helped reduce abortion rates to historic lows. Today, I join the women all across this country who are speaking out loud and clear: we are not going back! Women should be able to make their own decisions about their bodies, their health care and their future -- Roe v. Wade has protected those freedoms for nearly five decades. 

"As we look back on years of progress, we do so knowing that the rights secured by Roe v. Wade have never been more in danger since the decision was first handed down. Republican efforts to overturn Roe, restrictive state laws that seek to shut down abortion clinics and the Trump administration's incessant attacks on family planning programs continue to put women's health at stake," continued Shaheen. "I'm inspired by the groundswell of activism by women and girls of all ages in response to these attacks and I believe that together we can fight off these efforts and keep pushing forward. We stand on the shoulders of generations of women who fought to get us here -- we can't go back. We won't go back."
