Shaheen Hosts Conference Call with NH Tourism & Hospitality Businesses Following Senate Passage of Bill to Improve PPP


Today, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) hosted a conference call with New Hampshire tourism and hospitality leaders to discuss needs and areas of concern as the tourism and hospitality industries, which play key roles in the State, continue to grapple with the economic fallout from COVID-19. During the call, Shaheen heard more about their experiences and challenges they have faced operating in the present environment, and shared an update from the Senate on legislative efforts to provide relief to these hard-hit industries, including news of passage of the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act -- bipartisan legislation that improves the Paycheck Protection Program to ensure funding assistance reaches small businesses that need it most. The changes included in this legislation had been requested by many Granite State small businesses.

"Small businesses in New Hampshire's tourism and hospitality sectors are among the hardest hit from this crisis. As they made clear to me during our conversation -- they need help to keep their doors open and they need it now," said Shaheen. "The challenges they have faced are why I've worked across the aisle to provide critical financial support to our small businesses through the PPP, and supported legislation that has now passed the Senate to give them flexibility as to how they can use this funding and on fast-approaching deadlines. I will be sharing the feedback I heard today with my colleagues in the Senate and the Trump administration, and will continue to press for more relief legislation to help these businesses get through this crisis."
