Shaheen Statement Following Iran's Attacks on Bases Housing U.S. Personnel in Iraq


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement after Iran launched ballistic missile attacks on Iraqi military installations housing U.S troops:  

"Tonight my thoughts are with our military men and women in uniform in Iraq and throughout the Middle East," said Shaheen. "I continue to urge the Trump administration to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of our service members and diplomats in the region. I strongly condemn the use of ballistic missiles by Iran. Iran and the Trump administration must engage in diplomacy to de-escalate the situation. We do not yet know the full extent of the damage done and response by Iran. I expect the administration to fully brief Congress on what we know and what the next steps are. I remain adamant that war is not in America's or Iran's interest."
