Shaheen Calls on President Trump to Apologize for TBI Comments


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, called on President Trump to apologize for comments that minimized the Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) experienced by service members in Iraq following missile strikes by Iran:  

"For generations, battlefield traumatic brain injuries were not understood and often dismissed," said Shaheen. "As a society, we've come a long way to better recognize and treat TBI, and sympathize with those who are suffering. However, the President's ignorant comments are a step backwards, especially coming from the Commander in Chief. He owes an apology to service members who are suffering with these injuries and should develop a better understanding of the seriousness of TBI."
