Shaheen Hosts COVID-19 Conference Call with Law Enforcement Officers


Today, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) hosted a conference call with law enforcement officers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the conference call, Shaheen heard about their experiences serving their communities and the State during this public health crisis. Shaheen also provided an update on her efforts in Washington to support their work and service in future COVID-19 relief legislation. The call continues Shaheen's telework efforts to hear directly from leaders all across the State who are responding to this public health emergency, including firefighters and EMTs, school administrators and teachers, local officials, small business owners, health care providers and non-profit service organizations and charities.

"I want to express my deepest gratitude to our brave law enforcement officers throughout New Hampshire, who have been going above and beyond the call of duty to serve our communities during these extraordinarily difficult times," said Shaheen. "The federal government has a responsibility to provide these first responders and their communities with the resources and support they need to perform their duties, while staying healthy and safe on the job. I appreciate the opportunity I had today to hear firsthand their experiences amidst COVID-19 and will continue to make them a top priority as Congress continues to discuss upcoming relief legislation."
