Shaheen Statement Ahead of the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement ahead of the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day:

"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a sobering reminder of how connected we are to each other and to our environment. Many Granite Staters have found solace during these troubling times in nature -- something that can't be taken for granted. While it is difficult to think about much beyond responding to this public health crisis, we are still facing a long-term environmental crisis in climate change. As Granite Staters, we are truly fortunate to be surrounded by so much natural beauty, which also serves as an invaluable economic resource. On the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, we are reminded of the importance of protecting our environment for future generations."

Senator Shaheen is a leader in the Senate for safeguarding our natural environment. She helped introduce the International Climate Accountability Act -- legislation to prevent President Trump from using funds to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement and direct the administration to develop a strategic plan for the U.S. to meet its commitment under the Agreement. Shaheen also introduced widely praised bipartisan legislation with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) to save American homes and businesses billions of dollars in energy costs and dramatically reduce the United States' carbon footprint. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen is a vocal advocate of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and supports bipartisan legislation to permanently fund and authorize the program.
