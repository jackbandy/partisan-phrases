Shaheen Statement After Senate Passage of USMCA Trade Agreement


U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement after voting to approve the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA): 

"International trade has long spurred New Hampshire's economy, creating good paying jobs and opportunities for small businesses," said Shaheen. "This trade deal makes improvements to NAFTA that will help empower Granite State businesses while protecting American workers and safeguarding our environment. I was very pleased that this agreement was substantially improved by the priorities pressed by Democratic leaders in Congress in negotiations with the Trump administration. I'm very glad to see bipartisan progress on this issue and hope we can build on this work in Congress by addressing the many other critical concerns impacting middle-class families throughout the country." 

Senator Shaheen has long supported trade agreements and programs that increase opportunities and growth for New Hampshire businesses. Shaheen helped create the State Trade Expansion Program (STEP) as a pilot program in 2010 to help small businesses enter new markets, access export financing and attend trade missions. The program was fully authorized by Senator Shaheen's small business trade amendment, which was signed into law in 2016. Senator Shaheen has prioritized efforts in Congress to help small businesses boost their exports. Shaheen was also the first New Hampshire Governor to lead trade missions outside of North America.
