Shaheen Joins Nashua High School South Class Via Zoom & Takes Student Questions


Today, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) joined a remote learning classroom via Zoom with students from Nashua High School South's "Woman as Hero" class. Shaheen -- the first woman in New Hampshire to be elected Governor and later Senator, and the first woman in U.S. history to serve as both -- spoke about her experiences as a woman in government, provided updates on her efforts to support New Hampshire during the COVID-19 crisis and took questions from the class.

"This is such a thoughtful class filled with future Granite State leaders. I really enjoyed our conversation and answering their important questions," said Shaheen. "These are very difficult times, but I'm heartened by the hard work, dedication and enthusiasm I saw from these students and their teacher to adapt to the challenges of remote learning. I especially want to thank Sarah Paling for inviting me to join her class this morning, and for her tireless efforts to ensure her students continue to get the best education possible."

Earlier this month, Shaheen joined the students of Holderness Central School's 4th grade social studies class and Northwood Elementary School's 8th grade social studies class via Zoom, both of which are now learning remotely as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In March, Shaheen called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to help provide Wi-Fi hotspots or devices with Wi-Fi capability to students who lack internet access at home. Shaheen also sent a letter urging increased federal funding for schools and school employees, such as cafeteria staff, bus drivers and custodians, who are working overtime to support their communities during the pandemic. In addition, Shaheen wrote to the U.S. Department of Education expressing concern for children with disabilities amid the school closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
