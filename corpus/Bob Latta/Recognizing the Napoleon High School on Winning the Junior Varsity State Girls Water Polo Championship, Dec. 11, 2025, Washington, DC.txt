Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school water polo  team in Ohio's 5th Congressional District. The young women of the  Napoleon High School junior varsity girls water polo team  have represented their school ably on their way to achieving the JV  State Girls Water Polo Title. In their effort to surpass all other  teams, the Lady Wildcats overcame the challenges posed by intense  competition.

In pursuing the State Championship, the Lady Wildcats defeated Upper  Arlington to win the state championship. The members of this very  special team have shown that their sport requires an individual effort  for a team result. Their hard work and dedication, both in and out of  the pool, in achieving this accomplishment, is truly outstanding.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to the Napoleon High School junior varsity girls water polo team. On  behalf of the people of the 5th District of Ohio, I am proud to  recognize this great achievement.
