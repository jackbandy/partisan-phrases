Special Recognition of the Life and Service of Orval Mullen


Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and remember the  life and service of a dedicated American veteran, Mr. Orval Mullens of  Oakwood, Ohio. Orval, who celebrated his 103rd birthday in February,  passed away on May 15, 2025. Orval led a long, productive life, and I  am honored to have the opportunity to recognize his many  accomplishments in life, especially his service to our Nation.

During World War II, Orval served as a field lineman in the Eighth  Regiment of the Fourth Infantry of the U.S. Army from October 14, 1942,  to September 25, 1945. Orval landed on Utah Beach on D-Day, June 6,  1944, and he fought in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. In  April of 1945, Orval and the soldiers of the Eighth Regiment assisted  in the liberation of the concentration camp at Dachau. He was awarded  two Purple Hearts for his service. He also received a Bronze Star and  the French Legion of Honor, as well as several other medals.

After completing his military service, he started O.H. Mullen Sales  in the 1950s and owned and operated the business until the mid-1980s.  His company manufactured, sold, and distributed archery equipment. He  married Luella Conley on October 24, 1942, and they were together for  74 years until her passing in 2016. They had three children: Dr. Orval  Lee Mullen, James Mullen of Oakwood, and Judith Wieging of Willshire.  The family has grown to include grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to the life and service of Orval Mullen. On behalf of the Fifth  Congressional District of Ohio, it is my honor to recognize his  contributions to our Nation, community, and his family. Our thoughts  and prayers are with his family as they celebrate his long life.
