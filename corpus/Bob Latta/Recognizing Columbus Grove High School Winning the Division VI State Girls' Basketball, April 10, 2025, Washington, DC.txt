Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school basketball  team in Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. The young women of the  Columbus Grove High School girls' basketball team have represented  their school ably on their way to achieving the Division VI State Girls  Basketball Title. In their effort to surpass all other teams in the  Division VI State Basketball Playoffs, the Columbus Grove Bulldogs  overcame the challenges posed by intense competition.

In pursuing the State Championship, the Columbus Grove Lady Bulldogs  defeated the Rootstown Rovers to win their first state basketball  championship. The members of this very special team have shown that  their sport requires an individual effort for a team result. Their hard  work and dedication, both on and off the court, in achieving this  accomplishment, is truly outstanding.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to the Columbus Grove High School girls' basketball team. On behalf of  the people of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this  great achievement. Congratulations and go Bulldogs.
