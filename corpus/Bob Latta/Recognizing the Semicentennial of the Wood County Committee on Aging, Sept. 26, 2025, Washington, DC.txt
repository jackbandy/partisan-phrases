Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Semicentennial  of the Wood County Committee on Aging. For five decades, the Committee  has been dedicated to service, community, and care for all seniors in  Wood County. The hard work and spirit shown by staff at the Committee  have made it possible for countless older adults to remain independent  and improve their quality of life.

Founded in 1975, the Wood County Committee on Aging was established  to provide comprehensive services to the county's seniors. These  services have grown over the decades to include programs for home- delivered meals, medical transportation, health and wellness  initiatives, caregiver support, and much more. With senior centers  across the county, the Committee has been able to help elderly adults  and their families navigate the challenges that can arise while aging.

Mr. Speaker, by celebrating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Wood  County Committee on Aging, the county can recognize the outstanding  achievements of the staff and pride the patrons have for their senior  centers. I congratulate the Committee on Aging on this momentous  milestone. I thank them for all they do for our county's seniors.
