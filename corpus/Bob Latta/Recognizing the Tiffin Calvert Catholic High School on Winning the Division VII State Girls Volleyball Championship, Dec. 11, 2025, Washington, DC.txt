Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school volleyball  team in Ohio's 5th Congressional District. The young women of the  Tiffin Calvert Catholic High School girls volleyball team have  represented their school ably on their way to achieving the Division  VII State Girls Volleyball Title. In their effort to surpass all other  teams in the Division VII State Volleyball Playoffs, the Calvert  Senecas overcame the challenges posed by intense competition.

In pursuing the State Championship, Tiffin Calvert defeated the  Monroeville Eagles to win the state volleyball championship. The  members of this very special team have shown that their sport requires  an individual effort for a team result. Their hard work and dedication,  both on and off the field, in achieving this accomplishment, is truly  outstanding.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to the Tiffin Calvert Catholic High School girls volleyball team. On  behalf of the people of the 5th District of Ohio, I am proud to  recognize this great achievement.
