Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school track and  field relay team in Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. The young  women of the Coldwater High School's Girls 4x400 Meter Relay team have  represented their school ably on their way to achieving the Division  III State Track and Field Title. The team overcame the challenges posed  by intense competition in their effort to surpass all other relay teams  in their event.

In pursuing the State Championship, Audrey Alig, Lana Kaiser,  Kiersten Keller, and Isabella Zahn defeated their outstanding  competitors to win with an impressive time of 3:53.94. The members of  this very special team have shown that their sport requires an  individual effort for a team result. Their hard work and dedication,  both on and off the track, in achieving this accomplishment should be  commended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Coldwater  High School Girls 4x400 Meter Relay team. On behalf of the people of  the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great  achievement.
