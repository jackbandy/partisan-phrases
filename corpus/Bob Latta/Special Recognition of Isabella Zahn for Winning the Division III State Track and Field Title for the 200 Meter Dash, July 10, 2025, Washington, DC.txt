Special Recognition of Isabella Zahn for Winning the Division III State Track and Field Title for the 200 Meter Dash, 400 Meter Dash, and Long Jump


Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school athlete  from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. Isabella Zahn, a senior at  Coldwater High School, has represented her school ably on her way to  achieving three Division III State Titles for the 200 Meter Dash, 400  Meter Dash, and Girls Long Jump at the State Track and Field Meet. Anna  overcame the challenges posed by intense competition in her effort to  win the title.

In pursuing the State Championship, Anna defeated her opponents with  an impressive time of 23.04 seconds in the 200 Meter Dash, 54.56  seconds in the 400 Meter Dash, and a jump of 18-08.50 in the Girls Long  Jump. Her hard work and dedication, both on and off the track, in  achieving this accomplishment is truly outstanding. She has achieved an  impressive season, bringing pride to her school and community.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to Isabella Zahn of Coldwater High School. On behalf of the people of  the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great  achievement.
