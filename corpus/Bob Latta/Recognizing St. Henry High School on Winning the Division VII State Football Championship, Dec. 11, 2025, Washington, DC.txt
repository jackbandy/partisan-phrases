Recognizing St. Henry High School on Winning the Division VII State Football Championship


Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school football  team in Ohio's 5th Congressional District. The young men of the St.  Henry High School football team have represented their school ably on  their way to achieving the Division VII State Football Title. In their  effort to surpass all other teams in the Division VII State Football  Playoffs, the St. Henry Redskins overcame the challenges posed by  intense competition.

In pursuing the State Championship, the St. Henry Redskins defeated  the Hillsdale Falcons to win the state football championship. The  members of this very special team have shown that their sport requires  an individual effort for a team result. Their hard work and dedication,  both on and off the field, in achieving this accomplishment, is truly  outstanding.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to the St. Henry High School football team. On behalf of the people of  the 5th District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great  achievement.
