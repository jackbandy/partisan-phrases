Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act


Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding me time.

Mr. Speaker, for 4 years I have worked tirelessly with my colleague  from Virginia's Ninth District to pass the HALT Fentanyl Act. In 2023,  we saw over 107,000 overdose deaths, 75,000 of those attributed to  synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl-related substances.

Currently, fentanyl and fentanyl analogues temporarily fall under  schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the CSA, due to a  temporary scheduling order that runs through September 30 of this year.

This bill would permanently place fentanyl analogues into schedule I  of the CSA. A schedule I controlled substance is a drug, substance, or  chemical that has a high potential for abuse,  has no currently accepted medical value, and is subject to regulatory  controls and administrative civil and criminal penalties.

Today, this Chamber is permanently scheduling fentanyl-related  substances as schedule I.

We owe it to our communities, our constituents, the families, and to  the victims. Cartels are quite literally killing Americans for ten  cents. Among teens, fentanyl poisoning accounted for an average of 22  deaths per week in 2022.

Fentanyl is the number one cause of death among adults 18 to 49, more  than cancer, heart disease, and car accidents. This isn't about  criminal justice reform. This is about victims getting justice.

Currently, to trigger a 10-year mandatory minimum, an offense must  involve 100 or more grams of a mixture containing a fentanyl analogue.  Two milligrams of fentanyl will kill. This means 100 grams of fentanyl  analogue can kill roughly 50,000 people.

Mr. Speaker, I thank our Senate colleagues for passing this critical  legislation, and I encourage all of my House colleagues to support the  HALT Fentanyl Act so we can get this to the President's desk and stop  the greatest poisoning in American history.
