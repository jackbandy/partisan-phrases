Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school track and  field team in Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. The young women of  the Coldwater High School Girls Track and Field Team have represented  their school ably on their way to achieving the Division III State  Track and Field Title. The team overcame the challenges posed by  intense competition in their effort to surpass all other teams at the  2025 OHSAA Division III State Track and Field Championships.

In pursuing the State Championship, the Cavaliers defeated their  outstanding competitors to win with an impressive 65.5 points. The  members of this very special team have shown that their sport requires  an individual effort for a team result. Their hard work and dedication,  both on and off the track, in achieving this accomplishment should be  commended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Coldwater  High School Girls Track and Field Team. On behalf of the people of the  Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great achievement.
