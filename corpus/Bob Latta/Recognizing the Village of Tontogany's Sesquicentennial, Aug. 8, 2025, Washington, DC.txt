Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Village of  Tontogany's Sesquicentennial. The perseverance of pioneers and settlers  to overcome come the challenges faced during the early years of the  village's history has persisted throughout the past 150 years. The hard  work and spirit shown by generations of village residents have made  Tontogany an outstanding example of American ingenuity.

Tontogany's long history dates back to the first settlers to settle  in the area, Samuel and Eliza Hamilton. The village's name comes from  the Ottawa Native American Chief Tondoganie. When it was officially  incorporated in 1895, the town was an agricultural village, populated  by farmers. Keeping with the village's small town charm, the original  village hall built in 1898 is still used today. In 1900, The  Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton Railway depot was constructed, allowing  the village to continue its agricultural commerce. In 1958, Tontogany  became the home of the newly formed Otsego Local School District which  was formed when the state pushed for smaller districts to merge.

Mr. Speaker, by celebrating the 150th Anniversary of the Village of  Tontogany, community members recognize the outstanding  achievements, maintain the pioneer attitude, and strive to better their  village through the principles on which it was founded. I thank and  congratulate Tontogany on this significant milestone.
