Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school track and  field relay team in Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. The young men  of the Seneca East High School Boys 4 x 800 Meter Relay team have  represented their school ably on their way to achieving the Division  III State Track and Field Title. The team overcame the challenges posed  by intense competition in their effort to surpass all other relay teams  in their event.

In pursuing the State Championship, Evan Schiefer, Bradley Smith,  Ayden Perkins, and Owen Gahring defeated their outstanding competitors  to win with an impressive time of 7:57.32, a new school record. The  members of this very special team have shown that their sport requires  an individual effort for a team result. Their hard work and dedication,  both on and off the track, in achieving this accomplishment should be  commended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Seneca  East High Boys 4 x 800 Meter Relay team. On behalf of the people of the  Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great achievement.
