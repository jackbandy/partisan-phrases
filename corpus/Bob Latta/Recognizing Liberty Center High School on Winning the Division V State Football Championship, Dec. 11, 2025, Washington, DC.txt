Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school football  team in Ohio's 5th Congressional District. The young men of the Liberty  Center High School football team have represented their school ably on  their way to achieving the Division V State Football Title. In their  effort to surpass all other teams in the Division V State Football  Playoffs, the Liberty Center Tigers overcame the challenges posed by  intense competition.

In pursuing the State Championship, the Liberty Center Tigers  defeated the Wheelersburg Pirates to win the state football  championship. The members of this very special team have shown that  their sport requires an individual effort for a team result. Their hard  work and dedication, both on and off the field in achieving this  accomplishment, is truly outstanding.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to the Liberty Center High School football team. On behalf of the  people of the 5th District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great  achievement.
