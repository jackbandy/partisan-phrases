Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school athlete  from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. Hunter Spangler, a junior at  Liberty Center High School, has represented his school ably on his way  to achieving the Division III State Title for Shot Put at the State  Track and Field Meet. Hunter overcame the challenges posed by intense  competition in his effort to win the title.

In pursuing the State Championship, Hunter defeated his opponents  with an impressive personal record throw of 63 feet 1.25 inches. His  hard work and dedication, both on and off the field, in achieving this  accomplishment is truly outstanding. He has achieved an impressive  season, bringing pride to his school and community.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to Hunter Spangler of Liberty Center High School. On behalf of the  people of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this  great achievement.
