Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chair of the full committee for  yielding. I appreciate it.

Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 2483, the SUPPORT for Patients  and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025.

The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025  is one of the most impactful bills the Committee on Energy and Commerce  has worked on during my time in Congress. Simply put, we came together  to implement bipartisan policies that would save lives.

Gone are the days that substance abuse and addiction are a far off  problem that doesn't impact each one of our districts. Instead of  hearing the words: ``I know someone who knows someone,'' we hear too  often: ``I know someone personally who is impacted by addiction.''

That is why it is absolutely essential that we reauthorize the  SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025, which  will ensure that we have the right tools at our disposal to fight the  scourge of fentanyl and opioids in our communities. We must continue  vital resources for prevention, education, treatment, recovery,  workforce, and law enforcement to help patients struggling with  substance abuse. This reauthorization ensures that we will continue to  make progress, continue to fight back, and will continue to save lives.

Mr. Chair, I again thank the chairman of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), for his leadership  on this legislation. Let's fix it. Let's promote treatment before  tragedy, and stop the drug poisonings.

Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.
