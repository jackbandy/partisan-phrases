Welcoming Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Ms. POU. Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome His All-Holiness Ecumenical  Patriarch Bartholomew to the United States. On behalf of the many  Eastern Orthodox Christians who call New Jersey home, including my  constituents at St. George Greek Orthodox Church in Clifton, I offer my  heartfelt congratulations and express deep admiration to His All- Holiness for his ongoing efforts to foster peace, understanding, and  stewardship of our shared planet.

Leading the church since 1991, His All-Holiness serves as a spiritual  guide for more than 300 million faithful Orthodox Christians around the  world. His commitment to engaging with communities and governments  around the globe, regardless of faith, has made him one of the most  recognizable and respected religious figures of our time.

While in the United States, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew will be  awarded the prestigious Templeton Prize for his outstanding  contributions to the advancement of science and spirituality. He will  join the company of other spiritual leaders like Mother Teresa and the  Dalai Lama. I am honored to add my voice to the chorus of others who  welcome the Ecumenical Patriarch to the United States and honor him for  his lifetime of incredible service and work.
