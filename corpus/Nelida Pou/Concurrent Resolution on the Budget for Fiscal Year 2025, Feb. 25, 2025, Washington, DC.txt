Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025

Ms. POU. Mr. Chair, I rise for the first speech on the floor of this  body to  reject the Republicans' so-called budget.

I came to Congress to help my constituents. I came here to provide  direct relief to struggling Americans and lift people up. This  Republican budget does none of those things. It is nothing more than a  blueprint for cruelty. This GOP budget will destroy Medicaid and take  healthcare away from millions of Americans.

In my district alone, this could strip healthcare from the 215,000  people on Medicaid, blow up hospital budgets, raise insurance premiums,  all to give trillions in tax cuts to the millionaires. This is another  cash giveaway to the superrich at the expense of ruining American  lives.

Mr. Chair, I reject it, and I intend to vote ``no'' to this cruel  Republican budget.
