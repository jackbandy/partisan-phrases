Calling Upon Local Communities to Support Organizations That Provide Resources and Aid Gold Shield Families in Their Time of Need


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 364, which calls on local  communities to support organizations that provide resources and  assistance to the Gold Shield families.

Gold Shield families suffer tremendous, heartbreaking loss when their  loved ones--police officers, firefighters, emergency medical  technicians, and corrections officers--are killed while serving their  communities.

Mr. Speaker, I support H. Res. 364 because Gold Shield families  deserve recognition and need assistance. I am speaking of families such  as those of Captain Basil Pizzuto of Saddle Brook and Sergeant Robert  Miller of Clifton, both from the State of New Jersey.

Yet, I must also highlight that the Department of Justice recently  terminated 365 competitive grants totaling $811 million. This is  funding that Congress provided to the Justice Department to help  prosecutors, police, and sheriffs' departments protect and enhance  public safety.

While the Trump administration and my friends across the aisle call  for law and order and public safety, the Department of Justice is  terminating funding for congressionally authorized grant programs that  keep our communities safe.

Mr. Speaker, I support the resolution before us today. I also urge my  colleagues to express their opposition to the elimination of  congressionally authorized public safety grant programs at the  Department of Justice.

Ms. POU. Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support the resolution before  us today, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.
