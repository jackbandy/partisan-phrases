Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act

Ms. POU. Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose this bill, H.R. 3898, because it  is an affront to environmental stewardship everywhere. It undermines  the 50 years of vital, clean water progress and weakens the ability of  States like New Jersey to control pollution in its own waters.

Supporting localities in their efforts to provide clean water is one  of my top priorities as a member of the Water Resources and Environment  Subcommittee. I know firsthand the danger of aging stormwater, sewer,  and flood infrastructure to our environment and health.

It is unacceptable that this bill would allow polluters to release  raw or partially untreated sewage into our waters because they believe  that the water treatment technology is much too expensive.

These environmental rollbacks will only make our wealthiest polluters  richer and our riverfront communities sicker.

Stormwater infrastructure is critical. Our communities must have the  tools that they need to keep people safe.

That is why I offered an amendment to require the EPA to certify  before implementing this bill that it will not increase sewer  overflows, stormwater discharges, or flooding risks. Unfortunately, the  amendment was blocked by the House majority.

These terrible and horrible hazards endanger personal property,  businesses, local economies, critical infrastructure, and, most  importantly, human life and safety. This bill allows irreparable,  preventable damage in our communities, and I urge all of my colleagues  to vote ``no.''
