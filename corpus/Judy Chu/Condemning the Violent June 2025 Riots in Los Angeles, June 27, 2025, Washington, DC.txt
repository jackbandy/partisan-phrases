Condemning the Violent June 2025 Riots in Los Angeles, California


Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this extremely partisan  resolution that seeks to legitimize President Trump's baseless attacks  on Los Angeles and our elected leaders, including Governor Newsom and  Mayor Bass.

This administration's mass ICE raids by masked agents who will not  identify themselves have trampled on our rights and left our community  shaken but not defeated.

The President manufactured a crisis in Los Angeles and then blamed  our constituents for it. He induced ICE to terrorize our community,  detaining hundreds of hardworking residents at places like Home Depot  and car washes, including U.S. citizens like Job Garcia, a doctoral  student in my district at Claremont Graduate University. He was  manhandled, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed.

For this, the President called in the National Guard and Marines?

This resolution only gives credence to Trump's dangerous rhetoric.  Instead, we should be considering the resolution introduced by  California's Democratic delegation, which condemns anyone engaged in  violation of the law, violence, or vandalism. Most importantly, it  stands up for our constitutional rights to due process and free  expression and shows our appreciation to local law enforcement for  upholding public safety.

Rather than feed into the President's cruelty, we are standing up for  the communities we were elected to represent.
