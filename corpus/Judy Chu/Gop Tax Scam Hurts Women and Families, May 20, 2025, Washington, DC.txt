Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the GOP tax  scam, which would gut the programs that families rely on, like Medicaid  and SNAP, just to give trillions in tax breaks to the wealthy.

In my district, more than 208,000 people rely on Medicaid, and 75,000  people rely on SNAP. They include women like Nancy from Pasadena,  California.

Nancy has stage V kidney failure. She relies on Medicaid, SNAP, and  Social Security to keep a roof over her head, food on her table, and  continue her treatment. She is scared to death about losing these.

Nancy asked me to tell my Republican colleagues that one day, they or  their loved one might need the resources that they are fighting so hard  to slash.

Do not take food literally out of the mouths of babies just so Elon  Musk can buy another yacht. Nancy deserves better. All of our  constituents deserve better, and House Democrats are here to fight back  against this cruelty.
