Breaking the Gridlock Act

Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, 1 week ago, Republicans skyrocketed healthcare  costs for 22 million Americans. They chose to let the ACA tax credits  expire, even though there was bipartisan support to extend them.

Now, families are seeing premiums jump by hundreds, even thousands,  of dollars a month. That is utterly devastating and was entirely  avoidable.

Middle-class families are being forced to cancel coverage. People  with cancer are going uninsured. Small business owners are being told  to pay 34 percent more, or $40,000 a year, or go without care.

Republicans knew this would happen, and they did it anyway. Now, we  have a chance to fix it. Democrats have a clean, 3-year extension of  these tax credits on the floor today with bipartisan support.

Let's make sure families get the help they need. We must vote ``yes''  on this bill.
