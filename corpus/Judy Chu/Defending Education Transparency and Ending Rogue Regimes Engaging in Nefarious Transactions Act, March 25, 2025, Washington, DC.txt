Ms. CHU. Mr. Chairman, as chair emerita of the Congressional Asian  Pacific American Caucus, I rise in strong opposition to the DETERRENT  Act.

For now, the American university research system is the envy of the  world, but the DETERRENT Act would burden our higher education  institutions and Federal agencies with massive amounts of reporting of  a gift of any value from foreign countries and will cast a chilling  effect disproportionately on the Asian-American academic community.

From the incarceration of Japanese Americans in World War II to the  racial profiling of Chinese-American scientists under Trump's failed  first term China Initiative, countless Asian Americans have had their  lives destroyed because our government falsely accused them of being  spies.

Already, 72 percent of Asian-American academic researchers report  feeling unsafe. By publicizing the private, personal information of  certain faculty and staff on databases, this bill would make the  problem worse, making them much easier targets for xenophobic attacks.

Safeguarding national security can be done through commonsense  reforms Democrats have offered that don't come at the expense of U.S.  scientific innovation, global collaboration, and the Asian-American  community. As if we needed another reason to oppose this bill, it would  create enormous new responsibilities for the Department of Education at  the same time that Trump is attempting to illegally dismantle that very  Department.

Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
