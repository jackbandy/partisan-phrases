Women's History Month


Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, as this year's Women's History Month comes to a  close, there is no better way to honor the prolific and powerful  contributions of women in this country than to finally authorize the  creation of the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum on The  National Mall.

As one of the original cosponsors of this bipartisan bill, I feel  strongly that this museum must become a reality.  The National Mall here in Washington, D.C., tells the profound story of  our country, but that story is woefully incomplete without a dedicated  space to commemorate how women have shaped our Nation every single day  since before the founding. From Abigail Adams' request to ``remember  the ladies,'' to the suffrage rights movement, to Nancy Pelosi's  historic speakership, women have been trailblazers and have made  history.

That is why I am proud to work with colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to pass our bill, the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum  Act, to make sure that the Women's History Museum gets its rightful  spot on The National Mall. We are also working to make sure that the  National Museum of the American Latino, which also enjoys bipartisan  support, gets its spot, too.

So much progress has already been made to find the right location,  raise funds, and garner broad bipartisan support for this museum. The  momentum is here, and the time is now to finally make the story of our  Nation more complete by ensuring that the Smithsonian American Women's  History Museum secures its place in our Nation's Capital.

Ms. De La CRUZ.
