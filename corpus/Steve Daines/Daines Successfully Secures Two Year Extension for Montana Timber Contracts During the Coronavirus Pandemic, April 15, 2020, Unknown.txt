Daines Successfully Secures Two Year Extension for Montana Timber Contracts During the Coronavirus Pandemic


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be providing all timber sale contract holders with a two-year extension. This follows Daines' direct request to USDA Secretary Perdue for relief for the wood products industry, including the two-year extension for those with timber sale contracts to provide stability during the pandemic.

"It's critical we protect Montana timber jobs and industry during the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic," Daines said. "Active forest management not only supports good paying jobs but it protects our communities from the threat of wildfires and improves the conditions of our national forests. I'm glad the administration acted quickly on my request and I will continue fighting to help Montana timber get through this crisis."

Daines has been leading the efforts in Congress to respond to the coronavirus outbreak impacting the country.
