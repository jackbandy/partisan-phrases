Daines, Tester Work to Shed a Light on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Crisis


U.S. Senators Steve Daines and Jon Tester introduced a bipartisan Senate resolution designating May 5th, 2020 as a National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.

"This is about honoring the memories of the young women whose lives were cut short because of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women crisis plaguing our tribal communities," Daines said. "I will continue working to raise awareness on what is happening in Indian country and fight to put an end to this crisis that has torn apart so many families and caused so much suffering for our native communities."

"Shining a light on the crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women is one of the best tools we have in the fight to stop it," Tester said. "Today we amplify the voices of those impacted by the crisis and recommit ourselves to ending it. We've got a lot more work to do, and I'll keep fighting for solutions to this crisis so we can bring the perpetrators to justice, support survivors, and better hold Washington accountable to Indian Country."

Daines and Tester annually introduce a Senate resolution to mark May 5th as the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls to honor the memory of Hanna Harris. Hanna, born on May 5th, 1992, was a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and was murdered in July 2013. This resolution seeks to commemorate the lives of all American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls like Hanna who have gone missing or have been murdered.
