Daines Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Extend the Tax Filing Deadline, Provide Additional Relief For Montanans


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today introduced the bipartisan Tax Filing Relief for America Act to extend the tax filing deadline from April 15, 2020, to July 15, 2020. Daines' bill would provide additional relief to Montanans during the Coronavirus outbreak. 

"Hardworking Montanans shouldn't have to worry about meeting a deadline for filing their taxes when we're in the middle of a public health and economic crisis. This will give some extra time so Montanans can focus on what they need to do to protect their health and finances."

This legislation would provide greater clarity to taxpayers and allow those who need to travel to a secondary location to acquire documents or meet with an accountant to follow CDC's ongoing guidelines with respect to the coronavirus outbreak. It would also preserve the right of taxpayers who are owed refunds to file their tax returns and get their hard-earned money back today.

Daines' bill coincides with the Treasury Department's previous announcement that it would extend the tax payment deadline for filers who owe the IRS for the 2019 tax year.
