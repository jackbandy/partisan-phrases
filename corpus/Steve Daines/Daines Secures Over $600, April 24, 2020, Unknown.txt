Daines Secures Over $600,000 for Shodair Children's Hospital Amid Coronavirus Pandemic


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today secured $642,118 for Shodair Children's Hospital amid the Coronavirus pandemic. This follows Daines request to U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Azar urging the next round of hospital and provider funding under the Phase Three Coronavirus Economic Recovery Package to target the needs of Montana's rural providers and children's hospitals, including Shodair Children's Hospital in Helena.

"This funding ensures Shodair Children's Hospital has the resources it needs to treat young Montanans during this public health crisis," Daines said. "I'm glad the Trump administration acted quickly on my request to get this done for our children and the health care professionals at Shodair."

Daines fought to secure $100 billion in the Phase Three Coronavirus Economic Recovery Package to ensure healthcare providers continue to receive the support they need for COVID-19 related expenses and lost revenue. This announcement today reflects a release of a second round of funding from HHS and additional distributions will be made.  

Support From Stakeholder:

"Shodair was not included in receiving any funding in the first round of stimulus dollars, and we reached out to Senator Daines to voice concern. Not only was the Senator available and understanding, he was responsive and took quick action. His advocacy resulted in Shodair receiving a substantial dollar amount this week, and for that, we are forever grateful. On behalf of the Shodair community and most importantly, Montana kids, we extend a heartful thanks and appreciation." - Craig Aasved, CEO, Shodair Children's Hospital

Background:   

Daines has been leading the efforts in Congress to respond to the coronavirus outbreak impacting the country.
