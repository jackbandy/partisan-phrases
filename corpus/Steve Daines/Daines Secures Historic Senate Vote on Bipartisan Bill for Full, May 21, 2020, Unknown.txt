Daines Secures Historic Senate Vote on Bipartisan Bill for Full, Mandatory Funding of LWCF, National Parks Backlog Fix Set for June


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced that the U.S. Senate will be voting on his bipartisan bill, the Great American Outdoors Act, when the Senate returns from the state working period in June. Daines' bill requires full, mandatory funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and addresses the national park maintenance backlog.

"This vote will be one of the most historic conservation wins in Montana and the nation in decades," Daines said. "I've made it one of my top priorities to fight for LWCF and our national parks in the Senate, and with this vote, LWCF will have full, mandatory funding and we'll be able to address our maintenance backlog at our parks. I'm am proud to have secured this vote following my meeting with Leader McConnell and President Trump and I look forward to getting this conservation win across the finish line for future generations of Montanans."

Leader McConnell announced the news of the vote today on the floor of the U.S. Senate, highlighting Daines' work to get the bill across the finish line.  

In February, Daines met with President Trump and Leader McConnell to highlight the importance of these conservation priorities for Montana. During the meeting, President Trump agreed to support and sign Daines' legislation into law.

Daines' Great American Outdoors Act requires full, mandatory funding of LWCF at $900 million. Daines' bill also helps fix the $11.9 billion maintenance backlog facing national parks across the nation, including over $700 million in Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks.
