President Trump Signs Daines' Bill Stopping Robocalls into Law


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today celebrated President Trump signing his bipartisan bill, the TRACED Act, which works to protect Montanans from illegal robocalls, into law.

"Montanans are tired of being swamped night and day by illegal robocalls," Daines said. "I am thankful to President Trump for signing my bipartisan bill into law. This new law will protect Montanans and help stop these illegal calls."

Daines' bill does the following:

-Extends the time frame in which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) can catch and punish companies or individuals that intentionally break telemarketing restrictions-Requires voice service providers to implement an authentication framework to verify that incoming calls are legitimate before they reach consumers' phones-Directs the FCC to craft a plan to block calls that cannot be authenticated through the framework 

Background: 

In late December, Daines celebrated final passage of his bipartisan TRACED Act out of the U.S. Senate.

In late May, Daines first voted to clear his bipartisan TRACED Act out of the U.S. Senate.

In early May, Daines pressed FCC Chairman Pai and FTC Chairman Simons on the need to pass and quickly implement the TRACED Act.
