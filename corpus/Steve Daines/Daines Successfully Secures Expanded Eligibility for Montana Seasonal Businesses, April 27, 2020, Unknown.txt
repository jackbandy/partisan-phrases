Daines Successfully Secures Expanded Eligibility for Montana Seasonal Businesses, Workers Under PPP


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced he successfully had the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) guidelines expanded to offer fair relief for Montana seasonal businesses and workers.

"This is about ensuring Montana's seasonal small businesses and workers are eligible for relief during the coronavirus pandemic," Daines said. "Over 10% of Montana workers are seasonal employees and the way the Paycheck Protection Program was originally written, those workers and small businesses would've had a much harder time getting relief. I am thankful to the Trump administration for acting swiftly on my request to expand the program to help Montana workers like our outfitters and guides."

The new guidelines under PPP allow seasonal employers to incorporate their peak months when calculating their maximum allowable loan size. Previously, seasonal employers calculated their loan size by using their average monthly payroll from 3/1/2019 - 6/30/2019. Now, they can use any consecutive 12 week period from 5/1/19 - 9/15/2019.

Daines worked directly with the Trump administration to ensure Montana seasonal businesses and workers were eligible for these loans. Non-resident travel directly supports 38,890 seasonal jobs in Montana and over 11% of all Montana workers are seasonal workers.
