Daines: Montana Veterans Will Now Receive Direct Checks Automatically


Today, U.S. Senator Steve Daines announced that Montana veterans and their beneficiaries who receive VA benefits will be receiving their direct checks automatically without having to do anything extra from the Department of Treasury. This follows Daines urging both Treasury and Veterans Affairs Departments to work together to get the direct checks to Montana veterans the fastest and most effective way possible.

"This is great news for our Montana veterans and their families who have given so much in defense of this country," Daines said. "Ensuring our veterans get these direct checks as quickly and easily as possible will help give some peace of mind during these tough times."

On Tuesday, Senator Daines joined a group of bipartisan senators and sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Treasury and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs urging the agencies work together to get the nation's veterans their direct checks in response to the Coronavirus as soon as possible.
