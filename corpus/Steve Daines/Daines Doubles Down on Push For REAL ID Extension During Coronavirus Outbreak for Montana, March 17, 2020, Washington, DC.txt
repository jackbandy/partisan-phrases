Daines Doubles Down on Push For REAL ID Extension During Coronavirus Outbreak for Montana, America


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today introduced a bipartisan bill that directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to delay enforcement of REAL ID for at least one year in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Daines has been proactively working with the Trump administration on a delay of REAL ID for Montana.

"Montanans need to put their health and safety priorities first. Delaying the REAL ID requirements for one year will remove any additional burdens on Montanans while we work to overcome the coronavirus outbreak," Daines said.

Currently, over 90% of Montana ID's issued are not yet compliant according to the Montana Department of Justice.

Earlier this month, Daines urged President Trump asking the administration to delay requirements of the REAL ID Act of 2005 for Montanans.

Daines is working to include this bill in Congress' response to the coronavirus outbreak.
