Daines Secures Over $3 Million for Montana's Health Centers to Expand Coronavirus Testing in Montana


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would be directing $3,004,376 to 14 health centers across Montana to expand testing for COVID-19.

"As we work to safely reopen the economy, it's critical that Montana has the ability to conduct widespread testing, and health centers are essential to make testing more accessible," Daines said. "I will continue working with our health care professionals on the front lines of this pandemic to get them the resources they need to expand testing." 

The $3,004,376 will be directed to the following facilities:

-$249,049 to Bighorn Valley Health Center in Hardin-$166,294 to Bullhook Community Health Center in Havre-$293,824 to Butte-Silver Bow Primary Health Care Clinic in Butte-$222,274 to Community Health Care Center in Great Falls-$274,459 to Community Health Partners Clinic in Livingston-$220,699 to County of Flathead in Kalispell-$144,574 to Glacier Community Health Center in Cut Bank-$220,174 to Lincoln County Community Health Center in Libby-$188,044 to Marias Healthcare Services in Shelby-$334,474 to County of Missoula in Missoula-$140,614 to Montana Migrant & Seasonal Farm Workers Council in Billings-$98,329 to Pureview Health Center in Helena-$124,729 to Sapphire Community Health in Hamilton-$326,839 to Yellowstone City-County Health Department in Billings

Daines fought to secure $25 billion in funding to expand testing for COVID-19 in the bipartisan agreement to boost the Paycheck Protection Program that President Trump signed into law two weeks ago. This funding included over $16 million for Montana to develop, purchase, administer, process, and analyze COVID-19 tests, scale-up laboratory capacity, trace contacts, and support employer testing.

Daines has been leading the efforts in Congress to respond to the coronavirus outbreak impacting the country.
