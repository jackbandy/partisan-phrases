Daines Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Extend VA Health Benefits to WWII Veterans


U.S. Senator Steve Daines introduced a bipartisan bill that would ensure all World War II (WWII) veterans are eligible for health care services provided by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

"The fighting men and women of our nation's greatest generation deserve the utmost respect and care for their service in World War II," Daines said. "This bipartisan bill is about ensuring that all World War II veterans have access to VA services. It important our veterans who served bravely in defense of our country have access to the care they need." 

Daines bipartisan bill will extend the exemption to include WWII veterans. As of 2017 there are 2,793 WWII veterans living in Montana. 

The VA determines a veteran's eligibility for cost-free health care benefits based on a variety of factors such as military service history, disability rating and income level. The Veterans Health Care Eligibility Act of 1996 exempted all Spanish American War and World War I veterans from having to meet certain requirements in order to receive VA health care benefits.
