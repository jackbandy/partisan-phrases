Daines Secures Montana Air National Guard on Short List for Upgrade to C-130J Aircraft


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced that the Montana Air National Guard base has made the short list to receive an upgrade to C-130J military aircrafts. 

"This is great news for our men and women serving in the Montana Air National Guard and Great Falls," Daines said. "Modernizing our aging fleet will strengthen our national security and ensure our men and women have the resources necessary to keep America safe. That's why I fought to highlight the work of the 120th Airlift Wing to Secretary Barrett to ensure Montana was on the Air Force's short list for this project. I will continue fighting to ensure MANG is first to receive the replacement C-130J aircraft." 

Background:

In February, Daines requested Secretary of the U.S. Air Force Barbara Barrett to add Montana Air National Guard to the short list to receive an upgrade to C-130J military aircrafts.

Last December, Daines sent a letter to advocate that the Montana Air National Guard receive an upgrade to C-130J military aircrafts.
