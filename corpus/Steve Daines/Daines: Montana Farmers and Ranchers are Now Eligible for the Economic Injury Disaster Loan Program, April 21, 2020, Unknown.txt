Daines: Montana Farmers and Ranchers are Now Eligible for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced that Montana's farmers, ranchers and ag businesses will be eligible for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Today's announcement follows Daines' request to the Small Business Association urging them to grant farms, ranches and ag businesses the opportunity to apply for the EIDL program.

"This is great news for Montana's farmers and ranchers as they head into the spring planting season. Ensuring our farmers and ranchers have access to this program is critical to making sure they can continue to maintain our nation's food supply chain during the Coronavirus outbreak," Daines said.

Today, Senate Leadership credited Daines' hard work to ensure this got done for Montana ag.

Earlier this month, Daines sent a letter to the Small Business Association urging them to grant farms, ranches, and agriculture businesses the opportunity to apply for the EIDL program.
