Daines to FDA: We Must Bring Drug Manufacturing Back to America, Strengthen Medical Supply Chain


Yesterday, at a U.S. Senate Finance Hearing with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Senator Steve Daines stressed the need to end the nation's reliance on China and other nations and bring critical life-saving drugs and medical supply equipment jobs back to the U.S.

"It's long overdue we end our reliance on China to produce our medical supply equipment like PPE as well as life-saving drugs. Over 70 percent of our personal protective equipment and over one third of our antibiotics are imported from China. Being dependent on China is a threat to our national health and national security. America will be safer and America will be stronger when we bring our pharmaceutical and medical manufacturing supply chains and those jobs back to America." Daines said.  

Daines also asked the FDA on how the agency can strengthen the U.S. medical supply chain as well as the best way to ensure China remains in compliance when it comes to the exporting of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to America and elsewhere around the globe.
