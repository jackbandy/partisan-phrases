Daines: We Must Prioritize Made in Montana Beef, Support Montana Ranchers


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today introduced a resolution that would urge the President and U.S. Trade Representative to prioritize mandatory country of origin labeling (COOL) for beef in trade negotiations.

"During these unprecedented and challenging times, Montana producers and ranchers are struggling to keep their operations going," Daines said. "That's why it is important we pursue negotiations with our trading partners to include country of origin labeling. We must support ranchers in Montana and across the U.S. and ensure that only beef made and slaughtered in America receive the Product of the USA label." 

Additionally, Daines cosponsored the U.S. Beef Integrity Act which would make certain that the "Product of the U.S.A." label only goes to beef and beef products exclusively derived from one or more animals born, raised and slaughtered in the United States.

Daines' resolution will help prevent retaliation from trading partners in future trade agreements.

Background:

Daines serves as Montana's lone voice on the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over all trade between the United States and foreign nations. 

Daines is committed to fighting for better opportunities for Montana farmers and ranchers.
