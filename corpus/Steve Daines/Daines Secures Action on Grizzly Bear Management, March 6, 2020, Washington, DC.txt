Daines Secures Action on Grizzly Bear Management


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) responded to his frequent pleas for better management surrounding grizzly bears and human conflict in Montana. This comes after Daines discussed concerns with U.S. Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt during a U.S. Senate Appropriations hearing to respond to new rulemakings concerning the Endangered Species Act.

"Until we can retain full state management of the grizzly bear, we need common sense, collaborative methods of managing to reduce human conflict," Daines said. "I am thankful to Secretary Bernhardt for listening to the concerns of Montanans and redirecting management."

"During my hearing before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, we discussed our shared concerns over grizzly bear management in the State of Montana," Bernhardt wrote. "You have been a vocal leader on this issue, and I would like to provide an update on the actions the Department is taking to improve the management of grizzly bears."

The Department of Interior has committed to the following:

Enter into a contract with USDA Wildlife Services to better manage problem bears.Provide addition funding through the Wildlife Services contract to address bear and human conflict.Leverage existing Federal programs, such as grants provided under the Pittman-Robertson Act, to restore, conserve, and manage animals and their habitat.Update and reissue guidance on actions to avoid bear contact.
