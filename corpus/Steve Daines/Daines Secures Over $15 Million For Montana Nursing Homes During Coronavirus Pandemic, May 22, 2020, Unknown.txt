Daines Secures Over $15 Million For Montana Nursing Homes During Coronavirus Pandemic


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be directing $15,615,000 to 60 Montana nursing facilities amid the coronavirus pandemic.

"This critical funding will support Montana nursing homes and care providers as they work to keep our seniors safe and healthy during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic," Daines said. "I'm glad to have fought to secure this funding to support Montana's most vulnerable and I will continue working to ensure we protect our seniors and those who care for them during this crisis."

Daines fought to secure $175 billion in relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the coronavirus response in the Phase Three Coronavirus Economic Recovery Package and the Phase 3.5 Coronavirus Economic Recovery Package.

This funding will help nursing homes address critical needs such as labor, scaling up their testing capacity, acquiring personal protective equipment and a range of other expenses related to combatting the COVID-19 outbreak.
