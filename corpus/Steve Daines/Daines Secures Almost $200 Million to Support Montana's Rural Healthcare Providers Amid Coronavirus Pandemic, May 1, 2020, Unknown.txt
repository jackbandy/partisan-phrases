Daines Secures Almost $200 Million to Support Montana's Rural Healthcare Providers Amid Coronavirus Pandemic


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be directing $199,485,740 to support 121 rural healthcare providers in Montana during the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic.

"These resources are vital for Montana's critical access hospitals, rural health clinics, and community health centers that have been in desperate need of relief during these challenging times," Daines said. "I will continue working to ensure that Montana's hospitals and healthcare providers are equipped to care for our communities across the state."

Daines fought to secure $100 billion in the Phase Three Coronavirus Economic Recovery Package to ensure hospitals and healthcare providers continue to receive the support they need for COVID-19 related expenses and lost revenue. This announcement today reflects the release of the third round of this funding and additional distributions from the Provider Relief Fund will be made.  

On Wednesday, Daines announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would be directing $13,193,537 to support 69 healthcare providers in Montana in response to the Coronavirus pandemic. That distribution included the over $600,000 in funding secured for Shodair Children's Hospital.

Earlier this month, Daines announced $111,503,248 for 1,469 health providers in Montana.
