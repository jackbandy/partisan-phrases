Daines Secures $300,000 for Access to Community Resources for Montana Seniors, Montanans with Disabilities During the Coronavirus Pandemic


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be directing $300,000 to support older Montanans and those with disabilities connect with community resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"This is about getting Montana seniors and those with disabilities access to the critical resources they need to stay safe and healthy during this Coronavirus pandemic," Daines said. "I will continue fighting to ensure that all Montanans, including those most at risk to this virus, receive the care and support they need as we work to overcome this crisis."

Daines fought to secure $50 million for Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) in the Phase Three Coronavirus Economic Recovery Package. This funding will support programs that connect Montanans at greatest risk to COVID-19 to services like care coordination and services that support individuals in returning home following hospitalization.

Senator Daines recently announced $5.5 million in support for Montana seniors and Montanans with disabilities during the Coronavirus pandemic.
