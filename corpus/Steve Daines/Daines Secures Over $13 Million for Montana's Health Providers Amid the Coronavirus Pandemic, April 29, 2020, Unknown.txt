Daines Secures Over $13 Million for Montana's Health Providers Amid the Coronavirus Pandemic


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be directing $13,193,537 to support 69 healthcare providers in Montana in response to the Coronavirus pandemic. This distribution includes the over $600,000 in funding secured for Shodair Children's Hospital.

"This is about delivering much needed relief for Montana's healthcare providers who are on the frontlines of this coronavirus pandemic," Daines said. "I will continue working to ensure our hospitals and health providers have the resources they need to serve our communities as we work to safely reopen the economy."  

This funding is in addition to the $111,503,248 Daines announced for 1,469 health providers in Montana earlier this month.

Daines fought to secure $100 billion in the Phase Three Coronavirus Economic Recovery Package to ensure healthcare providers continue to receive the support they need for COVID-19 related expenses and lost revenue. This announcement today reflects the release of the second round of this funding and additional distributions will be made.
