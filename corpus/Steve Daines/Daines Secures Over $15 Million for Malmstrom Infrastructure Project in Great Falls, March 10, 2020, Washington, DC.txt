Daines Secures Over $15 Million for Malmstrom Infrastructure Project in Great Falls


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced that $15,077,162 will go to the renovation of an existing 3-Bay hangar at Malmstrom Air Force Base to facilitate the storage of the new MH-139 helicopter.

"This is good news for Montana and will help modernize our defense infrastructure at Malmstrom," Daines said. "We must ensure that our men and women serving in uniform have access to the best equipment available for our national security. I'm proud to have helped secure resources and push for this important project for Malmstrom."    

This news follows Daines' February 28th meeting with 341st Missile Wing Commander Col. Reeves at Malmstrom to talk about the importance of upgrading the outdated infrastructure including this project.

In late September, Daines also met with U.S. Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett to emphasize the importance of upgrading the aging "Huey" helicopters at Malmstrom, including this project to update the hangar.

Background:

On the December 19th, 2019, Daines voted for a bipartisan bill that would strengthen Montana's military units, secure the southern border and combat Montana's meth crisis which included funds for projects like Malmstrom's infrastructure project.

On December 12th, 2019, Daines voted for the NDAA, which authorized a 3.1% pay raise for the military, critical defense priorities for Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls and federal recognition of the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians.
