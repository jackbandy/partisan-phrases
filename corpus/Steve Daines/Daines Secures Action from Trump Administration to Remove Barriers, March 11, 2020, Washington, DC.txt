Daines Secures Action from Trump Administration to Remove Barriers, Lower Costs of Coronavirus Testing and Treatment


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced the Trump administration adopted his proposal to remove barriers and lower the costs of testing and treatment for the Coronavirus. Today's announcement is a direct response to Daines' letter sent to the Administration yesterday urging this action.

"Montanans shouldn't be faced with barriers and high costs for Coronavirus testing and treatment," Daines said. "That's why I urged the Trump administration to take this action that will help lower the costs for Coronavirus testing and treatment for Montanans. I'm glad to see President Trump act on my request and I will continue working to help protect Montana families and their finances during the Coronavirus outbreak."

Yesterday, Daines sent a letter urging the Trump administration to take swift action to make testing for the Coronavirus disease affordable.

Following Daines' request, today the IRS announced they will now provide flexibility for high deductible health plans that will allow patients to have access to Coronavirus testing and treatment without having met their deducible first.

Earlier this week, Daines unveiled a slate of proposals and priorities he's working to advance that will help protect Montana families and their finances during the Coronavirus outbreak including paid leave, temporarily waiving payroll taxes, providing relief from tariffs, and ensuring access to affordable testing.
