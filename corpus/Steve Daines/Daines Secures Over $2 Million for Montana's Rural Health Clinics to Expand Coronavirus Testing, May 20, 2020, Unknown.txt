Daines Secures Over $2 Million for Montana's Rural Health Clinics to Expand Coronavirus Testing


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be directing $2,868,762 to 58 rural health clinics in Montana for COVID-19 testing.

"This critical funding is about getting Montanans in our rural communities greater access to testing for COVID-19 as we work to safely reopen the economy," Daines said. "I'm glad to have fought to secure this funding to support our rural health clinics and will continue working to ensure the needs of our communities are met during this crisis."

Daines fought to secure $225 million for Rural Health Clinics (RHC) for COVID-19 testing in the Phase 3.5 Coronavirus Economic Recovery Package. This funding will support over 4,500 RHCs across the country to support COVID-19 testing efforts and expand access to testing in rural communities.
