Daines Secures $360,187 for MT's Upcoming Flu Season Preparation


Today, U.S. Senator Steve Daines announced Montana will receive $360,187 from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to prepare for the upcoming flu season, given the increased risk of COVID-19.

"As we continue to invest in efforts to develop life-saving drugs to treat and prevent COVID-19, we must also prepare for the upcoming flu season in the fall," Daines said. "I'm glad to have secured this funding to help protect vulnerable Montanans and will continue working to ensure our communities are equipped to combat COVID-19."

The funding source for this award is through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and will support staffing and preparedness measures to ensure proper flu coverage for vulnerable populations.
