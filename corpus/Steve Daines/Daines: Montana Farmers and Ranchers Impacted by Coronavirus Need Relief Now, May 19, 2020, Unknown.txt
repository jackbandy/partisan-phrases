Daines: Montana Farmers and Ranchers Impacted by Coronavirus Need Relief Now


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today issued the following statement following President Trump's announcement on new guidelines to implement the $19 billion Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) for farmers and ranchers impacted by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

"Montana's hardworking farmers and ranchers whose operations have been hit hard by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic need relief now," Daines said. "I'm grateful to President Trump for announcing these new guidelines that will provide more critical financial support for our ag folks. I will continue working with the Administration to ensure our farmers and ranchers get the support they need quickly."

Daines fought to secure $19 billion in funding for the CFAP in the Phase Three Coronavirus Economic Recovery Package.

Farmers and ranchers can apply for CFAP at their local Farm Service Agency office starting on May 26th.

Part of the CFAP funding will go to help Montana's ranchers who have seen a drastic decline in cattle markets during the pandemic. This follows Daines' request in early April to USDA Secretary Perdue urging immediate action for Montana's farmers and ranchers. Daines also spoke directly with Secretary Perdue about the importance of implementing this program as quickly as possible.

The CFAP will provide:  

$16 billion in direct support for farmers and ranchers based on actual losses for agricultural producers impacted by lost demand and oversupply due to the pandemic in 2020.

Background:

Daines has been leading the efforts in Congress to respond to the coronavirus outbreak impacting the country.
