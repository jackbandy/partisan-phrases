Daines Introduces Bill to Protect 2nd Amendment, Law-Abiding Gun Owners


U.S. Senator Steve Daines introduced a bill to protect the Second Amendment and law-abiding gun owners. The bill would reform the Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA) to protect travelers who are transporting firearms across state lines.

"This is about protecting law abiding gun owners and their right to safely transport their firearms," Daines said. "Montanans want their 2nd Amendment rights protected and that's what I'm fighting for."

Daines' bill reforms FOPA to:

-Clarify the term "transport" as to include, "staying in temporary lodging overnight, stopping for food, fuel, vehicle maintenance, an emergency, medical treatment, and any other activity incidental".-Ensure that law-abiding gun owners may not be arrested for violation of local laws relating to "the possession, transportation, or carrying of firearms" unless there is probable cause. -Put the burden of proof clearly on the States to prove that the traveler beyond a reasonable doubt, did not meet the requirements of ยง 926A.-Clarify that transportation of firearms, their magazines, and ammunition is federally protected.-Make clear that violation of the right to transport firearms is judicially enforceable as a federal civil right.

Statement of Support:

"Law-abiding Americans traveling with unloaded, secured firearms have continually been harassed with malicious arrests and prosecutions when traveling through anti-gun jurisdictions. Senator Daines' legislation ensures such outrageous actions will no longer be tolerated under the law. On behalf of the NRA's five million members, we thank Senator Daines for having the legislative courage to stand and fight against local bullies who were hoping to suppress our Second Amendment rights."- Jason Ouimet, Executive Director, NRA's Institute for Legislative Action.
