Daines Secures Meritorious Unit Commendation for Montana Army National Guard Unit


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today announced that the Montana Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 189th Aviation Regiment received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for actions in 2014.  

"I am glad to have finally secured this long overdue recognition for the over 200 Montanans serving in the 189th Aviation Regiment of the Montana Army National Guard," Daines said. "The 189th Aviation Regiment was recommended for this commendation for actions in 2014 while serving in Kuwait. I am honored I could work on behalf of our fighting men and women to get them the recognition they earned."

Background:

In April of 2017, Daines was contacted to provide a Congressional recommendation to award the Meritorious Unit Commendation for the 1-189th GSAB. Daines persisted over the course of three years with extensive outreach to work with the U.S. Department of the Army on behalf of the unit to ensure they receive the recognition they earned in defense of our country.
