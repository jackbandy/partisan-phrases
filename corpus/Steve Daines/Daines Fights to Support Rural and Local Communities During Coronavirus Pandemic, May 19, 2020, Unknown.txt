Daines Fights to Support Rural and Local Communities During Coronavirus Pandemic


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today introduced a bill requiring that 45% of coronavirus relief funds directed to state governments are distributed to local governments including counties, cities, and towns. 

"This bill is about supporting local communities and ensuring they get the relief they need as they work to fight the coronavirus pandemic," Daines said. "With public health and emergency services supported by local governments, it's important that they have the resources needed to continue to combat the coronavirus."  

Daines' legislation will empower local communities with the funding needed to support those on the front lines working to keep Montanans safe and healthy.

Localities have been bearing the burden of health and enforcement related expenses during the pandemic. This includes costs related to supporting local health care professionals, first responders and law enforcement responding to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Background:

Daines has been leading the efforts in Congress to respond to the coronavirus outbreak impacting the country.
