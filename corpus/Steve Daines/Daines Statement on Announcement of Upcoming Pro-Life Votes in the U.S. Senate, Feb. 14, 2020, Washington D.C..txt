Daines Statement on Announcement of Upcoming Pro-Life Votes in the U.S. Senate


U.S. Senator Steve Daines issued the following statement after it was announced the U.S. Senate will be voting on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.

"As founder of the first ever Senate Pro-Life Caucus, I am very glad the Senate will be voting on two important pro-life bills," Daines said. "These are commonsense bills that defend the sanctity of human life by ending late term abortion and outlawing the horrific act of infanticide. These back-to-back votes will present an opportunity for Senate Democrats to show the American people whether there are any limits at all to their radical abortion extremism."
