Daines Votes YES on Two Major Pro-Life Bills


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today voted for two critical pro-life bills, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.  Daines is the Founder and Chair of the U.S. Senate Pro-Life Caucus. Daines issued the following statement after the votes:

"Today, I voted to protect innocent babies and for basic human rights," Daines said. "It's astonishing that Senate Democrats voted against these commonsense bills which end late term abortion and protect babies born alive from botched abortions. This shouldn't be about politics. It's about protecting life. As founder of the first ever Senate Pro-Life Caucus, I will continue fighting for pro-life policies."

The bills did not pass the Senate due to Democratic opposition to protecting life.

Last night, Senator Daines led a colloquy with Senate Pro-Life Caucus members Senators Ernst, Sasse, and Braun ahead of the votes today.

Background:

Daines is the founder of the first ever Senate Pro-Life Caucus. He has been a champion for pro-life legislation since coming to Congress.
