Government Funding

Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I am here to make some comments about my  friend Bill Mercer, whom we are actually going to vote on here on the  floor in a minute, but I wanted to set the record straight on  something. I am tired of the lies being spread around.

There is a lie about what is happening here in Washington, and the  lie is this: Republicans control the Presidency, the House, and the  Senate, so it is on the Republicans for shutting it down. That is a  lie. It takes 60 votes to get something done here in the U.S. Senate.  We are looking for five Democrats to join us.

It is already bipartisan. Three Democrats have joined us. If five  more join the Republicans, we have done this 11 times in voting for  this clean CR, which Democrats have done repeatedly under Joe Biden's  watch. If five Democrats join us, we will open the government back up.  But just wanted to set that straight at home. Yes, Republicans have  majority control of the Senate, but it takes 60 votes to get an outcome  here in Washington. We have 53 Republicans, if five Democrats join us,  we will get this done.
