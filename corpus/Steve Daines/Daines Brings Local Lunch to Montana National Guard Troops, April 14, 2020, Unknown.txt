Daines Brings Local Lunch to Montana National Guard Troops, Shares Two Big Announcements


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today brought lunch from Bozeman's Chalet Market to Montana National Guard troops serving at the Bozeman airport to thank them for protecting Montana communities during the COVID-19 pandemic and to share two big National Guard announcements.

"It's an honor to be here today to deliver some free lunches to our Montana National Guard members who are here in the front lines, the Bozeman airport. It's important we stand with these health care heroes, whether it's our nurses or doctors or first responders, in this case, the Montana National Guard in the front lines keeping us safe. Very pleased to see that President Trump announced that we would be allowing these National Guard members now to receive health care insurance based on these deployments they have in serving us across Montana airports. I wrote a letter to the President, got a response, they now can get healthcare insurance... Additionally, I just wrote a letter to President Trump asking that we include hazard pay for National Guard members who are serving us in this difficult time..."

First, Daines shared that following his request to President Trump, Montana National Guard members responding to the Coronavirus pandemic will be eligible for healthcare benefits (TRICARE coverage) and housing benefits. This follows Daines' request to President Trump asking the administration to increase the National Guard's orders of duties beyond 30 days, which would trigger federal benefits including healthcare and housing benefits for the troops and their families.

Daines also shared that this week he sent a letter to President Trump urging the administration to give hazard pay to National Guard troops serving during COVID-19.
