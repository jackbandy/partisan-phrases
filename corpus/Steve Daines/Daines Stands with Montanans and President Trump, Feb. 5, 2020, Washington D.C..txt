Daines Stands with Montanans and President Trump, Votes Against Impeachment


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today voted to acquit President Donald J. Trump of two partisan impeachment articles. President Trump was acquitted by the U.S. Senate on both articles of impeachment.

"I voted to acquit President Trump of the most partisan impeachment in our nation's history. Never has the Senate been faced with articles of impeachment against a President that allege no crimes and never have we seen such a partisan presidential impeachment process. This has always been about overturning the 2016 election and trying to severely impact the 2020 election. Montanans overwhelmingly oppose this impeachment and stand with President Trump. Supporting this impeachment means ignoring the voices of Montanans who voted for President Trump in the last election, and it means silencing Montanans who plan to vote for President Trump in 2020. The answer is an election, not an impeachment," Daines stated.
