Daines: We Must Bring Drug Manufacturing Back to America, Reduce Dependency on China


U.S. Senator Steve Daines is pushing legislation to end the United States' reliance on China for drug and medical equipment manufacturing and bring those jobs back to the United States.

"America cannot continue to rely on foreign countries like China to manufacture our PPE and critical drugs," Daines said. "China's lack of transparency and cover up of the virus made this global pandemic much worse--it costs lives and devastated our booming economy. The coronavirus has made it clear that we must bring drug manufacturing and medical equipment jobs back to the United States and strengthen our capacity to respond to future pandemics like we're in today."

It was reported by U.S. intelligence over the weekend that China covered up the extent of the Coronavirus outbreak to stock up on medical supplies.

On April 23rd, 2020, Daines visited the University of Montana where he announced $2.5 million would be directed to the university to begin work on a developing a Montana made COVID-19 vaccine.

On April 13th, 2020, Daines sent a letter to President Trump urging him to end the U.S. government's reliance on medical supplies and equipment from China and bring back drug manufacturing jobs to America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On April 6th, 2020, Daines sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to work with our allies around the world and fully investigate China's response to the emergence of the virus causing COVID-19.

On March 22nd, 2020, Daines announced a plan and over $10 billion in funding for accelerated drug development and manufacturing to treat and prevent the Coronavirus.
