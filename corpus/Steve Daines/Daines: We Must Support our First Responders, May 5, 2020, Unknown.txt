Daines: We Must Support our First Responders, Families on the Front Lines


U.S. Senator Steve Daines today introduced bipartisan legislation that would guarantee benefits for families of any first responder who tragically dies from COVID-19 in the line of duty.

"Our first responder heroes need to know that when they are putting their lives on the line during this Coronavirus pandemic, their families will be supported," Daines said. "This is about protecting those and their families who keep us all safe. I will continue fighting to support our first responders and their families who sacrifice so much to keep our communities safe."

Currently, infectious diseases are considered line of duty deaths as long as a public safety officer is able to provide evidence that the infectious disease was contracted on duty.

Daines' legislation creates a presumption that if a first responder is diagnosed with COVID-19 within 45 days of their last day on duty, the Department of Justice will treat it as a line of duty incident. The presumption will guarantee payment of benefits (a one-time lump sum payment of $359,316 and/or education assistance of $1,224.00 per month) to any first responder who dies from COVID-19
