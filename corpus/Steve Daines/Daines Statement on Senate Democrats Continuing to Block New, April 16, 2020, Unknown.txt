Daines Statement on Senate Democrats Continuing to Block New, Critical Funding for the Paycheck Protection Program


U.S. Senator Steve Daines issued the following statement after Senate Democrats refused to come to the table and continued to block new funding to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) which would keep Montana small business open and workers employed during the Coronavirus pandemic.

"The Paycheck Protection Program which is critical to keep Montana small businesses open and workers employed has officially run out of money," Daines said. "Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are holding working folks and their families hostage by blocking funding to the program. Nearly 70,000 working Montanans and over 22 million Americans have lost their jobs due to this pandemic. Folks are literally losing jobs by the minute. If we don't increase funding NOW, more jobs will be lost and more livelihoods will be on the line. Enough with political games. Let's boost funding now."

Daines fought to secure $350 billion in initial funding for the PPP in the Coronavirus Economic Recovery Package signed into law three weeks ago.

As of Tuesday, in Montana 10,372 PPP loans have been approved for close to $1.3 billion
