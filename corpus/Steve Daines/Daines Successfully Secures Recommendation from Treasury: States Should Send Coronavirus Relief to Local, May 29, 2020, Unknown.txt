Daines Successfully Secures Recommendation from Treasury: States Should Send Coronavirus Relief to Local, Rural Communities


U.S. Senator Steve Daines announced today the U.S. Department of Treasury stated that states should distribute 45% of coronavirus relief funds it received to local governments including counties, cities, and towns. This announcement follows Daines introducing a bill requiring this of the state. 

"Our local communities impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak need the resources and support necessary from the state to protect the health and safety of Montanans," Daines said. "I'm glad the administration acted swiftly on my request to ensure the needs of Montana's local and rural communities are met during this crisis."

The recommendation from Treasury states "Consistent with the needs of all local governments for funding to address the public health emergency, States should transfer funds to local governments with populations of 500,000 or less."

This action follows Daines' bipartisan bill requiring that 45% of coronavirus relief funds be directed to local governments.

Localities have been bearing the burden of a majority of health and enforcement related expenses during the pandemic. This includes costs related to supporting local health care professionals, first responders and law enforcement responding to the COVID-19 outbreak.
