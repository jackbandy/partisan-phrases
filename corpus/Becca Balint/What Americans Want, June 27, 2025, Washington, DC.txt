What Americans Want


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, we all know that the Republicans' so-called  big, beautiful bill is wildly unpopular. Every poll, including FOX  News, shows that Americans think it is rotten, and it is.

That is why Trump is trying desperately to rehabilitate the bill in  the eyes of the public, but Americans aren't stupid. They don't want  their healthcare taken away. They don't want us taking food away from  hungry people. They don't want our rural hospitals to close. They don't  want to add trillions of dollars to the debt, and they sure as hell do  not want the wealthy to continue to get rich off the backs of the rest  of us.

This is not rocket science. They want a tax code that doesn't screw  us over. They want affordable rent and mortgages. They want lower  healthcare costs. They want to see us fighting for a better future for  their families.

All this bill does is take and take and take away from working people  and provide it, once again, to the billionaires who do not need it.  They see right through it, and so do we.
