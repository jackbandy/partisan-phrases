Fighting for Affordable, Quality Healthcare

Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, so over at the Centers for Medicaid &  Medicaid Services, the administrator, Dr. Oz--yes, that guy--decided  they should curb waste by letting the government use AI to decide if  your medical procedure is really necessary.

That means for-profit companies will use bots to deny care for  seniors and working people and will get rich doing it at your expense.  Right now, there are over 70 million Americans who rely on Medicare and  Medicaid for their insurance.

If there is one thing that Americans agree on right now, it is that  our healthcare system is sick. Our premiums are too high. Our access is  shrinking. We are all enraged by a system that is already designed to  deny us healthcare coverage, not make us healthier. Our healthcare  system is so perverse, we don't need yet another way for the system to  screw us over.

Americans deserve affordable, quality healthcare, and AI should not  be determining whether you get healthcare. That is what Democrats are  fighting for.
