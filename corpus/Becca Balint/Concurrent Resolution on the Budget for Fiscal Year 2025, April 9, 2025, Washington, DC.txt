Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025

Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the  Republican budget.

Let's lay out where we are. Republicans control the House, the  Senate, and the White House, and they could be passing legislation  right now to actually lower costs for families on groceries,  prescription drugs, and housing.

Instead, they are attacking the very programs that working people and  middle-class people across this country rely on. They have proposed a  budget that gives massive tax cuts to the wealthiest and the  corporations.

How will they pay for it? They will pay for it by making cuts to  Medicaid to the tune of $880 billion and deep cuts to SNAP benefits,  food assistance to families. On top of that, they will add to the  deficit.

When I vote against this Republican budget, I will be thinking about  all of the working families back in Vermont, thinking of the families  who aren't going to be able to drop their kids off at a Head Start  program, and thinking about the small businesses who tell me that the  Trump on-again, off-again global tariffs are crushing them.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this reckless budget.
