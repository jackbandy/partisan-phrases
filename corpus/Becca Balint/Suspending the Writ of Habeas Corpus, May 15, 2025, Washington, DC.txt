Suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus

Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, I was a history teacher, and I know that we  have to be documenting this moment. When we look back, I don't want  anyone to say that we didn't know what was happening.

Trump adviser Stephen Miller and perhaps the most joyless man in  America recently said that Trump is actively looking at suspending the  writ of habeas corpus.

I am sorry. What? What?

Habeas corpus is the right we all have to challenge in court if we  are detained and locked up. Without it, it means that any of us can be  locked up with no cause. It can only be suspended by Congress, by us.

Americans, please hear me: Who are we? Who are we if we let Trump  abandon our core principle that no one in this country will be  imprisoned unlawfully? This is about liberty, and there is nothing more  important than our liberty.
