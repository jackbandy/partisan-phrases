Another Disgusting Pardon By Donald Trump

Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, another day, another disgusting pardon by  Donald Trump. I will tell you today about Joseph Schwartz.

Joseph Schwartz ran a nationwide nursing home empire and stole $38  million through Medicaid and tax fraud. I want you all to remember that  is our money. He cheated American taxpayers. He cheated his employees.  He stole money out of their paychecks and kept it for himself instead  of paying their taxes. He robbed them of their 401(k)'s. Elderly  patients in his care got substandard care.

In April, this swindler was rightly sentenced to 3 years in prison,  but he didn't stay long thanks to our President. He gave him a full and  unconditional pardon after just 90 days. Trump and the Republicans cut  $1 trillion from Medicaid, and Americans are not going to have their  healthcare.

Meanwhile, this guy literally steals $38 million from all of us, and  Trump lets him walk free and back home to his $1.2 million home. Trump  is laughing at his voters. It is disgusting.
