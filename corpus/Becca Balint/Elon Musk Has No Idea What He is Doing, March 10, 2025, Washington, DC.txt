Elon Musk Has No Idea What He is Doing

Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, we have heard for months now that this  administration only hires the very best people.

Really? Let's look at exhibit A. This is the guy? This guy? This is  the guy that keeps swinging around his big chainsaw? This is the guy  who is going to fix government?

Let me state for the record what millions of Americans can already  see with their own eyes and what Trump's own Cabinet can see and what  my colleagues across the aisle are hoping nobody will ask them about.

Elon Musk has no idea what he is doing.

He has fired people who guard our nuclear arsenal. He has gone after  the people protecting us from bird flu and Ebola. His own emails and  directives contradict each other. He erroneously triple counted  contracts to inflate the DOGE numbers. He has had to remove faulty  claims and replace them with a page saying: Coming soon.

Mr. Speaker, the incompetence is shocking, and it makes us all less  safe. From exposing our personal, private information to leaving  Americans stranded abroad to kicking our veterans to the curb, we  deserve so much better than this.
