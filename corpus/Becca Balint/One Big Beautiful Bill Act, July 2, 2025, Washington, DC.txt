One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, this is a cruel bill. Thousands of Americans  will die because of it. Rural hospitals will close. Millions will lose  their healthcare. Kids will go hungry. Americans will be poorer. They  will be sicker because my Republican colleagues  are falling in line instead of standing up for their people back home.

This bill shows us their priorities, and it is not the American  people. They are taking away Americans' healthcare to give more money  to the very wealthy. This bill is for billionaires and not for  Americans.
