A Somber Day of Remembrance

Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, it is a somber day of remembrance in our  Nation's Capital. It was on this day 5 years ago when this Chamber, the  people's House of the United States of America, was viciously attacked  by a violent mob.

No tweet, no post, no spin, no disgusting lie-filled website is going  to change the facts of the history of what happened on that day.

I rise today to honor the men and women who with great courage and  sacrifice defended this Capitol Building. Our Capitol Police are still  being treated with disrespect and now denigration from the President  who today has accused them of somehow being responsible for their own  beatings. They have already given so much.

Mr. Speaker, the leader of this Chamber is bound by law to hang the  plaque in remembrance of what these brave men and women did on January  6, and there is no excuse, no excuse, for his moral failure.
