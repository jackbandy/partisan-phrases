Cbp Turns Houston Airport Into Trap


Ms. BALINT. Madam Speaker, I take to the floor today because I am  angry and so are Vermonters. We are furious because of what happened  yesterday to a Vermonter, a U.S. citizen, as he attempted to return  home.

Wilmer Chavarria is a community leader. He is a school superintendent  in my State. He was held and interrogated for hours yesterday in the  Houston airport by CBP agents and given no reason for his detainment.  Wilmer called this experience psychological terror.

Again, we are talking about a U.S. citizen here. When we say this can  happen to any of us, this is what we are talking about. This kind of  violation of our constitutional rights is how leaders use terror to  intimidate us into silence.

I don't want to hear about how everyone is going after the violent  criminals in this country and trying to get violent criminals off the  streets, when community leaders and school superintendents are being  detained because of the color of their skin and the sound of their last  name.

Madam Speaker, we need to hold onto our collective outrage. We do not  need to accept this. This is not what Americans want.
