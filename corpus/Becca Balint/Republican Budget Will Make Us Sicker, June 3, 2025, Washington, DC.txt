Republican Budget Will Make Us Sicker

Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, it is hard not to feel like this  administration is trying to kill us.

The Republican budget slashes billions of dollars from Medicaid and  food assistance programs. Millions will lose their health insurance and  will be hungrier and sicker.

It gets worse. In his 2026 budget, Trump has called for a 40 percent  cut to the National Institutes of Health. He wants a 44 percent cut to  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and he is urging  Republicans to cut billions of dollars from the National Cancer  Institute.

For over 50 years, every major medical breakthrough that has happened  in the treatment of cancer has been linked to our Federal investments.  Americans are not demanding that we cut money to fund cancer research,  Mr. Speaker, I promise you that. They are not calling for these cuts.

Of course, as the irrepressibly cheerful Joni Ernst reminded  Americans last week, that is okay because we all are going to die. I  just don't think Americans thought the Trump administration would be  actively trying to speed up our deaths, but here we are.
