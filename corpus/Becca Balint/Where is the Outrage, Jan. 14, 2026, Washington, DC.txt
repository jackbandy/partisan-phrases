Where is the Outrage


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, I need to level set here.

The President cannot take money from the proceeds of seized  Venezuelan oil and control it himself via means of a highly illegal and  improper offshore slush fund. The President has no constitutional  authority to do this.

He doesn't get to create his own secret, overseas slush fund, which  is outside of our purview and oversight. This is absolutely insane. We  take Venezuelan oil at gunpoint, engage in regime change and nation  building, and then the President personally controls the proceeds?

What has happened here? Why do my colleagues give up their power?

Mr. Speaker, where is the Republican opposition to this lawless,  half-baked, absurd plan? You know that if any Democratic President  claimed this kind of maniacal power, you would be enraged.

So I ask you, Mr. Speaker: Where is the outrage now? Where is the  pushback? Do not give this President any more power.
