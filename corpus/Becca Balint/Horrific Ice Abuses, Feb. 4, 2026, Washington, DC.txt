Horrific Ice Abuses


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. This is not about catching  the most violent criminals. It is about power. It is about control. It  is about cruelty. It is about depravity and abandoning human decency.

I have spent time in Chicago. I have spent time in Minneapolis-Saint  Paul. I have talked to the people there. We knew it would end like  this.

President Trump and his apologists and his enablers have been  demonizing and dehumanizing immigrants and refugees for years.  Americans are now dead at the hands of ICE, and over 40 others have  been killed in DHS custody. Despite what Secretary Noem has said, over  170 Americans have been arrested and detained. As I said, we knew that  this is how it would end.

There are people of color across this country afraid to leave their  homes because right now ICE and Border Patrol will detain anyone who  they think they can use to meet a quota based on the color of their  skin or the accent that they are using.

This didn't have to go like this. I remind everybody who is  responsible for supersizing the ICE budget and bringing us to this  place, it was Republicans in Congress who did this, even though we  warned them that this is what would happen.

ICE needs to be dismantled. Secretary Noem needs to be fired, and  Stephen Miller has to go. He is the mastermind of this ghoulish plan.
