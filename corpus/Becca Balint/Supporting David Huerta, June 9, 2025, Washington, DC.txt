Supporting David Huerta


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in support of labor  leader David Huerta. The head of the SEIU California union was arrested  in Los Angeles while exercising his First Amendment rights to speech  and assembly, rights that are guaranteed to all of us in the  Constitution. That is what separates us from autocratic regimes around  the world.

The Trump administration is now going after judges, Members of  Congress, political opponents, students, law firms, reporters,  Governors, and now the leader of a powerful labor union.

This is about abusing power to silence dissent. This is about  generating fear to turn us against each other so that we don't pay  attention to this lawbreaking administration.

David Huerta said this after being arrested: ``What happened to me is  not about me. This is about something much bigger. This is about how we  as a community stand together and resist the injustice that is  happening. Hardworking people and members of our family and community  are being treated like criminals. We all collectively have to object to  this madness because this is not justice.''
