President Trump's Offensive Post

Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, in light of the President's offensive and  cruel post about the tragic murders of director Rob Reiner and his  wife, producer and actress, Michele Reiner, I think it is important to  speak out.

Mr. Speaker, may this be the last time America elects a President  devoid of sympathy and compassion.

May this be the last time that we choose someone so heartless and  cruel, who denies the basic dignity of honoring someone's life when  they have been murdered.

May this be the last time we choose someone who divides us instead of  unites us.

May this be the last time we elevate and celebrate a man unwilling to  offer condolence or consolation or comfort.

May this be the last time we choose a leader wrapped up in spite and  vindictiveness.

May this be the last time that we lose ourselves in our collective  cruelty.
