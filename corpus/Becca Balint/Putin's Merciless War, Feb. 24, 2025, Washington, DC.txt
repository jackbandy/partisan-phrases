Putin's Merciless War

Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, Russia invaded the sovereign nation of  Ukraine. That is the cold, hard truth of it. Vladimir Putin is the  aggressor. I stand here on the floor to say that our President will not  rewrite the past.

Putin has mercilessly continued this war for over 3 years now; a war  that has led to immeasurable suffering for Ukraine and a shocking death  toll of both Ukrainians and Russians. The region is awash in blood  because of him.

Now the United States stands with Russia and North Korea against  Ukraine and all of our allies in Europe?

It is sick. We are standing with dictators and against our allies. I  never thought I would see the day when our President would be a puppet  for a dictator.

To my Republican colleagues: Did you ever imagine that you would be  in a party that stands on the side of dictators or on the side of a  country who has killed journalists, with an authoritarian accused of  war crimes, and a man who assassinates his political opponents?

Aren't you embarrassed by what you have become?

It is revolting to watch my colleagues side with Russia because Trump  said so.
