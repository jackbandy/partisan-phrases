Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, 1 week ago today, Republicans allowed the  ACA premium tax credits to expire after telling us there was no money  to do so.

Healthcare premiums have soared, and millions of Americans will lose  their healthcare coverage because they simply can't afford it.

Just 3 days later, the President found money, a lot of money, to pay  for a very extensive and expensive military raid to capture the  President of Venezuela. This regime change and the nation building that  will come later is going to cost us additional billions of dollars.

We have seemingly endless money to spend for illegal, unauthorized  warmongering, but there is no money available for healthcare for  Americans. It doesn't have to be this way. We are the richest Nation in  the world. We have the money to make sure everyone has healthcare.

Voting to extend these healthcare tax credits is the least that we  can do for Americans to show them that we are focused on them and their  needs.

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
