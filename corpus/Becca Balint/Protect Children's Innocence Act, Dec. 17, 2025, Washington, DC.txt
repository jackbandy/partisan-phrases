Protect Children's Innocence Act


Ms. BALINT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in fierce opposition to  Representative Greene's bill that would throw doctors and parents in  jail for providing lifesaving medical care. Even for Republicans, this  bill is extreme.

Are we really attempting to lock up parents and doctors?

Your kids' medical care is none of their damn business.

We should call their obsession with being in your kids'  pediatrician's office and what treatment they are getting in a  pediatrician's office what it is. It is creepy. It is a creepy  obsession we have had to deal with for years.

The science is clear: Evidence-based, medically necessary care for  transgender youth is safe, effective, and supported by every major  medical association in the United States, including the American  Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

My Republican colleagues know this, because this intentionally  discriminatory bill includes a bunch of exemptions to allow other kids  to receive the exact same medical care.

I call on my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this truly reprehensible  piece of legislation. Congress should not be making medical decisions  for your kids.

For this reason, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill back to committee. If the House rules permitted, I  would have offered the motion with an important amendment to this bill.  My amendment would ensure that this bill does not compromise the  private medical records of a minor or result in parents and doctors  being thrown in jail.

Ms. BALINT. Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in  voting for the motion to recommit.

Ms. BALINT. Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.

Ms. BALINT. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
