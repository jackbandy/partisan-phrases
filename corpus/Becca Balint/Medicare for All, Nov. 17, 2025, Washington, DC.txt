Medicare for All


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696754/medicare-for-all


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, the healthcare system that we have today  doesn't work for anyone except if you are an insurance company. I hear  it from Vermonters all the time: Our healthcare system is on the brink,  and every choice Republicans make leads us further into collapse.

Republicans have no plan for healthcare, and they never have. For the  last 15 years, all they have done is try to repeal, defund,  deauthorize, and dismantle the Affordable Care Act with no alternative  ever presented.

Americans are so tired of hearing about a concept of a plan or  volumes of ideas.

Mr. Speaker, I will tell you the plan: Medicare for all. I will tell  you the vision. It is that every American has access to affordable  healthcare, to good jobs, to good schools, to clean air and water,  housing they can actually afford, safer communities, and a functioning  democracy. That is the vision.

I want the American people to know that Democrats are not giving up  on healthcare. We are going to continue to fight.
