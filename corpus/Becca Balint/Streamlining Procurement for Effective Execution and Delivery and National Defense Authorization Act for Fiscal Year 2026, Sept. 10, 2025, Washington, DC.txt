Ms. BALINT. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to this  amendment.

If passed, this amendment would immediately prohibit TRICARE coverage  of mental health counseling for transgender young people. Let me repeat  that. This amendment would take away mental health care services for  transgender kids of servicemembers. That is what we are talking about.

This amendment is intentionally discriminatory and will result in  higher rates of mental health issues and suicide for trans youth, kids  who already experience higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide  compared to their peers.

Republicans' all-out assault on healthcare right now has put these  people into a state of constant fear and anxiety. Imagine that you are  a servicemember, you are a parent, and you hear from a doctor that  Congress has banned medically necessary care endorsed by every major  medical association that would literally help save your child's life.  All young people in this country should have access to the mental  health care that they need, full stop.

Forcing servicemembers to choose between being able to provide  healthcare for their family, for their kids, or serving their country  does not make our military stronger, does not make our country safer,  and it will not--no matter what the Member says, it will not make  transgender people in this country disappear.

I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
