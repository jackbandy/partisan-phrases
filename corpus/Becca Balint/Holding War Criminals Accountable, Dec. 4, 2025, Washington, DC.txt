Holding War Criminals Accountable

Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, the Uniform Code of Military Justice is  clear. It requires servicemembers to obey lawful orders and to refuse  illegal orders.

We can't order a servicemember to commit a crime. It is that simple.  If someone is a servicemember, he can't follow an order that requires  him to commit a crime.

Recently, my Democratic colleagues merely reminded our servicemembers  of their lawful duty. The President's reaction was that these  Democratic Members of Congress were traitors and should be hanged.

Fast-forward to last week, when we learned that Secretary Pete  Hegseth ordered the illegal killing of defenseless survivors of an  attack on a boat in the Caribbean. This is what our colleagues were  warning about.

Mr. Speaker, Secretary Hegseth and anyone else who commits war crimes  must be held accountable. Secretary Hegseth has to go.
