Statement of Sen. Mark R. Warner on Joseph Maguire


U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement on the resignation of former acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire:

"I'd like to thank Joe for his service and wish him the best for the future. While he and I haven't always agreed on everything, at both NCTC and as Acting DNI, I have always known him to be serious, sincere, and doing his best to protect both his country, and the men and women of the intelligence community who worked under him. We should all be grateful to people like Joe who devote their entire careers to protecting their fellow Americans -- regardless of partisan politics."
