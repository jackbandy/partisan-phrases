Sen. Warner on Supreme Court Taking Up Trump Administration Challenge to ACA


U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-VA), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, released the following statement after the Supreme Court said on Monday that it will hear the Republican lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Texas v. U.S., later this year:

"The President continues to claim he supports protecting people with preexisting conditions, yet his Administration continues to pursue this lawsuit that will rip protections away from millions of Americans without any viable plan to fix it.

"The uncertainty created by the Trump Administration's repeated attacks on the Affordable Care Act jeopardize essential health care coverage for Virginia families. I am committed to strengthening our health care law, and will do everything in my power to protect it."

In the Senate, Sen. Warner has sponsored several bills to block the Administration's efforts to undermine the ACA and protect people with preexisting conditions. Last year, Sen. Warner led the entire Senate Democratic Caucus in forcing an up-or-down vote on overturning a Trump Administration rule that explicitly undermines protections for preexisting conditions by flooding the health care market with junk health care plans, which are often advertised in low-income communities or communities of color. That vote was defeated as a result of Republican opposition, jeopardizing protections for millions of Americans with preexisting conditions.
