Letter to the Vice President - Warner Expresses Concern with Violence, Harassment Against Asian Americans in Wake of Coronavirus Outbreak


Dear Vice President Pence:

I am deeply concerned about increasing reports of verbal harassment and violent attacks against Americans of Asian descent across the country since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). I encourage you, your coronavirus task force, and members of the Administration to share only confirmed and verifiable information about COVID-19 and dispel misinformation or discriminatory rhetoric to help prevent suspicion, panic, and race-based assaults. 

Referring to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a "foreign virus" that "started in China" spreads xenophobia and racism, which is especially concerning as we experience a rise of domestic terrorism right here at home.  

We request your help to counter this narrative and help ensure Americans are not vulnerable to any kind of race-based attack or harassment as a result of this outbreak, which has been a disturbing byproduct of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Thank you for your attention to this request and I look forward to your response.
