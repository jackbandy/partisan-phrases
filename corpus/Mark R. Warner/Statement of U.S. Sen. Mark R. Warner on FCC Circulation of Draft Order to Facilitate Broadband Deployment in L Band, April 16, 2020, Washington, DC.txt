Statement of U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner on FCC Circulation of Draft Order to Facilitate Broadband Deployment in L Band


U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-VA) issued the following statement today, after the FCC circulated a draft order to facilitate broadband deployment in L band: 

"I am pleased to see Chairman Pai circulate a draft order to finally allow for commercial deployments in the L Band. Throughout the history of commercial mobile communications, the U.S. has been solutions-oriented, favoring evidence-based testing and technology innovation to promote efficient spectrum usage. As the U.S. works to lead the world in 5G innovation -- and as we work to promote wider coverage here in the U.S --  it's all the more important to ensure valuable mid-band spectrum is put to use.

"Ligado, a Virginia company, has endured years of back-and-forth as the issue has been studied and re-studied. I encourage the Commission to approve this draft order expeditiously."
