Sens. Cramer, Warner Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Allow Remote Online Notarizations Nationwide


U.S. Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and Mark Warner (D-VA) introduced S. 3533, the "Securing and Enabling Commerce Using Remote and Electronic (SECURE) Notarization Act of 2020," today. This bipartisan legislation permits immediate nationwide use of Remote Online Notarizations (RONs), a type of electronic notarization where the notary and signer are in different physical locations. 

"Americans shouldn't have to risk their health or safety to execute important financial or legal documents, especially when they could do so from the safety of their own home," said Senator Cramer. "The SECURE Notarization Act brings the notary process into the 21st century, allowing people to securely complete documents while still following recommended health and social practices amid the coronavirus pandemic."

"Virginia has safely and securely allowed the use of remote notarizations for years," said Senator Warner. "At a time when most people should be staying at home, there's no reason anyone should have to leave just to get notary services."

The SECURE Notarization Act authorizes every notary in the United States to perform RONs, requires tamper-evident technology in electronic notarizations, and provides fraud prevention through use of multifactor authentication. Click here for a one pager on the bill and here for an FAQ section.

The legislation is endorsed by the American Land Title Association (ALTA), Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) and the National Association of Realtors (NAR). North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum also supports the bill.

"By harnessing the power of technology, we can give North Dakotans and all Americans the convenient service they expect and deserve in the safety of their own homes," said Governor Burgum. "We're grateful to Senator Cramer and Senator Warner for introducing this legislation to bring the notarization process into the 21st century."
