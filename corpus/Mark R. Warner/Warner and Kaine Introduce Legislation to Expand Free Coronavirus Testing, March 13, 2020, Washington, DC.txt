Warner and Kaine Introduce Legislation to Expand Free Coronavirus Testing


Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine joined their colleagues in introducing the Free COVID-19 Testing Act, legislation that would expand free tests to confirm coronavirus (COVID-19) infections.

The Free COVID-19 Testing Act would waive cost-sharing for COVID-19 diagnostic testing and related health care services for individuals enrolled in private health plans, Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, VA as well as for federal civilians, American Indians and Alaska Natives. Private insurers would be barred from imposing limits like prior authorization for testing. For uninsured individuals, this legislation would cover the cost of lab fees, and states would have the option and new incentives to cover COVID-19 diagnostic testing and related health care services through their Medicaid programs.

"Costs should never be a barrier to accessing potentially life-saving testing," Warner and Kaine said. "This legislation ensures any Virginian can get tested without the fear of a medical bill they can't afford. The Senate must immediately pass this critical legislationto help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus and protect public health."
