Statement of Senate Intel Vice Chair Warner on the President's retaliation against ICIG Michael Atkinson


U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement after President Trump informed the congressional Intelligence Committees of his intent to fire the Intelligence Community Inspector General, Michael Atkinson:

"In the midst of a national emergency, it is unconscionable that the President is once again attempting to undermine the integrity of the intelligence community by firing yet another an intelligence official simply for doing his job. The work of the intelligence community has never been about loyalty to a single individual; it's about keeping us all safe from those who wish to do our country harm. We should all be deeply disturbed by ongoing attempts to politicize the nation's intelligence agencies."
