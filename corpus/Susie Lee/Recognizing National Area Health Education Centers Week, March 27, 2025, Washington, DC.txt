Ms. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the week of March  24th to March 28th of 2025 as National Area Health Education Centers  Week, or AHEC week.

Southern Nevadans are facing a dire shortage of health care  providers, which means longer wait times, fewer choices, and less  access to quality care. To solve this crisis, underserved communities  like ours need to expand the resources we offer so that medical  providers can learn and grow their careers in southern Nevada.

AHECs are a part of that solution. These centers connect students to  local populations, which helps facilitate future engagement and boosts  care in our communities. That has been and will continue to be key as  we fight to ensure every Nevadan has access to the health care they  need.

The AHEC program has already trained millions of health care  professionals. Across our state, from Elko to Reno to Las Vegas, the  AHEC program is strengthening the future of our health care workforce  which will help the collective health of all Nevadans.

That's why I'm proud to support this program and why, year after  year, I've fought to secure essential federal investments in the  national AHEC program.

On behalf of my constituents at the Nevada AHEC program, their  national counterparts, and the thousands of Americans who benefit from  the care fostered by AHECs, I am proud to recognize this National Area  Health Education Centers Week.

I thank them all for their dedication to keeping our communities  healthy.
