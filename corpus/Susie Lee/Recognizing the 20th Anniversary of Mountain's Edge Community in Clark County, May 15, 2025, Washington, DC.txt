Ms. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and celebrate the  20th anniversary of the Mountain's Edge community in Clark County,  Nevada.

Since its groundbreaking in 2005, Mountain's Edge has grown into one  of the most vibrant communities in the southwest area of the Las Vegas  Valley. Mountain's Edge sits at the foothills of the Spring Mountains,  and was envisioned as a place where residents could live, work, and  thrive with the surrounding natural beauty.

Over the past two decades, that vision has become a reality for the  more than 40,000 people that call Mountain's Edge home Today, its  residents can enjoy outdoor living with 700 acres dedicated to open  green spaces, parks and trails. This award-winning community is home to  over 70 diverse neighborhoods with convenient access to strong schools,  shopping centers, and other amenities. Not only does its outdoor  recreation set it apart, but Mountain's Edge offers its residents a  strong sense of community.

I would like to extend my congratulations to the Mountain's Edge  Master Association, local businesses, schools, first responders, and  all the residents who have helped shape the community's success over  the last 20 years. I wish its residents continued success and community  spirit for decades to come.
