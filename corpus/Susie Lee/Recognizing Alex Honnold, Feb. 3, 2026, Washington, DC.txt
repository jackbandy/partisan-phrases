Recognizing Alex Honnold


Ms. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my  constituent, Alex Honnold, on his remarkable climb of one of the  world's tallest skyscrapers, Taipei 101, without a rope.

Alex is a world-class athlete and perhaps one of the best athletes of  our time. He is also known for being the first person to ever free solo  El Capitan in Yosemite.

I am proud to say that Alex and I have worked together to promote  outdoor recreation with my PARC Act, which helps protect climbers on  our beautiful public lands. Alex also founded the Honnold Foundation,  which partners with marginalized communities to expand equitable solar  access around the world.

Nevada's Third District is honored to have such an accomplished  athlete with a passion for outdoor recreation and making the world a  better place. We are all looking forward to seeing what Alex will  accomplish next.

I congratulate Alex.
