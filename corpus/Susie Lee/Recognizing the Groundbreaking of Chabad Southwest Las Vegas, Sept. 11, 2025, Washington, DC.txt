Recognizing the Groundbreaking of Chabad Southwest Las Vegas


Mr. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  celebrate a milestone moment for the Jewish community in southern  Nevada--the groundbreaking of the permanent home of Chabad Southwest  Las Vegas, which will take place on September 13, 2025.

Founded under the leadership of Rabbi Levi Wilhelm and Mrs. Chayala  Wilhelm, Chabad Southwest has become a vibrant center for Jewish life,  learning, and community in the Southwest Las Vegas Valley.

The new permanent home of Chabad Southwest Las Vegas will serve as a  hub for worship, education, and fellowship. It will house weekly prayer  services, holiday programs, adult and child education classes, Mommy &  Me programs, women's groups, after-school enrichment, and a wide  variety of cultural and social gatherings. This expansion will allow  Chabad Southwest Las Vegas to better serve families, individuals, and  future generations, strengthening the fabric of the southern Nevada  community.

The groundbreaking marks not only a construction project but also the  realization of a vision--``Building Our Future Together''--that will  ensure the Jewish community in the region has a spiritual, educational,  and cultural home for decades to come.

On this historic occasion, I ask my colleagues to join me in  congratulating Rabbi Levi and Mrs. Chayala Wilhelm, the dedicated  members of the Chabad Southwest Las Vegas community, and all those  whose generosity and commitment have made this day possible. Their  efforts stand as a testament to the enduring values of faith, family,  and community that enrich our great state of Nevada and our Nation.
