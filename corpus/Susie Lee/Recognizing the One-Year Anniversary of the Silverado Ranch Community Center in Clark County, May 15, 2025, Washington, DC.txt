Recognizing the One-Year Anniversary of the Silverado Ranch Community Center in Clark County, Nevada


Ms. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and celebrate the  one-year anniversary of the Silverado Ranch Community Center in Clark  County, Nevada.

Since opening its doors, the Silverado Ranch Community Center has  become a cornerstone of engagement, learning, and well-being for  families and residents of all ages. From youth programs and senior  activities to public meetings and fitness classes, the Center has  served as a vital hub for connection and opportunity in the growing  southeast area of the Las Vegas Valley.

This achievement would not have been possible without the foresight  and commitment of the Clark County Commission, whose leadership  continues to invest in high-quality community infrastructure that  enhances the lives of local residents. Their support reflects the  values of accessibility, inclusion, and forward-thinking civic  development.

I would also like to extend heartfelt gratitude to the dedicated  staff of the Silverado Ranch Community Center. Their tireless efforts,  professionalism, and welcoming spirit have made this first year a  resounding success.

As we celebrate this anniversary, let it serve as a testament to what  can be accomplished when local government, public servants, and  community members come together with a shared vision. This is a great  milestone in our community.

I look forward to many more years of growth, service, and celebration  at Silverado Ranch.
