Ms. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  tremendous achievement of eleven young men from Troop 407 in Las Vegas  who will receive their Eagle Scout Awards simultaneously on December 6,  2025. This event marks only the second time nationally, and the first  in Las Vegas, that a troop has achieved such a feat.

These young men are setting the example of what Scouts and young  people can achieve. It is not easy to earn the prestigious rank of  Eagle Scout--one must persevere through years of hard work, demonstrate  strong leadership, and dedicate countless hours of service to others.

The Scout Motto is ``Be Prepared'' and becoming an Eagle Scout is one  of the best ways for a young person to prepare for a life of service  and leadership in their community. Las Vegas is proud to have raised  these boys into young leaders, and we are looking forward to seeing  what all eleven of them become in the years ahead.

I commend the hard work, dedication, and achievement of Jacob  Bennett, Cannon Castor, Ethan Dastrup, Christian Earl, Jackson Hedin,  Nixon Hunt, Jack Hyer, Issac Koval, Seth Leedom, Michael Norton, and  Luke Robison. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing their achievement.
