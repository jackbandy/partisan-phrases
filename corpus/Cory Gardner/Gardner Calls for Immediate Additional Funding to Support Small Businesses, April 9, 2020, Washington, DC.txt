Gardner Calls for Immediate Additional Funding to Support Small Businesses


U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) released the following statement after the Senate failed to provide an additional $250 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, which was created under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

"The Paycheck Protection Program is one of the most important aspects of the CARES Act and we must do whatever is necessary to keep it running and funded," said Senator Gardner. "Small businesses in every corner of America are applying for this support to keep our economy moving and workers on payroll, but Congress must provide more funding. There is no time to wait -- small businesses and workers in Colorado need relief right now. It's shameful that Chuck Schumer blocked emergency aid on the same morning we received the most recent unemployment numbers, which continue to show small businesses need immediate funding."
