Gardner Statement on the Death of General Qassem Soleimani


U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) issued the following statement regarding the death of Qassem Soleimani, commander of Iran's Quds Force, and other pro-Iran militia leaders in Iraq.

"I commend the Administration for taking this decisive action today in Baghdad against Tehran-backed terrorists. The world should not mourn Qassem Soleimani, a man whose name is synonymous with murder in the Middle East and who was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members," said Senator Gardner. "I now urge the Administration to be prepared for possible retaliation, including against U.S. troops stationed in the region, and to consult closely with Congress on any next steps should the situation escalate. I hope Iran will realize its future depends on stopping its support of terrorism."
