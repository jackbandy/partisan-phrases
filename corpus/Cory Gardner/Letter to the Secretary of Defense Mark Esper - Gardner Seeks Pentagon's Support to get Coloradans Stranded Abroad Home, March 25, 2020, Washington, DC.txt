Letter to the Secretary of Defense Mark Esper - Gardner Seeks Pentagon's Support to get Coloradans Stranded Abroad Home


Dear Secretary Esper:

I write to urge your prompt review and approval of a request made by the U.S. Department of State for the support and assistance of U.S. Transportation Command. The State Department is requesting this assistance as they work to repatriate American citizens abroad.

The State Department estimates there are roughly 50,000 American citizens currently seeking repatriation back to the United States including hundreds of Colorado families, students, business owners and healthcare providers. 

U.S. Transportation Command's ability to provide logistical support is critical to ensuring the success of the State Department's efforts and I urge your prompt approval of their request. Thank you for your assistance on this important matter.
