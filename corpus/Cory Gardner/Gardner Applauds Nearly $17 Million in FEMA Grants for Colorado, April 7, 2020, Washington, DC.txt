Gardner Applauds Nearly $17 Million in FEMA Grants for Colorado


Today U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) applauded the announcement that the state of Colorado will receive a total of $16,688,096.55 in expedited federal funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for eligible emergency protective measures to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding is authorized under the Robert T. Stafford Act and comes as a result of the President approving the state of Colorado's Disaster Declaration, which Gardner and members of the Colorado delegation urged.

"Communities all across Colorado are hurting right now as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic," said Senator Gardner. "I'm pleased that FEMA is awarding this much needed grant to Colorado so that we have the resources to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and I'll continue to work with public health officials and leaders at every level to ensure our state can get through this crisis together."

According to FEMA, examples of eligible emergency protective measures include the activation of State Emergency Operations Centers, National Guard costs, law enforcement, and other measures necessary to protect public health and safety.
