Gardner Applauds House Passage of the CARES Act


U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) released the following statement on the House of Representatives passing H.R. 748, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Earlier this week the CARES Act passed the Senate by a vote of 96-0.

"I've spoken to countless Coloradans who are worried about their futures and how to provide for their families because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the CARES Act provides the much-needed relief that Coloradans and the American people need," said Senator Gardner. "The CARES Act provides approximately $2 trillion in direct economic relief and will support our frontline healthcare providers, families, and workers in Colorado as we get through this crisis together. I encourage the President to sign the CARES Act into law right away to give the American people relief now."

Gardner has called for immediate action on the CARES Act since Sunday. The approximately $2 trillion relief package will provide direct payments to American families and more than 1.3 million Coloradans: $1,200 for individual tax filers, $2,400 for married couples, and an additional $500 per child.

The relief package contains $377 billion to help prevent workers from losing their jobs and small businesses from going under, which will cover 58 million American workers and more than 30 million small businesses. Small businesses make up 99.5 percent of all businesses in Colorado and employ more than 1.1 million Coloradans.

The CARES Act will provide $100 billion to our frontline healthcare providers to support them during the response and assist with lost revenue and $150 billion for states and tribes to assist in their response to the COVID-19 outbreak through the Coronavirus Relief Fund.

In addition to providing direct payments to families, support for the health care system, and stabilization for American businesses, the CARES Act will create a new form of federal unemployment insurance (UI), similar to what Gardner proposed. This new temporary "Pandemic Unemployment Assistance" program will permit far more American workers to receive UI payments during the crisis, including those whose employers have been forced closed by the COVID-19 emergency.
