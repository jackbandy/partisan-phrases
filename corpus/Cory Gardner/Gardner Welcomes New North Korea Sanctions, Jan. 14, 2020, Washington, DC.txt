Gardner Welcomes New North Korea Sanctions


U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, released the following statement welcoming the U.S. Department of the Treasury's announcement of new sanctions against entities that participate in North Korea's supply of slave labor abroad, as mandated by Gardner's North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 (NKSPEA), signed into law in February 2016, and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (ARIA) that was signed into law in December 2018.

"I welcome these new sanctions on North Korea from the Treasury Department and I renew my call for the international community to increase the pressure on North Korea, as Kim Jong Un continues to build his illicit weapons programs and engage in human rights abuses against his own people. I urge the Trump Administration to ramp up the maximum pressure campaign against Pyongyang and its enablers until such time as the regime fully complies with international law," said Senator Gardner. "Through bipartisan legislation like NSKPEA and ARIA, Congress has spoken loud and clear that the goal of any negotiation with Pyongyang should be the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea."
