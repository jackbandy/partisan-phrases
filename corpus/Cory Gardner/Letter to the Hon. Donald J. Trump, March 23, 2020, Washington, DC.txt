Letter to the Hon. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States - Colorado Delegation Members Urge President Trump to Approve National Guard Assistance in Colorado to Combat COVID-19 Pandemic


Dear President Trump, We write to urge you to quickly approve the request made by Governor Polis for additional authorities and funding under 502(f)(2)(A) of Title 32, U.S. Code to assist the State of Colorado to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The Governor is requesting this authority and funding for the Colorado National Guard as they work to respond to incidents related to the preservation of life and property in connection with COVID-19. Last week, the Governor determined the need to increase the Colorado National Guard force to full time status and intends to utilize the Colorado National Guard to fulfill immediate COVID-19 response requirements across the state. We urge your prompt approval of this request so the Governor may fully task the Colorado National Guard as he finds necessary to support the state's COVID-19 response efforts. Thank you for your assistance in this important request.
