Gardner Statement on Iran's Missile Attack Targeting U.S. Forces


U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement regarding Iran's attacks on two bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq.

"I condemn the ballistic missile attacks from Iran against bases in Iraq hosting U.S. troops. No one wants war with Iran and I urge Tehran to de-escalate immediately. The Administration must continue taking all necessary steps to keep our troops, diplomats and country safe, and to regularly consult with Congress on next steps," said Senator Gardner.
