Gardner Statement on the CARES Act


U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) released the following statement regarding today's vote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 748, the legislative vehicle for the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

"While families wonder how they are going to put food on the table and businesses wonder how long they can stay open, there are some in Washington who are playing political games with this relief package," said Senator Gardner. "The CARES Act provides more than $1 trillion in economic relief, and the longer Congress waits to act, more Americans will suffer. We must provide immediate relief to Americans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we must do it now. I'm calling for swift passage of the CARES Act to provide the health care system and American families the support they are demanding from Congress and the peace of mind that we will get through this crisis together."

At the direct guidance from the Tri-County Health Department and the Attending Physician, Gardner is in self-quarantine and did not have the opportunity to vote in support of this measure.

Since the first reported case of the novel coronavirus in the United States, Senator Gardner has been in close contact with local, state, and federal officials to prepare to slow and contain the outbreak. You can read more about Senator Gardner's actions to protect Coloradans from COVID-19 here.

The CARES Act will aid American workers, small businesses, and the health care system as we respond to the COVID-19 pandemic:
