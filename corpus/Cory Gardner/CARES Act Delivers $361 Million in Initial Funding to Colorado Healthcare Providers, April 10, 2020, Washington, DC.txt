CARES Act Delivers $361 Million in Initial Funding to Colorado Healthcare Providers


Today U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) released the following statement regarding the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) delivery of $360,905,482 in emergency relief funding to 4,696 Colorado healthcare providers who receive Medicare and $785,371 in hospital preparedness funding for the Colorado Hospital Association. This funding comes as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020. 

"Our brave doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals on the front lines of COVID-19 need immediate support." said Senator Gardner. "That's why I fought hard for Congress to pass the CARES Act, and I'm glad to see this initial round of funding reach our Colorado healthcare providers in need. More work needs to be done, but these critical funds will help more hospitals to remain open to provide critical services to our communities and fight COVID-19."

The CARES Act included a $100 billion fund to support healthcare providers. Today HHS distributed a total of $30 billion to healthcare providers nationwide. According to HHS, this quick dispersal of funds will provide relief to both providers in areas heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and those providers who are struggling to keep their doors open due to the necessary hold on elective procedures, their main source of revenue. These are direct payments, not loans, and more information from HHS can be found here.
