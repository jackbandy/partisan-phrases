Gardner Joins Bipartisan Legislation to Provide More Relief to Parents


U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) announced he is joining S. 3679, the Newborn CARES Act, bipartisan legislation to help new parents receive the $500 per child direct payments provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act instead of having to wait next year for the payment. Under current law, parents of children born in 2020 have to wait until 2021 to receive the CARES Act's $500 payment. The Newborn CARES Act waives the existing rules regarding the Child Tax Credit to require the Internal Revenue Service to provide direct payments to parents as soon as a social security number is assigned to children born in 2020.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused immediate financial hardships for families in Colorado and across the United States. People need relief now, not in a year's time. This is especially true for new parents," said Senator Gardner. "While the CARES Act took bold steps to provide immediate relief, we must continue to improve it to ensure it reaches people in need. I'm proud to join this effort to support parents and families, and I'll continue working to ensure that we can get through this crisis together."
