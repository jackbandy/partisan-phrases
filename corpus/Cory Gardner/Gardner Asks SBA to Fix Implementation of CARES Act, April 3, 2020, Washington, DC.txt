Gardner Asks SBA to Fix Implementation of CARES Act


U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) released the following statement today regarding the Small Business Administration's (SBA) implementation of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Stabilization (CARES) Act:

"People in Colorado and across the nation are suffering and small businesses are closing because of the COVID-19 pandemic. These are extraordinary times that require extraordinary action, and the Small Business Administration's implementation of the CARES Act must rise to meet the moment," said Senator Gardner. "Congress passed the CARES Act to immediately provide relief for small businesses and it should be implemented in a way that makes CARES Act assistance as broadly applicable as possible. I am concerned that the SBA guidance and implementation of the Paycheck Protection Program does not meet the objectives Congress had in designing the emergency relief package. The Small Business Administration's guidance must make it easier to help more workers and small businesses."

Senator Gardner is calling on the SBA and Treasury Department to immediately issue updated guidance that, at a minimum:

Expressly acknowledges that Payroll Protection Program borrowers are still able to receive Economic Injury Disaster Loans after April 3, 2020 in order to help pay non-payroll expenses.Clarifies the eligibility rules to reflect congressional intent that this program be as widely available as possible, including by expressly eliminating any prior rules that may bar small businesses that are  Critical Access Hospitals or Rural Health Clinics that have quasi-governmental relationships, are financial institutions, have limited gaming licenses, and those with outside investors who do not have a controlling stake in the company.Removes the newly-imposed 25 percent cap on non-payroll expenses.Implements the forgiveness standards regarding full time equivalent employees and average wages that are expressly stated in the CARES Act.Clarifies that entities that take advantage of the NAICS 72 code affiliation exception for eligibility are eligible for loans on a per location basis rather than simply having one loan for the entire entity. Senator Gardner is taking action to protect small businesses and workers in Colorado from COVID-19:

Gardner and members of the Colorado congressional delegation are calling on the Small Business Administration to interpret the CARES Act to ensure that Critical Access Hospitals and Rural Health Clinics are eligible for certain assistance, particularly the Paycheck Protection Program.Gardner urged the Small Business Administration to increase access to loans provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act to benefit more workers, restaurants, and franchises in Colorado and across the nation.Immediately after the President signed the CARES Act into law, Gardner joined the Colorado congressional delegation to request that the Small Business Administration immediately implement the act's loan programs for small businesses. Gardner and bipartisan colleagues introduced the MEP Crisis Response Act of 2020, which would help Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) centers stay open during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.On March 17, Gardner called for additional provisions known as the American Workforce Act to support American workers and boost the economy to be included in the economic stimulus package being considered by the Senate in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.Gardner and the entire Colorado congressional delegation wrote to the Administrator of the Small Business Association on March 17 requesting that the SBA approve the Governor of Colorado's request for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) declaration.
