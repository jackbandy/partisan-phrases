Gardner Statement on Impeachment Trial


Today U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) released the following statement on the beginning of the U.S. Senate's impeachment trial.

"Impeaching the president is one of the most serious constitutional actions, and I will closely evaluate the law and facts presented to the Senate as I fulfill my constitutional duties as a United States Senator. The Senate will move forward with an organizing resolution that is modeled after the same basic principles as the Clinton impeachment proceedings and will establish guidelines for a bipartisan trial allowing both sides to present their case," said Senator Gardner.
