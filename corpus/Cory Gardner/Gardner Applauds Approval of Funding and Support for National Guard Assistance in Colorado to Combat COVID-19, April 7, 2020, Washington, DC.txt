Gardner Applauds Approval of Funding and Support for National Guard Assistance in Colorado to Combat COVID-19


U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) released the following statement after President Trump directed under his authority that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) fund 100 percent of the emergency assistance activities associated with COVID-19 pandemic response using Colorado's National Guard forces. Gardner and members of the Colorado congressional delegation requested that the President approve the request from Colorado Governor Jared Polis for additional funding to support the Colorado National Guard as they work to respond to statewide incidents related to the preservation of life and property in connection with COVID-19.

"Since the first reported case of COVID-19 in the United States, I have been in close contact with local, state, and federal officials to ensure the state of Colorado has the support and funding necessary to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic," said Senator Gardner. "I'm pleased that the President approved the request from members of the Colorado congressional delegation and Governor Polis to fund the use of the Colorado National Guard for state response efforts. I will continue to work with my colleagues and the Governor to ensure Colorado is prepared to contain and combat this deadly virus."
