National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2019


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, in a Chamber that has seen more than its  fair share of life-or-death matters, especially the last several  months, this bill that I am about to ask for unanimous consent to pass  before the Senate, the creation of the 988 National Suicide Hotline  bill, is a bill that gives hope to life. 

  This bill will save lives. It has been an honor to work on this  legislation so we can come together as a Chamber, as a Congress, as a  nation, to do all we can to save those precious lives, those precious  voices, that we lose too often. 

  In Colorado, we lose someone to suicide every 7 hours. The bill that  we are about to pass can change that. We can all change that with  responsible actions, more funding, more efforts, and this is our start  to continue the great work that has been done, to build on the work  that we know needs to be done, to create a 3-digit 988 national hotline  to prevent suicide.

  Mr. GARDNER. I know of no further debate on the bill, as amended. BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, this is a big deal for the lives of so  many people across the country, and I am grateful to our colleagues  that we were able to get this passed today.
