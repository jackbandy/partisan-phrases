Letter to Pete T. Gaynor, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator - Congressman Neguse, Colorado Delegation Members Request Continued and Expanded PPE for Colorado Senior Living Facilities


Dear Administrator Gaynor,

We write today to urge the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") to continuedelivery of personal protective equipment ("PPE") to senior living facilities in Colorado throughJune and July 2020, and to include assisted living residences and intermediate care facilities, inaddition to nursing homes, in your distribution plans.

Since the beginning of the novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic, senior living facilitieshave been the epicenter of both outbreaks and deaths in Colorado and across the country.COVID-19 linked deaths in Colorado's senior living facilities continue to be the single largestcontributor to COVID-19 fatalities in our state, representing approximately 61% of total deaths.According to some reports, Colorado has experienced as many as 105 deaths in seniorcongregate living facilities in just one single week.

We understand that FEMA is delivering two rounds of PPE to Colorado nursing homes on May18th and again the following week. We greatly appreciate this much needed support, and wethank you for your efforts to expand the availability of PPE to our seniors and front-line workerswho support them. Given the unique and devastating effects the COVID-19 outbreak has had onthese facilities and the citizens they serve, we request that FEMA regularly continue delivery ofPPE supplies to nursing homes in Colorado throughout June and July 2020. It is also criticallyimportant to expand the criteria governing which facilities receive these supplies to includeassisted living facilities and intermediate care facilities, which also care for Medicaid enrollees,because they too have faced staggering infection and death rates and are in desperate need ofthese resources.

We understand the immense task before you and FEMA as you work to ensure all communitieshave the resources they need to combat this crisis, and we appreciate the supplies you havedistributed to Colorado thus far. Thank you for your consideration, and we request an immediateresponse to this inquiry.
