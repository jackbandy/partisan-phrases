Gardner Statement on Reports of Potential Coronavirus Case in Colorado


U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, released the following statement regarding a potential novel coronavirus case in Colorado:

"I am aware of reports of a potential novel coronavirus case in Lakewood, Colorado," said Senator Gardner. "I contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of State earlier this week to ensure Congress is prepared to serve as a collaborative partner in a successful response. At my urging, the U.S Senate Committees on Foreign Relations and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions held a briefing today from top U.S. public health officials, and I stand ready to help local and state officials respond if the need arises."

On January 23, Gardner sent letters to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Dr. Robert Redfield, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, inquiring about a reported novel coronavirus case in the United States, efforts to contain the outbreak in Wuhan, China, and China's handling of novel coronavirus samples. 

Today the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held an all-senator briefing with top administration health officials regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak that was first detected in Wuhan, China.
