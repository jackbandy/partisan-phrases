Gardner Reacts to the State of the Union Address


U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) released the following statement in response to President Trump's State of the Union address:

"Tonight the President offered a call to put division behind us and to come together to create new opportunities for Americans from every walk of life," said Senator Gardner. 

"A divided Congress does not mandate a divisive Congress. There is ample opportunity for us to work across the aisle to provide strong national security, to lower health care costs for American families, and to repair our country's crumbling infrastructure. There's bipartisan support in Congress and across our great nation to fix our broken immigration system, address rising suicide rates, and protect the public lands that we all cherish.

"We must remember that much more unites us than divides us as Americans. I hope that our nation's elected leaders can rise to meet this moment to work in a bipartisan fashion to solve the most challenging issues facing the American people. It's what Coloradans demand."
