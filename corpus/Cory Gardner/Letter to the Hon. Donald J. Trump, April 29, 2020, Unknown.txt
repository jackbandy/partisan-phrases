Letter to the Hon. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States - Congressman Crow Leads Colorado Delegation in Urging President Trump to Extend Funding to Keep National Guard Deployed in Colorado


Dear Mr. President,

 

As the bipartisan Congressional delegation of Colorado, we write today to request an extension of 502(f)(2)(A) of Title 32, U.S. Code, funding for the Colorado National Guard in support of the fight against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) through the end of the year, with monthly assessments based on state requirements. This funding was approved on April 7 and an extension is critical to ensuring the safety and health of our citizens.

 

The Colorado National Guard has been critical to Colorado's response with their ability to support state efforts. Hundreds of National Guard servicemembers have been providing invaluable support for testing civilians and Guard personnel, logistics and warehouse distribution support, planning for Colorado's Emergency Operations Centers, homelessness outreach and much more. All of these efforts are essential to mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on Coloradans, and the need for this support is expected to persist through the end of the year. We share the Governor's concern that prematurely ceasing federal funding for National Guard COVID-19 support operations will hinder Colorado's ability to respond and could contribute to a possible second wave of infection.

 

Therefore, we request that you extend the 502(f)(2)(A) funding authorization through the end of the year, with monthly assessments, in order to allow the Colorado National Guard to continue supporting these mission critical tasks.

 

Thank you for your urgent consideration of this important matter.
