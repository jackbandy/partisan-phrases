Gardner Statement of Support as Senate Considers the CARES Act


U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) released the following statement regarding today's vote to proceed to H.R. 748, the legislative vehicle that will include the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

"Coloradans deserve relief now. The health and security of all Americans are at risk, and we must take quick, decisive action to support the health care response and provide families and small businesses relief," said Senator Gardner. "Inaction is inexcusable. Congress must act now -- at minimum we need more supplies, research, mental health resources, telehealth access, and support for states. I'm calling for the swift passage of this measure to provide critical assistance to American families. Partisanship is wrong during this crisis and as elected leaders it's time to lead and ensure the American people that we will get through this."

In addition to providing direct payments to families and stabilization for American businesses, the CARES Act will create a new form of federal unemployment insurance (UI), similar to what Gardner proposed. This new temporary "Pandemic Unemployment Assistance" program will permit far more American workers to receive UI payments during the crisis, including those whose employers have been forced closed by the COVID-19 emergency.

At the direct guidance from the Tri-County Health Department and the Attending Physician, Gardner is in self-quarantine and did not have the opportunity to vote in support of this measure.
