Gardner Calls for Additional Economic Stimulus Measures in Response to COVID-19


Today U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) called for additional provisions to support American workers and boost the economy to be included in the economic stimulus package being considered by the Senate in response to the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

"Congress must move heaven and earth to protect American workers by providing them with immediate financial assistance and make sure workers and businesses can get through this crisis. This is urgent and it needs to get done now," said Senator Gardner. "As the Senate considers the House-passed economic stimulus package, I am offering a series of proposals for next steps that will help provide support for the American people to sustain the economic hardships brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak and provide a path back to prosperity after this national emergency is behind us. This assistance for both employees and employers needs to be made available immediately with as much flexibility and as little red tape as possible."

Gardner's Proposals for Consideration will Provide Assurances for American Workers and Keep the Economy Moving:

Creating a new form of federal unemployment insurance (UI) that permits an individual to be designated a "COVID-19 Furlough," making them eligible for temporary UI payments while still technically on their employer's payroll.Mandating forbearance on late fees for past-due bills, helping Americans with cash flow issues stemming from the COVID-19 outbreak.Establishing a large fund for financial assurance to businesses to operate through the IRS, which would include grants, low-cost micro-loans, and a COVID-19 employee retention tax credit to help businesses bridge this crisis.
