CARES Act Delivers $327M in Transit Funding to Colorado


Today U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO), a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, released the following statement celebrating the news that the state of Colorado will receive $327,257,604 in funding from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19. This funding was provided under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020.

"Every sector of our economy is hurting because of COVID-19, which is why I fought hard to have the CARES Act signed into law," said Senator Gardner. "Our transit agencies support the connectivity of Colorado and this funding will help provide critical support needed to help address this pandemic, and I'll continue to fight for Colorado's needs at the federal level."
