Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025

Mr. MOSKOWITZ. Mr. Chair, Representative   Thomas Massie is a budget  hawk who walks around with the debt clock--which, by the way, I bought.  It is $99 on the website. Today, he talked about that if the Republican  budget passes, the budget deficit doesn't get better. It gets worse.

Then Elon Musk commented, and he said: That sounds bad.

Boy, that is awkward. I mean, you know how much we hate it when you  guys fight amongst each other.

That wasn't enough, right? Then Representative Massie went to the  Republican meeting where the budget was being discussed, and he came  out, and he said: You know what, they convinced me.

They convinced me that he is a ``no.'' The reason he is a ``no,'' he  said, over the next 3 years, it is going to add almost a trillion  dollars to the debt, and that is in the best case, the most rosy  scenario. Then he said: That is a lie.

This clock that we have that has the debt, it is still going up. DOGE  has not yet reversed it. I say that as a member of the DOGE Caucus who  wants to shrink the size of government and cut spending. This 36,  instead of your budget making it a 35, it is going to make it a 37. We  are going to go to $37 trillion in debt.

If you pass this today, this idea about DOGE or the Republicans being  fiscal hawks or wanting to cut spending is no longer a reality.
