Pending Opm Claims

Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I have been  hearing from so many constituents in northern Virginia about the Office  of Personnel Management. That is because there are 16,000 retirement  claims pending at OPM, and a lot of them are my constituents.

We were making progress towards reducing that backlog. Then what  happened? DOGE and this administration came in and started  indiscriminately firing OPM employees. This even included the  congressional liaisons who help our offices resolve retirement issues  for Federal retirees.

I have heard directly from my constituents who spent their careers  serving this country. These folks are now waiting months or even years  for their retirement benefits that they earned. This backlog directly  impacts their ability to pay their bills, remain financially stable,  and live with dignity.

Our constituents are paying the price, and we are hearing about it.  Let's inject some common sense and fix this process instead of firing  key staff for short-term savings.
