Concerns About Hurricane Season

Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise because I am deeply concerned  about hurricane season and the state of FEMA and our national disaster  preparedness.

A little bit of context: One of the reasons I got involved in  politics was as a student at Tulane University in New Orleans,  Hurricane Katrina hit the city at the time.

I couldn't believe the waste, fraud, and incompetence that occurred  at places like FEMA.

Here we are, years later, with an acting FEMA director who doesn't  even know we have a hurricane season. Well, we do have a hurricane  season, and it is estimated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, or NOAA, that there will be at least 10 hurricanes this  year.

After firing hundreds of weather experts and saying they wanted to  traumatize the rest, NOAA is now scrambling to refill those empty  positions. They also cancelled critical storm damage reports this year.

It just seems like we are not prepared right now for hurricane season  and other major natural disasters.

Let's be clear. There is no room for error when it comes to this, and  this poor leadership will cost us lives. The American people deserve  better.
