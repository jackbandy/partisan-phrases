January 6 Attack

Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, we will never forget that 5 years ago  on this day at this President's urging, violent insurrectionists  stormed the Capitol and attempted to overturn a peaceful transition of  power.

I know that the families of the 140 police officers who were  criminally assaulted will never forget either, especially those lives  who were taken that day and in the days that followed.

Virginians will never forget that day either, including the  Virginians who were in the Capitol complex that day and the family of  Howie Liebengood, a Capitol Police Officer from Virginia, who took his  own life in the aftermath.

Most importantly, the American people will never forget that day or  the 1,500 people who were charged with crimes for what they did, but  then received a pardon from President Trump in one of his first actions  of 2025.

At least 33 of them have been rearrested, charged, or sentenced for  other crimes, including plotting the murder of an FBI agent or child  sexual assaults. We will not forget, and those who try to gloss over  that day or rewrite history will just be on the wrong side of history.
