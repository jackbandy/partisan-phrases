Student Visa Process


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about an issue that is  hurting our country that we aren't talking about enough, and that is  the uncertainty of this administration's student visa process.

We have students doing groundbreaking research that are being forced  to leave the country, students that last academic year contributed $43  billion to the U.S. economy. The administration is trying to prevent  institutions from enrolling top international students altogether.

The United States has welcomed international students for decades.  Some of them include world leaders, founders of billion-dollar  companies here, and over 40 percent of the founders of the American  leading AI companies, just as a few examples.

We are shooting ourselves in the foot. Instead, why don't we go back  to being a place that welcomes students to dream big and conduct  groundbreaking research no matter where they are coming from?

Why don't we become a place that unites people of all backgrounds and  welcomes the best and brightest? That is something that makes our  country great.
