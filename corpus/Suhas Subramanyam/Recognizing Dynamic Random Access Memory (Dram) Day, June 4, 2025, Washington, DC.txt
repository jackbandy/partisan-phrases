Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  proclamation recognizing National Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)  Day:

Whereas, Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) has been a       cornerstone of technological innovation since its invention.       On June 4, 1968, Dr. Robert Dennard was granted the patent       for DRAM, a breakthrough that revolutionized computing and       paved the way for the digital age. Today, DRAM is an       essential component in countless devices, from personal       computers and smartphones to advanced data centers and       artificial intelligence systems.

Whereas, DRAM's impact on our economy and society is       profound. It has enabled the development of faster, more       efficient, and more powerful computing systems, driving       innovation across industries and improving the quality of       life for millions of people. The semiconductor industry,       including DRAM manufacturing, supports millions of jobs and       contributes significantly to the United States' global       leadership in technology.

Whereas, As we celebrate National DRAM Day, we honor the       legacy of Dr. Robert Dennard and the countless researchers,       engineers, and manufacturers who have advanced this critical       technology. Their ingenuity and dedication have made DRAM a       vital part of our technological infrastructure, fueling       economic growth and enhancing our national security.

Whereas, The semiconductor industry is a cornerstone of the       U.S. economy, driving innovation and supporting millions of       jobs. In 2024, global semiconductor sales reached a record       $627.6 billion. The U.S. semiconductor industry directly       contributes $246.4 billion to the nation's GDP and employs       over 300,000 people in roles such as chip design, electronic       design automation, and manufacturing. Additionally, the       industry supports nearly two million indirect and induced       jobs. With continued investments and advancements, the       semiconductor sector is projected to see further growth,       reinforcing its critical role in the U.S. economy.

Whereas, During National DRAM Day, we recognize the       importance of DRAM to our economy and our way of life. We       celebrate the achievements of those who have contributed to       its development and reaffirm our commitment to supporting the       semiconductor industry and bringing manufacturing back to       American soil.

NOW, therefore, be it resolved, I, Suhas Subramanyam,       Member of Congress, call upon the people of the United States       to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and       activities that honor the legacy of DRAM and its impact on       our world.
