Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, this week's address to Congress was one  of the longest addresses to Congress ever, yet there was no real plan  or blueprint for how we are actually going to lower costs.

We heard a lot about Greenland and golden tickets and something about  Mars, but we didn't actually hear about lowering costs because the  actions of this administration will actually raise costs for every  American.

If you cut Medicaid, for instance, not only will you cut off care for  millions, it will raise the healthcare premiums of every American, not  just the ones on Medicaid. Health costs will go up.

If you fire half the people who administer Social Security and  undermine it for our seniors, costs will go up. If you continue the  brain drain in our government and fire Federal workers who protect  consumers or do critical safety or health research, you will make us  less safe and costs will go up.

Mr. Speaker, this administration's policies will directly lead to  costs going up for all families. Americans deserve better.
