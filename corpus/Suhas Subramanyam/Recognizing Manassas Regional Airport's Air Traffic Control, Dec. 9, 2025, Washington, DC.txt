Recognizing Manassas Regional Airport's Air Traffic Control


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate the extraordinary Air Traffic Controllers of Manassas  Regional Airport. Despite challenging circumstances during the 2025  federal government shutdown, the dedicated Manassas Tower workforce  worked arduously to ensure seamless airport operations. Manassas Tower  is one of few towers to have zero staffing triggers throughout the  shutdown, a testament to the unwavering commitment and efforts of its  employees.

The Manassas Tower is a critical part of regional air traffic. As the  largest regional airport in Virginia and ranked in the top 25 percent  of busiest general aviation airports, it oversaw over 100,000 flights  in 2024. In addition to prioritizing the safety of all flights moving  through the airport, Manassas Tower is committed to providing  mentorship and professional development for all its staff. Their  impeccable training for controllers has equipped several employees with  the skills and experiences to transition to major airport facilities.

Manassas Tower has historically prevailed against difficult  circumstances. It has faced critical infrastructure issues yet  maintained its role as a leader in air traffic control. As they prepare  for commercial flights in 2026, they will continue to be a role model  for perseverance and leading with purpose.

I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing and commemorating the  efforts of the Manassas Air Traffic Control Tower team.
