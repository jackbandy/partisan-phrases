Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, Virginia Federal employees are still  being fired, RIF'd, and harassed by this administration.

Last week, I heard from a constituent who received a termination  letter from the Department of Health and Human Services just hours  before it went into effect with no access to their equipment, no  offboarding information, and no details about their severance. This is  one of the many, many stories that I get at my office every week.

Civil servants who dedicate their career to serving this government  deserve transparency, clarity, and respect. But across agencies, this  administration continues to blindly and abruptly fire Federal workers.  What do we have to show for it? A complete and total brain drain.

We are losing talent and expertise in our Federal Government, all  while the administration prioritizes tax cuts and handouts to the  biggest corporations.

To my constituents impacted by these cuts, I will continue to demand  answers, and I will continue to fight to hold this administration  accountable.
