Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the  ROTOR Act. I thank the sponsor as well.

On January 29, 2025, a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American  Airlines flight 5342 collided midair outside of DCA, and 67 lives were  lost.

Among the victims were families from my community in northern  Virginia. We lost children, parents, and members of the ice-skating  community. These folks had their whole lives ahead of them. It is a  tragedy that has had a profound and lasting impact on our community and  our Nation.

This week, the families of the victims are here on Capitol Hill, and  I got to speak with them today. They have one message for us: Pass the  ROTOR Act.

The ROTOR Act addresses the glaring holes in aviation safety around  DCA that allowed this completely preventable accident to happen. It  does so by requiring military and civilian aircraft in busy airspace to  broadcast and receive real-time traffic information.

Having been more than a year since the collision, it is time for  there to be real accountability and change. We must ensure that nothing  like this ever happens again, and people don't fear flying.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.
