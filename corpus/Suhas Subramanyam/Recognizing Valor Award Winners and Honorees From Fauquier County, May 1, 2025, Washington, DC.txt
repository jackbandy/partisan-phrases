Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the recent  Valor Award winners and honorees from Fauquier County, individuals who  embody courage and service.

Sponsored by the Fauquier Chamber of Commerce, the Valor Awards  highlight the critical work local law enforcement and first responders  do every day to keep our communities safe.

Among this year's Lifetime Achievement Awards was Warrenton Police  Chief Tim Carter. A native of Fauquier County, Chief Carter has served  his hometown as a police officer, corporal, detective sergeant,  lieutenant, and deputy chief before becoming police chief in 2023.

Also recognized with a Lifetime Achievement Award was retired fire  chief Dale Koglin. Chief Koglin served the Warrenton Volunteer Fire  Company for 62 years, first joining when he was only 14 years old.

Another award went to Sergeant John Larson, who donated a portion of  his liver to a child after screenings said he was a good match.

George Scheulen was honored for his courageous service as a platoon  leader in the Army.

To the Valor Award winners and honorees, and to those who work to  keep our communities safe every day, I thank them for their service.
