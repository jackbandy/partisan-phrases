Cuts to Medicare and Medicaid

Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I recently met with a group of  advocates for children with complex medical needs and disabilities.  They all shared stories of their kids with special needs or that they  were simply allies.

Their vision is that all children with these complex needs should  have the medical care, education, and support they need to thrive.  However, this vision will never be achieved by slashing the coverage of  children on Medicaid or firing NIH scientists who are responsible for  developing treatments and cures for rare diseases.

The plan to severely cut Medicaid and gut NIH funding is a serious  threat to the health and stability of so many families across the  country like the ones I met with last week. I will continue to fight  with these kids for the care that they deserve.
