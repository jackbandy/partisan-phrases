Gutting the Department of Education

Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, when I recently asked someone who  supports gutting the Department of Education how that decision would  make American education better or what the Department even does, they  couldn't give me an answer.

Let me tell you how gutting this Department will hurt every parent,  teacher, and, most of all, students in our country.

In Virginia alone, 5,000 teachers would be at risk of removal; our  education system would face a $2.4 billion shortfall; and we would lose  $2,000 in spending for each student. Our most vulnerable students with  special needs would be unable to access the resources they need to  succeed, and low-income students would go hungry.

Education has always been a great equalizer and an engine for  socioeconomic mobility. Without the Department of Education, we will be  left with a system that leaves Americans--rural, urban, and suburban-- underserved, uneducated, and unprepared.

If we want to lead in the world of innovation and discovery, if we  want opportunity for everyone, we need to invest in the next  generation, our kids.
