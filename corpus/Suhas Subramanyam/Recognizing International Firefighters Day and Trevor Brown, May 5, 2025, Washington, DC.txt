Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of International  Firefighters Day to honor the brave firefighters in Virginia and around  the world.

Virginia is home to thousands of dedicated firefighters who put their  lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe.

Whether it is battling wildfires, responding to plane crashes, or  kitchen fires, firefighters are always there to answer the call.

International Firefighters Day is also a solemn reminder of those we  have lost in the line of duty. Just last year, our community lost one  of our own, Firefighter Trevor Brown, a husband and father of three  from Sterling. He passed away responding to an emergency gas leak call.  His sacrifice, like that of many others, is a testament to the courage  that firefighters display daily, running into danger to keep us safe.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the fighters in Virginia and around the world  for their service. Because of them we are safer and stronger and our  communities are more prosperous.
