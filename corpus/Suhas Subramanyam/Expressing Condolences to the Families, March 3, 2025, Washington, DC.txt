Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Kansas (Ms.  Davids) for yielding.

On January 29, our community in northern Virginia was shattered.

Mr. Speaker, 67 lives were taken from us far too soon when American  Eagle Flight 5342 and Army flight call sign PAT 25 collided. Many of  those on Flight 5342 called Virginia's 10th District home, and they  leave behind countless family members, friends, and loved ones in our  community.

I am especially heartbroken for the children who were on the plane.  Some of them were former Loudoun County Public Schools students and  members of our local figure skating community at the Ashburn Ice House  and Ion International Training Center, places where I have taken my own  daughters figure skating in the past.

To the servicemembers who lost their lives on PAT 25, we thank them  for their service to our Nation.

To the first responders who rushed to the scene and worked in frigid  and dangerous conditions to save anyone they could, including Fairfax  and Prince William Counties' first responders, we are so grateful.

To the professionals at the NTSB who are investigating this tragedy  to ensure we learn from it and to prevent others like it, they have our  appreciation and full support in their work.

Finally, to my constituents, we will do anything and everything we  can to make sure a tragedy like this doesn't happen again.

Mr. Speaker, it will take a long time to come to terms with this  loss, but I know that our community is resilient. It has warmed my  heart to see how it came together for us in the aftermath of such an  awful tragedy. I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.
