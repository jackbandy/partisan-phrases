Recognizing Aanhpi Month


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the month of May as  Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

Virginia is home to a dynamic and growing AANHPI community, a  community that across the country and in Virginia contributes in every  field, including business, education, science, technology, and, of  course, government.

Many leaders in our community emigrated from Asian countries in  pursuit of the American Dream, like my family. Their stories and  success are a testament to the founding ideals of our country.

Mr. Speaker, I wish a happy AANHPI Month to everyone.

Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to recognize the month of May as  National Cancer Research Month.

Every day, 5,000 Americans will be diagnosed with cancer. More than  1,600 will die from it every day.

Now more than ever, we must support our dedicated scientists and  doctors across the country who work to treat and care for patients.

I urge everyone to support robust funding for medical research for  cancer so we can find a cure and stop the cuts to cancer research.

Mr. Speaker, I wish a happy National Cancer Research Month to  everyone.
