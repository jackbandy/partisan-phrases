Don't Underestimate Susan Perri

Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, last week, the first speaker in line at  my townhall was Susan Perri.

My colleagues wouldn't know it at first, but Susan has difficulty  speaking. Within the last 6 months, she had a 7-centimeter tumor  removed from her adrenal gland, but Susan is refusing to stay quiet.

She made sure to be the first in line to share her story and how the  Republican budget cuts to Medicaid and research will impact her, her  family, and the American people. I could hear her loud and clear.

That is why I am honored that Susan will be my guest at the  President's joint address because we should all hear her voice, too.

Susan is a retired special education teacher from Fauquier County.  Her husband is a retired Postal Service employee of 44 years, worried  about his retirement benefits getting cut. Her son has cystic fibrosis,  and her son has benefited from cutting-edge NIH research and lifesaving  medication approved by the Federal Government.

As this administration is cutting the very science that saves lives,  Susan's fight gives me hope that we can all make our voices heard and  fight for change.

Don't underestimate Susan, and don't underestimate the American  people.
