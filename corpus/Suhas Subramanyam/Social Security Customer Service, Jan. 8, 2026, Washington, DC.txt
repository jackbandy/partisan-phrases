Social Security Customer Service

Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, 74 million Americans depend on Social  Security, but because of the Trump administration's actions, customer  service has completely collapsed. The agency faces 6 million backlogged  cases, 12 million delayed field-office transactions, and some of the  worst wait times in history.

Why is this happening? It is because the Trump administration pushed  out 7,000 Social Security employees. That is 12 percent of their  workforce. Offices were reorganized overnight, hiring was frozen, and  thousands of workers were reassigned.

This has real-life consequences for my constituents, like a 75-year- old stroke victim who hasn't received his check for months because he  can't drive or use a computer, or an immigrant who may lose his job  because a name correction appointment is weeks away, or the retiree who  waited hours just to schedule an appointment on the phone.

Social Security is not a political experiment. It is a promise. The  American people paid into the system and earned these benefits. They  shouldn't have to fight their own government to receive them.
