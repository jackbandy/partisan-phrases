Medicaid is America's Healthcare Safety Net


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, $880 billion, that is how much Medicaid  funding is on the chopping block. Medicaid funding provides lifesaving  care for millions of Americans.

Medicaid is America's healthcare safety net. Without it, hospitals  operating on thin margins will close, medical debt will skyrocket, and  kids across the country will suffer.

Americans on Medicaid are your grandparents, your neighbors, your  friends, and they are at risk because of these cuts. Virginians, in  particular, are vulnerable because even if 1 percent of Federal funding  of Medicaid is cut, 600,000 Virginians will lose their  Medicaid expansion coverage. This means pregnant women, babies, kids  with disabilities, and our most vulnerable neighbors will lose  coverage.

These cuts will make us less healthy and they will make us less  prosperous and less safe. Even if you are not on Medicaid, emergency  rooms will be overwhelmed with uninsured patients and your premiums and  healthcare costs will go up, as well.

Mr. Speaker, every American should speak out against these cuts to  Medicaid.
