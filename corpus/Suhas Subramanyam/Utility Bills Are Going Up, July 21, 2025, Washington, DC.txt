Utility Bills Are Going Up

Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, across the country, Americans'  utilities bills are going up, and this administration's actions are  just making things worse, giving out favors to the fossil fuel  industry.

Last week, employees of the Department of the Interior received a  memo, and basically what the memo said was that Secretary Burgum has to  personally approve every single wind and solar project.

This will add red tape to renewable energy developments while  stifling new technology innovation. It is just ridiculous. We want to  be a leader in clean energy, but instead we are having the Secretary  personally having to approve every single project.

They are cutting off the future of American renewable energy and  leaving a void for our adversaries to fill. Our Federal Government  should be investing in new innovations that help lower utility costs  and allow Americans to live better and healthier lives. Instead, this  administration is doing favors for the fossil fuel industry and picking  energy favorites.

I think this is bad for every single American, and I think we need to  stand up against it.
