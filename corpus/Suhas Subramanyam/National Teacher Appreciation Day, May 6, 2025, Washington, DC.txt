National Teacher Appreciation Day


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, to the more than 3.8 million educators  across the country, I wish you a happy National Teacher Appreciation  Day.

I know our teachers work tirelessly to provide our students with an  education that opens the door to opportunity, and I am sure everyone in  this body can think of a teacher that profoundly impacted their lives.

Despite working long hours, without a salary that reflects the work  they do, our teachers in Virginia have made sure that Virginia schools  consistently rank high in the country for K-12 performance, test  scores, and even safety. Over 92 percent of our students here in  Virginia graduate high school in 4 years, and we have amazing teachers  to thank for that.

We need to make sure our teachers are being paid what they are worth,  have the support they need in the classroom, and have access to all the  resources they need to do their jobs.

Happy National Teacher Appreciation Day to all the teachers out  there.
