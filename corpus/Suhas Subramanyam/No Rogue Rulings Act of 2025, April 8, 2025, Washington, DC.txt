No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, let's take a step back and be clear on  what is going on here.

This administration maybe didn't have the votes or will to get  legislation through Congress, so it created these executive orders and  broke the law in doing so. Some of these orders are unconstitutional,  and that is why there have been so many injunctions to stop the  lawbreaking.

These injunctions were celebrated by the other side when they stopped  actions under the previous Democratic administrations. Yet, now that  President Trump is in office, this bill exists to help the President do  whatever he wants, even if it is unconstitutional.

I get asked a lot these days about what is going to happen when this  President ignores the courts. Wouldn't we have a constitutional crisis  on our hands?

Mr. Speaker, this bill makes it easier for the President's actions to  go unchecked. By blocking nationwide injunctions, people will be  powerless to quickly stop illegal and unconstitutional actions.

This bill is simply another loyalty bill for the President, up there  with naming airports after him or putting his face on Mount Rushmore.  Loyalty to the President should not supersede the rule of law or  loyalty to uphold the Constitution. This bill doesn't just take power  away from judges, but it takes power away from the American people.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation.
