Disability Determination Renewals


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, families with disabled adult children  deserve our full support in Congress, but these days they are being  forced through unnecessary security and disability determination  renewals to prove that their disabled adult children deserve assistance  at all.

That is right, recipients are asked to prove over and over and over  again whether a person still has a genetic condition, a chromosomal  disorder, or a known lifelong disability. On top of that, these reviews  are too often done incorrectly, inconsistently, and without regard for  medical reality.

This process is exhausting for families, distressing for individuals  with disabilities, and a waste of money because--that is right--we are  spending a lot of taxpayer dollars to prove over and over again that  Americans with permanent conditions need assistance.

The burden on these families doesn't stop there because Medicaid  waiver hours are being reduced nationwide, which means families are  losing vital community-based care, forcing parents who are able to fill  the gaps.

This is not efficient at all. This is neglect. This administration  must step in, make changes now, and end the unnecessary reviews.  Support the families instead.
