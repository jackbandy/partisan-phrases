Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, May is Mental Health Awareness Month,  and there are so many groups in Virginia that do incredible work for  our community in this space.

One I want to recognize today is Loudoun Serenity House which  champions affordable, peer-based services for people living with mental  health conditions or who are on the road to recovery from substance  abuse.

Serenity House started as a shared dream of two sisters, Melissa and  Rachel Hinton, and they established their first recovery house in  October of 2020. It has since expanded to serve so many people in our  community.

This past weekend, I had the honor of joining them for their annual  5K race. I didn't run, but I did shoot the starting gun. Most  importantly, we raised a lot of money, and it was a beautiful day.

We must remember that nearly one in four American adults live with  mental health conditions, yet the majority do not receive the care they  need. Peer-based programs have been really successful. They are a very  affordable way of getting that care.

Happy Mental Health Awareness Month to everyone, and I am grateful  for groups like Loudoun Serenity House.
