Remember

Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, today, on the 24th anniversary of 9/11,  we remember the thousands of innocent people whose lives were lost, as  well as the courage of servicemembers and first responders who  responded that day, many of whom called Virginia home.

The emotional and physical scars of those attacks persist today. We  have a duty to care for those who were affected by the devastation.  That includes the servicemembers who returned to work at the Pentagon  the next day and were exposed to asbestos and other toxins, causing  lifelong negative health effects.

That is why I am introducing the Susan E. Lukas 9/11 Servicemember  Fairness Act today. This legislation will close the gap in coverage and  ensure that these servicemembers receive the care and benefits they  deserve.

This bill is named after retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Susan  Lukas, a constituent from Gainesville, who returned to work in the  Pentagon the day after 9/11 and still suffers to this day chronic  health issues as a result.

These brave servicemembers, like Susan, sacrifice so much to keep our  country safe. They deserve our support.
