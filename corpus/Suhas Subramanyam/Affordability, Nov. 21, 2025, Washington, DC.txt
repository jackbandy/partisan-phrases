Affordability


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I am so happy to be back. This is our  first week back in a long time, and it is great to see all my  colleagues since the House was closed during this entire shutdown.

I was so excited when I started hearing from the President and the  other side of the aisle that we are going to start working on lowering  costs and that we are going to address affordability in America.  Finally, after 10 months in this administration, and, yes, one of the  first bills that we voted on, H.R. 1949, actually increases Americans'  utility bills by even more, by hundreds of dollars, in fact.

So, once again, we are back here, and we are doing things that  actually raise costs on the American people. So with tariff policies  that promote monopolies or policies that simply raise costs directly on  the American people, this Congress, this leadership continues to raise  costs and not actually address affordability.

We have tons of legislation that are stuck in committees that have  not gotten a fair hearing or gotten to this floor that will address the  cost of utility bills, healthcare, and so many other things head-on.  Instead, the leadership on the Republican side continues to raise costs  on the American people.

So we have the ideas. If the President wants to work with us or  anyone else on the other side wants to work with us, then we are ready  to do that to lower costs for the American people.
