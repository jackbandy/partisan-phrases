Lowering Costs for All Virginians

Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, meet Tariff Bear. He is cute, soft, and  cuddly. He is only triple the cost of a normal bear like him. He is  here to show us how this administration's tariffs are raising costs on  families' favorite toys, clothes, and shoes because toys like him are  becoming unaffordable to families.

I recently got a letter from a concerned young Scout who is worried  that the administration's tariffs will drive up the cost of Legos, one  of his favorite toys. As a dad, this hits home for me. My girls are  Lego and Disney Princess fans. I have watched the movie about ten  times.

From Transformers to Lincoln Logs to Barbies, this administration is  raising prices in our toys aisles with these tariffs. We keep hearing  that this President is ushering in a golden age. I  think raising costs on families buying gifts, clothes, or shoes for  their children does not sound very golden to me,

To the young constituent who wrote to me, I will fight to lower costs  for all Virginians and all Americans and to keep Tariff Bear where he  belongs, which is in hibernation.
