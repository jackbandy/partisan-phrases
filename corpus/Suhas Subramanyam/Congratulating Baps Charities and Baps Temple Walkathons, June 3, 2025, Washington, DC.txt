Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate BAPS Charities  and the BAPS Temple in Chantilly for hosting its annual walkathon at  One Loudoun in Ashburn.

The walk, which I was proud to join, was a huge success and raised  money for Mobile Hope which serves at-risk youth in Loudoun County.  BAPS Charities is a global charity, active across the country and in  nine other countries, and its efforts are volunteer-led.

BAPS Charities aims to express a spirit of selfless service through  five key areas: health awareness, educational services, humanitarian  relief, environmental protection and preservation, and community  empowerment. Events and walks like the one this past week happen all  over the country and make a huge difference.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate BAPS Charities on a great event and all  of its great work.
