Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Patriot High  School class of 2025.

This year's graduating class is a remarkable group of students,  including 405 students who are continuing their studies in college, 24  who are attending trade schools, 19 who are planning to serve in the  military, and 32 who are heading straight into the workforce.

In their time at Patriot High School, this class achieved so many  great things, including receiving $14.8 million in scholarship offers  and winning their eighth straight basketball district championship.

Mr. Speaker, I know that the class of 2025, whether it is in the  basketball gym, class, mock trial, or on stage, will carry their  lessons learned during their time at Patriot High School in whatever  they do next.

I congratulate the class of 2025, and they should not forget to thank  their parents and teachers, as well.
