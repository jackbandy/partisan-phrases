Restoring Retirement Processing for Federal Workers


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, this past year, more than 112,000  Federal employees retired, far more than last year. A lot of them  retired because they took the DOGE buyout deal, the Deferred  Resignation Program, where people were given a buyout if they resigned  by October. Others had simply put in their time and were ready to leave  and receive their earned retirement benefits.

We are here months later, and many of these Federal employees who  have served our country well are still waiting for their benefits and  the money that they are owed.

Our office has seen a huge spike in constituents experiencing delayed  retirement processing at OPM, at Federal agencies, and at payroll  providers across the government. These delays are not isolated. They  are systemic.

The administration knew these retirements were coming. It was part of  the DOGE plan, but once again, the administration was not prepared for  what came next. As a result, Federal retirees faced delayed annuity  payments, gaps in benefits, and real financial hardship.

These are families who are trying to pay mortgages, cover healthcare,  and plan their next chapter. This backlog is completely unacceptable.  We must fix it and restore trust in a retirement system that enables us  to recruit the great people who we have in government.
