Information Quality Assurance Act of 2025

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6329. This is about improving  the quality and transparency of information Federal agencies use to  make rules.

The bill would require OMB to update their guidance to ensure  agencies use high-quality, reliable information when creating new  rules. That means the best scientific, technical, economic, or  statistical information available.

Agencies would also have to make public the models, methods, and  information sources they use in rulemaking. Anyone in the public can  then give feedback on the information agencies use. The bill requires  OMB to report any public complaints to Congress.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this bill. This bill passed the  House  overwhelmingly last Congress, and I again urge my colleagues to support  the bill.
