Accessing Satellite Capabilities to Enable New Discoveries Act

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the ASCEND Act. The bill would  codify the successful Commercial Satellite Data Acquisition pilot  program.

The data acquired from the pilot project was shown to complement  Earth observations from NASA's fleet of satellites and instruments.  NASA has continued these activities as the Commercial SmallSat Data  Acquisition Pilot Program.

This bill also allows us to acquire commercial Earth remote sensing  data and imagery from vendors. The bill also includes provisions to  support data publication, transparency, and reports to Congress, and to  ensure the widest possible use of the data procured under the program  consistent with program goals.

This bill supports both science and our commercial remote sensing  industry, such as companies in my home Commonwealth of Virginia, by  augmenting scientific research with additional sources of data and  leveraging commercial capabilities.

I thank the bill's sponsors for their work on the ASCEND Act and  encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, as well.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Mr. Hurd and Ms. Bonamici, for  their work on this legislation. It is a great bill. I am a cosponsor  myself. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2600, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
