After 72 Hours Of Negotiating Improvements, Tester Votes To Deliver Critical Relief For Montana Workers, Families, Businesses, Hospitals


After 72 hours negotiating substantial, bipartisan improvements to COVID-19 stimulus legislation that had previously fallen far short, U.S. Senator Jon Tester today voted to deliver critical, urgent relief to Montana workers, families, small businesses, hospitals and others hardest hit by the outbreak.

On Sunday, Tester outlined his opposition to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's original spending package, which did not protect workers or businesses while bailing out large corporations, and got to work over the next 72 hours to improve the bill--successfully adding strong accountability provisions on loans to corporations, better protections for workers and businesses and an additional $55 billion in funding for hospitals, healthcare workers and community health centers, which will have a tangible impact on Montana's efforts to combat this crisis.

"This bill is far from perfect, but after working to fix some of its most serious shortcomings and make improvements, I believe it will now help provide the critical, urgent relief that Montanans need," Tester said. "After two failed attempts at delivering for Montana, I'm glad my Republican colleagues listened to our concerns and agreed to support our small businesses, employees, hospitals and communities that have been hit hardest."

Tester continued: "I'm troubled that the Administration and some of my colleagues forced us to accept their $500 billion slush fund in order to get needed relief for hardworking Montanans. I will be aggressive in making sure there is accountability and transparency in how this money is spent moving forward to combat waste, fraud, and abuse."

Tester has been working tirelessly to ensure that Montana is prepared to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak, speaking around the clock with Montana workers, business leaders, local government officials, Tribal members, and educators across the state to hear directly about the public health and economic effects of the outbreak, and what policy solutions would provide the most relief.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provides investments Tester pushed for, including:
