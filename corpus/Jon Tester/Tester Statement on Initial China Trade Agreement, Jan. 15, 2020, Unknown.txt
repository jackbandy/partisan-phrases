Tester Statement on Initial China Trade Agreement


Senator: "We shouldn't pat ourselves on the back when we have a lot more work to do"U.S. Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement welcoming the signing of the Administration's Phase I Agreement with China aimed at halting the escalating trade war:

"Today's phase one agreement with China is a welcome first step but we shouldn't pat ourselves on the back when we have a lot more work to do to end this self-inflicted trade war. Montana producers are hurting, and I'm going to keep fighting to make sure today's deal is enforceable and that China delivers on what they promised, because family farms and Main Street businesses are on the line." 

Tester has been an outspoken critic of President Trump's trade war and has pushed to hold the Administration accountable by passing legislation to give Congress a role in imposing tariffs. He has heard about the impact of these tariffs firsthand, holding in-person listening sessions with Montana farmers, ranchers, and small business owners about the consequences of the trade war.
