Tester congratulates Butte's Christian Sherman on acceptance to U.S. Air Force Academy


U.S. Senator Jon Tester congratulated Butte area high schooler Christian Sherman today on his appointment to the U.S. Air Force Academy.

Christian is a varsity wrestling and soccer captain at Butte High School. He is also a member of the Civil Air Patrol, the Western Aerospace Scholars Program, the National Honor Society, and plays piano at the First Presbyterian Church.

"Christian is one of Montana's best and brightest who has already proven himself a capable leader and a dedicated student," said Tester. "I have no doubt that he will continue to serve our state and country proudly as he moves on to this exciting new journey at the Air Force Academy."

Tester nominated Christian in December based on his academic accomplishments, extracurricular activities, and commitment to serving and leading in the United States military. A nomination from a member of Congress is the first step in students' applications to the four schools.
