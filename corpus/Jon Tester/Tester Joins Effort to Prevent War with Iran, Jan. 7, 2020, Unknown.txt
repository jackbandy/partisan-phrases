Tester Joins Effort to Prevent War with Iran


Senator signs on to war powers resolution ensuring Congress plays constitutional role in authorization of military forceU.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced he is joining an effort to prevent the Trump Administration from going to war with Iran without explicit approval from Congress.

"The American people - and the servicemembers who will be sent halfway across the world to defend us - deserve a transparent debate and vote by the folks who represent them in Congress about whether it's in our national interest to fight yet another war in the Middle East," Tester said. "While the world is better off without Qassim Soleimani, his killing without consultation with Congress or our closest allies cannot become the sole justification for an unconstitutional war with enormous consequences to American taxpayers and our military."

Following the Administration's killing of Iran's Qassim Soleimani on Iraqi soil, the Tester-backed resolution requires any hostilities with Iran be explicitly authorized by a congressional declaration of war or a specific authorization of the use of military force. It does not prevent the United States from defending itself from imminent attack.
