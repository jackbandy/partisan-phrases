Tester announces $10 million for child care providers in Montana


U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced he secured $10 million in funding to support Montana child care providers keeping their doors open to serve the families of essential workers-funding that was originally left out of Senator Mitch McConnell's COVID-19 response package.

"Child care providers are key to confronting this crisis," Tester said. "The care they provide allows critical health care workers, first responders, grocery store employees, and others on the front lines to continue serving our communities and keeping us safe and healthy. These funds will ensure child care providers can continue this essential work as we combat this crisis together."

The $10,113,887 is available through the Child Care and Development Block Grant program and will be distributed to child care providers by the State of Montana. Many child care providers are also small businesses, and this funding will help support these entities as they continue providing care to families across Montana.

Tester has been working tirelessly to ensure that Montana is prepared to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. After 72 hours negotiating substantial, bipartisan improvements to COVID-19 stimulus legislation that had previously fallen far short, Tester voted to deliver critical, urgent relief to Montana workers, families, small businesses, hospitals and others hardest hit by the outbreak. This funding includes $1.25 billion for the state of Montana.
