Eligible veterans will automatically receive stimulus checks, following calls from Tester & Moran


Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Ranking Member Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Chairman Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) released the following joint statement after the Treasury Department and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) clarified that eligible veterans who do not file income taxes will receive their stimulus checks:

"We're glad that the Treasury Department answered our call to provide veterans and survivors--who aren't normally required to file annual tax returns--with the same access to swift financial relief as everyone else during this crisis," said Senators Tester and Moran. "This is a critical step in removing an unnecessary burden from our nation's heroes, and will help our vulnerable population of veterans and survivors get through this unprecedented time. Moving forward, we must ensure that Washington provides veterans with their promised payments quickly, and without any additional bureaucratic hurdles."

Senators Tester and Moran have led the effort in Congress to ensure veterans were provided their Economic Impact Payments in a timely manner without having to file additional burdensome paperwork.

Earlier this month, the Senators urged VA Under Secretary for Benefits, Dr. Paul Lawrence, to develop a plan between the VA and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to provide veterans and VA beneficiaries their stimulus checks under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Tester additionally joined 45 colleagues in a letter to the Trump Administration, highlighting the urgent need to provide eligible recipients direct cash assistance.
