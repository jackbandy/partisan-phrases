As President Signs COVID-19 Package Into Law, Montana T Receive $1.25 Billion Secured By Tester


As the President signed the Phase III Coronavirus legislative package into law, U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced further details of the $1.25 billion coronavirus relief fund now available to Montana.

This money is a part of $150 billion made available to state, local, and Tribal governments to set up local relief funds. These funds were not included in Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's initial draft legislation but were added as a result of negotiations by Senator Tester and his colleagues to make sure the package was directed at providing relief to working Montanans and small businesses, and not just corporations.

"Now that this bill is law, I'm going to fight aggressively to ensure Montana workers and small businesses can immediately access the relief they need," said Tester. "Montana's state, local, and Tribal governments are fighting on the front lines of this pandemic, and I fought tooth and nail to secure $1.25 billion in this final package so our state has as many tools as possible to keep our communities healthy and safe. But our fight against effects of this virus is just beginning: I'll be working to make sure this money is getting swiftly into the hands of the folks that need it, and continuing to push for investments in the medical equipment our state so desperately needs to contain the disease."

Montana's $1.25 billion in funding is available directly to the state from the Treasury Department and it requires no state or local matching requirement. Montana will be able to use these funds for necessary expenditures to secure Montana's public health and combat the outbreak, including construction of emergency beds as well as the purchase of personal protective equipment, masks, and medical supplies, among others.

Tester also fought for and secured $10 billion for Tribal governments to help them respond to COVID-19, including $300 million for Tribal housing initiatives, as well as $20 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Tester has been working tirelessly to ensure that Montana is prepared to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Senate on Wednesday, after 72 hours negotiating substantial, bipartisan improvements to COVID-19 stimulus legislation that had previously fallen far short, Tester voted to deliver critical, urgent relief to Montana workers, families, small businesses, hospitals and others hardest hit by the outbreak.
