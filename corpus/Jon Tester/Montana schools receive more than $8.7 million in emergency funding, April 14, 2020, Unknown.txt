Montana schools receive more than $8.7 million in emergency funding, Tester announces


Continuing his push to provide relief to Montana's students and schools amid the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced $8,764,495 in Department of Education funding for the Montana Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund.

"I have spoken with educators, administrators and students across Montana and what is clear is that, from our elementary schools to our colleges and universities, everyone has felt the hurt from this public health crisis," said Tester. "These funds will help our schools weather this storm, so they can continue to do what they do best: teaching and training the next generation of Montana leaders."

Montana's allocation of $8,764,495 is based on a formula that accounts for the state's total school aged population (age 5-24) and the number of children counted under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The estimated $3 billion national total in the Governor's Emergency Educations Relief Fund from the CARES Act is awarded to governors in flexible funding to allow them to address the needs of their elementary and secondary schools as well as public institutions of higher education.

Last week, Tester announced $32 million in funding for more than 25 Montana colleges and universities after he pushed Senate leadership to include higher educational institutions in the coronavirus relief package, urging Congress to consider the importance of education in maintaining America's global educational edge. The CARES Act provides needed relief to those with student debt and allows federal student loan borrowers to defer their loan payments through September 30 to eliminate that financial pressure during the pandemic. Tester's bill ensuring no Montanan looking to qualify for Public Student Loan Forgiveness will be penalized for missing a payment during a national or public health emergency was also included in the CARES Act.
