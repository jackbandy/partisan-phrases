Letter to Hon. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States - Tester To Trump: Approve Montana'sMajor Disaster Declaration Request


Dear President Trump:

I write to urge you to expeditiously approve the State of Montana's major disaster declaration request to assist the state with its response to the COVID-19 crisis. The number of confirmed cases is rising rapidly in Montana, which is putting a tremendous strain on our public health resources and communities. Immediate federal assistance in Montana is vital to help the state slow the spread of the virus and mitigate the effects of this major disaster.

Governor Bullock submitted a major disaster declaration request in accordance with the Stafford Act late last week. Granting this request will allow the State of Montana to access resources for medical supplies, personal protection equipment, and treatment facilities. It will also help the state deal with the overwhelming negative effects this crisis is having on our workers and small business through programs like Disaster Unemployment Assistance.

As you have stated, the response to COVID-19 is predominantly a national responsibly. That is why I also urge you to grant Governor Bullock's request for 100 percent federal assistance. We must all work together to ensure that states and local governments are empowered to take care of American citizens.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Jon Tester
