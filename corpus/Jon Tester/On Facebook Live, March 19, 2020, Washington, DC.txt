On Facebook Live, Tester Answers Questions From Montanans On COVID-19


U.S. Senator Jon Tester hosted a Facebook Live Q&A today to answer Montanans' questions and direct them to resources during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Tester discussed best practices to limit the spread of the disease, gave an update on legislation to address the crisis, and directed Montanans towards resources for up-to-the-minute information on the outbreak.

"I wanted to get online with you all today because I know that folks are very worried about the coronavirus and its impacts on Montana," Tester said. "I want to listen to your concerns, answer your questions, and get your feedback on how we can help you - your family, your business, your local hospital-whatever it may be, during this difficult time."

Responding to questions submitted online by Montanans, Tester also spoke about his work to make sure the VA has the resources it needs to keep veterans safe, his effort to secure funds for Indian Country to address the crisis, and the need for expanded telehealth to help treat patients while keeping doctors and nurses safe and reduce pressure on hospitals being overwhelmed by COVID-19.

Tester has led the charge in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. He has introduced legislation to guarantee testing for the virus will be at zero cost, passed bipartisan legislation through the Senate to ensure veterans GI benefits are protected during the outbreak, and he is working to extend the IRS tax filing deadline. He has also doubled down on his efforts to press the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Indian Health Service to provide veterans, VA healthcare staff, and Tribes with access to proper resources and information.
