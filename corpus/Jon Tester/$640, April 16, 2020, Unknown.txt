$640,624 for Hamilton community health center, Tester announces


Continuing his push to make sure Montana's Community Health Centers have the funding they need during the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced $640,624 in Department of Health and Human Services funding for Sapphire Community Health in Hamilton.

"Montana's community health centers are moving heaven and earth to protect our communities during this pandemic," said Tester. "They are on the front lines of the battle with this disease, and this critical funding will help make sure they can keep Montanans healthy. We've got to make sure they have the resources to get the job done."

Tester successfully fought to secure continued funding security for Community Health Centers in the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, extending their funding through November 30, 2020, and he continues to push to ensure health centers and rural health providers have proper access to critical supplies like test kits, masks, and other personal protective equipment.

Tester has been working tirelessly to ensure that Montana health care providers are prepared to combat the COVID-19 crisis. Last week, he secured $111.5 million for Montana's hospitals, $9.1 million for Montana Community Health Centers, and $411,135 for research to help Montana providers prepare to respond to the pandemic. He recently demanded that the Trump Administration not leave rural hospitals behind in their coronavirus response, and he voted to deliver critical, urgent relief to Montana hospitals, workers, families, small businesses, and others hardest hit by the outbreak, which included $1.25 billion for the state of Montana.
