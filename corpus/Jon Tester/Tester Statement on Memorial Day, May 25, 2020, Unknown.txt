Tester Statement on Memorial Day


U.S. Senator Jon Tester, Ranking Member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, released the following statement today in honor of Memorial Day:

"It's an understatement to say that Memorial Day is a special day for this country. It's a day that we honor our men and women who have given the ultimate sacrifice to this country--and died in service. 

"The fact of the matter is that every day should be Memorial Day in this country. Because without the folks who serve us, this country would be a whole different place--this world would be a whole different world.

"So I just want to say thank you. Thank you to the folks who currently serve, thank you to those who have served, and most importantly--thank you to those who have given their lives for this country. It's the reason I'm able to talk to you today, and it's the reason we have our freedoms and our liberties.

"So with that, I wish you all the very best today, as we think to the people who have sacrificed so much for this country."

Ranking Member Tester is one of Congress' most effective advocates for veterans. He works with both Republicans and Democrats to ensure America's veterans receive the care and benefits they have earned. And he is continuing efforts to provide the Department of Veterans Affairs with critical resources to protect and serve veterans during the COVID-19 crisis.
