On fourth Facebook live in a month, Tester gives tips on avoiding scams, answers questions about coronavirus crisis


U.S. Senator Jon Tester answered questions from Montanans and provided updates on the COVID-19 response today on his fourth Facebook Live Q & A in less than a month.

Tester gave tips on how to avoid scammers looking to take advantage of the coronavirus crisis, answered questions about the new July 15th tax filing deadline, and steps he is taking to make sure the United States Postal Service remains operational, among other topics submitted by Montanans.

"The last thing folks should be thinking about while keeping their families healthy is filing paperwork with the IRS," Tester said. "I called for the filing deadline to be postponed--and the IRS did just that. The new deadline for federal tax filing is July 15th, and Governor Bullock pushed the Montana State tax filing deadline to July 15th as well."

Tester also discussed his ongoing efforts to make sure front line health care workers have the medical supplies they need to stay safe in face of the outbreak.

"You can bet I'll be keeping my foot on the gas to get these critically-needed supplies to Montana," Tester said. "And I'll continue fighting every day to make sure Montanans receive the accountability and the relief they expect from Washington in the face of this pandemic."

Tester has been working tirelessly to ensure that Montana is prepared to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. After 72 hours negotiating substantial, bipartisan improvements to COVID-19 stimulus legislation that had previously fallen far short, Tester voted to deliver critical, urgent relief  to Montana workers, families, small businesses, hospitals and others hardest hit by the outbreak. This funding includes $1.25 billion for the state of Montana.
