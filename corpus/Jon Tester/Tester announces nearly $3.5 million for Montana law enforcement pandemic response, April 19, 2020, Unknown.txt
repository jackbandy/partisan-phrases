Tester announces nearly $3.5 million for Montana law enforcement pandemic response


U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced $3,457,033 in Department of Justice funding for the Montana Board of Crime Patrol to help bolster Montana law enforcement's preparedness to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

"Members of Montana law enforcement are going above and beyond to help protect Montana communities from the spread of this pandemic," said Tester. "They are fundamental to the success of Montana's response to this virus, and I'm proud to have secured these resources that will help them get the job done safely."

This funding is made available through the Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding Program, which allows states and local government to support a broad range of activities to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the pandemic, including through overtime, personal protective equipment, hiring, supplies, training, and travel expenses.

Tester previously secured $1.3 million for local law enforcement and has been working around the clock to ensure that Montana's first responders and medical professionals have the necessary equipment to combat coronavirus. He also successfully pressured FEMA to ship 68,000 N95 masks to Montana after the agency failed to deliver on their promise to provide the state with PPE. He recently voted to deliver critical, urgent relief to Montana health providers including $16 billion to replenish the Strategic National Stockpile with PPE for frontline health workers, $850 million in Byrne JAG funding to help law enforcement purchase PPE and pay officer overtime, and $1.25 billion for the state of Montana to combat the virus.
