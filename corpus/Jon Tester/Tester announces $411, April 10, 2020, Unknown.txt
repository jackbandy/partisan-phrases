Tester announces $411,135 to help Montana hospitals combat COVID-19


U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced a $411,135 grant to help Montana's hospitals prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 crisis.

"Montana's frontline health care workers need all the support they can get, and this funding will help them continue to stay safe and effective during this outbreak," Tester said. "I'm keeping up the fight to make sure Montana's hospitals, community health care centers, and first responders have the resources they need to safely respond to the COVID-19 crisis."

The grant will help fund the Montana Health Research and Education Foundation and is administered through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's Hospital Preparedness Program, which works to make sure hospitals and health care coalitions are better prepared to respond to emergencies.

Tester has been working tirelessly to ensure that Montana hospitals are prepared to combat the COVID-19 crisis. This week, he secured $111.5 million for Montana's hospitals and $9.1 million for Montana Community Health Centers to respond to the pandemic, and secured an additional $3 million for the Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council Public Health Workforce Expansion in Indian Country. He recently demanded that the Trump Administration not leave rural hospitals behind in their coronavirus response, and he voted to deliver critical, urgent relief to Montana hospitals, workers, families, small businesses, and others hardest hit by the outbreak, which included $1.25 billion for the state of Montana.
