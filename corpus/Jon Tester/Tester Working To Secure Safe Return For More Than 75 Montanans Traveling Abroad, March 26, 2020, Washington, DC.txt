Tester Working To Secure Safe Return For More Than 75 Montanans Traveling Abroad


After helping 16 Montanans return home from the Norwegian Jewel cruise ship earlier this week, U.S. Senator Jon Tester continues his work to ensure that Montanans traveling or living abroad can return safely home to the United States.

"My office is available to help Montanans who have been traveling internationally return to the United States," said Tester. "We are in continuous contact with dozens of Montanans across the globe, and we are working closely with the State Department, cruise operators, airlines, and other agencies to make sure that folks can return home quickly and safely. I will continue holding the State Department accountable to provide timely, up-to-date travel guidance and working with the Trump Administration to safely return our citizens home."

Tester and his staff have been working closely with approximately 75 Montanans living or traveling abroad, or traveling on cruise ships. The vast majority of those Montanans are requesting help from across South and Central America, although Tester's office has been in touch with smaller numbers of Montanans in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Tester's staff is communicating directly with travelers and their families to get them accurate, up to date information about how to safely return home to Montana. Late last week, the State Department finally began asking all travelers to register through its Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to track travelers who need to be evacuated.

Senator Tester continues to push the State Department to hold daily briefings with congressional offices to provide immediate updates to travel information for Montanans abroad.

Senator Tester is urging all Montanans traveling internationally to contact his office and register their travels through the State Department. More information can be found on Tester's website, HERE.
