Tester announces $3.3 million in housing relief during pandemic


U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced $3,325,357 in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to support public health, coronavirus response, housing, and economic disruption needs.

"During this pandemic, every Montanan should have a roof over their head, plain and simple," said Tester. "I'm proud to have secured these funds that will help keep Montanans healthy and safe by addressing urgent needs in communities across our state."

The CARES Act provided $5 billion in supplemental Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus. This second allotment of funds from that supplemental appropriation will be allocated to state and local governments.

Tester has played a key role in expanding access to affordable housing in Montana. In February, he held an Affordable Housing Summit to gather ideas and suggestions from stakeholders and constituents on how to address the growing housing crisis, and has fought for substantial investments into affordable housing initiatives including the HOME and Community Development Block Grant programs. Over the last year he helped secure more than $4 million for Public Housing Authorities across Montana and more than $26 million for affordable housing in Indian Country.

Tester has been working tirelessly to ensure that Montana is prepared to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. After 72 hours negotiating substantial, bipartisan improvements to COVID-19 stimulus legislation, Tester voted to deliver critical, urgent relief to Montana workers, families, small businesses, hospitals and others hardest hit by the outbreak. This funding includes $1.25 billion for the state of Montana.
