New veterans clinic headed to Bozeman following Tester efforts


Bozeman will receive a new veterans Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) after sustained efforts from U.S. Senator Jon Tester. As Ranking Member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and member of the Appropriations Committee, Tester fought to secure this new facility to better serve Montana's veterans and the dedicated staff who provide their care.

The Bozeman clinic will be more than 12,000 square feet--twice the size of the existing clinic--and will offer Primary Care, Behavioral Health, Laboratory, and Telehealth services to veterans.

"This is exciting news for Bozeman-area veterans who can look forward to a new clinic that will improve care right here in the community," said Tester. "I fought hard to secure funding for this facility because Montana veterans have sacrificed a great deal on behalf of this nation--and deserve to return home to quality care that's convenient. I'll continue to work as hard as I know how to ensure this project stays on track."

The project is currently set to be completed by summer 2021. Additional details on the clinic location will be announced at a later date.

Tester has been working relentlessly in Congress to improve and expand veterans' access to VA health care. He introduced the bipartisan Build, Utilize, Invest, Lease, and Deliver (BUILD) for Veterans Act to expedite Congress' approval process of VA medical leases and provide the Department with the tools to facilitate construction, leasing and refurbishing of facilities across the country. He also led the call in urging Secretary Robert Wilkie to streamline VA's process of awarding construction projects and leases.
