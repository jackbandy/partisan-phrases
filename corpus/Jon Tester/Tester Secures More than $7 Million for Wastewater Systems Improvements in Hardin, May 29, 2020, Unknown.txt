Tester Secures More than $7 Million for Wastewater Systems Improvements in Hardin


U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced that the City of Hardin will receive $7,322,000 to make critical improvements and additions to their wastewater systems.

"Whether it's for our schools, our main street businesses, or our families, clean water is critical to Montana's communities, especially during these unprecedented times," said Tester. "This investment will help Hardin improve conditions for small business owners, farmers, and families, protecting clean water and their pocket books."

The City of Hardin will receive $2.121 million in loans and $5.201 million in grants as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Water and Waste Disposal Loan & Grant program to upgrade the Hardin wastewater treatment plant. Improvements planned for the system include installation of a new sewer main and manholes, as well as upgrading and replacing the headworks structure in the mechanical plant. Other upgrades will include a new plant water well, a septage receiving station, installation of a backup power generator, a new disinfection system, and an administration building.

Tester has worked diligently to supply Montana's water and wastewater systems with the funding needed to stay up-to-date. Earlier this month, he secured $335,000 for Wolf Point and $533,000 for Scobey to update outdated water mains. He secured nearly $3 million for Whitehall, Sweet Grass County, Whitefish, Cascade County, Seeley Lake, Sanders County, and Toole County. Additionally, he secured an additional $2 million to make upgrades to Geraldine's water system.
