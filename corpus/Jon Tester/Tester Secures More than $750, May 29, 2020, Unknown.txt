Tester Secures More than $750,000 for Wastewater Systems Improvements in Flathead County


U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced that Flathead County Water District #101 will receive $757,000 to make critical improvements and additions to their wastewater systems.

"Whether it's for our schools, our main street businesses, or our families, clean water is critical to Montana's communities, especially during these unprecedented times," said Tester. "This investment will help Flathead County improve conditions for small business owners, farmers, and families, protecting clean water and their pocket books."

Flathead County Water District #101, which serves the Columbia Falls area, will receive $587,000 in loans and $170,000 in grants as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Water and Waste Disposal Loan & Grant program to replace and upgrade the water distribution system within a small water district. This project will replace critical infrastructure for existing residents and business enterprises in an area experiencing growth and development while also providing ways to support future growth.

Tester has worked diligently to supply Montana's water and wastewater systems with the funding needed to stay up-to-date. Earlier this month, he secured $335,000 for Wolf Point and $533,000 for Scobey to update outdated water mains. He secured nearly $3 million for Whitehall, Sweet Grass County, Whitefish, Cascade County, Seeley Lake, Sanders County, and Toole County. Additionally, he secured an additional $2 million to make upgrades to Geraldine's water system.
