Tester Announces REAL ID Deadline Postponed In Response To COVID-19


U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced the deadline to obtain a REAL ID to fly on commercial domestic flights has been pushed back in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

"Montanans should be worried about keeping their families healthy, not standing in line at the DMV to fill out government paperwork," Tester said. "This measure will help slow the spread of the coronavirus and ensure Montanans remain compliant with the law while keeping Montana families safe."

Tester has led the charge in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. He successfully pushed to delay the tax filing deadline until July 15, introduced legislation-now law-to guarantee testing for the virus will be at zero cost, and he passed bipartisan legislation through the Senate to ensure veterans GI benefits are protected during the outbreak. He has also doubled down on his efforts to press the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Indian Health Service to provide veterans, VA healthcare staff, and Tribes with access to proper resources and information.
