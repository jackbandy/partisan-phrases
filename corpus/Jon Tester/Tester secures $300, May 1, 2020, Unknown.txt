Tester secures $300,000 for Montana seniors in pandemic relief funding


U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced $300,000 in pandemic relief funding for the Montana Department of Health and Human Services for Aging and Disability Resource Centers that help older Montanans navigate and support long-term care service systems.

"Older Montanans are among those at highest risk from the coronavirus pandemic, and we need to make sure they have access to the services they need to stay healthy," said Tester. "I'm proud to have secured this funding, which will help the Montana Department of Health and Human Services, through local partnerships, provide seniors with the resources to make informed decisions about what programs and services are available to them during this difficult time."

The Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) were developed through a partnership between the federal Administration on Aging and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The overall goal of the ADRC Program is to empower individuals to effectively navigate their long-term services and supports options to make informed choices. Montana's Office on Aging contracts with 10 ARDCs serving 56 Montana counties.

Tester has led the charge to ensure that Montana's seniors have the resources they need to stay healthy during the pandemic. This week he successfully pressured CMS to update a rule that will level the playing field for seniors and other Montanans without reliable broadband who need access to health care. He also recently announced $5.5 million to provide grants for home-delivered meals, caregiver support, Centers for Independent Living, and other supportive services for seniors and Montanans with disabilities via the Older Americans Act (OAA). This funding is part of the overall $1 billion Tester helped secure for seniors across the country in the CARES Act, which was not included in Senator Mitch McConnell's original legislation.
