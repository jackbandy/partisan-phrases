Following Calls from Chairman Moran & Ranking Member Tester, Eligible Veterans to Automatically Receive Stimulus Checks


Senate Veterans' Affairs Chairman Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Ranking Member Jon Tester (D-Mont.) today released the following statement after the Treasury Department and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) clarified that eligible veterans who do not file income taxes will receive their stimulus checks:

"We're glad that the Treasury Department answered our call to provide veterans and survivors--who aren't normally required to file annual tax returns--with the same access to swift financial relief as everyone else during this crisis," said Senators Moran and Tester. "This is a critical step in removing an unnecessary burden from our nation's heroes, and will help our vulnerable population of veterans and survivors get through this unprecedented time. Moving forward, we must ensure that Washington provides veterans with their promised payments quickly, and without any additional bureaucratic hurdles."

Senators Moran and Tester have led the effort in Congress to ensure veterans were provided their Economic Impact Payments in a timely manner without having to file additional burdensome paperwork. Earlier this month, the Senators urged VA Under Secretary for Benefits, Dr. Paul Lawrence, to develop a plan between VA and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to provide veterans and VA beneficiaries their stimulus checks under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
