Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I was in the Virginia State Senate when  Virginia finally expanded Medicaid.  Today, as a result, over 600,000 Virginians now have health insurance  who didn't before.

By giving them insurance, we were able to keep our rural hospitals  open. We were able to keep costs from going up too much for everybody  else because even the uninsured get sick. They don't seek care until  they have to go to the emergency room.

Hundreds of thousands of Virginians now stand to lose their  healthcare if this big, bad bill cuts Medicaid as it does now. Some  Members of the Republican caucus want to go even further.

Gloria has struggled for a long time with her health. She was born  with a heart murmur, blood pressure issues, and constant bronchitis.  She was recently diagnosed with glaucoma and cataracts that are getting  worse.

For years, Gloria had to rely on emergency care at the hospital  because she was uninsured. Because she has Medicaid, she can have the  surgery she needs and see again. Don't take Gloria's healthcare away.
