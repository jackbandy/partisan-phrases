Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. In  just 15 days, health insurance premiums will skyrocket for more than 20  million Americans.

At a time when people are already struggling with higher costs for  groceries, rent, childcare, and utilities, this bill does nothing to  stop the immediate harm heading their way on January 1.

Here is what that looks like for Virginians in Virginia: A 60-year- old couple earning $85,600 a year will see their premiums rise by  $15,446, and a family of four earning $66,000 a year will see their  premiums jump $2,651.

Mr. Speaker, these are not abstract numbers. They are small business  owners, employees, farmers, gig workers, self-employed, and more who  will be forced to make impossible choices.

We still have time. We can pass a bill now to extend the tax credits.  We should do so.
