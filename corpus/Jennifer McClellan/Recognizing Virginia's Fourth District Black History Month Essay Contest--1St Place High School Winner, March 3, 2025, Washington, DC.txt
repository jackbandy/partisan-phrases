Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  essay from Virginia's Fourth District Black History Month Essay  Contest--1st Place High School contest winner, Tanvi Palavalas.

When Lt. Gen. Arthur J. Gregg first wore his Army uniform       during World War II, he stepped into a military that saw his       skin color before his capabilities. Today, as a woman of       color preparing to serve, I see in his journey not just       history, but a torch lighting my own path forward. From an       enlisted soldier in a segregated Army to becoming the first       Black officer to earn the rank of lieutenant general, Gregg       didn't just climb the ranks, he fundamentally redefined what       was possible.

In the unforgiving landscape of 1940's America, Gregg's       early military career could have been defined by the       limitations others sought to impose. During the Vietnam War,       his innovative supply chain systems didn't just move       materials--they saved lives. His mastery of military       logistics proved that excellence and leadership flow from       capability, not ancestry. For those of us who still face       skepticism about our place in military leadership, his       technical brilliance offers a powerful reminder that       competence speaks louder than prejudice.

The Army's unprecedented decision to name Fort Gregg-Adams       after him in April 2023, making him the first living Black       leader to receive such an honor, carries special resonance       for those of us following in his wake. In replacing the name       of a Confederate general with that of Black excellence       embodied, the Army didn't just change a sign; it declared       that the future belongs to those who can lead, regardless of       their background. Until his passing in August 2024, Gregg's       living presence at ceremonies and military events reminded us       that such transformation isn't ancient history but an ongoing       journey we continue today.

But Gregg's most powerful legacy lies not in the barriers       he broke, but in the doors he kept open behind him. As a       mentor and leader, he understood that his success meant       little if it didn't create opportunities for others. His       leadership style, combining uncompromising standards with       deep empathy, showed that bringing one's whole self to       military service strengthens rather than weakens the force.       For women of color like me, preparing to enter a military       still grappling with inclusion, his example offers both       inspiration and instruction: excellence is our armor,       competence our sword.

The systems Gregg built for military logistics mirror the       pathways he forged for future leaders, both designed to       ensure essential resources reach those who need them when       they need them most. Today, as I prepare to don my own       uniform, I understand that I'm not just pursuing a career but       that I'm continuing a mission he began. His success proved       that the military is strengthened, not compromised, by       diverse leadership. The respect he commanded showed that       authority flows from character and capability, not color or       gender.

The transformation of military culture is far from       perfection, but Gregg showed us how to advance it--through       impeccable service, unwavering determination, and a       commitment to bringing others forward. As I prepare to begin       my own military journey, I carry with me not just my dreams,       but the torch Lt. Gen. Gregg lit decades ago. In his honor,       and for those who will follow, I intend to carry it forward,       lighting the way for others as he did for me.
