Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National  Rural Health Day and National Rural Health Month.

Due to a lack of infrastructure and support, rural communities suffer  from the worst health outcomes nationwide. Pharmacy deserts, maternal  health deserts, mental health deserts, worker shortages, and more limit  people's access to care, sometimes forcing residents to travel 1 hour  or longer for primary and emergency care.

These communities that already need help accessing affordable,  quality care now face a growing crisis due to draconian cuts to  Medicaid and the big, ugly law signed in July, which will make it  harder for rural communities to access the care that they need.

Mr. Speaker, 338 rural hospitals from across the country have been  identified as at risk, 6 in Virginia, 1 in my district.

I traveled around rural areas during our recesses talking to these  providers about their concerns. I was accused by my Republican  colleagues of fear-mongering. Yet, I was amplifying the fears that they  had. Lo and behold, weeks after visiting some of these providers, three  rural providers closed their doors citing the big, ugly law's Medicaid  cuts.

A Farmville hospital announced the closure of its labor and delivery  unit, citing a reduction in Federal care. We need to do more for our  rural communities in providing care, not less.

Mr. Speaker, it's not too late to address this health care crisis of  Republicans' making. We can start by permanently extending the enhanced  premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act to prevent millions  more from seeing their premiums skyrocket.

This Rural Health Day, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle to recognize this issue for what it is, and to act now.
