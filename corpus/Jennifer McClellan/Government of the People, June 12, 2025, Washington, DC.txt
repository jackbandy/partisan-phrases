Government of the People, Not of the King

Mrs. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, on January 6, 2021, a crowd of people  stormed the Capitol seeking for the second time in American history to  take by force what they could not win at the ballot box.

Capitol Police were beaten as they tried to protect Members of this  body and the Vice President of the United States from harm.  Congressional leaders begged President Trump to send in the National  Guard. He refused. However, Virginia, the birthplace of American  democracy, did.

Four years later, President Trump pardoned the individuals who sought  to harm Members of Congress and who did hurt Capitol Police who swear  to keep us safe.

Now, as people exercise their constitutional right to protest,  President Trump has deployed the National Guard and the Marines, and  now an administration that ignores the Constitution it swore to  preserve, protect, and defend seeks to intimidate, assault, and arrest  Members of Congress exercising their oversight duties outlined in that  same constitution, like Representative LaMonica McIver and Senator Alex  Padilla.

Next year we have the opportunity to celebrate 250 years of a  remarkable idea of power derived from the people, not from a king, but  only if we take action now.
