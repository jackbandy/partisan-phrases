Medical Bills Are Too High


Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, today is December 1. At midnight and 30  days, at least 5 million Americans could lose access to their health  insurance, and 22 million Americans who benefit from enhanced premium  tax credits under the Affordable Care Act--as they began open  enrollment 1 month ago--started to see their health insurance premiums  spike.

Last week, in honor of Prematurity Awareness Month, I stood on this  floor  to talk about how the Affordable Care Act expanded insurance to  millions of Americans, how Medicaid expansion expanded insurance to  millions of Americans, and how critically important that health  insurance coverage is to a full-term birth with a nonfatal outcome for  mother and child.

In the middle of the week, with several other mothers of preemies, I  talked about my birth story.

Ten years ago, when I woke up one morning and my placenta ruptured  and after almost bleeding to death, my daughter, Samantha, was born by  emergency C-section. It was the scariest moment of my life. The hardest  moment was the fact that I could not hold her, see her, or touch her  for 24 hours, as she was in the NICU, and then the moment when I walked  out of the hospital and had to leave her in the NICU for 6 more weeks.

I don't remember how much that NICU bill was because I was one of the  lucky ones who had health insurance to cover that stay. On average, a  NICU stay is $70,000 a day. That is more than a single person who  qualifies for the enhanced premium tax credits under the Affordable  Care Act at the maximum rate of 400 percent of the Federal poverty line  makes in a year. That person makes $62,600. The average NICU stay is  $70,000.

I was lucky not only because I was able to take my daughter home 6  weeks later, but that entire 6 weeks I didn't have to worry about how I  was going to pay that bill. All I had to worry about was her and my  recovery. There are a lot of people that aren't that lucky.

There are a lot of people trying to decide right now whether to start  a family. There are people right now who are in the process of starting  a family who wonder if they will be able to afford their health  insurance come January 1. They are having to make really tough  decisions now, as they are in the middle of open enrollment, as to  whether or not they can continue to afford health insurance.

Tonight, members of the Congressional Black Caucus will bring you  stories from our constituents, from the States that we represent, of  people who will be priced out of the insurance market, who will be one  illness or accident away from economic devastation if Congress does not  act to extend the enhanced premium tax credits beyond December 31.

Clarke),  our chairwoman and the Representative from New York's Ninth District,  to tell some stories.

Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Virginia for her steadfast leadership and for hosting our Special Order  hour this evening.

Mr. Speaker, good evening. I am Representative Yvette D. Clarke,  chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, proudly representing New  York's Ninth Congressional District, located in Brooklyn, New York.

I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan, for anchoring  this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour.

I rise tonight with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus  to bring awareness to the fast-approaching ACA tax credit funding  deadline, 30 days to go, and to give voice to everyday Americans who  will be harmed by the Republican-led healthcare crisis.

The enhanced ACA tax credits are set to expire on December 31 unless  congressional Republicans join Democrats to extend them.

Without an extension of the ACA tax credits, tens of millions of  individuals and families can expect to pay significantly higher health  insurance premiums for marketplace plans.

Without these tax credits, Americans will see their healthcare costs  skyrocket, increase by hundreds if not thousands of dollars per month,  which will force families who are already struggling with the cost of  living to face unaffordable premium spikes or lose coverage altogether.

The ACA tax credits have ensured that families, seniors, young  adults, and workers in every CBC district could afford quality  healthcare.

In our districts, we have heard from countless constituents who  receive their healthcare on the ACA marketplace who are now worried  about the cost of their healthcare going up.

One of my constituents, Lilah Wilson, a small business owner who  depends on the ACA marketplace said: ``My heart dropped when I got an  email earlier this month stating that I might lose my insurance  benefits. I already struggle to afford the city that I have grown up in  and contributed to as a small business owner.''

She continued: ``Shopping for health insurance through the  marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act was the first time that  I had assurance of affordable, good insurance. We must protect this  program. It is a matter of survival.''

At every turn, Republicans have turned their backs on the American  people. President Trump and congressional Republicans promised the  American people that they would take swift action on day one to address  our Nation's affordability crisis by lowering the high cost of living.

Well, instead, they unleashed the most aggressive assault on our  Nation's healthcare in history, and the damage has been devastating.

Across the country, we are already seeing hospitals, nursing homes,  and clinics that serve our communities closing their doors, and now  Republicans' refusal to extend ACA premium tax credits is driving up  costs and pushing coverage out of reach for many in our communities.

The CBC and House Democrats stood united for more than 40 days to  prevent exactly this outcome while Republicans refused to negotiate and  left working families to bear the consequences.

We are calling on our Republican colleagues to join us in putting the  well-being of the American people above partisanship, to put people  over politics.

This is not an abstract policy debate. It is about real lives. It is  about parents deciding whether to fill a prescription or pay the rent.  It is about seniors choosing between a doctor's visit and groceries. It  is about young adults, gig workers, caregivers, and small business  owners who depend on the ACA marketplace for the coverage that keeps  them healthy and financially secure.

Let me be clear: Allowing these tax credits to expire is a choice. It  is a choice of greed. It is a choice of cruelty. It is the wrong  choice.

Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our chair for those remarks.

Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his words.

To hear more stories from Georgia, I now yield to the Representative  from Georgia's Seventh District, Congresswoman Lucy McBath.

Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.

Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I will take a personal privilege to close  this Special Order hour with some stories from Virginia, which I know  you, Mr. Speaker, care a lot about. You and I served together in the  State legislature there where we were able to find common ground across  the aisle a little more easily than we are able to do in Congress.

In Virginia, about 350,000 people benefit from the Affordable Care  Act premium tax credits, enhanced premium tax credits, 30,000 in my  district, the Fourth Congressional District.

For a family of four that earns $129,800 a year, they are looking at  premiums that will increase by $4,675. A family of four earning $64,000  a year will see their annual premiums increase $2,571. A 60-year-old  couple earning $82,800 a year will see their annual premiums increase  $11,968. That is a 174-percent increase. That is what Virginians are  facing if we can't find common ground to solve this problem, even  temporarily.

Our former colleagues in the General Assembly have predicted that at  least 60,000 Virginians would end up canceling their insurance coverage  due to affordability if they lose access to the enhanced premium tax  credits.

Mr. Speaker, last week, Cardinal News--which covers the Southwest and  Southside, Virginia, both of us represent portions of that part of the  Commonwealth--told several stories.

There was one from Reagan Fisher Wyssbrod from Salem. Reagan and her  husband, who is self-employed, have two children.

Wyssbrod works three part-time jobs to help support the family while  keeping the flexibility needed for her children. She spends some days  as a substitute teacher and as a business manager for a library  association. She does some bookkeeping on the side. None of these jobs  offer benefits.

She has a bachelor's degree in psychology, roughly two decades of  experience in health insurance and accounting, and she is willing to  take almost any job that will offer benefits, she said, even if that  means working at McDonald's because she doesn't want to let her  children go without healthcare.

Her projected monthly premium increase is $400, which would raise her  monthly out-of-pocket costs to $1900. On top of that, her longtime  doctor has moved out of network. It is astonishing, she said.

She spent 3 weeks combing through plans and eventually found one that  would save the family about $100 a month, bringing their premium down  to $1,800, allowing her to keep her doctor, but it has a higher  deductible. She said the worst case scenario is her out-of-pocket costs  would be $20,000 on top of the monthly premium.

Ultimately, it came down to: I don't go to the doctor that often, my  kids don't go to the doctor that often, so we will just roll the dice.

She said: We will wrap some bubble wrap around us, I guess.

I don't think bubble wrap is going to help if they get in a car  accident.

Victoria Cassels, an accountant in Roanoke, worries about her adult  daughter who lives in Richmond, who is a self-employed graphic designer  with an autoimmune disease. Her condition limits how much work she can  take on, and she depends on marketplace coverage. Her monthly premium  rose by $400, about three times higher than it was last year.

Cassels is going to do what she can to help her daughter cover the  costs if she can't take on enough work to meet this new expense.  Cassels prepares taxes for individuals and small businesses and says  more of her younger clients are  talking about dropping health insurance all together because they just  can't afford it.

In the last few years, she has had a slew of clients in their  twenties and thirties who have started their own businesses. Just  getting started in life, they don't have the savings to afford the  increasing cost of health insurance. Without health insurance, it is  going to be very difficult for them to start a family.

Ben Pearman, financial adviser from Bent Mountain in Roanoke, runs  his own business which is well established, and he has a steady income,  but higher monthly costs have led him to reconsider his options.

As a single man in his fifties, he pays for his own health plan. Next  year, his monthly premium will jump from $724 to $935. He can absorb  the higher cost but is considering switching to concierge care, a model  in which the patients pay a flat monthly fee, but that would leave him  without insurance if an accident happens.

Linda Bartlett, 64, entered semi-retirement last year, and now works  part time at Roanoke's Mast General Store. She turned to the  marketplace until she qualifies for Medicare. Her premium is about to  double, bringing her monthly payment to $1,200, which is nearly all of  her Social Security check.

Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to put this debate in a larger  context. I was in the State legislature where the Affordable Care Act  passed. It wasn't perfect. Our healthcare system has never been  perfect, but what it did, between the marketplace and expanding  Medicaid, is it got the number of uninsured to record lows, at least in  Virginia. I can't speak to nationwide, but in Virginia, we saw our  uninsured rate go to record lows.

We were able to expand Medicaid on a bipartisan basis because it  didn't just benefit urban cores, but suburban centers and rural  communities, rural communities that had high numbers of uninsured, that  were worried about how their healthcare centers, their hospitals were  going to have the volumes to stay open.

We expanded Medicaid. During the--I call it the big, ugly bill, we  put millions of Americans at risk of losing their health insurance  through cuts to Medicaid. We saw a list of over 300 hospitals in rural  areas identified as being at risk of closing.

During the August recess, I traveled all over Virginia not just to  talk to my constituents, but as one of only two members of the Energy  and Commerce Committee to talk to a wide cross-section of Virginians. I  visited a dental clinic in Abingdon. Eighty percent of their patients  are covered by Medicaid, 80 percent. The other 20 percent are  uninsured.

Before that clinic opened, that community got dental services once a  year when a mobile dental clinic showed up, and the line was incredibly  long to get one day of dental service a year.

When I visited this clinic, I didn't come in with any talking points.  I just came to tour. I asked: What keeps you up at night? The director  said: I don't know how we are going to keep our doors open with these  Medicaid cuts.

Two TV stations were there who were there when the clinic opened  because they understood what a big deal this clinic was, not just for  Abingdon, but the entire southwest corner of the Commonwealth. My  colleague who represents that area in response to that visit said:  Democrats are just fear-mongering.

Well, lo and behold, less than a month later, three rural clinics  closed, citing Medicaid cuts in H.R. 1. A hospital in Farmville closed  its labor and delivery unit.

I ran for office because I grew up listening to my parents tell  stories when they grew up in the segregated South during the  Depression. They saw the best of government and they saw the worst of  government.

Mr. Speaker, the best of government was when people came together to  solve problems and to help people who were hurting through no fault of  their own. These were people who were working day in and day out and  couldn't afford to put food on the table. They couldn't afford  healthcare when they got sick. They couldn't afford a roof over their  heads.

The worst of government is when we sit here and focus more on: How  can I score political points? How can I benefit the wealthiest 1  percent on the backs of every other working American?

As I traveled around Virginia in August and October, and in the 54  days that we weren't doing our job here in Washington--not having  committee hearings and not voting on the House floor--what I heard was  people losing faith that our government knows how to be at its best. We  have to get back to that.

Our system is not perfect. That is why in the Constitution it says  that our government was formed in order to form a more perfect Union.  It is not a perfect union but a more perfect Union.

The beauty of our form of government is when we listen to the people  and see that they are hurting, we have an opportunity to do something  to stop that hurting, an opportunity to feed the hungry, house the  homeless, care for the sick, welcome the stranger, and visit the  incarcerated. When we do for the least of these, we are at our best.

We have gotten away from that, Mr. Speaker. We better get back to it  because the American people are losing faith that this body, Congress,  will do its job. We better do it. They are depending on us to. They  have told us they are worried. We heard the stories tonight. This is  just one thing people are worried about.

We need to get back to our better nature. We need to come together,  find common ground, and help people who are wondering: Come January 1,  how am I going to afford this health insurance? What am I going to do  when my kid burns his hand and ends up in the burn unit with a bill of  $15,000 that I can't afford to pay? What am I going to do if my baby is  born prematurely and has to stay in the NICU at an average price of  $70,000 a day?

People are wondering: Do we hear them, and are we going to act?
