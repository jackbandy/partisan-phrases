Raising Awareness of Preterm Birth Rates

Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, the United States has one of the highest  preterm birth rates in the world, which is a leading cause of infant  mortality.

Today, the March of Dimes released its 2025 report card on the state  of maternal and infant health. The United States received a D-plus for  preterm birthrate for the fourth consecutive year in a row.

In 2024, 380,000 babies were born prematurely. That is 10.4 percent  of all babies born. The worst rates are in the southern region of the  United States.

These statistics are personal for me. My daughter was born 9 weeks  early when my placenta ruptured. We both nearly died. She spent the  next 6 weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit. We were among the  lucky ones. Far too many mothers and babies don't have that same  outcome.

Mr. Speaker, today I join Representatives Jennifer Kiggans and Robin  Kelly to introduce a bipartisan resolution to designate November 2025  as Prematurity Awareness Month, and I join my colleagues to do more to  prevent preterm births.
