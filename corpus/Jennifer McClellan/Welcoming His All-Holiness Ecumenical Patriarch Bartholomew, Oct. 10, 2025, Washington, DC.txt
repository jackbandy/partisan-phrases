Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend a warm welcome to  His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the Spiritual Head  of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the second largest Christian Church in  the world. It is a distinct honor for our Nation's Capital to host such  a revered global religious leader whose life's work has been defined by  faith, peace, and reconciliation.

His All-Holiness has long been a tireless advocate for interfaith  dialogue, human rights, religious freedom, and environmental  stewardship. For decades, he has traveled the world promoting  understanding and respect among faith traditions and urging us to  safeguard our common home for future generations. His spiritual  leadership has touched the lives of millions of Orthodox Christians and  countless others across the globe.

I am especially proud to represent the Saints Constantine and Helen  Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Richmond, Virginia, a vibrant and  faithful community that stands as a testament to the Orthodox  tradition's rich history and enduring presence in America. Their  commitment to faith, service, and fellowship reflects the very values  His All-Holiness has championed throughout his ministry.

On behalf of the 4th Congressional District of Virginia, I welcome  His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington and  extend deep gratitude for his lifelong dedication to promoting peace,  unity, and justice in our world.
