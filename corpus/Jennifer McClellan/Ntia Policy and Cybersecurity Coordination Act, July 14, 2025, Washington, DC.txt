Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  1766, the NTIA Policy and Cybersecurity Coordination Act, which I was  pleased to introduce with the gentleman from California (Mr.  Obernolte).

Mr. Speaker, this important bipartisan legislation would cement the  responsibilities of the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration, or NTIA, by codifying, renaming, and enhancing the work  of its Office of Policy Analysis and Development, which plays a  critical role in shaping our Nation's telecommunications and  information objectives.

NTIA is already central to advancing market-driven strategies that  foster innovation, expand broadband deployment, and promote a  competitive digital economy. However, this legislation ensures that  NTIA is equally empowered to help safeguard that digital future,  particularly as the cybersecurity threats we face grow more complex and  more dangerous by the day.

Last year's Salt Typhoon cyberattack was one of the most  sophisticated and malicious efforts to infiltrate our  telecommunications networks. It was a sobering reminder of how  vulnerable our communications infrastructure remains and how deeply  those vulnerabilities can impact multiple sectors from healthcare to  national security.

In today's interconnected world, a breach in one wireless network can  compromise critical services in transportation, healthcare, finance,  and public safety. As our reliance on digital technologies increases,  so too does the scale and sophistication of these threats, especially  with the rise of artificial intelligence.

While AI holds tremendous potential to improve efficiency, optimize  networks, and revolutionize industries, it also introduces new  cybersecurity risks.

Foreign adversaries and malicious actors are already leveraging AI to  enhance phishing campaigns, automate malware, and exploit zero-day  vulnerabilities faster than ever before. These tools can evade  traditional defenses, manipulate systems, and do so at a scale and  speed that we have never encountered or imagined before.

That is why this legislation is so timely and so necessary. By  reinforcing the NTIA's authority and resources in cybersecurity policy,  we position the agency to not only be a leader in innovation and  broadband expansion but a central player in securing the Nation's  digital infrastructure against these emerging threats.

As the principal adviser to the President on telecommunications and  information policy, NTIA must be equipped to identify risks early,  coordinate effectively across agencies, and shape forward-looking  policies that protect American consumers, businesses, and critical  services.

Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleague for introducing this bill, and I  urge my fellow Members to join me in supporting it. Strengthening  NTIA's cybersecurity capabilities is not just a matter of good  governance but a national security imperative.
