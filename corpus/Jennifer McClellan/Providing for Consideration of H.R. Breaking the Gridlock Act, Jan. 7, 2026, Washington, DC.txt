Providing for Consideration of H.R. Breaking the Gridlock Act


Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of a 3-year  extension of the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits.

Millions of Americans who benefited from these credits are now facing  the real prospect of losing their health insurance because they can no  longer afford their premiums. We have told their stories for months.  These are small business owners, their employees, the self-employed,  farmers, restaurateurs, beauticians, landscapers, mediators,  chiropractors, on and on.

They are people like Bobby Connor from Brunswick County, Virginia,  who is 3 years away from Medicare. Last year, with the tax credit, he  paid $34 per month for his insurance. This year, he was set to pay $92  with the tax credit. Now, without it, he is looking at $1,700 a month.

Lester and Yolanda Johnson of Richmond, Virginia, co-owners of Mama  J's Restaurant, and their 8-year-old daughter are going from paying  about $700 a month with the tax credit last year to over $1,400 this  year without it.

We have a chance to give Bobby, Lester, Yolanda, and millions like  them the peace of mind that if they get sick or injured, they can get  the care they need without losing everything.
