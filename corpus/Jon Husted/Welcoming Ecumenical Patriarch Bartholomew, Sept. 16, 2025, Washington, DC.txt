Mr. HUSTED. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize His All- Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew's visit to Washington, DC.  His All-Holiness is visiting our Nation's Capital in conjunction with  his acceptance of the prestigious Templeton Prize, an award which has  been received by faith leaders including Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama,  and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The Greek Orthodox community in Ohio and  across the country take great pride in this recognition of their faith  leader's global influence.
