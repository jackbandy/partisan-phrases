Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and  congratulate the city of Provo, Utah, for earning the top rank as  America's number one best-run city.

In WalletHub's 2025 study, Provo outperformed 148 other large U.S.  cities, excelling at financial stability, public services, safety,  infrastructure, and education.

Mayor Michelle Kaufusi aptly noted that getting the fundamentals  right is the most important part of governance, like delivering quality  education, maintaining safe neighborhoods, ensuring well-maintained  infrastructure, and practicing responsible fiscal stewardship.

This approach is validated by this national ranking, showing that  going back to the basics leads to residents prospering, businesses  flourishing, and a community thriving.

Provo's success also reflects the vital presence of my alma mater,  Brigham Young University, at the heart of the community. Home to over  35,000 students and a world-class private university, BYU provides a  steady flow of educated graduates, drives economic activity, and  fosters a culture of excellence that enriches every neighborhood.

I am also proud to note that our district office calls Provo home,  and I am grateful for the support from the local community there.

I am proud to represent the residents of Provo and to champion the  excellent qualities that they have on the floor of this House.
