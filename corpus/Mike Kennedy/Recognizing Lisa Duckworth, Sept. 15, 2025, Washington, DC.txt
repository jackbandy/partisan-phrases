Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, today I rise and recognize a proud  U.S. Army veteran, Lisa Duckworth, who was recently named Military  Friendly's 2025 Veteran of the Year for the State of Utah. From her  role as a chaplaincy resources manager in the Army for close to 6 years  to her current role as Utah's veteran employment representative, Lisa  has demonstrated her outstanding devotion to education and empowerment.

As Utah's veteran employment representative, Lisa advocates for the  veteran and military community by working with organizations that  provide them with employment, training, and development opportunities.

This award given to Lisa recognizes the tangible difference she makes  every day for those in Utah's military community.

Her unwavering dedication to those who have served our country  reminds us that all public service continues beyond uniform, whether it  be through advocacy or community. She reminds us that when we support  our veterans and military members, we strengthen our communities.

I am proud to have Lisa Duckworth representing our beautiful State  and thank her for her continued service. I thank Lisa for all she does  to ensure a supportive environment for our veterans in Utah.
