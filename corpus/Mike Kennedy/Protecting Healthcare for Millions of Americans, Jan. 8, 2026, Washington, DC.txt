Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of symbolism that is happening at this  point. I appreciate the bipartisanship. I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding time. It is a reflection of what really should happen around  this place. We should love and help each other and try to find common  ground. It is a great representation of how Doug LaMalfa served.

He was a man of the people. He served his people well. He was a man  of the land. He loved his land. He loved his rice. He would talk about  it with me and everybody else here regularly. He also loved people  sufficiently to give them nicknames.

My nickname had something to do with the villain in ``Ocean's  Twelve.'' I was the ``Night Fox.'' I don't know if I agree with that  characterization. He was the guy that did a break dance across a laser  dance floor to steal things. Maybe some around here would think that is  the kind of person that I am. I knew it was all in good taste and good  fun. Doug game nicknames to everybody.

Mr. Speaker, I will point out the last thing about Doug is that he  loved his country. He knew that on the top the Capitol rotunda was a  statue called the Statue of Freedom. Doug served not only his people  but he served his God. He certainly loved both. In serving his country,  he understood he was serving freedom.

Mr. Speaker, I hope that I, as well as all of us, can live up to  Doug's standard of service, his love for people, and his love for God.
