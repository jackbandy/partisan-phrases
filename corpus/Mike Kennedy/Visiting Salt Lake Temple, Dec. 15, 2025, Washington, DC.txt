Visiting Salt Lake Temple


Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, in 2027, beginning in April and  ending in October, the Salt Lake Temple, which is to my left, will be  open for public tours.

All are welcome, with 3 million to 5 million visitors expected during  this historic event that will be important to Utahns and especially to  those who will again worship and serve there. I invite all of my  colleagues in the House and their friends to visit Salt Lake City and  tour the temple with me.

Though it was not the first, it has become the most recognizable  temple of  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Many visitors associate the temple with Utah's capital city. The  temple is built of native granite and took 40 years to complete, with  the goal to construct it so it would last throughout time.

Come experience the spirit of this event with me.
