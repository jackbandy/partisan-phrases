Breaking the Gridlock Act

Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Missouri for  this time.

As a family practice doctor for more than 25 years, I hear directly  from my patients about the skyrocketing cost of insurance and  prescription drugs. Americans were promised lower costs, more choices,  and better care. More than a decade later, too many families are asking  what happened.

Since its passage, the unaffordable care act has created a subsidy- fueled illusion with spiraling costs hidden by taxpayer dollars and  deficit spending.

Today, many Americans have insurance on paper but still cannot afford  to use it. Plans often come with deductibles of several thousand  dollars, meaning families pay out of pocket for most routine care.  Insurance that cannot be used when people are sick is not real  security. It is an illusion.

Let's look at the facts. Healthcare costs have skyrocketed since  ObamaCare went into effect. The ACA promised to lower healthcare  premiums by up to $2,500 per family per year, but since ObamaCare went  into effect, premiums have nearly tripled and deductibles have nearly  doubled. The cost of coverage for a family of 4 has increased by more  than $10,000.

The benchmark ACA silver plan cost $346 a month in 2014. In 2026, the  same exact plan costs $625 a month. The benchmark ACA silver plan  deductible was $2,425 in 2014. In 2026, the average deductible will be  $5,304, a 119 percent increase. That means that before your health  insurance even kicks in, you have to incur $5,304 in out-of-pocket  costs.

Such deductibles leave families effectively self-funding their care  despite being insured. A policy that you can't afford when you are sick  is not a real solution, only an illusion of coverage, leaving  individuals functionally uninsured.

Compounding these design failures are serious fraud and enforcement  breakdowns within the system itself. A 2024 GAO investigation found  that fake identities were approved for ObamaCare subsidies at a 100  percent rate. Often remaining enrolled despite missing or falsified  documentation, these ObamaCare subsidies continued for these fraudulent  applications. Taxpayers are left footing the bill as reused Social  Security numbers, subsidies paid on behalf of deceased individuals, and  billions in unreconciled payments expose a system unable to protect  public funds.

To be clear, expanding access to health insurance and protecting  people with preexisting conditions are worthy goals, but good  intentions do not excuse bad results.

Mr. Speaker, faced with these affordability problems, what have my  Democratic colleagues proposed? Their answer has been more taxpayer  subsidies to paper over ObamaCare's problems. Rather than address the  root causes of high premiums, they want to pour ever-larger subsidies  to insurance companies to mask the broken system.

Extending subsidies without reform is just paying more for a broken  system. I am not going to vote to promote a broken ObamaCare system. If  health insurance only looks affordable when Washington pumps in  billions of temporary subsidies, the law itself is not affordable. That  structure is the real problem that we need to fix. I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no.''
