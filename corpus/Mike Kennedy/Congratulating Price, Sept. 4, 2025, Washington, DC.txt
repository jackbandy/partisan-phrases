Congratulating Price, Utah, Battle Youth Baseball Team


Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, today I rise with great pride to  congratulate the Price, Utah, Battle 13u youth baseball team. This  talented group of 13-year-old baseball players from Carbon and Emery  Counties won the Pacific Southwest Regional, advancing to the Babe Ruth  World Series. They are only the third Utah team to do so in the 75-year  history of the tournament.

The Price Battle team won third place at the championship, making  history for our community while competing on the national stage. Price  Battle also took home the most awards for the tournament, including one  player with the best batting average for the World Series, two players  making the All-World Offensive Team, and three players making the All- World Defensive Team.

Not only did the team play well, but they also showed excellent  character and conduct, earning the prestigious Heart of the Babe Ruth  Sportsmanship Award. This combination of skill, hard work, and  character is something our entire State of Utah can cheer for.

Congratulations to the team and their coaches on an incredible season  and for making Price and Utah proud. We can't wait to see what they do  next.
