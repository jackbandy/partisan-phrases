Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  Representative Bice's Stop Illegal Entry Act of 2025, and I applaud my  colleague, Mr. Knott, for his role in this important piece of  legislation.

For too long, open-border policies have left American families at  risk. Under the Biden administration, the vast majority of those  charged with illegal reentry already had criminal records. In Utah, we  have seen the consequences firsthand.

This July in Salt Lake County, a 43-year-old Mexican national was  sentenced for drug trafficking and illegal reentry. He had been  deported three times before. When he was arrested, he carried an  illegal firearm and more than 9,000 fentanyl pills.

In May, ICE officers in Utah apprehended and removed an illegal  immigrant from Guatemala who was facing charges of aggravated sexual  assault of a child under the age of 14, after previously being caught  and removed twice before.

In January, a 24-year-old Mexican national was charged with the  murder of his girlfriend in Utah just one week after being deported for  the second time.

These are not isolated cases. They are just a few recent examples  from my home State, and there are countless more heartbreaking stories  from across the country.

It is clear that the current penalties are not enough to deter this  dangerous cycle of illegal reentry. The safety and security of our  citizens must never be compromised by those who abuse our system and  exploit our borders.

H.R. 3486 protects American families, upholds the rule of law, and  keeps our Nation secure by setting real penalties for those who seek to  enter our great Nation illegally to commit crimes. I urge my colleagues  to support this commonsense legislation.
