Personnel Oversight and Shift Tracking Act of 2025

Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill,  H.R. 3425, the Personnel Oversight and Shift Tracking Act of 2025, or  the POST Act.  I thank Mr. Barrett and Mr. Figures for their support of this really  important bill.

This is a commonsense bill that fixes a broken system and restores  accountability within the Federal Protective Service.

The Federal Protective Service, or FPS, is responsible for protecting  nearly 9,000 Federal facilities nationwide. In fiscal year 2024, FPS  operated with a $2.2 billion budget and oversaw more than 15,000  contract protective security officers.

With that level of funding and manpower, taxpayers expect reliable  results. Unfortunately, that is not what they are getting. A recent GAO  investigation showed contract guards failed to detect banned items like  batons and pepper spray in half of all covert tests. That is  unacceptable, and it should never have been allowed to persist. It is  also preventable.

H.R. 3425 makes sure FPS reviews these failures, documents them,  identifies the root causes, and then takes corrective action.

This bill also addresses the embarrassing state of FPS's Post  Tracking System. Back in 2018, FPS promised to modernize guard sign-in  with a digital system. Years later, that system still doesn't work, and  the agency is still relying on paper as its official record. That means  Washington can't even confirm in real time whether a building is  staffed and secure. In some cases, buildings have had to close because  of it. That is a waste of money and a failure of leadership.

H.R. 3425 fixes this by giving FPS 6 months to either make the system  work or replace it with one that does.

Mr. Speaker, this is not complicated. When Americans walk into a  Federal building, they deserve to know it is staffed and secured. The  American people expect their government to meet basic duties. The POST  Act honors that expectation by restoring accountability and requiring  results.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3425, the POST Act,  so that we restore proper oversight and accountability in the Federal  Protective Service and protect taxpayers from waste and failure.
