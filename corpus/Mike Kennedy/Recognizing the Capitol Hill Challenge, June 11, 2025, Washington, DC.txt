Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize and  congratulate the outstanding Whitehorse High School team from Montezuma  Creek, Utah, for achieving national distinction in the Capitol Hill  Challenge.

Out of hundreds of teams from across the country, this remarkable  group finished in the top ten. This is a truly impressive  accomplishment that speaks to their academic excellence and their  strong grasp of financial markets, economics, and civic engagement.  These students demonstrated exceptional teamwork, discipline, and a  genuine passion for learning throughout the competition.

The team members who I met today, along with their teacher, are Hope,  JaSea, Gabrielle, Nateo, and Kalvin, and they excelled under the  leadership of their dedicated teacher, Mr. Gosney. Their success is a  testament to both their individual talents and the support and guidance  that they received.

I am immensely proud to have such bright and committed leaders  representing Utah's Third District. Their achievement reflects the  strength, resilience, and character of our community.
