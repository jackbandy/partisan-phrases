Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of our  Nation's aviation professionals and their need for mental health  support.

Scientific studies of aviation professionals reveal that many are  hesitant to seek mental health treatment due to fears of professional  consequences. For example, pilots often speak about their careers with  deep passion, and the prospect of losing their wings is seen as one of  the worst possible outcomes. As a result, many choose not to self- report mental health concerns, fearing they might be grounded or face  stigma within the industry.

As a physician, I understand how deeply mental and physical health  are connected. When a profession so crucial to our daily lives faces  this challenge, I believe it is time we take a second look and see how  we can aid in combating this.

Destigmatizing mental health treatment for FAA employees and pilots  is essential to fostering a culture of safety, trust, and well-being in  aviation. Encouraging open dialogue and providing confidential,  nonpunitive access to mental health support helps ensure pilots receive  the care they need without fear of professional repercussions.

We cannot allow these essential professionals to suffer in silence.  Instead, let's create a system that supports their well-being and keeps  our skies safe.
