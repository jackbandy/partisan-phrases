Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the time you have  granted me to acknowledge a stunning accomplishment by one of our high  school athletes in Utah's Third District, Jane Hedengren.

Jane runs track for Timpview High School in Provo, Utah. In an  invitational meet in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 5, she swept the  field by more than 12 seconds, setting a national high school women's  and national women's 1-mile record for those under 20 years old of 4  minutes 23.5 seconds, only 0.04 seconds over the women's collegiate  mile record. Just 3 days later, she broke her own national high school  2-mile record by 17 seconds. She has also set national records for high  school women in the 2K, 3K, and 5K.

Forbes magazine recently said of her: ``Is this Utah teenager the  best girls track athlete in history? She certainly looks the part.''

Jane's post-graduation plans include running for the BYU Cougars  women's track and field and cross-country teams during the upcoming  school year.

I congratulate Jane and wish her good luck and much success. I am  excited to see what the future will hold for her.
