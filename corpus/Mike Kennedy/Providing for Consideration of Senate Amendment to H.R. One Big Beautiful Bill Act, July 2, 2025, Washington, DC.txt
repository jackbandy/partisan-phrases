Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here and  speak in favor of the rule for the big, beautiful bill.

As a provider of healthcare myself, as a doctor, and as a recipient  of Medicaid services--my first three children were born on Medicaid--in  addition to the fact that as a child, I was receiving food assistance  not only from free school lunch programs but church programs,  recognizing the vital need associated with Medicaid as well as with  these food programs, we need to rightsize these programs.

Mr. Speaker, if we don't take a different trajectory, these programs  will collapse under the economic failures of prior administrations. The  reality behind this is, this bill that we are discussing today is  insisting on work requirements associated with the recipients of  Medicaid.

If you are an able-bodied, working adult, you should be able to go  out and find a job. If you can't find a job, you need to go to a  training program and try to find training so that you can get a job and  ultimately get off Medicaid.

One of the components about Medicaid, we all know, is that it was  formed in favor of pregnant women, disabled people, as well as the  elderly. What the Republicans are trying to do is rightsize the  Medicaid program so that it survives for the long-term, vital needs of  the people of the future.
