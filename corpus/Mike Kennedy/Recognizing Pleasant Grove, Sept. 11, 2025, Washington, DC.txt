Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate 175  years since the establishment of Pleasant Grove, Utah.

Established on September 13, 1850, by pioneers, Pleasant Grove is  located in an idyllic location, nestled at the base of the majestic  snowcapped mountains of the Wasatch Front.

Its rich history is highlighted by the iconic Strawberry Days  celebration, which began in 1921 and remains the longest-running city  celebration in Utah. Each year, families gather to celebrate the city's  agricultural heritage with strawberries and cream, parades, concerts,  and rodeos.

Pleasant Grove also offers outstanding recreation and cultural  treasures, from the scenic trails of Battle Creek Falls and the wooden  castles at Discovery Park, to the family traditions of Hee Haw Farms  and the Christa McAuliffe Space Center.

Though the city has grown, it continues to be a family-oriented town  where residents can learn, explore, and thrive together.

At the heart of Pleasant Grove is its tight-knit community, people  dedicated to service, education, and preserving the city's rich  history.

I want to recognize the service of Mayor Guy Fugal and the members of  the Pleasant Grove City Council, whose leadership reflects the values  of this remarkable community.

I am proud to represent Pleasant Grove in Utah's Third District and  look forward to celebrating this momentous achievement with them.
