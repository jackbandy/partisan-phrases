Senator McConnell Applauds President Trump for Signing USMCA into Law


U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) made the following statement today regarding President Donald J. Trump signing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law:

"By signing the USMCA into law, President Trump has delivered a strong trade deal for Kentucky families. I was proud to lead the Senate as we sent the agreement to his desk, and I look forward to its benefits throughout the Commonwealth. Virtually every family and every industry in Kentucky is touched by the job-creating effects of exporting more of what we make here at home. Once the USMCA takes effect, Kentucky's workers, farmers and consumers are ready to take advantage of all it has to offer."
