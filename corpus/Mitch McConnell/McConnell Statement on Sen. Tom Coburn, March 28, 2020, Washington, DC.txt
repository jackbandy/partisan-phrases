McConnell Statement on Sen. Tom Coburn


U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) released the following statement on the passing of former Senator Tom Coburn.

"I am so sad that we have lost our friend and former colleague Senator Tom Coburn.

"The Senate knew Dr. Coburn as a whip-smart legislator with rock-solid principles. He was an unbelievably effective ambassador for his conservative Oklahoma values. He was central to igniting new national conversations about the proper role of federal policy and the shape of the conservative movement.

"But his famous nickname "Dr. No" did not fully capture Tom, because did not let his strong principles sideline him from creative policymaking or bipartisan cooperation. Tom's convictions did not drive him away from the table. They inspired him to become a central player. It took him less than two terms to become a master of the oversight process and a crucial partner in major legislation.

"As impressive as it was to see Tom work in the Senate, politics never defined him. Elected office was just one phase of a driven life that had already included growing a family business and delivering thousands of babies as a legendary hometown obstetrician. His deep faith and his endless capacity to the see the good in others made him a beloved friend to so many, including to Elaine and me.

"Seventy-two years was far too few for someone this brilliant, this tireless, and this dedicated to serving others. The Senate mourns our friend. We stand in prayer with his beloved wife Carolyn, their daughters Sarah, Katie, and Callie, and the entire Coburn family."
