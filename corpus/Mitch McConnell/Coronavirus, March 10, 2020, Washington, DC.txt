Coronavirus

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday evening, the President, the  Vice President, and their task force offered an extensive public  briefing on ongoing efforts to combat this new virus, which has spread  from China throughout the world. 

  As the Director of the CDC explained, officials are now tracking more  than 500 cases across our country. Nationwide, the risk to any  individual American remains low, but as the Vice President and the  experts reminded us, the time is now for all Americans to engage in  basic commonsense measures and for Americans at heightened risk to take  additional precautions. Detailed recommendations for individuals,  families, and employers are available online at coronavirus.gov. 

  President Trump also announced that in parallel with the public  health response, his administration is considering ways to mitigate the  impact of the virus on our economy. Senate Republicans look forward to  discussing this with Secretary Mnuchin and the President's team so we  can all consider the best ways to move forward for the American people.  As our government continues to prepare and protect our Nation, I would  urge all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle in both Chambers,  to put reflexive partisanship aside and stay focused on our common work  to promote the common good. This virus does not care--does not care-- about partisan divisions. 

  This disease poses a challenge, no question, but our Nation is  strong, we are well equipped, and we have overcome far, far greater  challenges before. As the Vice President put it yesterday, ``We're all  in this together.''
