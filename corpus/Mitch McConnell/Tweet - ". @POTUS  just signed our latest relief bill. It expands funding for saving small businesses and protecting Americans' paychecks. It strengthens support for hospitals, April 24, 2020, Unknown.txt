".@POTUS just signed our latest relief bill. It expands funding for saving small businesses and protecting Americans' paychecks. It strengthens support for hospitals, healthcare providers, and testing. Proud to have led the historic CARES Act and this expansion of key provisions."

"The Senate's historic CARES Act is the largest rescue package in American history. It is already sending hundreds of billions of dollars to struggling small businesses, hard-hit hospitals, testing, very targeted COVID-19 help for states and localities, and direct aid to families."

"This new bill strengthens some of the most important parts of the CARES Act, especially the popular Paycheck Protection Program which is saving millions of American jobs as we speak. And Republicans successfully kept extraneous issues out of the bill. It's a win for the country."
