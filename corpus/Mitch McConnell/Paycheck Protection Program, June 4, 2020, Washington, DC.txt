Paycheck Protection Program


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday evening, the Senate passed  a few targeted changes so that Senator Collins' and Senator Rubio's  historic Paycheck Protection Program will continue to protect American  workers and small businesses through this pandemic. 

  Back in March, these Senate leaders hand designed this plan to push  unprecedented assistance to working families and Main Street  businesses. Once again, in April, they led the charge to refill their  popular and successful program with more money so it could help even  more Americans. In the weeks since, our colleagues have continued to  track the program's operation and recommend further tweaks where  necessary. 

  In recent days, both Senator Collins and Senator Rubio helped to  strengthen and improve the House's proposed PPP modifications before it  actually passed the bill and sent it over to us, and I know the senior  Senators from Maine and Florida have already identified several more  technical fixes for the new legislation that, I hope, Congress will  address. 

  Talk about legislation making a difference. Thanks to Senator  Collins, Chairman Rubio, and our other colleagues who helped to make  this program a success, the PPP has delivered more than a half a  trillion dollars in relief and has literally saved tens of millions of  American jobs. 

  So, as we continue to stay nimble and continue our efforts, I just  had to thank and recognize the architects of this historic program--the  senior Senators from Maine and Florida--for helping to soften the blow  of this pandemic for so many American families.
