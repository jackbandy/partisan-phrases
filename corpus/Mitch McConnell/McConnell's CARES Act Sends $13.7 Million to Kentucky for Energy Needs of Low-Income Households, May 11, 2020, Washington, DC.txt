McConnell's CARES Act Sends $13.7 Million to Kentucky for Energy Needs of Low-Income Households


U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced today Kentucky received $13,745,001 to support low-income households with home energy costs impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. These federal funds, distributed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, were made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Senator McConnell introduced the CARES Act, which became the largest economic rescue package in American history, and led it to enactment in about a week. 

"Across Kentucky, the coronavirus poses serious health and economic challenges for almost everyone. I'm proud the bold legislation I introduced is delivering much-needed assistance for vulnerable Kentucky families," said Senator McConnell. "As families struggle to make ends meet during this crisis, these federal funds will help keep the lights on. My position as Senate Majority Leader helps give me the opportunity to take care of Kentucky, and I'm working to ensure our communities get the relief they need to beat this virus." 

In addition to these federal funds, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act has had an $11 billion impact on Kentucky so far. Senator McConnell's legislation has delivered $3.4 billion in relief to address urgent housing, transportation, healthcare, education and economic development priorities. His legislation also created the Paycheck Protection Program, which is helping nearly 44,000 Kentucky small businesses access over $5.3 billion in loans to keep their lights on and employees on payroll. Kentucky families have also received more than $3.2 billion in Economic Impact Payments from the U.S. Treasury.
