MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019--Motion to Proceed


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues  on both sides, as a result of this procedural obstruction, let me  explain where we are. 

  By refusal to allow us to take this first step, which would have  still given them plenty of time to negotiate, we have put the Senate in  the following position: If any 1 of the 100 of us chooses to object, we  can't deal with this until Friday or Saturday at the earliest. If any 1  of the 100 of us objects to some of the procedural hurdles we have to  overcome as a result of this mindless obstruction--absolutely mindless  obstruction going on on the other side, while the public is waiting for  us to act, while people are losing their jobs, losing their income, and  shutting down the economy, which we have had to do to deal with this  public health crisis, they are fiddling around with Senate procedure  that could, if 1 Senator objected, take us all the way to the end of  the week to solve this problem. 

  I am beginning to think our Democratic colleagues don't understand  the procedure in the Senate. I am not sure you understand the position  your leader has put you in. He loses nothing--nothing--in terms of  negotiating leverage by letting us get through these procedural hoops  sooner rather than later--sooner rather than later. 

  The American people have had enough of this nonsense. They wonder  where we are. They are looking to us to solve this problem. 

  The Secretary of the Treasury keeps going into the Democratic  leader's office, and the list keeps getting longer and longer and  longer. The bazaar is apparently open on the other side. Never let a  crisis go to waste, one former President's Chief of Staff famously  said. 

  So, look, I hope my colleagues will come out here and express  themselves in the course of the afternoon. The American people would  like to hear from us. They would like to know what is going on here. So  let's tell them.

  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, beyond what the Senator is accurately  pointing out, they put us in the following procedural position. By  refusing to jump over some of these procedural steps along the way--it  would not disadvantage their negotiating one bit--they have put us in a  position where one Senator 1 of 100--1--could keep us here until Friday  or Saturday. 

  Our constituents are saying to act now--as the Senator from Ohio was  pointing out--minus procedural roadblocks in a time of national  emergency.

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nebraska that I  will be very brief.                                Cloture Motion

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just one further observation, we will  not be having any votes tonight.
