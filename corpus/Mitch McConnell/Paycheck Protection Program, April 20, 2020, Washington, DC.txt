Paycheck Protection Program


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has now been 4 days since the  Paycheck Protection Program ran out of money. Republicans have been  trying to secure more funding for this critical program for a week and  a half now. At this hour, our Democratic colleagues are still  prolonging their discussions with the administration, so the Senate  regretfully will not be able to pass more funding for Americans'  paychecks today. 

  However, since this is so urgent, I have asked that the Senate meet  again tomorrow in a new session that was not previously scheduled, and  the Democratic leader has agreed to my request. 

  Colleagues, it is past time--past time--to get this done for the  country. 

  Mr. President, if I may, the Senator desires to speak for a few  minutes.
