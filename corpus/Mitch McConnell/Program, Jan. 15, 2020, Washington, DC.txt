  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, a  few minutes ago, the Senate was notified that the House of  Representatives is finally ready to proceed with their Articles of  Impeachment. So, by unanimous consent, we have just laid some of the  groundwork that will structure the next several days. 

  We have officially invited the House managers to come to the Senate  tomorrow at noon to exhibit their Articles of Impeachment. Then later  tomorrow afternoon, at 2 p.m., the Chief Justice of the United States  will arrive here in the Senate. He will be sworn in by the President  pro tempore, Senator Grassley. Then the Chief Justice will swear in all  of us Senators. We will pledge to rise above the petty factionalism and  do justice for our institutions, for our States, and for the Nation.  Then we will formally notify the  White House of our pending trial and summon the President to answer the  articles and send his counsel. 

  So the trial will commence in earnest on Tuesday. 

  First, Mr. President, some important good news for the country. We  anticipate the Senate will finish the USMCA tomorrow and send this  landmark trade deal to President Trump for his signature. This is a  major victory for the administration, but more importantly, for  American families. 

  Let me close with this: This is a difficult time for our country, but  this is precisely the kind of time for which the Framers created the  Senate. I am confident this body can rise above short-termism and  factional fever and serve the long-term best interests of our Nation.  We can do this, and we must. BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
