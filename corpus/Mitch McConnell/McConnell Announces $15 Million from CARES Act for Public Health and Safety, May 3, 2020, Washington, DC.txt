McConnell Announces $15 Million from CARES Act for Public Health and Safety


U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced today Kentucky received $15,121,392 to respond to the public health and safety effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) awarded nearly $8.3 million to strengthen testing, containment and treatment as well as to help Kentucky make progress toward safely re-opening the economy. The U.S. Department of Justice Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Fund delivered $6.8 million to Kentucky to help state and local governments respond the virus' spread. 

These federal funds were made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the largest economic rescue package in history. Senator McConnell introduced the CARES Act and led it to enactment in about a week. 

"As Kentucky continues battling the effects of the coronavirus, I'm proud my CARES Act is providing the vital resources to help communities in need," said Senator McConnell. "The unprecedented crisis requires a bold response, and these federal funds from the CDC and Justice Department can help keep families healthy and safe during this challenging time. As Senate Majority Leader, I'm putting Kentucky's priorities at the center of the national response and working to deliver the resources to beat this virus." 

In addition to these federal funds, the CARES Act has so far had a $10 billion impact on Kentucky. Senator McConnell's legislation has delivered $3 billion in relief to address urgent housing, transportation, healthcare, education and economic development priorities. His legislation also created the Paycheck Protection Program, which is helping nearly 42,000 Kentucky small businesses access over $5.2 billion in loans to keep their lights on and employees on payroll. Kentucky families have also received more than $2.3 in Economic Impact Payments from the U.S. Treasury.
