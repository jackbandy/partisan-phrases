Paycheck Protection Program


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 1 week ago, I warned that the Paycheck  Protection Program was running out of money and tried to pass a clean  funding bill. Senate Democrats blocked it. 

  So here we are a week later with absolutely no progress. This morning  the program ran out of money and shut down, just as I warned a week  ago. Even now, Senate Democrats are still blocking funding. Every  Senate Republican was ready to act today--today--but Democrats have not  let us reopen the program. 

  So, look, it is absolutely surreal to see Democratic leaders treat  support for workers and small businesses as something they need to be  goaded--goaded--into supporting. This really should be above politics. 

  Five million more Americans lost their jobs just last week. That  makes 20 million layoffs in just 1 month. Americans need Democrats to  stop blocking emergency paycheck money and let this job-saving program  reopen. I hope our colleagues will come around soon.
