BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, the Senate is now ready to vote on  the Articles of Impeachment, and after that is done, we will adjourn  the Court of Impeachment.                                  Article I

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, I send an order to the desk.

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, before this process fully  concludes, I want to very quickly acknowledge a few of the people who  helped the Senate fulfill our duty these past weeks. 

  First and foremost, I know my colleagues join me in thanking Chief  Justice Roberts for presiding over the Senate trial with a clear head,  steady hand, and the forbearance that this rare occasion demands. 

  (Applause.) 

  We know full well that his presence as our Presiding Officer came in  addition to, not instead of, his day job across the street, so the  Senate thanks the Chief Justice and his staff who helped him perform  this unique role. 

  Like his predecessor, Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Senate will be  awarding Chief Justice Roberts the golden gavel to commemorate his time  presiding over this body. We typically award this to new Senators after  about 100 hours in the chair, but I think we can agree that the Chief  Justice has put in his due and then some. 

  The page is delivering the gavel.

  Mr. McCONNELL. Of course, there are countless Senate professionals  whose efforts were essential, and I will have more thorough facts to  offer next week to all of those teams, from the Secretary of the  Senate's office, to the Parliamentarian, to the Sergeant at Arms team,  and beyond. 

  But there are two more groups I would like to single out now. First,  the two different classes of Senate pages who participated in this  trial, their footwork and cool under pressure literally kept the floor  running. Our current class came on board right in the middle of the  third Presidential impeachment trial in American history and quickly  found themselves hand-delivering 180 question cards from Senators'  desks to the dais. 

  No pressure, right, guys? 

  So thank you all very much for your good work. 

  (Applause.) 

  Second, the fine men and women of the Capitol Police, we know that  the safety of our democracy literally rests in their hands every single  day, but the heightened measures surrounding the trial meant even more  hours and even more work and even more vigilance. 

  Thank you all very much for your service to this body and to the  country. 

  (Applause.)
