  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, so here we are, colleagues. For the  information of all of our Senators, we will first vote on the adoption  of the Sasse amendment at a 60-vote threshold, and then our second and  final vote will be on passage of the CARES Act, also at a 60-vote  threshold. We are going to pass this bipartisan relief package and send  it over to the House so they can put it on the President's desk. 

  When the Senate adjourns this evening, our next scheduled vote will  be the afternoon of Monday, April 20. Of course, during this  unprecedented time for our country, the Senate is going to stay nimble.  As always, we will convene regular pro forma sessions, and if  circumstances require the Senate to return for a vote sooner than April  20, we will provide at least 24 hours' notice. 

  Our Nation obviously is going through a kind of crisis that is  totally unprecedented in living memory. Let's stay connected and  continue to collaborate on the best ways to keep helping our States and  our country through this pandemic. Let's continue to pray for one  another, for all of our families, and for our country.
