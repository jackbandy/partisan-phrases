Usa Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2020


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, on one other important matter,  late last night, several critical authorities that law enforcement uses  to keep Americans safe lapsed into expiration. Barring Senate action,  these important tools, which help protect the homeland from terrorists  and counter foreign intelligence activities on U.S. soil, will remain  offline. 

  Fortunately, in the weeks leading up to this deadline, the Attorney  General engaged in extensive bipartisan talks with Members of the  House--of both parties--to try to reach a solution. The resulting  legislation, which the House passed last week by large margins within  each party, strikes a key balance. It reauthorizes the tools which our  national security requires, while also imposing a number of new reforms  which basic accountability demands. 

  We can't let the relative success of these tools at preserving the  safety and security of our country mislead us to believe they are  unnecessary. It is just the opposite. Terrorist organizations still  search constantly for opportunities to strike on American soil. Hostile  foreign intelligence services--whether Chinese, Russian, or Iranian-- still seek to conduct operations within our borders, to recruit assets  and agents among our population. 

  These threats will not wait around if the United States delays  restocking our toolbox, so the Senate should not wait to act. I  sincerely hope that even our colleagues who may wish to vote against  the House bill will not make us prolong this brief lapse in authorities  and that we will be able to get these tools back online this week.
