"It was sad to see some Senate Democrats rush to blame our own administration before even knowing the facts. Rush to split hairs about intelligence before being briefed on it. Rush to downplay Soleimani's evil while presenting our own president as the villain."

"In the Senate, overheated partisan passions are supposed to give way to sober judgment. Can we not wait until we know the facts? Can we not maintain a shred of unity for five minutes before deepening partisan fights? We are all Americans first and we are all in this together."
