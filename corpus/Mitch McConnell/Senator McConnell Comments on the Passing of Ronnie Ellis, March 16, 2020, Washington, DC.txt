Senator McConnell Comments on the Passing of Ronnie Ellis


U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on Ronnie Ellis:

"In a hall of fame career spanning more than 40 years, Ronnie Ellis earned a reputation as one of the hardest-working reporters in Kentucky. He was always armed with the tough questions, and he helped set the standard for other journalists. Ronnie gave his readers a first-hand look into their government and helped shape countless conversations across the Commonwealth.

"Through the years, I enjoyed talking with Ronnie about everything from politics to sports. Even when he disagreed with your position, you knew he'd treat everyone fairly. I'm going to miss his insightful perspective.

"Elaine and I join all Ronnie's many fans in honoring his dedicated journalism. Our sincere condolences are with Jack and Scottie."
