McConnell Update on Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security Act


U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) issued the following statement regarding the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act:

"The past two days of intense bipartisan talks are very close to a resolution. I believe we are poised to deliver the significant relief that Americans need with the speed that this crisis demands.

"The legislation we are finalizing addresses all four of the crucial priorities that Senate Republicans laid out earlier this week. It will send direct relief to the American people, deliver historic assistance to small businesses so workers can keep getting paid, help secure our economic foundations and prevent layoffs, and Â¬surge more resources onto the front lines of our brave healthcare professionals' fight to defend Americans and defeat the virus.

"I believe Senators on both sides and the Administration have been encouraged by our discussions. Republicans and Democrats have worked together to produce a compromise that should be able to pass the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority.

"I have asked committee chairmen to draft final legislative text that reflects their compromise products and deliver that text later this evening.

"This would allow all Senators to review the complete bipartisan text in advance of our first procedural vote at 3:00pm tomorrow."
