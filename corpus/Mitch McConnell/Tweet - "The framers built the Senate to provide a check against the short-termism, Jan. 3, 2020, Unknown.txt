"The framers built the Senate to provide a check against the short-termism, the runaway passions, and the "the demon of faction" that Hamilton warned would "extend his sceptre" over the House of Representatives "at certain seasons.""

"We exist because the founders wanted an institution that could stop momentary hysterias and partisan passions from damaging our Republic. An institution that could be thoughtful, be sober, and take the long view."

"If the House ever musters the courage to stand behind their slapdash work product and transmit their impeachment to the Senate, it will be time for the United States Senate to fulfill our founding purpose."

"We can't hold a trial without the articles. The Senate's own rules don't provide for that. So, for now, we are content to continue the ordinary business of the Senate while House Democrats continue to flounder. For now."
