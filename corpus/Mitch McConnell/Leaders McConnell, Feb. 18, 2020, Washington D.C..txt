Leaders McConnell, McCarthy and Chairman Graham Statement in Support of Attorney General Bill Barr


Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) issued the following statement in support of Attorney General Bill Barr in light of recent attacks against him:

"Attorney General William Barr is a man of the highest character and unquestionable integrity. The Senate has attested to this fact by confirming him four times to positions of the utmost public trust. In each case, his commitment to the rule of law, the Constitution, and the American people has proven this trust to be well-placed.

"Suggestions from outside groups that the Attorney General has fallen short of the responsibilities of his office are unfounded. The Attorney General has shown that he is committed without qualification to securing equal justice under law for all Americans.

"The American system of government is only as strong as the public servants who are willing to preserve, protect, and defend it. The nation is fortunate that President Trump chose such a strong and selfless public servant to lead the Department of Justice. We expect that, as always, efforts to intimidate the Attorney General will fall woefully short."
