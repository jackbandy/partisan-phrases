McConnell Statement on New Guidance from the Office of the Attending Physician


U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) issued the following statement today regarding guidance from the Office of the Attending Physician (OAP):

"I am grateful to Dr. Monahan, the entire Office of the Attending Physician (OAP), the Senate Rules Committee, and the offices of the Sergeant at Arms, the Architect of the Capitol, and the Secretary of the Senate. All of these dedicated professionals have worked hard to develop solutions so the United States Senate can smartly and safely begin resuming our critical in-person work on Monday.

"Today the OAP has transmitted detailed advice to members and committees. It covers a wide variety of subjects, from staffing levels to physical workspaces to self-screening procedures to conduct at home every morning. Some practical questions will necessarily be addressed Senate-wide. Many others will be addressed office-by-office. I strongly urge my colleagues to consult these guidelines as we carefully resume in-person work.

"All across our nation, American workers in essential sectors are following expert advice and taking new precautions while they continue reporting for duty and performing irreplaceable work their country needs. Starting Monday, the Senate will do the same. There is critical business waiting for us, including continued action on COVID-19 but also urgent national-security legislation and nominations for key government positions.

"I look forward to seeing my colleagues on Monday. We will continue to stand together for the American people -- even as we stand six feet apart."
