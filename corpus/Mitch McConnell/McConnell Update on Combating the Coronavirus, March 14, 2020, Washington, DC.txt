McConnell Update on Combating the Coronavirus


U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) issued the following statement regarding the House of Representatives passage of additional legislation to assist with the economic fallout from the coronavirus:

"I applaud the additional steps President Trump announced today to continue fighting the coronavirus. The new emergency declaration will unlock even more resources and flexibility for the federal, state, and local officials working to protect American families.

"In parallel with our public health efforts, the American people also deserve swift assistance with the economic fallout from the virus.

"The rough draft that Speaker Pelosi published Wednesday night fell far short of what American families and small businesses deserve. I want to commend Secretary Mnuchin for his hard work over the past two days to improve it.

"Of course, Senators will need to carefully review the version just passed by the House. But I believe the vast majority of Senators in both parties will agree we should act swiftly to secure relief for American workers, families, and small businesses.

"I have canceled next week's state work period so the Senate can work on this urgent legislation and reauthorize key national security tools that law enforcement need to keep us safe."
