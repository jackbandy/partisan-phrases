Senate Resolution 493--To Authorize Testimony, Documents, and Representation in United States V. Stahlnecker


BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a resolution authorizing the production of testimony, documents, and representation by the Senate Legal Counsel, and ask for its immediate consideration. 

  Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for evidence in a  criminal action pending in California Federal district court. In this action, the defendant is charged with making threatening telephone calls last year to the Washington, D.C. offices of Senator Sherrod  Brown and Senator Shelley Moore Capito. Trial is scheduled to commence on February 11, 2020. 

  The prosecution is seeking testimony at trial from three Senate witnesses who received the telephone calls at issue: current employees of Senator Brown's and Senator Capito's offices and a former employee of Senator Brown's office. Senators Brown and Capito would like to cooperate with this request by providing relevant employee testimony and, if necessary, documents from their offices. 

  The enclosed resolution would authorize those staffers, and any other current or former employee of the Senators' offices from whom relevant evidence may be necessary, to testify and produce documents in this action, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.
