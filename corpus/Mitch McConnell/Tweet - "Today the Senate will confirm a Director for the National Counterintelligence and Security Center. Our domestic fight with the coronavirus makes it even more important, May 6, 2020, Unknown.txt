"Today the Senate will confirm a Director for the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. Our domestic fight with the coronavirus makes it even more important, not less important, that we also maintain global vigilance and keep a close eye on those who wish us harm."

"Even though the Democrats' own top member on the Intelligence Committee praises this nominee and wants a swift confirmation, Senate Democrats still forced us to use hours of floor time and multiple votes, as if he were controversial. This is what I've called mindless obstruction."

"The Senate is not going to let either the coronavirus or reflexive partisanship stop us from doing crucial national business. We are elected to do our jobs. I'm glad we'll have a Senate-confirmed counterintelligence leader by the end of the day."
