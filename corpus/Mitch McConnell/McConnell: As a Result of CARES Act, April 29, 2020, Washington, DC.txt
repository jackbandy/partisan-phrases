McConnell: As a Result of CARES Act, Kentucky Healthcare Providers Receive an Additional $77.7 Million to Combat Coronavirus


U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced today that Kentucky healthcare providers received an additional $77.7 million in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support their ongoing fight against the coronavirus. Kentucky has already received more than $452.7 million through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to provide critical relief and support for healthcare providers. The funding was distributed to more than 3,900 Kentucky medical providers and systems. 

The funding is the result of the CARES Act, which Senator McConnell introduced and led to passage last month. The bipartisan CARES Act, which is the biggest rescue package in history, passed with a 96 to 0 vote and was signed into law by President Donald Trump. 

"Frontline healthcare workers are courageously protecting our families and communities from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. They deserve our sincere gratitude and our support," said Senator McConnell.  "As Senate Majority Leader, I was proud to help deliver Kentucky's hospital workers and healthcare professionals with more than half a billion dollars. These Kentucky heroes continue to inspire us all to do our part to beat this virus, and I look forward to continuing to support them in the Senate." 

In addition to these federal funds, Kentucky has so far received more than $2.9 billion to address urgent housing, transportation, healthcare, education and economic development priorities from Senator McConnell's CARES Act. His legislation also created the Paycheck Protection Program, which is helping nearly 24,000 Kentucky small businesses access over $4.1 billion in loans to keep their lights on and employees on payroll.
