Bill to Fight Fentanyl in Kentucky Goes to President Trump for Signature


U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) made the following statement after the House passed a Senate measure that will allow all types of fentanyl-like substances (analogues) to continue being designated as Schedule 1 narcotics:

"Deadly fentanyl and its analogues continue plaguing families across the nation, killing more Kentuckians in 2018 than any other illegal drug. I'm glad the House followed the Senate's lead to ensure illicit fentanyl-like substances remain subject to criminal prosecution like other Schedule I drugs. This legislation will help keep these dangerous drugs off the streets. As Senate Majority Leader, I'll continue to work with local, state and federal law enforcement to prioritize Kentucky's fight against opioid and substance abuse."

Earlier this month, under Senator McConnell's leadership, the Senate passed the measure. Clark County Sheriff Berl Perdue, Jr., President of the Kentucky State Fraternal Order of Police, said, "Kentucky's law enforcement officers have no greater friend than Senator McConnell, and his support is critical to our work to protect our families and to keep our officers safe. Through his position as Majority Leader, Senator McConnell answered our call and made this legislation a national priority. We're grateful to Senator McConnell for his leadership for Kentucky and his work to help protect our Commonwealth from the scourge of drugs."
