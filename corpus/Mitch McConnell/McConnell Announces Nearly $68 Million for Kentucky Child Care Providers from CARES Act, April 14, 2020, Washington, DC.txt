McConnell Announces Nearly $68 Million for Kentucky Child Care Providers from CARES Act


U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced today Kentucky will receive more than $67.74 million to support child care providers during the coronavirus pandemic. The federal funding, delivered through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families, was made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The bipartisan CARES Act, introduced by Senator McConnell, became the largest economic rescue package in American history. 

"Kentucky's child care centers provide a critical service to families across our Commonwealth. They deserve our support as they face the health and economic crisis of the coronavirus," said Senator McConnell. "By investing in these centers and their dedicated workers, we are helping ensure our children can return to a safe environment for growth and development when this crisis is over." 

"Majority Leader McConnell's leadership on the CARES Act again demonstrates his commitment to Kentucky kids and families. He accurately focused on a multi-sector, multi-generational approach and that's especially true with an additional funding commitment to child care supports," said Terry Brooks, executive director of Kentucky Youth Advocates. "Parents need access to safe, affordable, quality care while they work. Leader McConnell's actions help preserve access to child care for Kentucky's workforce, restore the Commonwealth's economy, and invest in our children." 

In addition to this announcement, Kentucky communities and organizations have so far received nearly $880 million to address urgent housing, transportation, healthcare, education and economic development priorities from Senator McConnell's CARES Act.
