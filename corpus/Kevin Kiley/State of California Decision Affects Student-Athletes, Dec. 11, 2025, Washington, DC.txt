State of California Decision Affects Student-Athletes

Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I feel compelled to call  attention to an outrageous action that has just been undertaken by the  State of California to deprive many, many young people in my district  of athletic opportunities.

Truckee Unified School District, which is in my district, competes  when it comes to athletics in a neighboring school district in Nevada.  What is the reason for that?

Well, for sports like soccer, these are winter sports in California,  but they are quite hard to play in the winter in this part of the State  because there is a lot of snow. They are spring sports in Nevada. So in  order to allow young people to play soccer and other sports, they  compete in Nevada.

However, the State of California has just ordered Truckee Unified to  compete in California, no longer giving them that option. Why? It is  because Nevada doesn't have the same policy of allowing biological  males to compete in women's sports.

Regardless of what you think of that particular policy, it is  something that only affects a few students, and now the State of  California is depriving all of these student-athletes of the  opportunity to play their sport as well as subjecting them to onerous  new travel arrangements.

I am urging the State of California to reverse this outrageous  action.
