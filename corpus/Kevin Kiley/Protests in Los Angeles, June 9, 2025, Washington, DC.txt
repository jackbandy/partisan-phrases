Mr. KILEY of California. The scenes we are seeing in Los Angeles  right now are absolutely horrifying, and California's radical political  leadership has done everything possible to usher in this chaos.

First of all, they aided and abetted Biden's open border, which was  worse in California than anywhere.

Second, they adopted sanctuary policies that prevent ICE from being  able to conduct immigration operations in the safest and most orderly  fashion in a custodial setting.

Three, they massively have funded radical groups that are now going  out and providing coordinates to people throughout L.A. for where ICE  operations are taking place.

Four, they have actually released a lot of dangerous criminals from  our jails through early release policies so there are plenty of people  out there who are willing to stir up trouble.

Five, they are adding fuel to the fire--literal fires--with  incendiary rhetoric that are vilifying our law enforcement officers,  that are vilifying Federal officials.

Then, worst of all, the Governor is refusing to take action to keep  the community safe. Right now the entire country has seen what his  failed policies have done to our State.
