Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Act of 2025


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of the Secure  Rural Schools Reauthorization Act, I am very glad and relieved this day  has finally come.

Mr. Speaker, seven of the counties in my district rely on this  program to assure every child has access to a quality education and to  provide important public services.

Throughout the period in which this fund has lapsed, I have met with  many of the leaders in these schools who have talked about the  tradeoffs they have had to make. I met with the students who have seen  opportunities taken from them, extracurriculars and other programs that  have been limited because of this lapse in funding.

I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle here today  and in the committees of jurisdiction for their tireless efforts in  overcoming the inertia of this institution and getting this bill to the  floor for a vote today.

I look forward to it passing in a resounding bipartisan way and in a  way that I hope will assure that, going forward, we don't allow for  this sort of lapse to happen again where for 1\1/2\ years these schools  and counties were going without these vitally needed payments.

This is a measure that has broad bipartisan support. It is a very  popular program. It is an important program. There is no reason that  Congress should fail to pass its reauthorization in a timely manner.

Mr. Speaker, I look forward to this passing on the floor today. We  need to make sure that in the future we don't keep our schools and our  students in limbo.
