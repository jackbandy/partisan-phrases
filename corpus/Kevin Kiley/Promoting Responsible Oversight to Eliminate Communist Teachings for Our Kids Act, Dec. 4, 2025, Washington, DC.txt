Promoting Responsible Oversight to Eliminate Communist Teachings for Our Kids Act


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 1069, the Promoting Responsible Oversight To Eliminate Communist  Teachings for Our Kids Act, in order to protect our kids and to protect  our country.

The Chinese Communist Party is responsible for severe human rights  abuses and the suppression of fundamental freedoms, with a long and  well-documented history of censorship, oppression, and disregard for  human rights.

However, it is equally well understood that the CCP aggressively  pushes its propaganda worldwide to reshape global narratives in its  favor. That effort has extended into virtually every facet of American  society, including, unfortunately, American classrooms.

Findings from the State Department have revealed that CCP-funded so- called Confucius classrooms have operated in over 500 K-12 schools  across the United States.

Now, these programs are not about education. They are about  influence. The CCP does not act with charitable intent. These programs  exist because the CCP expects something in return: control over  curriculum and influence over young minds.

It is unacceptable that American school districts have entered into  financial arrangements with entities tied to the CCP, an adversary of  the United States and a regime with one of the worst human rights  records in the world.

The simple premise of this legislation is that no Federal tax dollars  should support schools that partner with the Chinese Communist Party.  The PROTECT Our Kids Act puts that principle into law by ensuring that  Federal education funds are not available to schools that collaborate  with, receive funding from, or otherwise engage in agreements with the  Government of the People's Republic of China. This includes  partnerships with Confucius classrooms, language programs funded by the  CCP, and instructional materials or personnel tied to the Chinese  Government.

American education should teach American values, not communist  propaganda.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a  firm stand against foreign influence in our children's education.
