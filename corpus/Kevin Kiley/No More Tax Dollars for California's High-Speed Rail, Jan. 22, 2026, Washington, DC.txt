No More Tax Dollars for California's High-Speed Rail

Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, a year ago, I introduced  legislation to cut off all funding for California's high-speed rail  project and today, in an overwhelming, bipartisan vote, the House  passed this measure as part of an appropriations bill that will soon be  signed into law.

This is fantastic news for American taxpayers and for California  taxpayers as the high-speed rail project is the biggest public  infrastructure failure in United States history. It was supposed to be  done in 2020 and yet now in 2026, no track has been laid despite  spending $18 billion.

The estimated total cost has ballooned from $33 billion to $128  billion, and even The New York Times found that it is not on pace to be  finished this century.

With the success of this legislation, our Federal tax dollars in  California can go where they are needed when it comes to transportation  and that is to improve our failing roads, to alleviate traffic, and to  actually improve the quality of life for Californians.
