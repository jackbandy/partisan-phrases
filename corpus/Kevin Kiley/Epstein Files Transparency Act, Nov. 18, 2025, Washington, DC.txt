Epstein Files Transparency Act


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1696819/epstein-files-transparency-act


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I have consistently called for  the maximum possible level of transparency when it comes to the heinous  crimes of Jeffrey Epstein. That is why I have consistently said that I  am inclined to vote for this bill, and it is why I will be doing so  today.

The victims deserve the truth. They deserve justice. They deserve  closure.

For months, they have had to wake up every day to see the name of  their tormentor on the front page of every newspaper, on every TV  channel, as has the broader American public.

This issue has been so politicized by so many people in so many ways,  which is deeply unfortunate when we are talking about matters of the  highest sensitivity and untold suffering.

It is my hope that the passage of this resolution today, together  with the work of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, will  lead to the expeditious release of all pertinent material so that we  can move on.

Let's get accountability. Let's get answers. Let's get this over  with.
