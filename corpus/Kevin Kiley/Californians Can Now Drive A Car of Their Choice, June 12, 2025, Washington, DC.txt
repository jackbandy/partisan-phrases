Californians Can Now Drive A Car of Their Choice

Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, today was a tremendous victory for sanity in  California. I had the opportunity to join President Trump at the White  House where he signed into law a resolution I introduced to reverse  Gavin Newsom's ban on gas cars once and for all.

I want to thank my colleagues here in Congress on both sides of the  aisle who joined us in passing this and getting it to the President's  desk where it was signed into law today.

Because of its passage, Californians can now continue to drive a car  of their choice rather than one that is dictated to them by the  government.

We are pretty close to killing the high-speed rail disaster once and  for all, as well, so we can invest money in our roads where it is  needed. I think, Mr. Speaker, that we truly are on a path back to  sanity in California.
