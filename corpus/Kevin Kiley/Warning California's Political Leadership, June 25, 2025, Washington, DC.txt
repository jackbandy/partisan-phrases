Warning California's Political Leadership

Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, for months, I have been warning  California's political leadership that our State is in violation of  Federal civil rights laws, with a policy that even Governor Newsom has  admitted is fundamentally unfair. That policy is one that allows for  biological males to compete in women's sports.

Today, that warning proved well-founded as the Department of  Education concluded its investigation, finding that California is in  blatant violation of Title IX. As a result, our State could lose its  Federal education funding.

The good news is that we don't have to. The State can prevent any  loss of funding simply by complying with the Department's very  reasonable conditions: reverse this unfair policy; provide titles,  honors, and awards to female athletes who are unjustly deprived; and  issue those athletes an apology.

This will simply restore fairness, common sense, and sanity in  California. I am calling on California's political leaders to comply  with these conditions immediately.
