Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate  World Intellectual Property Day and the creation of the Congressional  Inventions Caucus.

The newly created caucus will work to foster education,  collaboration, and legislative action on intellectually property issues  in Congress. I would like to thank Rep. Deborah Ross for leading this  caucus with me in the House, as well as Sen. Daines and Sen. Coons.

Copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets are key to  America's innovation, industrial strength, standard of living, and our  economic and national security.

Intellectual property-intensive firms account for 44 percent of U.S.  jobs and better pay and benefits than jobs with that utilize little or  no intellectual property.

It is integral to cutting-edge technologies, discovery, and  development of new miracle medicines, sophisticated computing, and  advanced microchips. Intellectual property is also foundational for  movies, music, publishing, and much more.

Intellectual property industries produce almost 80 percent of U.S.  commodity exports. Many of these industries even have trade surpluses  since the United States is the world's top intellectual property  exporter, with exports valued at $140 billion in 2024.
