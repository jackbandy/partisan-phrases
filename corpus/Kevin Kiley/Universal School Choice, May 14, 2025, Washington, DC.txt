Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, The Nation's Report Card  recently showed that our education system is in a state of crisis.  There has been a steady and alarming decline. However, right now, we  have an opportunity to turn the tide by catalyzing a revolution in  school choice across the country.

One-half of the equation is the Educational Choice for Children Act  which will expand private school choice to 2 million kids and has been  included in the text of the reconciliation bill.

However, the other one-half, the High-Quality Charter School Act, and  a tax provision contained therein, would triple the number of kids in  charter schools across the country remains missing still.

I am encouraging my colleagues to ensure that we provide support for  charter school families in equal measure in a way that will expand  opportunity across the country. Together with universal school choice,  we will be able to begin a new era of educational excellence in this  country.
