Iranian Regime is World's Foremost Sponsor of Terror


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, the elimination of Iran's  nuclear weapons capacity is not just an important foreign policy  objective. It is an absolute national security imperative.

This has long been a point of bipartisan, nonpartisan consensus: Iran  cannot get a nuclear weapon. The targeted yet overwhelming strikes  executed this past weekend were precisely tailored to achieve that  limited, yet vital mission.

Let's remember who we are dealing with here. The Iranian regime is  the world's foremost sponsor of terror. They have funded monsters,  sponsored violence, and sewn chaos far beyond their borders. Their all- consuming obsession is the obliteration of America's principal ally in  the Middle East, and they have avowed death to America itself.

It is, therefore, deeply disturbing to see the reflexive partisan  reactions by certain Members of Congress. Either they believe Iran  should obtain a nuclear weapon or they hope the regime's nuclear  program will magically disappear on its own. Both positions are equally  delusional.

It is time to put partisanship aside and come together as a country.  This is not just another political issue. It is about the safety and  security of the American people and the future of civilization itself.
