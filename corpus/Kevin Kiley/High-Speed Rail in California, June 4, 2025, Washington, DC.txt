High-Speed Rail in California

Mr. KILEY of California. I have good news for Californians. Today is  the beginning of the end of high-speed rail, the biggest public  infrastructure disaster in U.S. history.

A few months ago, I joined Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy in  Los Angeles to announce an investigation and compliance review into the  State's high-speed rail project. Today, the results are in.

The State, with respect to $4 billion in grants that it took, is  woefully out of compliance with the conditions of those grants, and,  fundamentally, the audit found that this project has no viable path  forward.

Of course, Californians have known that for a long time. They have  spent $17 billion and haven't laid any track. The New York Times found  the project is not on track to be completed this century and will be  $100 billion over budget.

They initially told us that there would be a high-speed train from  L.A. to San Francisco by the year 2020. Now, even the modest initial  segment from Bakersfield to Merced is going to miss its 2033 deadline.  Even if the train were to magically come into existence today, it would  be decades-old technology.

It is time to end this embarrassment for our State once and for all  and use our transportation dollars in ways that will actually benefit  the quality of life of Californians.
