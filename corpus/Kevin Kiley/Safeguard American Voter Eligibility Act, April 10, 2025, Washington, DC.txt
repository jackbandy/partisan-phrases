Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act

Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor of  the SAVE Act to advance the radical proposition that only American  citizens should vote in American elections.

Of course, this isn't radical at all. It is common sense. I think the  vast majority of Americans would be shocked to learn that it elicits  any opposition at all.

In many States in this country, foremost my own State of California,  the administration of our elections is completely out of touch with the  rest of the developed world, falling well short of the standards that  ought to exist in a modern democratic society.

This measure requiring proof of citizenship in order to vote is a  needed corrective. I believe, in my State, it will complement other  initiatives that we are advancing now to require voter ID and to have a  timely vote-counting process in order to restore public confidence in  our election process.

What is at stake is not only election integrity and election security  but democratic legitimacy, ensuring that our people have the ability to  express themselves fully in our own identity as a State in the country  through the democratic process.

I urge passage of this on a bipartisan basis.
