Do Not Mess with Our Public Lands

Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, today, I have a simple message  for my colleagues in the U.S. Senate: Do not mess with our public  lands.

I helped to defeat a provision originally included in the House  reconciliation bill that would have provided for public land sales. We  got it removed, but now a similar provision has somehow reemerged in  the Senate.

I will be very clear: The inclusion of any such provision in the  final version of the bill will imperil the entire reconciliation  package. Our beautiful public lands are not just national treasures.  They are deeply interwoven with our communities. They are essential to  the character of our region. They provide jobs and economic activity.  They provide recreation and joy, and they are open to all.

Mr. Speaker, I will fight in every way I can to assure that they  remain open to all and that the will of our local communities is not  subordinated to decisions made in Washington, D.C.
