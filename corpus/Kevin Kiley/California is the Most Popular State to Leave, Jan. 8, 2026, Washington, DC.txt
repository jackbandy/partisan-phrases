Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, today, the Governor of my  State, Gavin Newsom, gave his state of the State address in which he  declared that California leads the Nation. Now, the Governor isn't  wrong. As the residents of our State know all too well, California does  lead the Nation.

California leads the Nation in fraud. California leads the Nation in  unemployment. California leads the Nation in homelessness. California  leads the Nation in poverty. California leads the Nation in illiteracy.  California leads the Nation in gas prices. California leads the Nation  in electricity prices. California leads the Nation in housing prices.  California leads the Nation in debt and deficits. Just this week, we  learned that for the sixth straight year, California leads the Nation  in outbound U-Haul rentals. The greatest State in the country has  become the most popular State to leave.

That, Mr. Speaker, is the true state of our State during this  Governor's tenure.
