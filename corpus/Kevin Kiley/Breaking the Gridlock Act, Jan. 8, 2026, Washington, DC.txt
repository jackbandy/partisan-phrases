Breaking the Gridlock Act


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I agree with points that are  being made on both sides. The fundamental point of our side is  undeniably true, which is that our healthcare system is broken and  costs continue to spiral out of control.

However, it is also true that suddenly withdrawing premium support  from 22 million Americans is going to force those folks into a terrible  dilemma: either paying hundreds or thousands of dollars more, so they  face hard trade-offs for their families, losing their insurance  altogether in a way that will impact the employer-based market of 150  million Americans, or working less in order to remain eligible in a way  that will reduce their discretionary income as well as be bad for our  economy as a whole.

We need a solution to this, but this bill is obviously not a  solution. Everyone knows that. It is a political exercise that has been  engineered by the minority leader at the expense of pursuing an actual  solution.

Now, once again, it is falling on the Senate to do the real  policymaking, but I am heartened that they seem to be close to a deal  that roughly mirrors the compromise bipartisan bill that I have offered  with the gentleman from California (Mr. Liccardo) that does a temporary  extension with reforms and cost controls to provide runway, so then we  can begin the real hard work of fixing our healthcare system in this  country.
