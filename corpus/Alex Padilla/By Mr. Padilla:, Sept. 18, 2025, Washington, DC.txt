Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Ackerson Meadow  Land Exchange Act. This legislation will facilitate a simple land  exchange between the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service  in the Sierra Nevada.

This bill would transfer 160 acres of Stanislaus National Forest land  to the National Park Service to be managed as part of Yosemite National  Park and transfer 170 acres of National Park land to the Forest Service  to manage as part of Stanislaus National Forest. The land in the  exchange is known as Ackerson Meadow.

Ackerson Meadow is one of the largest midelevation meadows in the  Sierra Nevada. It is an ecologically and regionally critical wildlife  corridor, and the scenic meadow is an important habitat for the State  endangered great grey owl and little willow flycatcher, as well as a  suite of additional at-risk wildlife species. In 2016, a coalition of  conservation groups donated Ackerson Meadow to Yosemite National Park;  however, it is almost completely surrounded by Stanislaus National  Forest and only partially contiguous to the rest of Yosemite National  Park.

The current configuration of land management presents logistical  challenges to both NPS and Forest Service; therefore, both Agencies, as  well as local stakeholders, support this land exchange.

I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this  straightforward legislation to better manage the land in and around  Ackerson Meadow.                               By Mr. DURBIN:
