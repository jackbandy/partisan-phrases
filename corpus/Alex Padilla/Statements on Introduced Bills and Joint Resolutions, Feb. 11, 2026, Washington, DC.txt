Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Health Investment  Zones Act of 2026. This legislation would designate health investment  zones for 10 years in areas with large health disparities based on  income, life expectancy, provider shortages, and align tax, grant,  loan-repayment, and Medicare incentives to expand services where they  are needed most.

This bill would establish health investment zones, HIZs, in areas  with significant health disparities, offering incentives like expanded  tax credits for employers and workers, grants for health projects, and  loan repayment for healthcare professionals serving in these zones. It  supports initiatives such as mobile clinics and wellness programs and  provides Medicare bonuses for services delivered in HIZs. The bill  focuses on improving outcomes for conditions like diabetes,  cardiovascular disease, and maternal health, with a 10-year report to  measure progress in health, access, and cost reductions.

Many communities face preventable gaps in health care access that  lead to higher emergency room use, more hospital admissions, and rising  costs. Establishing 10-year health investment zones will help close  these gaps and ensure that underserved areas receive the consistent,  affordable, and high-quality care they need.                                  ______

By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Warren,          Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Duckworth, Ms. Hirono, Mr.          Sanders, and Ms. Baldwin):

``(3) Exception for corporations with substantial business       activities in foreign country of organization.--A foreign       corporation described in paragraph (2) shall not be treated       as an inverted domestic corporation if after the acquisition       the expanded affiliated group which includes the entity has       substantial business activities in the foreign country in       which or under the law of which the entity is created or       organized when compared to the total business activities of       such expanded affiliated group. For purposes of subsection       (a)(2)(B)(iii) and the preceding sentence, the term       `substantial business activities' shall have the meaning       given such term under regulations in effect on January 18,       2017, except that the Secretary may issue regulations       increasing the threshold percent in any of the tests under       such regulations for determining if business activities       constitute substantial business activities for purposes of       this paragraph.
