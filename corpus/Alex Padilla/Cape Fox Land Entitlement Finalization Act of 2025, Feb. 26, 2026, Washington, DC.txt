Cape Fox Land Entitlement Finalization Act of 2025

I certainly understand my colleagues' frustration with how the public  lands process is currently playing out. I am glad that they are  acknowledging I, too, share that frustration. But I also can't believe  we can't create a scenario where the Senate completely cedes to the  House the ability to pick and choose which public lands bills are  allowed to be sent to the White House.

Regardless of who is in the majority, the process has historically  been both bicameral and bipartisan, and we need to get back to that.

So as I said publicly, and as I have reminded in private, my  objection to  these bills is not on the substance, and my objection is not an  objection forever. So I appreciate when my colleagues have offered to  join me in this effort to push leadership of both parties of the  committees in both Houses to convene and create that process that isn't  just going to be a fair consideration of my proposals or their  proposals but all the proposals that come from the Senate through the  Natural Resources Committee; give them a shot for consideration on the  House side and proper consideration for signature by the President of  the United States.

My colleague from Alaska, not just as a member of the Energy and  Natural Resources Committee but her leadership on the Committee of  Indian Affairs--not all public lands bills involve Indian Country, but  many, indeed, do, including some of mine that have been in the  pipeline--I appreciate her willingness to bring her authority and role  in her caucus to bear in this effort and conversation.

My colleague from the State of Nevada, not just a member of the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee but a member of the leadership  team on the Democratic side here in the Senate, I appreciate her  willingness to bring her authority and power to bear in advancing this  conversation.

So, for today, I shall not object on these two bills but reiterate my  frustration and am glad to be joined by two additional colleagues in  trying to push, again, leadership on both sides of the aisle, not just  the Senate committees but the House committees, to establish a fair way  forward for all Members and all of our proposals.
