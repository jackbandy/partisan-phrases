But as it pertains to these bills, I think we need to find a similar  bipartisan approach on the Energy and Natural Resource bills that the  Senator from Alaska is suggesting that we approve by unanimous consent.  I am more than happy and eager to sit down with my colleague and the  chair and ranking member of the committee to put together a larger  package of bills to ensure that both Republican and Democratic  priorities reach the President's desk and get signed into law.

I think, historically, we have been successful at avoiding a  piecemeal approach, instances where only one party's priorities or one  Chamber's priorities reach the President's desk and get signed into  law.

And so I look forward to continuing to work in that spirit to  continue the conversation with my colleague from Alaska to arrive at a  balanced, bipartisan package of bills and work together to advance  them. Therefore, I must object at this time.
