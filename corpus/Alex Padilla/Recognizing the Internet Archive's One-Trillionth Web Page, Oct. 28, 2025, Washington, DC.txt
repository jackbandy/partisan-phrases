Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate an  extraordinary milestone in the democratization of public information,  as the Internet Archive marks their one-trillionth web page archived.

Founded by digital librarian and MIT alumnus Brewster Kahle, the  Internet Archive first launched in San Francisco in 1996 with the goal  of providing ``Universal Access to All Knowledge'' by creating a  ``shared digital library of humanity's online history.'' In 2001, they  launched the ``Wayback Machine,'' making their archives easily  accessible to the public.

Coordinating with governments, nonprofits, institutions, and  individuals to grow their digital collection, for nearly three decades,  the Internet Archive has worked to preserve everything from academic  research to personal blogs, local news stories to international  breaking news, and troves of official government records--including the  archival of websites from every Presidential administration since 2008.  Information from its archives has even been cited by every Circuit  Court in the United States and the Supreme Court.

Working to prevent and repair broken web links, the Internet Archive  has become a modern-day, digital Library of Alexandria and given  billions of people the tools that once only professional archivists had  at their disposal.

On a personal note, earlier this year, it was my honor to help  designate the Internet Archive as a Federal depository library,  allowing the Internet Archive to digitize and expand public access to  Federal Government publications for years to come.

For their outstanding commitment to the public good and tireless  preservation of public information, today we celebrate San Francisco's  own Internet Archive. Here is to the next trillion.
