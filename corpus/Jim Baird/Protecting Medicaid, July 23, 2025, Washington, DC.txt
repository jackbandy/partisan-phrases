Protecting Medicaid

Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight how the One Big  Beautiful Bill Act will strengthen and protect Medicaid for those who  need it the most. This legislation focuses on eliminating waste, fraud,  and abuse that have historically plagued this system, ensuring that  resources are used efficiently and effectively.

Contrary to the misinformation spreading, there are roughly 1.4  million illegal immigrants who are receiving Medicaid, crowding out  benefits meant for American citizens.

What is more, this bill invests billions of dollars in long-term care  for seniors and people with disabilities by establishing a new pathway  for States to offer community-based services. This will help preserve  Medicaid for the most vulnerable populations who rely on it: pregnant  mothers, children, seniors, and individuals with disabilities and low- income families.
