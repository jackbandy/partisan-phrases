Mathematical and Statistical Modeling Education Act

Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, the Mathematical and Statistical Modeling  Education Act seeks  to improve the quality of STEM education in America. This bill will  allow us to modernize math curricula and improve K-12 science,  technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.

While this bill directs the National Science Foundation to grant  awards to educational institutions, it does not award any new funding.  As we look at reining in the out-of-control government spending and  bureaucracy, we must work with the resources we already have.

As an animal scientist, I understand the life-changing effects STEM  education can have when it comes to our livestock, creating innovative,  more effective farming techniques, our food quality, and ultimately our  Nation's well-being.

Proper STEM education has an invaluable impact on American  innovation. It equips our students--our future workforce--to tackle the  challenges of our modern digital economy. Modernizing STEM education  also has wide-ranging impacts on our national security.

The United States' ability to create cutting-edge technologies has  been vital to defeating our adversaries, especially as our adversary,  Communist China, continues to make huge investments in STEM to try and  out-compete the U.S. Beating China and maintaining our global  competitive edge begins with strengthening STEM education in K-12  schools.

That is why I am proud to co-lead this bipartisan legislation to  ensure that the United States continues to dominate when it comes to  STEM education.
