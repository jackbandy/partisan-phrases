Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.

Mr. Speaker, on July Fourth, President Trump signed the One Big  Beautiful Bill Act into law. This historic legislation delivered the  largest tax cuts to working-and middle-class Americans in U.S. history  and will revitalize rural America.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made permanent the 199A small business  tax credit, providing certainty to small businesses and ensuring Main  Street can thrive.

This legislation also saves 2 million family farms, including over  6,800 family farms in my district, from facing a death tax increase.  This will protect the generational transfer of family farms.

This bill also cuts down on the waste, fraud, and abuse in our  Federal agencies that have made it harder and more expensive for our  American people.

This bill is a win for our farmers, small businesses, and Americans  in every income bracket.
