Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Chairman, I rise to support my amendment to direct the Department  of Defense to begin evaluating pulse laser capabilities and to brief  Congress within 90 days on its feasibility against drone swarms in the  near term and missile threats in the medium term.

Drone swarms and hypersonic weapons are advancing rapidly,  overwhelming traditional defenses. Kinetic interceptors are costly, and  continuous-wave lasers require long engagement times.

Pulsed lasers offer an opportunity and a breakthrough, delivering  multi-gigawatt bursts that can neutralize drones instantly and engage  multiple targets rapidly, making defense more affordable and scalable.

Pulsed lasers have advanced rapidly in recent years, building on the  same industrial and scientific foundation as existing directed-energy  systems but with greater efficiency and lethality.

The purpose of this amendment is not to deploy this technology  immediately but to ensure the Department of Defense has a pathway to  mature, test, and integrate this promising technology.

Pulsed lasers are complementary to existing missile defense programs.  Kinetic systems remain essential for some threats, but magazine depth  and cost limit them.

Pulsed lasers provide a scaleable, lower-cost layer that extends the  effectiveness of the entire air and missile defense portfolio.

My amendment directs the U.S. Secretary of Defense to stay ahead of  the adversaries and modernize our layered defenses and assess our  potential pulse layer capabilities. I greatly appreciate the inclusion  of my amendment in the en bloc. I ask my colleagues to support my  amendment.
