Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Indiana High  School Athletic Association 3A football State champions, the Cascade  Cadets.

The Cascade High School football team triumphed over Fort Wayne Luers  with a 29-14 victory, securing the first football State championship in  the school's history.

These outstanding athletes played their hardest at Lucas Oil Stadium  on Friday. The Cascade Cadets secured a commanding lead in the first  quarter and remained dominant throughout the game, ultimately emerging  victorious.

I congratulate these outstanding student athletes on winning the  State championship, a fitting way to end their perfect season. The  students on Cascade's football team should be extraordinarily proud of  their tireless efforts and dedication. I know this win means so much to  everyone in the Clayton community who was cheering them on to victory.

Congratulations, again, to the Cascade Cadets on this historic  championship.
