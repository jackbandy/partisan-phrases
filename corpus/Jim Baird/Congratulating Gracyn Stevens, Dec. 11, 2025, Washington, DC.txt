Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Gracyn Stevens  from Kirklin, Indiana, who won the 13th annual National Cattlemen's  Beef Association National Anthem Contest. Gracyn will sing ``The Star- Spangled Banner'' at CattleCon 2026 in Nashville, Tennessee. She will  also sing before both ``Cowboys Night at the Opry'' shows at the  historic Ryman Auditorium.

Gracyn said that it was an honor to win this contest and represent an  industry that she loves and that she will strive to make a meaningful  impact on for years to come.

Gracyn Stevens says she appreciates the lessons that she learned  growing up showing cattle in 4-H. The cattle industry taught her that  true success is about the effort and passion put into each project.

I congratulate Gracyn on this outstanding achievement. I know she  will make Indiana proud at CattleCon.
