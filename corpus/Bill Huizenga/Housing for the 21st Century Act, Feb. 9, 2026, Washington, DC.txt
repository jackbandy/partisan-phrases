Housing for the 21st Century Act


Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, housing is vital in every State and in every one of our  communities. As of 2025, my home State of Michigan was short more than  141,000 homes, leaving many qualified home buyers on the sidelines.

The Housing for the 21st Century Act will help increase home  production, which to date has failed to keep pace with rising demand,  leading to more affordability challenges for all Americans.  Additionally, today's legislation rightly focuses on modernizing  housing policies while increasing affordable housing and accelerating  development.

``Affordability'' is the keyword here. I have a professional  background in construction, housing development, and home sales. My own  family has been involved for over three generations in construction.  Now, my cousins have their ready-mix concrete company, and I have our  aggregate businesses and home development.

I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, we have seen firsthand how government at  every level, local, State, and Federal, has put up barrier after  barrier to affordable housing. In fact, based on recent analysis, the  average home in Michigan costs almost double to build than what the  average family can afford.

The Housing for the 21st Century Act would help reduce Federal  barriers to building housing by expanding the Federal and local housing  systems. Now, the American people need the same level of commitment  from their State and local governments, as well.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this well-crafted,  bipartisan bill.
