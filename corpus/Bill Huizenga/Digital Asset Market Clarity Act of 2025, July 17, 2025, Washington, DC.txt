Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025


Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those remarks from the chair.

The digital asset ecosystem currently operates in a fragmented  regulatory environment that lends itself to significant challenges for  both businesses and, more importantly, investors.

The ambiguity in classifying a digital asset, either as a security or  a commodity, has led to confusion, legal uncertainty, and, ultimately,  consumer harm.

American innovation is a critical element in job creation and  economic opportunity here in the United States. Congress must look to  preserve this competitive advantage and not let it leave our shores.

By passing a comprehensive market structure framework, responsible  actors will now have greater certainty and consumers greater protection  from bad actors.

This bill establishes a regulatory framework for digital assets that  aligns with our existing financial markets while accounting for the  unique characteristics of digital assets.

Mr. Speaker, our markets are the envy of the world. American  innovation is a critical element of job creation and economic  opportunity here in the United States. Congress must not cede its  responsibility.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
