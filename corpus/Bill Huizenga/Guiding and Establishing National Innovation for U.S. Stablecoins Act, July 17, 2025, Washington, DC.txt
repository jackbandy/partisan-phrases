Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.

Mr. Speaker, today is a good day for innovation. It is a good day for  free markets, entrepreneurs, and consumer choice. It is a good day for  American digital leadership.

Mr. Speaker, after years of debate and, frankly, as I was chair of  the Capital Markets Subcommittee in 2017 and 2018 and held hearings on  cryptoassets, Congress has finally recognized the unique nature of  stablecoin products.

Under this bill, we established a regulatory framework that targets  the activity, not the technology. After years of indecision, Americans  finally have an administration that is ready to embrace those products.  The time to reassert American leadership in the digital asset space is  now.

The GENIUS Act acknowledges that stablecoins can address  inefficiencies in the U.S. payment system. It acknowledges that  maintaining the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency should  always be at the forefront of any decision that we have. It  acknowledges that the private sector must lead the way, fostering  innovation and competition.

Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me  additional time.

Mr. Speaker, obviously, at the end of this, finally, it acknowledges  that a clear regulatory framework led by the United States is needed to  usher in this modern technology.

Mr. Speaker, we are at an inflection point. When it comes to digital  assets, I urge my colleagues to seize this moment by supporting this  important legislation.
