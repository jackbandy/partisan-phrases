Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, a parliamentary inquiry.

Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, this is National Police Week pursuant to  Public Law 87-726, enacted on October 1, 1962, National Police Week  here in the United States Congress, where Congress honors the courage,  the bravery, the service, the sacrifice, and the heroism of members of  law enforcement. Is that correct?

Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, a further parliamentary inquiry.

Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, do the House rules require compliance with  the 2022 Public Law 117-103, signed by the President at the time, that  requires a plaque listing the names of all police officers who defended  the Capitol on January 6 to be placed on the western front of the  Capitol Building?

Do the House rules require compliance with that public law?

Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, a further parliamentary inquiry.

Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, we appear to be in violation of the House  rules, given that the law that was passed in 2022 required that a  plaque honoring those heroic police officers be placed on the western  front of the Capitol Building no later than March 15, 2023, but 791  days have passed, and this Republican Congress has refused to comply  with the law.

It is time to honor those heroic officers. It is unconscionable. It  is unpatriotic. It is unfathomable. It is unacceptable. It is un- American. You need to honor those officers and treat them with the  dignity and respect that they deserve.
