Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2 of rule XV, I call up  the motion to discharge previously noticed.

Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call up a bipartisan  motion to discharge legislation to extend the Affordable Care Act tax  credits to make sure that tens of millions of everyday Americans do not  experience dramatically increased premiums, copays, and deductibles  that will prevent them from being able to go see a doctor when they  need one.

I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on this bipartisan motion so that we  can take a meaningful step forward in this Congress to address the  healthcare crisis in the United States of America.

Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity in this Congress in  a bipartisan way to address the healthcare crisis in this country and  to make sure that tens of millions of people have the ability to go see  a doctor when they need one in this great country of ours.

We have an affordability crisis in the United States of America. We  know that healthcare costs are out of control, housing costs are out of  control, and grocery costs are out of control. There is an  affordability crisis that needs to be addressed decisively, and we have  an ability to take meaningful action today. Vote ``yes'' on advancing  this motion to discharge.

Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.

Mr. JEFFRIES.
