Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act

Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, after 15 years of talk, House Republicans  have finally brought their healthcare bill to the floor, yet it fails  working families. Despite its name, it does nothing to lower costs.

Republicans found time to lock in tax breaks for big corporations and  billionaires but not the urgency or respect to help Americans afford  their healthcare.

House Democrats are 100 percent united, and now four Republicans,  after months of delay, have finally chosen to join us to extend the  advanced premium tax credits.

That is why it is time for the Speaker to bring the House Democrats'  bipartisan discharge petition to the floor immediately.

Every Member must make a choice. Stand with the working men and women  of this country and small businesses or Donald Trump.

Vote ``no'' on this sham of a bill. Vote ``yes'' on the Jeffries  discharge petition.
