Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, President Trump loves tariffs. He calls  them beautiful. He says they protect American workers, but here is the  cold, hard truth: The American people are paying them.

Just today, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office confirmed  what families already feel--American consumers are paying 95 percent of  these tariffs. They pay at the grocery store. They pay in higher energy  bills. They pay when small businesses shut their doors.

These blanket tariffs on Canada are a slap in the face to one of our  closest trading allies. Canada is Nevada's top international visitor.  Tourism in Las Vegas is already down 7.5 percent. Nationwide, Canadian  travel is down 23 percent, a $4 billion hit to our economy.

Today, though, thanks to Congressman Meeks, House Democrats, and  Republicans who are willing to stand up, Congress can take back its  power. We can give the American people real relief today. The families  sitting around their kitchen tables tonight deserve a government that  will lower their costs and that will end these Trump tariff taxes.

Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to vote ``yes'' on this resolution.
