Breaking the Gridlock Act

Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about being on the right  side of history. I have taken the time to listen directly to the people  of Nevada's Fourth District and all across my great State. They have  shared their stories, their concerns, and their fears about their  healthcare.

I am talking about people like Richard and his wife who have worked  to do everything right. They budgeted. They made sacrifices. Yet,  today, they are paying $1,200 a month for health insurance, up from  $280 a month just a month ago because vital healthcare lifelines were  allowed to expire.

Richard told me that they can identify places to make cuts in their  lives, but what worries him is what they will be forced to give up.  That includes fewer groceries, fewer essentials, and fewer visits with  family.

Mr. Speaker, I get it. Some in this Chamber want to make this about  politics. The reality is this is life and death. It is life and death  for the 15 million Americans who are at risk of losing healthcare,  while Republicans found the time and the money to give tax cuts to  billionaires but no time to give relief to middle-class families.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Leader Jeffries and Democrats. I call on my  Republican colleagues to join us, and let's be on the right side of  history.
