Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 618. I  thank Ms. Hoyle, the floor manager for the committee as well as the  chairman, for the courtesy.

In 1989, Congress enacted the Apex Project, Nevada Land Transfer and  Authorization Act, directing the sale of 21,000 acres of Federal land  to Clark County for the establishment of the Apex Industrial Area.

This law permits only the Bureau of Land Management and Clark County  to issue utility and transportation rights-of-way.

Originally, Clark County had this authorization in order to make the  permitting process shorter. In recent years, however, the city of North  Las Vegas and the Apex Industrial Owners Association primarily manage  the site, not Clark County.

The result is that this law has had the opposite effect and leads to  a longer permitting process for businesses that need to construct  sewer, gas, and power, as well as broadband infrastructure.

Amending the Apex Project, Nevada Land Transfer and Authorization Act  to include the city of North Las Vegas and the Apex Area Industrial  Owners Association as permittees would allow the original congressional  intent of expediting the permitting process to be fulfilled.

H.R. 618 is an extremely simple fix to a complex problem that plagues  Apex and causes major slowdowns at the Southern Nevada Bureau of Land  Management and stifles economic growth in the county.

I thank Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member Jared Huffman as well as  Representative Hoyle and the rest of the Natural Resources Committee  for allowing this measure to pass through committee and to come to the  floor.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members support this legislation on  economic development, expediting the permitting process, and ensuring  that the lands in our community are decided by the residents who use  them.
