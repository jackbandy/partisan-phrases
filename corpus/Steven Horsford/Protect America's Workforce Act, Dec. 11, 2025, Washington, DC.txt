Protect America's Workforce Act

Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, despite repeatedly claiming to be the most  pro-worker President and administration in history, since taking  office, President Trump took action earlier this year that stripped  collective bargaining rights from nearly 1 million Federal employees.

These workers are the backbone of our Nation, from nurses caring for  veterans, law enforcement officers keeping our communities safe,  teachers educating the next generation, and countless others who ensure  America runs every day.

That is why I was proud to cosponsor the Protect America's Workforce  Act  alongside my Congressional Labor Caucus co-chairs and our over 120  members to counter what is arguably the largest act of union busting in  American history.

I urge every Member of this Chamber to join the Congressional Labor  Caucus in supporting this crucial legislation. Let's stand with Federal  workers in restoring their union rights against these unprecedented  attacks on their livelihoods. I urge adoption.
