Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, for more than a year now, working Members  and families have been forced to pay the price for Donald Trump's  illegal tariffs. Let's call them what they are. Blanket tariffs are  blanket taxes. They are taxes that the American people have paid.

What did Donald Trump tax when he imposed these sweeping, unlawful  tariffs?

He taxed your groceries. He taxed your baby formula and your  strollers. He taxed the inventory sitting on the shelves of small  businesses that are just trying to survive.

In my home State of Nevada, families have paid nearly $1,800 more in  the last year because of these unlawful taxes. That is a rent payment,  childcare, a car repair, and it is groceries for families that are  already struggling to get by.

My district has seen the real-world consequences. A neighborhood  cupcake shop, a local brewery, coffee roasters who built their dream  from the ground up were all forced to shutter their doors this past  year directly because their costs have skyrocketed and their customers  can no longer afford these high prices.

Now the Supreme Court has spoken. The emergency authority used to  justify these tariffs--taxes that Americans have paid--did not  authorize this mess. In simple terms: This administration did not have  the power to do it, and yet, they did. Billions of dollars were  illegally taken--in my view, stolen--from the American people.

Now what are my Republican colleagues proposing? They are proposing a  bill on appliances. They want you, the small business owner, the  working parent, they want you to have to hire a lawyer or to sue the  Federal Government to get your own money back. Donald Trump himself  said that you may have to litigate this for 5 years. Mr. Speaker, 5  years? That is not relief. That is a bureaucratic maze. It is a rigged  system designed to exhaust you, to outlast you, and to ensure that the  little guy never sees a dime.

Well, we have a solution. My bill, the RELIEF Act, does something  radical in Washington. It makes the government fix its own mistake. It  requires automatic refunds of all tariff payments from the last year  within 90 days--no application, no protest process, no lawyer required.  If the government took it illegally, the government must give it back,  period.

To the businesses that received those refunds, it is time to bring  prices down for working people and families who have stood by you and  who kept you afloat.

Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, if Republicans block this vote, they are  voting to keep your money. They are telling Main Street America: Take  us to court. They are choosing delay over relief and politics over  people.

Tonight, the President will stand in this very Chamber and try to  sell the American people on his economy. Working families don't need a  sales pitch; they need relief. They need honesty. They need their money  back--no more excuses, no more delays, and no more courtroom battles.

Let us return what was taken. Let us stand with small businesses. Let  us stand with the working families.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and  to support the RELIEF Act.

They vote to keep life unaffordable. This is a rigged system.

Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, the President has disregard and disrespect  for the American people when the Supreme Court told him that his  actions were illegal, they were unconstitutional, and it is time to  give the American people their money back, to give them relief--not  disrespect, not disregard, but their money back.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and  to support my bill, the RELIEF Act. If they vote ``yes'' and deny me  the ability to bring forward the RELIEF Act, they are keeping your life  more unaffordable.
