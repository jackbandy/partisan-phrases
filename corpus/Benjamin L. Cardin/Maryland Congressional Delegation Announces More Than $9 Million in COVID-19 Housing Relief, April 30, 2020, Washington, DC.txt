Maryland Congressional Delegation Announces More Than $9 Million in COVID-19 Housing Relief


Congressman Steny H. Hoyer (MD-05) and the full Maryland Congressional Delegation, including Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Congressmen Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin, and David Trone, today announced $9,043,232 in COVID-19 relief for tenant-based housing voucher recipients in Maryland through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Funding comes from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) Act, which provided $1.25 billion nationwide for Tenant-Based Rental Assistance to support the Housing Choice Voucher program, including:

$400 million for increased subsidy costs, which are paid directly to landlords; and$850 million for administrative and other expenses incurred by public housing authorities (PHAs), including activities to support or maintain the health and safety of assisted individuals and families, and costs related to retention and support of participating owners."The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant financial hardships for Americans -- especially those in our most vulnerable communities," the Delegation said. "These new federal funds will help low-income Marylanders keep a roof over their heads at a time when they may be facing job losses and reduced income. Our delegation will continue to work together to ensure that federal assistance makes its way to the people who need it most."

Tenant-based vouchers increase affordable housing choices for low-income families, allowing them to choose and lease safe, decent, and affordable rental housing. See here for more information about tenant-based vouchers.

In addition to supporting local public housing authorities, this new federal funding will also go to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD). Full details of the awards for Maryland may be found below:
