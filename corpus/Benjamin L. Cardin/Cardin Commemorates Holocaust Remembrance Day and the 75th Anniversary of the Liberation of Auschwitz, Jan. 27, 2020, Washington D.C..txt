Cardin Commemorates Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 75th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz


U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, and Ranking Member of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, made the following statement on International Holocaust Commemoration Day which also commemorates the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.

"On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we come together to solemnly remember the horrors of the Holocaust and the six million Jews who perished. We also remember the lives of millions of other innocent individuals killed - Poles, Soviets, Romani, Serbs, Afro-Germans, Jehovah's Witnesses, gay men and women, people with disabilities. Today, we honor their legacy and the strength of all those who survived.

"This day marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland where 1.1 million perished in unspeakable violence. The crimes against humanity perpetrated at Auschwitz were the most notorious of the murders and other atrocities committed in death camps and killing fields across Europe. We must do everything in our power to safeguard this history in our collective memory and work to ensure they are never repeated.  Especially as we lose more and more of the few survivors, it is our charge to continue to honor them and those who perished by sharing their stories, by pushing back against all forms of anti-Semitism and racism, and by ensuring the truth about this dark chapter in human history is not erased. And, with the knowledge of the Holocaust front and center, we also must work to make certain that modern-day genocides are stopped and future crimes against humanity are prevented. "Never forget' is a promise to their memory and a commitment to preserving peace and humanity for generations to come."
