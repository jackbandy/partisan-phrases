Cardin Statement on Arrests in the Murder of Ahmaud Arbery


U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly, released the following statement after the arrest of two white men in the death of Ahmaud Arbery. 

"Arresting Ahmaud Arbery's killers is the right thing to do. What's wrong is that it took 74 days to do it; that it took public outcry and a painful viral video to hold his killers accountable. It is wholly unacceptable that in the United States of America in 2020 that an African American man cannot go jogging without losing his life.

"Condolences must be backed up with action. Nationally, we need to end racial profiling and address the inequities and lack of trust in our criminal justice system. It has been heartbreaking to see yet another family gripped by tragedy as result of racial profiling in America.  In Congress and in our communities, we must continue to confront the flaws in the foundation of our society and justice system that continue to break against people of color. Until we address these flaws at their core, justice will be far from served."
