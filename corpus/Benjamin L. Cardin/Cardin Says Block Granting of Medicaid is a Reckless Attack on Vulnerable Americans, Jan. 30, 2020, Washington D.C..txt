Cardin Says Block Granting of Medicaid is a Reckless Attack on Vulnerable Americans


U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Finance Health Care Subcommittee, released the following statement on the announcement that the Trump Administration plans to limit Medicaid spending by converting its funding into block grants.

"This guidance represents the latest, most egregious move in the Trump Administration's campaign to slash social safety nets and jeopardize the health of our most vulnerable communities. Turning Medicaid into a limited block grant will give states unprecedented license to cut benefits, eligibility, and provider payments for the 70 million low-income and disabled Americans who rely on this life-saving program. Such a reckless attack on health coverage for vulnerable Americans is unacceptable.  Families across the country already successfully raised their voices to stop Republicans' attempts in Congress to block grant Medicaid. Now we must come together once more to protect every American's right to quality health care."
