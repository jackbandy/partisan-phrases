Cardin: De-escalation and Diplomacy Are in Our National Security Interest


U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a co-author of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, issued the following statement on President Donald Trump's speech to the nation regarding Iran.

"The president's words today provide an opening toward de-escalation of the dangerous back-and-forth with Iran. Unfortunately, it has been President Trump's actions over the last three years that put us in the current precarious state. My hope is that the opening made toward diplomacy today will take root, and we can set aside the blustery speeches and tweets on both sides to muster back together a coalition focused on peacefully ending Iran's nuclear ambitions and terrorist activities. De-escalation and diplomacy are in our national security interest and will make the American people and our troops, as well as the people of the Middle East safer."
