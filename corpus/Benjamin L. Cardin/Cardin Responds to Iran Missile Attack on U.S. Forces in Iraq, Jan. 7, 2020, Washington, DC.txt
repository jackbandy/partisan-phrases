Cardin Responds to Iran Missile Attack on U.S. Forces in Iraq


U.S Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) released the following statement in response to Iranian authorized missile strikes targeting U.S. forces in bases in Iraq. The attacks were issued in retaliation for the Trump-ordered killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani last week.

"The enmity between the US and Iran is becoming more dangerous by the minute. In the wake of the reported attacks on US forces in Iraq, President Trump must ensure any response minimizes the risk of further escalation. The American people do not want war with Iran. 

"My prayers tonight are with our service members and their families who sacrifice and worry so much every day their loved ones are in harm's way. De-escalation and diplomacy are the only way this conflict will end."
