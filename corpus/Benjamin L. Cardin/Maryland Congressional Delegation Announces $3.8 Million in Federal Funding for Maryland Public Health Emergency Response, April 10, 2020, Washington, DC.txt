Maryland Congressional Delegation Announces $3.8 Million in Federal Funding for Maryland Public Health Emergency Response


The full Maryland congressional delegation, including U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone, today announced the award of $3,808,516 for the Maryland Public Health Crisis Response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). This funding is awarded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) Program.  

"The current crisis is first and foremost a public health emergency. This federal funding will enable the response measures needed to limit the spread and mitigate the damage of COVID-19," said the lawmakers. "We will continue to work closely with Governor Hogan to protect the health of all Marylanders."  

Funds can be used to carry out surveillance, epidemiology, lab capacity, infection control, mitigation, communications, and other preparedness and response activities. The Maryland Department of Health will allocate funding to qualified local health departments across the state. 

Maryland is expected to receive additional funding through PHEP. The funding is provided through the CARES Act, which has also provided $15.6 million for community health centers announced Wednesday and $48 million to Maryland local governments announced by the delegation last week. Separately, the delegation has announced a total of $17.1 million in CDC funding through the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act to support the Maryland health system.
