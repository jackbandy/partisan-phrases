Cardin Tells Pompeo to Stop Using Term "Wuhan Virus"


U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly, is urging Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to stop the official use of the term "Wuhan Virus." The Department of State and the Secretary have repeatedly used the term, which has stoked xenophobic fear in the United States and globally.

"The tone you and your senior staff set for the men and women of the State Department is crucial; U.S. diplomatic credibility abroad must not be compromised by the irresponsible use of the term "Wuhan Virus.' Â…  Calling COVID-19 the "Wuhan Virus' or "Chinese Virus' nurtures this sense of fear and panic, and sows division at the moment where diplomacy and goodwill are most vital," wrote Senator Cardin. "I ask that you and your staff please be mindful of using -- both in verbal and written communication -- only the recognized names for COVID-19 and the virus that causes the disease."
