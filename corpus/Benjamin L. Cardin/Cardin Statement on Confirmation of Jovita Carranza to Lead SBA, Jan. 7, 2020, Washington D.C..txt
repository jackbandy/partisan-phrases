Cardin Statement on Confirmation of Jovita Carranza to Lead SBA


Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship Ranking Member Ben Cardin (D-Md.) today issued the following statement after the U.S. Senate voted 88-5 to confirm U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza as the Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA):

"Opening a business is one of the most rewarding endeavors a person can undertake, but it is also one of the most difficult, especially for entrepreneurs from underserved communities. As more women, minorities, veterans and other underserved entrepreneurs begin to open small businesses, SBA must have bold leadership and innovative thinking to help them overcome the specific, historical barriers they face on the path to business ownership. Treasurer Carranza's decades of experience in business and government will be an asset to SBA as it seeks to better meet the needs of America's entrepreneurs. I look forward to working with her to ensure that any American who wants to start a business has access to the tools and resources they need to be successful. Small businesses in America create jobs and we must support their growth in every way possible."
