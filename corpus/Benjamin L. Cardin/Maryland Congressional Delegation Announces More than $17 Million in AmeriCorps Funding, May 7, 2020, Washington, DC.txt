Raskin and David Trone (all Md.) announced that Maryland received an award of $17,133,477 in state and national AmeriCorps funding. The award comes from the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), the federal agency responsible for AmeriCorps, and will place more than 1,200 AmeriCorps volunteers into 10 organizations across Maryland.

"For more than 25 years, AmeriCorps volunteers have been doing crucial work in Maryland and around the country. They volunteer to help the homeless, aid those struggling with addiction, teach in our public schools, and more -- all with the tireless work ethic that comes with their commitment to national service. And now, as we battle the COVID-19 pandemic, these funds will ensure they can continue their efforts on behalf of Marylanders. We look forward to supporting this vital program for years to come," said the Lawmakers.
