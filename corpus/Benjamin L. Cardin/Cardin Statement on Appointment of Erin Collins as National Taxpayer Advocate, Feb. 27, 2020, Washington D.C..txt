Cardin Statement on Appointment of Erin Collins as National Taxpayer Advocate


U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, today issued the following statement on the appointment of Erin Collins to be National Taxpayer Advocate:

"The National Taxpayer Advocate is one of the most important positions within the administration--from helping guide tax policy so that it benefits taxpayers, to advocating on behalf of taxpayers within the IRS.  

"I welcome the appointment of Erin Collins to be the National Taxpayer Advocate and look forward to meeting with her to discuss her vision for representing low- and middle-income taxpayers. I also look forward to discussing the challenges that she will be undertaking in this role, including implementation of the Taxpayer First Act, issues arising from the current tax filing season, and efforts to ensure that IRS can better serve the needs of taxpayers. 

"Congress created the National Taxpayer Advocate to serve as a strong, independent voice in the administration who answers only to the American taxpayers and Congress, and my hope is that Ms. Collins will continue this tradition. The American people deserve nothing less."

The National Taxpayer Advocate position was created as part of the Portman-Cardin Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998.
