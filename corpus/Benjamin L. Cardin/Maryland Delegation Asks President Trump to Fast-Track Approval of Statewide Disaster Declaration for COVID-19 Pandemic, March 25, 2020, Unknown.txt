Maryland Delegation Asks President Trump to Fast-Track Approval of Statewide Disaster Declaration for COVID-19 Pandemic


The full Maryland congressional delegation, including U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone, is urging President Donald Trump to swiftly approve Governor Larry Hogan's request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of Maryland as a result of the impacts of the novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). Team Maryland has been working closely with state officials to deliver critical federal resources for Marylanders during this public health crisis. Yesterday, the delegation asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide needed support to utilize the Maryland Convention Center as a temporary federal medical station, adding 300 beds and 1096 ventilators to Maryland's available resources.

White House approval of a statewide disaster declaration is necessary to assure Maryland's eligibility for emergency funding reimbursed through FEMA under the Stafford Act.
