Cardin Says Strengthening the ACA Is More Crucial Than Ever


U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) released the following statement in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted on March 23, 2010. 

"Ten years ago, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law, reinforcing the truth that quality health care is a human right for all. In those 10 years, coverage for preexisting conditions, the Medicaid expansion, and essential health benefits have helped close gaps in health disparities and ensure that millions of Americans regardless of income, medical history, gender, and ethnicity have access to quality, life-saving care. 

"Since then, we have been engaged in a battle to preserve the ACA from an administration and Republican Congress that is extremely hostile to it. Efforts to sabotage the bill - from legislation aimed at weakening its protections to executive orders to expand inadequate junk plans, to the ongoing Texas v. US lawsuit backed by the Trump Administration - threaten care for millions of Americans including 130 million individuals with preexisting conditions. 

"In Maryland, we've enjoyed aggressive enrollment and strong bipartisan leadership from the state to the federal level to make it easier for Marylanders to participate despite the administration's attacks. Especially now, amid a national health emergency to address the COVID-19 outbreak, strengthening the ACA is more crucial than ever. We will continue to fight to do everything we can to preserve, to expand and to build on this monumental legislation to keep our citizens healthy and safe."
