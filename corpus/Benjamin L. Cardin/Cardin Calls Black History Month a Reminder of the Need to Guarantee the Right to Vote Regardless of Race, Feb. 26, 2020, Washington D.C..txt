Cardin Calls Black History Month a Reminder of the Need to Guarantee the Right to Vote Regardless of Race


U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), issued the following statement to commemorate Black History Month 2020.

"Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy, yet for much of our nation's history, black men and women were denied this right and, once recognized, faced brutal obstacles to exercise it. Black History Month is an opportunity to recognize the legacy of the men and women in Maryland and the US, who marched and organized to lay the groundwork for progress during the Civil Rights Movement -- and those who are working still to hold our nation accountable to the freedoms and rights guaranteed to all. 

"When we exclude people from fully participating in our democracy, we prevent them from achieving the social, economic, and civic reforms they need to strengthen their families and communities. Until we guarantee the right to vote regardless of race, we fall short of the unique promise and potential of the United States of America. Black History Month is a reminder of the progress achieved and the promises of equality we must continue to fulfill to form a more perfect union."
