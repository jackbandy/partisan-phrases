Maryland Congressional Delegation Announces more than $15.6 Million in Federal Funding for Community Health Centers


The full Maryland congressional delegation, including U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone, today announced $15,635,030 to support Maryland's community health centers in responding to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Funding comes through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). "Community health centers have a critical role to play in Maryland's response to the COVID-19 crisis. Team Maryland is united in our effort to provide communities across our state with the essential resources they need right now," said the delegation. "This federal funding will help local health providers adapt to unprecedented demands and challenges as they provide quality, affordable health care services for individuals and families from the most rural parts of our state to the most urban." These awards come through the CARES Act, which also provided $48 million to Maryland local governments as announced by the delegation last week. On Monday, the delegation separately announced new federal funding for the Maryland health system through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), bringing the total through that source to $17.1 million. That funding comes through the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act.
