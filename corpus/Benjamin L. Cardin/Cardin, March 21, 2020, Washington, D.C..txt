Cardin, Colleagues Urge Trump to Introduce UN Security Council Resolution to Fight Spread of Coronavirus, Prevent Future Pandemics


To fight the global spread of the novel coronavirus and prevent future outbreaks, U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined colleagues in calling on President Donald Trump to introduce a United Nations (UN) Security Council resolution that declares pandemics a clear threat to international peace and security and call for action on the resolution as soon as the Security Council reconvenes. The Senators add that a Security Council Resolution should include "binding commitments for UN-member nations to align their health preparedness frameworks with best international practices and reiterate the responsibility states have to protect the health of stateless refugees and those who face extreme humanitarian need."

For more than seven decades, the U.S. has rallied the world to combat threats through its position on the United Nations Security Council -- from countering the rise in global extremism to preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Senator Markey and his colleagues argue that the indiscriminate nature of global pandemics should spur the Trump administration to continue America's leadership in times of global emergency and not to engage in inward-facing xenophobia. 

"Your Administration still has an opportunity to be a global leader in the fight against COVID-19," write the Senators in their letter to President Trump. "It is only through U.S.-led global action that we will overcome this challenge and be better positioned to face the inevitable and indiscriminate global health emergency of tomorrow. The United States must lead the Security Council in the adoption of measures that can save countless lives and limit instability, to the benefit of all nations."
