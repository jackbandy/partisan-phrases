Maryland Delegation Members Announce $876 Million in Federal Funding to Support WMATA During COVID-19 Crisis


Congressman Steny H. Hoyer (MD-05), Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, and Congressmen John P. Sarbanes, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin, and David Trone announced that the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and local transit partners will receive $876 million in federal funding through the CARES Act. Of that total, $41.1 million will be distributed to Montgomery and Prince George's County local transit providers.

"Metro is an essential service, central to the success of our region and a safe reopening. While ridership and revenues have decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, we must ensure that our national transit system -- and the employees who keep it running -- are able to weather this storm. From delivering essential workers to the front lines of this crisis, to allowing our federal employees and others to safely return to work after we reopen, we were proud to fight for these much-needed funds to support WMATA's continued operations and the safety of its workers," said the Members.

Congressional Democrats fought to provide $25 billion through the CARES Act to help support transit agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding, awarded through the Federal Transit Administration, will help WMATA maintain a balanced budget while providing the resources necessary to safely scale up operations as the region looks towards a safe, gradual reopening. Funds will be used towards safety precautions including personal protective equipment for employees, the implementation of disinfectant and cleaning measures, and additional expenses from modified work schedules.
