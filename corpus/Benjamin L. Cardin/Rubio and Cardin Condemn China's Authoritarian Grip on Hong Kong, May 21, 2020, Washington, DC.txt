Rubio and Cardin Condemn China's Authoritarian Grip on Hong Kong


U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Ben Cardin (D-MD), Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively, of the Senate Foreign Relations' Subcommittee that oversees human rights and democracy, and authors of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (P.L. 116--76) issued the following statements as Chinese lawmakers are expected to propose a national security law in Hong Kong: 

"By proposing national security laws for Hong Kong, the Chinese government and Communist Party will push Hong Kong's autonomy to the breaking point," Rubio said. "Congress provided the U.S. government with powerful tools when it passed my bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, and the administration should use this law to hold Beijing accountable for its interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs and violations of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. It is in the interest of the United States to respond swiftly to Beijing's repeated attacks on Hong Kongers, their autonomy, and their basic rights." 

"China's plan to circumvent Hong Kong's independent legal system with a far reaching, oppressive national security law is dangerous and in complete disregard of the principles of the "one country, two systems," said Senator Cardin. "Hong Kong's citizens are entitled to stand up for their freedoms, democracy, and basic human rights. As one of the lead authors of the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, I have been proud to voice our solidarity with the people of Hong Kong. The Trump administration must use the authorities granted to them through this legislation and to support the legitimate aspirations of the people of Hong Kong."
