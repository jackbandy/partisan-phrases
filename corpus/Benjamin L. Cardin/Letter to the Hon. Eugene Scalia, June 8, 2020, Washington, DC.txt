Letter to the Hon. Eugene Scalia, Secretary of Labor - Cortez Masto Urges Administration to Improve Gig Workers' Access to Unemployment Benefits


Dear Secretary Scalia:When Congress enacted the CARES Act, it created a new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance(PUA) program for workers who otherwise fell through the cracks of our existing safety nets.Specifically, PUA was intended to expand unemployment coverage to workers who otherwisecannot access regular state unemployment insurance (UI).We are deeply concerned with the reports of confusion and difficulty that misclassified workers,many of whom already are eligible under law and should be receiving regular state UI asemployees, are being processed presumptively for the federal PUA program, with only bareconsideration--if any at all--for regular unemployment.Across the country, in states like Nevada, Ohio, and many other states, millions of peopleemployed in the so-called "gig economy" have been out of work. Because their employers haveimproperly classified them as independent contractors rather than employees, app-based workershave long faced challenges in accessing regular UI. Meanwhile, the companies that hire themavoid their obligations, such as paying into much-needed state UI trust funds. These workers areemployees and should have benefits as such, and their employers need to meet the obligationsshared by all employers.In passing the CARES Act, Congress intended to provide emergency benefits for the manyindividuals out of work who are excluded from traditional unemployment coverage during thepandemic. Congress did not intend to supplant states' own laws and court decisions, cementingbusiness practices that have been determined unlawful.Further, by creating a federal PUA program that supplements the existing UI system, Congressdid not intend to permit employers to inappropriately push their employees to PUA, absolvingemployers of their obligation to pay into much-needed state trust funds during an unprecedentedcrisis when states need to ensure they are fully and fairly resourced.When employers skip out on paying their fair share, the public must make up the difference.Federal, state, and local governments suffer hefty losses of revenue due to independentcontractor misclassification, in the form of unpaid and uncollectible income taxes, payroll taxes,and unemployment insurance and workers' compensation premiums. A 2009 report by theGovernment Accountability Office estimates independent contractor misclassification costfederal revenues $2.72 billion in 2006. According to a 2009 report by the Treasury InspectorGeneral for Tax Administration, misclassification contributed to a $54 billion underreporting ofemployment tax and losses of $15 billion in unpaid FICA taxes and UI taxes.The availability of PUA during an unprecedented crisis is supposed to be a lifeline for truly selfemployed individuals who cannot otherwise access unemployment assistance. It should not be apathway for low road companies to undercut honest businesses, eroding competition in a fairmarket. Employers that correctly classify workers as W-2 employees often are unable to competewith lower-bidding companies that reap the benefits of artificially low labor costs.Misclassification, as the Treasury Inspector General found, "plac[es] honest employers andbusinesses at a competitive disadvantage."Misclassification, especially when pervasive in an industry, skews markets and can driveresponsible employers out of business. Law-abiding employers also suffer from inflatedunemployment insurance and workers' compensation costs, as "free riding" employers thatmisclassify employees as independent contractors pass off costs to employers that play by therules. A 2010 study estimated that misclassifying employers shifts $831.4 million inunemployment insurance taxes and $2.54 billion in workers' compensation premiums to lawabiding businesses annually.While PUA was meant to be an emergency benefit to meet the unprecedented crisis of themoment, we are concerned that dishonest businesses will use the program as a tool to enshrinetheir workers' misclassification and skew markets against fair competition.It is essential that the Department properly administer the PUA program to fulfill Congressionalintent to support workers who "otherwise would not qualify for regular unemployment orextended benefits under State or Federal law[.]" Many workers, in spite of their misclassificationas contractors by their employer, already do qualify as employees for regular unemploymentbenefits.The Department should immediately issue clarifying guidance that the determination whetherapp-based workers are eligible for regular unemployment benefits is a state-by-statedetermination. While ride-hail drivers and other "platform" workers are statutorily classified asindependent contractors in some states, it remains critical that state agencies apply their statelaws to determine app-based workers' eligibility for regular UI.The urgent nature of this crisis demands swift action from the DOL. To that end, we request thatthe Department issue guidance that clarifies that: While some "gig economy workers" may only be eligible for PUA, many workers aremisclassified and in some cases already are employees under state law, and that agenciesshould process app-based workers by applying their state's existing laws to determine ifthey are employees eligible for regular unemployment compensation, rather thanpresumptively processing them for PUA; At the same time, state agencies should make it as convenient and quick for eligibleworkers to receive regular UI benefits as it is to receive PUA benefits, including byacceptance of workers' proof of earnings where wage records are not in the system andthe employer fails to provide them; A determination that a worker is eligible for PUA has no bearing on the question ofwhether that worker is an employee under any state or federal law; As state agencies perform required quarterly reviews that individuals receiving PUA areineligible for regular UI and PEUC, the agencies transfer any workers who aremisclassified to regular UI; State agencies should audit companies for which there is a demonstrated pattern of nonW-2 workers who have been found eligible for UI as employees.We appreciate your timely attention to this important issue for workers and states. We eagerlyawait your response.
