Impeachment


   Donald Trump held taxpayer-funded military aid       hostage from an ally at war while demanding a personal,       political favor. He tried to cheat, got caught, and worked       hard to cover it up. His actions constitute a shocking,       corrupt abuse of power and betrayal of his oath of office.       Just as a sheriff cannot delay responding to calls for help       until the callers endorse his re-election, the President is       not entitled to withhold vital military assistance from a       foreign ally until they announce an investigation to smear       his political rival. The proof shows precisely the type of       corruption that the Framers sought to prevent through the       Impeachment Clause, including foreign interference in our       election. 

       Two further points are significant. First, the President is       guilty of the crime of bribery, which is specifically listed       in the Constitution as a grounds for impeachment.\1\ Second,       the President's unprecedented campaign to obstruct the       impeachment inquiry compels us to conclude that the evidence       he is hiding would provide further proof of his guilt.      I. The President committed the federal crime of bribery 

       There is no question--based on the original meaning of the       Constitution, the elaboration of the impeachment clause in       the Federalist Papers, historical precedent, and common       sense--that the President need not violate a provision of any       criminal code in order to warrant removal from office.\2\ The       President's argument that he must violate ``established law''       to be impeached would be laughable if its implications were       not so dangerous. 

       But there is no reasonable doubt that the President has       violated established law. The Constitution specifically       states that a President who commits bribery should be       impeached.\3\ The evidence before us establishes that       President Trump has committed the crime of bribery as it       existed at the time of the framers and now. Therefore, even       using the President's own standard, the Senate has no choice       but to convict. 

       The evidence shows that the President solicited       interference in the 2020 election for his own benefit by       pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation into his       political opponents in return for releasing nearly $400       million in taxpayer-funded military aid Ukraine desperately       needed, as well as a meeting with President Zelensky at the       White House. He sought, indeed demanded, a personal benefit       in exchange for an official act. 

       Section 201 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code criminalizes       ``bribery of public officials and witnesses.'' A public       official is guilty under this section when they seek       ``anything of value'' in exchange for any ``official act''       and do so with corrupt intent. The code even specifies that       punishment for this crime may include disqualification ``from       holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the       United States.'' \4\       A. The requested investigations constitute ``things of value''  

       The investigations that President Trump requested into his       political enemies and to undermine claims that Russia       illegally helped him get elected are clearly ``things of       value.'' \5\ By all accounts, he was obsessed with them.       According to multiple reports, Trump cared more about the       investigations than he did about defending Ukraine from       Russia. Ambassador Gordon Sondland even testified that the       President ``doesn't give a s**t'' about Ukraine and only       cares about ``big stuff'' like the announcement of the       investigations he requested.\6\ 

       Courts have consistently applied a broad and subjective       understanding of the phrase ``anything of value.'' All that       matters is that the bribe had value in the eyes of the       official accepting or soliciting it. The Second Circuit has       determined that ``anything of value'' includes stock that,       although it had no commercial value at the time, had       subjective value to the defendant.\7\ Similarly, the Sixth       Circuit held that loans that a public official would have       been otherwise unable to receive were ``thing[s] of value.''       \8\ The Eighth Circuit has similarly emphasized that       ``anything of value'' should be interpreted ``broadly'' and       ``subjectively.'' \9\ 

       Further, the ``thing'' need not be tangible, and it need       not be immediately available. For example, the Sixth Circuit       held that a promise of ``future employment'' is a thing of       value.\10\ A D.C. district court found that travel and       entrance to various events that Tyson Foods gave to the       Agriculture Secretary's girlfriend counted as things of       value, despite the fact that they were not given directly to       the Secretary and were not tangible items.\11\ Campaign       contributions also count as ``things of value,'' even       contributions made to Super PACs, despite Supreme Court       precedent holding that independent expenditures do not have       sufficient value to candidates to justify placing limits on       them.\12\ In other contexts, the courts have interpreted the       phrase ``thing of value'' to encompass a tip about the       whereabouts of a witness,\13\ information about government       informants,\14\ and the testimony of a government       witness.\15\ The courts have roundly rejected the proposition       that this phrase ``covers only things having commercial       value;'' intangibles, including information itself, can       certainly be a ``thing of value.'' \16\ The relevant inquiry       is not the objective value of the thing offered, but       ``whether the donee placed any value on the intangible       gifts.'' \17\ 

       Here, President Trump clearly placed value on the       announcement of investigations. During the July 25 phone       call, Trump stated that it was ``very important'' that       Zelensky open these investigations.\18\ Over several months,       Trump and Rudy Giuliani had made repeated public statements       about how important they thought the investigations were.       Since at least April, 2017, President Trump has been publicly       promoting the debunked conspiracy theory that a California-      based cybersecurity company, CrowdStrike, worked with the       Democratic National Committee to fabricate evidence that       Russia interfered in the 2016 election and hide the proof of       their actions in Ukraine. Rudy Giuliani, the President's       personal attorney, has been promoting a conspiracy theory       about Joe and Hunter Biden since at least January, 2019.\19\       Days after Zelensky was elected, Trump stated on air that he       would be directing Attorney General Barr to ``look into'' the       CrowdStrike conspiracy theory.\20\ In May, 2019, Rudy       Giuliani, with the knowledge and consent of President Trump       and acting on the President's behalf,\21\ planned to travel       to Ukraine to ask for these investigations, which he said       would be ``very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out       to be helpful to my government.'' \22\ On July 10, top       Ukrainian officials met with Energy Secretary Perry, John       Bolton, Kurt Volker, and Ambassador Sondland at the White       House where Sondland made clear that an official White House       visit with Zelensky was important to the President.\23\ 

       Further, the electoral value to President Trump of       investigations that would smear Joe Biden and the DNC while       casting doubt on Russian interference in the 2016 election is       obvious. President Trump was elected in a shocking and narrow       victory after polls showed him trailing his opponent until       officials announced that she was under investigation.\24\ The       announcement of an investigation into his political opponents       clearly had tremendous value to him personally. 

       The President's counsels claim that Trump demanded       investigations of his political rival as part of a perfectly       legitimate anti-       corruption effort. In short, they want the Senate to leave       our common sense at the door. At least four undisputed facts       decisively disprove the claim that President Trump's actions       were motivated by the public interest and not his own. 

       First, as one of my colleagues has put it,\25\ it ``strains       credulity'' to suggest that President Trump was pursuing the       public interest and not his political benefit when the only       corruption investigations he could think to demand involved       his political opponents.\26\ President Trump's counsel have       claimed throughout this trial that the President believed       corruption in Ukraine to be widespread. Yet he did not       suggest a single investigation or programmatic action other       than the two investigations of his political rivals. 

       Second, President Trump did not actually want Ukraine to       conduct the investigations he only wanted Zelensky to       announce them.\27\ If he really did want to get to the bottom       of a legitimate concern, a public announcement of the       investigation would not further that interest. Any good       investigator knows that, if you actually want to get to the       truth, you do not prematurely tip off the subject of the       investigation. Indeed, federal prosecutors are instructed to       not even ``respond to questions about the existence of an       ongoing investigation or comment on its nature or progress       before charges are publicly filed.'' \28\ While announcing       the investigations could only harm any legitimate law       enforcement objective, it would obviously benefit President       Trump's political goals. 

       Third, President Trump never sought the investigations       through ordinary, official channels, or if he did seek them       the Justice Department declined to pursue them. If President       Trump wanted bona fide investigations, as opposed to       politically-motivated announcements, he would have charged       the Department of Justice with conducting an official       investigation, and the Department would have sought       cooperation from the Ukrainian government through the U.S.-      Ukraine Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT). Legitimate       requests made pursuant to an MLAT allow DOJ to take       testimony, obtain records, locate persons, serve documents,       transfer persons into U.S. custody, execute searches and       seizures, freeze assets, and engage in any other lawful       actions that the state can take.\29\ Trump claims that he       just wanted to root out criminality and corruption. But he       did not ask domestic U.S. law enforcement to look into the       matter; to date, there is no criminal investigation of Hunter       Biden. Instead, Trump tried to coerce a foreign government to       investigate a U.S. citizen without any formal coordination       with the U.S. Justice Department. In other words, there was       not a sufficient basis for a bona fide, domestic criminal       investigation, so Trump had to go elsewhere. The fact that       Trump asked a foreign government to investigate Hunter Biden       is not evidence that he cared about corruption; it is       evidence that he was engaged in corruption. 

       In fact, Ukraine ultimately resisted President Trump's       requests for investigations precisely because the President       had failed to rely on the usual channels used to prevent       political interference with law enforcement.\30\ If Trump       actually wanted a legitimate investigation, and wanted to       ensure that DOJ would be privy to relevant information, he       would have sought formal assistance through the U.S.-Ukraine       MLAT. DOJ has confirmed that he did no such thing.\31\       Instead, President Trump acted through his personal attorney,       Rudy Giuliani, a man who made clear that he was duty bound to       pursue his boss's personal interests and not those of the       public.\32\ The only reasonable explanation for the       President's decision to completely bypass the Justice       Department is that he knew that his conspiracy theories could       not withstand scrutiny and he set out to circumvent law       enforcement officials. They were solely intended to serve       Trump's personal, political interests. 

       Finally, as the American Intelligence Community has       unanimously concluded,\33\ the CrowdStrike conspiracy is not       supported by any evidence. It is difficult to fathom how       propagating Russian-generated propaganda that implicates       American public figures and companies is in the national       interest of the United States. Even if his motives were       mixed, and he cared peripherally about corruption generally,       his predominant goal was to smear a political opponent.  B. The release of the hold on military aid and the promised White House                     visit constitute ``official acts''  

       The two acts the President agreed to perform--releasing the       hold on military aid and setting up an official White House       meeting with Zelensky--constitute ``official acts.'' The       bribery statute defines ``official act'' broadly to include       ``any decision or action on any question, matter, cause,       suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be       pending, or which may by law be brought before any public       official, in such official's official capacity, or in such       official's place of trust or profit.'' \34\ Military       assistance and an official White House visit were within his       control only because of his tenure in elective office. In       fact, both receiving foreign dignitaries and providing       foreign assistance are in the President's official,       constitutional job description.\35\ 

       Actions authorized by statute, such as the ones President       Trump took here, are particularly clear examples of official       acts.\36\ Congress has specifically authorized, and       circumscribed, the President's ability to award military       assistance to foreign countries. This process has been       codified since the early 1960s, and there is an enormous       federal apparatus devoted to evaluating the needs of foreign       nations, how those needs intersect with legitimate U.S.       foreign policy interests, and how to award foreign aid in       line with those interests.\37\ Further, when the President       placed a hold on the aid, he was acting on behalf of the       United States, not in his personal capacity. It defies reason       to argue that the President's decision to award, or fail to       execute, a foreign aid determination is not an ``official       act'' under the bribery statute. 

       Similarly, an official White House meeting is an ``official       act'' because the President is specifically ``assigned by       law'' \38\--in both the Constitution and numerous statutes--      with receiving representatives from foreign governments.\39\       Indeed, the authority to receive ambassadors and recognize       foreign governments is considered so core to the office of       the President that the Supreme Court has struck down statutes       that interfere with it.\40\              C. The President corruptly sought a quid pro quo  

       President Trump made an agreement with the specific intent       to be influenced in his decision whether to lift the hold on       the military aid and to host a White House meeting. In United       States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of California, the Supreme       Court held that a bribe made or solicited ``in return for''       an official act entails an exchange, a quid pro quo.\41\ In a       seminal case, the D.C. Circuit reasoned that the term       ``corruptly'' means that the official act would not be       undertaken (or undertaken in a particular way) without the       thing of value.\42\ 

       Department of Justice guidance on the issue, citing the       standard jury instructions that numerous courts have upheld,       indicates that ``corruptly'' denotes ``nothing more than . .       . acting `with bad purpose' to achieve some unlawful end.''       \43\ The guidance further explains that, ordinarily, this       ``bad purpose'' is ``a hope or expectation of either       financial gain or other benefit to one's self, or some aid or       profit or benefit to another.''\44\ In other words, the       intent merely to be influenced in the way prohibited by the       bribery statute itself is sufficient to find that the       defendant acted ``corruptly.'' 

       Further, the Supreme Court unanimously held in 2016 that       the quid pro quo demand ``need not be explicit,'' the       official ``need not specify the means that he will use to       perform his end of the bargain,'' nor must the official       actually intend to follow through for a prosecutor to succeed       in making her case that the defendant is guilty of       bribery.\45\ In a Seventh Circuit case, the court made clear       that the context of a communication can be determinative:       evidence of a quid pro quo can emerge from ``the often       clandestine atmosphere of corruption with a simple wink and a       nod if the surrounding circumstances make it clear that       something of value will pass to a public official if he takes       improper, or withholds proper, action.'' \46\ While the       defendant in that case never made an explicit offer and never       relayed a specific amount of money, the court nonetheless       upheld his conviction for bribery.\47\ 

       Trump's actions clearly qualify as a quid pro quo. Less       than a month prior to this phone call, President Trump had       put a hold on hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid       to Ukraine and had previously set in motion, but not       committed to, an official White House visit with Ukraine's       new president, Volodomyr Zelensky. When Trump and Zelensky       spoke on July 25, Trump set the terms of the conversation by       making clear that he felt Ukraine owed him for America's       generosity. And as soon as Zelensky mentioned that Ukraine       was interested in receiving American anti-tank missiles, the       President immediately stated that he would like Zelensky to       ``do us a favor though,'' and explicitly asked Zelensky to       investigate the Biden conspiracy theory and alleged Ukrainian       interference in the 2016 election. As soon as Zelensky       appeared to agree to open the requested investigations, Trump       almost immediately assured the Ukrainian President that       ``whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel       free to call.'' \48\ Text messages sent by Special Envoy       Volker indicate that it had also been made clear to the       Ukrainians prior to the call that the official White House       visit was also conditioned upon Zelensky complying with       Trump's request for these investigations.\49\ Gordon       Sondland, the American ambassador to the EU, testified that       the President's proposal to lift the hold in exchange for the       investigations was as clear as ``two plus two equals four.''       \50\ Trump's acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, confessed       during a press conference that there was a quid pro quo       exchange and suggested that the public should just ``get over       it.'' \51\ 

       The implication of Trump's message to Zelensky on the July       25 phone call is that Trump would not lift the hold or have       the White House meeting unless Zelensky opened the requested       investigations. The obvious political value to the President       of opening these investigations constitutes sufficient       grounds for a jury to determine that he had a ``bad motive''       in making this request. Trump is guilty of quid pro quo       bribery.                   D. Trump's defenses are not persuasive  

       Trump attempts to absolve his behavior by arguing that his       subjective intent is irrelevant to whether he committed an       impeachable offense, that there is no quid pro quo because       Ukraine never announced the infamous investigations, and       that, even if he did commit a quid pro quo, he cannot be       impeached       because the articles do not accuse him of bribery. Even       setting aside that these defenses ignore the fact that Trump       still has not held a White House meeting with Zelensky, these       arguments are wholly unpersuasive in their own right.             1. Trump's subjective intent is eminently relevant  

       Trump claims that his subjective intent is irrelevant; that       he cannot be impeached based on the reasons for which he       sought the investigations.\52\ This argument is specious for       at least three reasons. First, the two offenses that the       Constitution explicitly mentions as requiring removal from       office--treason and bribery--hinge on the subjective reasons       that the official acted. If the Commander-in-Chief orders the       military to take certain actions with the purpose of       benefiting an enemy of the United States, then the President       has committed treason, even if the President generally has       the authority to command the armed forces. If the President       vetoes a law because someone has paid him a large bribe, then       he has committed bribery, even if the President generally has       the authority to veto laws. When we are prohibited from       scrutinizing the President's reasons for acting, we lose the       ability to protect our democracy from tyrants and traitors. 

       Second, the President maintains that he needs to have       violated ``established law'' in order to be impeached.\53\       Using the President's own standard, then, in evaluating       whether he violated the federal bribery statute, we must       evaluate whether he acted with corrupt intent. If the       President wants to be scrutinized using the standards of the       federal criminal code, then he must concede that his       subjective intent is at issue. 

       Third, even if Trump had other reasons for releasing the       aid, it was still a crime for him to even ask for the       investigations. Section 201(c) of Title 18 prohibits public       officials from demanding anything of value ``for or because       of any official act.'' \54\ The courts have been clear that       even if the official act ``might have been done without'' the       bribe, the defendant is still guilty under section       201(c).\55\ Even if Trump never actually intended to maintain       a hold on the aid, even if he decided to release the aid for       entirely legitimate reasons, the fact that he requested the       investigations as a ``favor'' \56\--because of how generous       the President was in agreeing to conduct a White House visit       or lifting the hold on the military aid--means that the       President committed a crime. 

       Even if a legislator would have voted for a piece of       legislation because he thinks it is in the public interest,       he still commits bribery if he takes a payoff to do it. As       the courts have made clear, an illegal bribe under this       section may take the form of ``a reward [. . .] for a past       act that has already been taken.'' \57\ Thus, the fact that       the President continued to ask for the investigations after       the hold was finally released \58\ does not absolve him; it       further incriminates him.       2. Trump completed his crime the moment he solicited the bribe  

       It is undisputed that the President, either directly or       indirectly, demanded investigations into Joe Biden and a       conspiracy theory involving the Democratic National       Committee. The President's only response is that he cannot be       liable because he did not receive what he requested. Under       federal law, however, a corrupt official need not receive the       benefit he demands or perform the official acts in question;       ``it is enough that the official agreed to do so.'' \59\ It       is the solicitation of a private benefit in and of itself       that constitutes the crime.\60\ All a prosecutor would have       to demonstrate is that the President made an agreement or       offer to exchange official acts for a thing of value. 

       We know from the memorandum of the July 25 phone call, from       Volker and Sondland's texts, and from Sondland's testimony       that Trump had agreed to lift the hold and conduct the White       House meeting in exchange for the investigations.\61\ We also       know that there is additional evidence out there that speaks       to the President's communications--both directly and through       his agents--with Ukraine regarding his illegal scheme. We       know, at the very least, of the existence of diplomatic       cables from the Ukrainian embassy about the hold on the       military assistance and communications with the State       Department about the hold.\62\ The head of the agency that       placed the hold on the military assistance has refused to       respond to a lawful subpoena, under the instruction of the       White House.\63\ As discussed below, when a party fails to       produce or obstructs access to relevant evidence, that       failure ``gives rise to an inference that the evidence is       unfavorable to him.'' \64\ In this case, although the       evidence already presented proves the crime of bribery, the       Senate should infer that the evidence that the executive       branch has hidden about these communications would provide       further evidence that Trump agreed to this illicit exchange.  3. Senators must convict if they conclude that the President committed  the crime of bribery, whether or not the term `bribery' appears in the                                  articles  

       The first article of impeachment accuses the President of       ``corruptly solicit[ing]'' the public announcement of       investigations that were in his ``personal political       benefit,'' in exchange for ``two official acts.'' \65\ In       response to questions from Senators, Trump's counsel has       argued that because the article did not explicitly refer to       the crime of bribery, Trump was provided inadequate notice.       This argument is absurd. 

       Trump has received plenty of notice that he stands accused       of bribery. Trump's actions, as described in the article,       clearly align with the elements of the federal crime of       bribery: he solicited a thing of value in exchange for       official acts and did so with corrupt intent.\66\ Further,       the House Judiciary Committee report adeptly explained why       the President is guilty of bribery under the criminal       code.\67\ Lawmakers have been discussing the President's       misdeeds in terms of bribery for months now.\68\ His lack of       a defense is due not to lack of notice but to lack of facts. 

       The historical record confirms the common sense notion that       the articles need not name specific crimes. In 1974, the       House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of       impeachment against President Nixon, none of which referenced       any provisions of any criminal code.\69\ Many of my       colleagues were presented with similarly drafted articles of       impeachment against Judge Porteous in 2010. In that instance,       the House adopted four articles of impeachment, none of which       explicitly referenced the criminal code.\70\ The first       article described conduct that amounts to bribery--claiming       that Judge Porteous ``solicited and accepted things of       value'' in exchange for ruling in favor of a particular       party--but never used the term ``bribe'' or mentioned the       federal bribery statute.\71\ The Senate unanimously convicted       Judge Porteous on this article and voted to forever       disqualify him from holding office.\72\ No one seriously       entertained the notice argument then, and there is no good       reason to do so now. This bad faith defense is a red herring,       and we must not let it distract us from the issue before us:       the President's crimes. 

       Trump's claim that he cannot be removed for a crime unless       the crime is specifically mentioned in the articles of       impeachment--coupled with his claim that there must be proof       of a crime--is simply untenable. By Trump's flawed logic, if       he had been impeached for ``shooting someone on Fifth       Avenue,'' he could not be removed for ``murder'' unless that       word was specifically included in the articles. We have not       been called to sit in judgment of the House of       Representatives' diction; we sit in judgment of the       President's actions--carefully and precisely described in the       articles of impeachment as a clear-cut case of bribery.     II. The President's unprecedented campaign to obstruct access to   relevant evidence compels us to conclude that the evidence is against                                    him.  

       The House of Representatives has made a very strong case       that the President's refusal to engage in any way with their       investigation is unlawful and constitutionally offensive. But       make no mistake--this conflict is more than a dispute between       the branches of government. The House of Representatives and       a number of Senators have raised the alarm bells not for our       own sake, but because when the President hides from Congress,       he hides from the American people. The separation of powers       does not exist to benefit members of Congress; it exists to       curb the excesses of enormously powerful government       officials. 

       Throughout this entire ordeal--from the moment the call       transcript was improperly placed on a classified server \73\       to the time when Trump threatened to unlawfully assert       executive privilege over any testimony requested by the       Senate \74\--the President has sought to keep his illegal       scheme secret from the very people the scheme was designed to       manipulate: the American electorate. 

       Indeed, the withholding of aid itself was concealed, unlike       with other similar pauses or suspensions of military       assistance. 

       The law and historical precedent are clear--when the       President stifles Congress' investigative authority, whether       during an impeachment inquiry or when Congress is exercising       its broader mandate to investigate the executive branch, he       has exceeded the bounds of the law. Because Trump has flouted       congressional inquiry in such a brazen and unhinged manner,       this violation alone requires us to vote to remove him from       office. 

       Separately, this egregious campaign of obfuscation       strengthens the case against the President for abuse of       power. As a matter of law, when a party to a case improperly       withholds relevant evidence, courts can instruct juries to       make an adverse inference--to assume that the evidence would       be unfavorable to the withholding party. In this case, Trump       has withheld every single piece of evidence that the House       requested. The facts before us confirm the underlying logic       of the adverse inference rule--that when a party hides       something, it is because they have something to hide.       Applying that rule here, the already overwhelming evidence       against Trump becomes an avalanche.   A. Trump's obstruction requires us to infer that all the evidence is   against him, which only strengthens the case for removal for abuse of                                   power  

       It is a long-established rule of law that when a party       ``has relevant evidence within his control which he fails to       produce, that failure gives rise to an inference that the       evidence is unfavorable to him.'' \75\ Importantly, this rule       applies even in the absence of a subpoena and, in fact, ``the       willingness of a party to defy a subpoena in order to       suppress the evidence strengthens the force of the       preexisting inference,'' because in that scenario ``it can       hardly be doubted he has some good reason for his       insistence on suppression.'' \76\ Indeed, the courts have       recognized that the adverse inference rule is essential to       prevent intransigent parties from abusing ``costly and       time consuming'' court proceedings to subvert their legal       duty to produce relevant evidence.\77\ The Supreme Court       has specifically applied this rule against a party who       selectively provided weak evidence and failed to allow       those persons with the most relevant knowledge to testify,       noting that ``the production of weak evidence when strong       is available can lead only to the conclusion that the       strong would have been adverse.'' \78\ As the Court put       it, in circumstances like this, ``silence then becomes       evidence of the most convincing character.'' \79\ 

       We know that the Trump administration has relevant evidence       that it refuses to produce. As an initial matter, the       President has failed to comply with a single request from the       House of Representatives, and, following the President's       orders, the White House, the office of the Vice President,       the Office of Management and Budget, the State Department,       the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy       refused to produce a single document in response to 71       specific requests issued by the House of Representatives.\80\ 

       But we also know of specific pieces of evidence that go to       the heart of the House's case and that Trump is concealing.       Mark Sandy testified that in August, OMB produced a       memorandum recommending that the President's hold on the       Ukraine military assistance be released.\81\ William Taylor       testified that on August 29, he sent a first person cable to       Secretary Pompeo, relaying his concerns about the ``folly I       saw in withholding military aid to Ukraine at a time when       hostilities were still active in the east and when Russia was       watching closely to gauge the level of American support for       the Ukrainian Government.'' \82\ Mr. Taylor also testified       that he had exchanged WhatsApp messages with Ambassadors       Volker and Sondland as well as with Ukrainian officials. The       White House has refused to release any of these documents. We       therefore must infer that they demonstrate that there was no       interagency process to review the best use of the funds--that       this rationale was pre-textual. 

       The White House maintains that Ukraine was not even aware       of the hold on the military assistance until after it was       reported on publicly. But we have testimony to the contrary--      testimony that includes reference to specific documents that       the President is withholding. Laura K. Cooper, the American       deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and       Eurasia, testified that her staff received two emails on July       25th that directly undermine Trump's claim. The first,       received at 2:31 PM, stated that the Ukrainian embassy was       asking about the security assistance. The second, received at       4:25 PM, stated that the Ukrainian embassy knew that the       foreign military financing assistance had been held up.\83\       At the behest of President Trump, the State Department has       not released these emails. Unless and until the       administration produces these documents and any others       bearing on when Ukraine first learned about the hold, we       should assume that they demonstrate that Ukraine knew about       the hold when Trump spoke to Zelensky on July 25.  B. The evidence that has emerged despite Trump's intransigence has only                       bolstered the case against him  

       Based on the above analysis alone, the Senate is more than       entitled to infer that the mountain of evidence that Trump is       withholding would demonstrate his guilt. But two further       points compel us to make such an inference. First, Trump       confessed on national television to having ``all the       materials'' and bragged about how he had kept them from       Congress.\84\ We cannot let this gleeful boast stand without       inferring that the materials in question speak to Trump's       guilt. 

       Second, as the House managers repeatedly cautioned us would       happen, the evidence that Trump has been hiding has started       to come out. And each newly revealed tape or record has been       unfavorable to the President's case. The assumption that the       law compels us to make about the contents of these       materials--that they demonstrate the President's guilt--is       confirmed each and every time they come out into the light.       Most damning has been the leak of a draft of John Bolton's       forthcoming book, which confirms that the President ``told       his national security adviser in August that he wanted to       continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to       Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into       Democrats including the Bidens,'' as well as details about       the involvement of various senior cabinet officials in       Trump's illegal scheme.\85\ And this is only the most recent       revelation in a rapidly growing series of records that have       come to light. On January 14, 2020, Lev Parnas, a former       associate of Rudy Giuliani, released documents which       demonstrate both that the President was orchestrating a deal       to get Zelensky to ``announce that the Biden case will be       investigated,'' and that Marie Yovanovitch was the subject of       an illegal intimidation campaign.\86\ On January 25, 2020, a       tape from April, 2018 was publicly released of a private       dinner with top donors where Trump is heard yelling: ``Get       rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out       tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it,'' in reference to       Ambassador Yovanovitch.\87\ The President is also heard       specifically asking how long Ukraine would last in a war       against Russia absent U.S. support--in other words, inquiring       how much Ukraine is at the mercy of the United States.\88\       Not only does this tape provide further evidence of a       coordinated campaign against the Ambassador; it also       undermines ``earlier defenses by the White House that Trump       wasn't aware of what was taking place in the early phase of       the Ukraine affair.'' \89\ This tape suggests that Trump not       only knew about the Ukraine affair, but also that ``he may       have been directing events'' as early as April 2018.\90\ 

       The steady drip of damning evidence leaking from the       President's associates, combined with Trump's own public       confession to concealing relevant evidence, compels us to       conclude what the law already instructs us to infer: that the       mountain of evidence Trump is hiding proves his guilt.      Conclusion 

       It is clear to me that Trump is guilty of bribery and that       his campaign to obstruct any investigation into his       wrongdoing only strengthens the case against him. Trump's       actions require us to vote to remove him from office. When       the Framers included the impeachment power in the       Constitution, they knew that there would be a presidential       election every four years--and they also knew that this was       an insufficient check against a President who abuses the       power of his office to cheat his way to re-election. Trump's       misdeeds are a case study in the need for impeachment. 

       Throughout the impeachment trial, I have been moved by the       grave moral purpose that the Senate is charged with       pursuing--of sustaining America as an idea, of our       Constitution as a living document that gives substance to our       identity as the world's leading democracy. As we sit in       judgment of a President who has demonstrated nothing but       contempt for our laws and our values, history sits in       judgment of the Senate. By failing to remove Trump from       office, we will have failed our country.                                   ENDNOTES

       5. The President does not contest that he is a ``public       official,'' and the law confirms that it would be foolish to       claim otherwise. The courts have found that a wide array of       officials are subject to the bribery statute: from a cook at       a federal prison, U.S. v. Baymon, 312 F. 3d 725, 728 (5th       Cir. 2002), to a private in the United States army, U.S. v.       Kidd, 734 F. 2d 409, 411-12 (9th Cir. 1984), to a housing       eligibility technician employed by an independent public       corporation, U.S. v. Hang, 75 F. 3d 1275, 1280 (8th Cir.       1996). It would defy reason to argue that a cook at a federal       prison is a public official but the President of the United       States is not.

Any statement to the contrary by       Zelensky is not reliable for the simple reason that Ukraine's       future depends on remaining in Trump's good graces. As       Catherine Croft, who testified that the Ukrainians knew about       the hold much earlier than       she expected to, stated, the Ukrainians did not want the hold       publicized because it ``would be a really big deal in       Ukraine, and an expression of declining U.S. support for       Ukraine.''
