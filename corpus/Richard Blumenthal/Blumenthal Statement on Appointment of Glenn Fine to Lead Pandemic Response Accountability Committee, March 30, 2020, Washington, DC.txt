Blumenthal Statement on Appointment of Glenn Fine to Lead Pandemic Response Accountability Committee


U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) released the following statement in response to the appointment of Glenn Fine, the current Acting Inspector General of the Department of Defense, to lead the newly created Pandemic Response Accountability Committee:

"The funding included in the CARES Act was specifically designated to help American families and workers -- not to personally enrich corporate CEOs or the Trump family business. A strong, serious watchdog is essential to make sure the safeguards we wrote into the law are upheld. As the lead of the new oversight committee, Glenn Fine must utilize his full authority to ensure the robust transparency measures we fought to include in the CARES Act are used. The Trump Administration must be held accountable as they implement this relief package."
