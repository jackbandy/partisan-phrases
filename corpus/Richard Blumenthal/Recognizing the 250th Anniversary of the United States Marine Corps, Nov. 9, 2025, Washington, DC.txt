Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored and proud to be here  today with the Presiding Officer in the Chair, a veteran--albeit of the  Navy, not the Marine Corps--and to be accompanied by a fellow marine,  Senator Sullivan, to whom I will yield shortly.

I am especially honored to pay tribute to one of the Nation's most  storied and steadfast institutions in the history--the entire history-- of our Nation, the U.S. Marine Corps, which marks its 250th anniversary  on Monday.

As legend and history have it, 250 years ago, in the back room of Tun  Tavern in Philadelphia, a new fighting force was born, a force of grit,  determination, and unshakable loyalty. Since that day in 1775, marines  have answered every call, without any exception, with courage and  conviction, not because it was easy but because it was right.

The motto of the Marine Corps, ``Semper Fidelis''--``Always  Faithful''--is more than just a phrase; it is a lifelong commitment. As  we know, there are no former marines, and there are no ex-marines. It  is a lifelong commitment and identity. ``Semper Fidelis'' speaks to the  bond between marines, to the cause they serve, and to the Nation that  they protect. That bond by no means ends with Active Duty. It continues  in communities across America where marines continue to serve, living  out the values of America as teachers, first responders, public  servants, and leaders.

The Marine Corps has fought in every American conflict from the  Revolutionary War to the War on Terror. On the beaches of Iwo Jima, in  the frozen mountains of Korea, in the jungles of Vietnam, and in the  sands of Fallujah, marines have stood their ground. They have led from  the front, often at great personal cost, with no expectation of glory.

Telling the story of America is impossible without telling the story  of the U.S. Marine Corps. Their sacrifices have safeguarded our  freedom. Their discipline has inspired generations. Their traditions of  toughness, honor, and duty have stood the test of time. Historic  battles exemplify the Marine Corps' unyielding commitment to courage,  sacrifice, and duty, and they define the very character of our  military: Derna, Chapultepec, First Bull Run, Belleau Wood,  Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, the Chosin Reservoir,  Khe Sanh, Hue, the liberation of Kuwait, Fallujah, and Helmand  Province.

Marines have not only fought our wars, they have also responded to  humanitarian crises, assisted in natural disasters, and stood sentry in  times of peace. They are not just warfighters; they are ambassadors of  American resolve and resilience. This milestone of 250 years is an  opportunity to reflect, to honor, and to recommit.

We honor the thousands of marines who never made it home, who gave  their last full measure of devotion, as the saying goes. We honor the  Gold Star families who carry their memory every single day. We honor  the wounded in body and some in spirit whose lives are forever shaped  by their service. We honor every marine, past and present, who has  earned the title with sweat, sacrifice, and a fierce sense of purpose.

Let me acknowledge, as well, the families who stand behind every  marine: spouses, children, parents. They serve quietly, often without  any recognition, but always with deep devotion. Their strength sustains  the Corps, those families, those friends, those loved ones. Their  sacrifices, too, must be honored.

The 250th anniversary is not only a celebration; it is a solemn  reminder we make to all who wear the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor that we  will never forget their service and that we will always fight to give  them the support, care, and respect they have earned.

This milestone is a chance to educate future generations about what  it means to serve and why the Marine Corps' legacy matters not just in  history books but in the daily defense of  our democracy and our ideals. The world has never been more dangerous  and more in need of that service.

As we look to the next 250 years of the greatest Nation in the  history of the world, let's ensure that our policies, our resources,  and our commitments match the trust we place in all of our military,  including our U.S. Marines. We need to provide our marines and our  military men and women with the tools and the resources they need to  fight and win and the care they deserve when they return home.

It is not about the rhetoric or just the celebration of birthdays.  What really matters is what we do between the birthdays to keep faith  with our men and women in uniform and afterward when they return to our  great Nation. We can leave no veteran behind in healthcare as well as  in education and training and in everything they need to be successful  when they come back. Let us rededicate ourselves to the ideals they  uphold: freedom, justice, service above self.

To every marine, from the youngest recruit on Parris Island or in San  Diego to the oldest veteran in our communities, we say thank you. Thank  you for your service. Thank you for your sacrifice. Thank you for never  wavering as a marine.

Happy birthday, U.S. Marine Corps.

Semper Fidelis.

I am happy now to yield to my colleague and friend from Alaska and  fellow marine, U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan.

Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska for  those very powerful words from himself and the Commandant.

As he has remarked, this Marine Corps birthday always has enormous  personal meaning for all of us who have served in the U.S. Marine  Corps, including for my son Matthew, who was in Helmand Province. I am  hopeful that he will invite his younger brother to one of the Marine  Corps balls. Michael served as a Navy SEAL.

This occasion is joined by our colleagues Senators Gallego and Young,  also marines, and I am sure is supported by others in this body and in  the House of Representatives who have served.

Res.  124 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.

Mr. BLUMENTHAL.
