Letter to the Hon. Mitch McConnell, Majority Leader and the Hon. Chuck Schumer, Minority Leader - Booker, Gillibrand, Harris, Smith Press Senate Leaders for Maternal Health Policies in Next COVID-19 Package


Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:As the Senate continues to work on the next legislative package to address COVID-19, we writeto urge you to include policies that will improve maternal health. While this should be a constantpriority for Congress, it is especially important now as we work to respond to COVID-19.As you know, the maternal mortality rate in the United States exceeds that of almost all of itspeer countries, and in fact, the U.S. is one of only a few countries in the world that experiencedan increase in maternal mortality between 2000 and 2014.1 Each year about 700 people in theUnited States die from pregnancy-related complications, and a majority of these deaths arepreventable.2 Troubling racial and geographic disparities plague maternal health. AmericanIndian and Alaska Native (Indigenous) people and black people are more than two and threetimes likely to die, respectively, than white people due to pregnancy-related complications.3Additionally, pregnant people in rural areas are more likely to die or experience severecomplications around the time of childbirth.4The same communities that are at greatest risk for maternal death and illness aredisproportionately affected by COVID-19. It is clear that this pandemic is placing further strainon our nation's maternal care system and on pregnant people. For instance, there have beenreports of expectant mothers forced to delay or forego check-ups and other needed care due tofears that they might contract COVID-19, which is particularly troubling for people of color,rural residents, and other medically underserved individuals who already face barriers to care.Many pregnant people are also having to give birth without their full support system, includingfamily members and doulas, due to the social distancing measures that hospitals haveimplemented.7 Other pregnant people are looking for alternatives to giving birth in a hospital butare burdened by restirctions. In addition, pregnant and postpartum individuals are dealing withsignificant stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including those related to employment,health, income, and housing.8 Furthermore, preliminary data indicates that Black and Indigenouspeople make up a disproportionate amount of those who are contracting and dying fromCOVID-19 across the country, and rural residents are increasingly affected. This, intersectedwith their already higher rates of maternal mortality, may put pregnant Black and Indigenouspeople, especially those in rural areas, at particular risk of experiencing poor health outcomesduring this pandemic.To support and address the needs of pregnant people, particularly during this time, we encourageyou to include the following policies in the next legislative package Congress considers:Postpartum MedicaidMedicaid is a primary payer of maternity care in the United States, covering 43 percent of birthsnationwide.9 One in three women experience a disruption in insurance coverage before, during,or after pregnancy, and nearly 60 percent of these perinatal insurance disruptions include aperiod of uninsurance.10 Under current law, many pregnant people who are covered by Medicaidas a result of their pregnancy are only guaranteed coverage for up to 60 days postpartum. Thisabrupt cut-off during the postpartum period is harmful for new mothers, particularly as one-thirdof pregnancy-related deaths occur between one week and one year after delivery.11 12 Deathsfrom cardiovascular disease, including cardiomyopathy, and other preventable causes, includingoverdose and suicide, occur more frequently during this 12-month postpartum period, thanbefore.13 Ensuring continous Medicaid coverage for postpartum individuals can save lives andreduce disparities; for example, Medicaid expansion has helped lead to 1.6 fewer maternal deathsper 100,000 women, and racial disparities in states that have expanded Medicaid are smaller thanin those that have not.14 As the nation continues to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, it isparticularly important that postpartum patients have continuous health coverage. We urge you toextend pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage for all postpartum beneficiaries to one full yearpost-birth.Full-Scope Medicaid Coverage and Increased ReimbursementIn addition to ensuring that pregnant Medicaid beneficiaries may remain covered for at least ayear postpartum, it is also critically important that coverage is comprehensive. Currently, manyMedicaid beneficiaries are restricted to coverage for "pregnancy-related" services only. Thisrestriction may prohibit individuals from receiving care for other health conditions andcomorbidities that impact maternal health, including those related to COVID-19. We urge you toensure that all pregnant and postpartum beneficiaries have full-scope Medicaid coverage, whichincludes coverage for critical services like oral health care as well. In addition, even before theCOVID-19 pandemic, Medicaid reimbursement rates for maternal health and other services werevery low. Maternal health providers, like all medical providers, are suffering deep losses due tothe pandemic and have received limited federal funding. Upcoming legislation should alsoinclude a reimbursement rate increase for maternal and childbirth services, including parity withMedicare rates as appropriate.Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs)Most, but not all, states have maternal mortality review committees that regularly reviewmaternal death data. It is essential that MMRCs be universally established and equitablyresourced; establish consistency in data collection and reporting; and include people who havebeen most affected by maternal mortality.15 Federal guidelines and resources for reportingmaternal deaths should be equitably provided across states. Additionally, federal leadership canensure consistency in how deaths are identified, defined, systematically collected, managed andhow to report on subpopulations at greatest risk (including different racial and ethnic groups,rural populations, and people experiencing domestic violence.) Committee representation shouldinclude people who have given birth, family members of those lost to maternal mortality, andthose who are disproportionately affected by maternal morbidity and mortality -- includingBlack, Indigenous, and rural people.Expanding Telehealth and Related EquipmentTelehealth may play an important role in providing maternal health care, particularly as manyAmericans continue to observe social distancing. The Centers for Medicare and MedicaidServices (CMS) recently published a toolkit to assist states in increasing the use of telehealthservices through Medicaid and CHIP.16 We urge you to provide additional support and resourcesto help states implement telehealth services for maternity care, particularly for Medicaid, whichcovers almost half of all births in the United States. This should include covering equipment anddevices that are necessary for providing maternal health services via telehealth, such as bloodpressure cuffs. Currently, many women enrolled in Medicaid do not have access to theequipment that is required for remote patient monitoring services. Allowing clinicians to writeprescriptions for at-home equipment will ensure equitable access to evidence-based telehealthservices for pregnant and postpartum women, as well as reduce their risk of exposure to COVID19. Congress should also do all it can to ensure that a range of providers are able to providetelehealth services and receive reimbursement for such services, including midwives.Additionally, similar guidance, requirements and resources should be applied to private insurersto ensure their patients have the ability to appropriately access critical maternity care servicesthrough telehealth at this time.Access to Doula and Other Perinatal Support Servicesphysical, and informational support before, during, and after birth. Doula support has been linkedto improved perinatal outcomes, particularly for people of color.17 Doula support also plays animportant role in helping expectant or new mothers relieve stress, which is particularly importantnow. Other perinatal support services like lactation counselors and childbirth educators can alsoaid expectant and new mothers by providing support and helping to navigate resources andsystems during this time. In the next COVID-19 package, Congress should require CMS - incoordination with patients and perinatal support workers, including community-based doulas - toprovide guidance and additional support to states to reimburse and better facilitate access todoula and other support services, including through telehealth, for Medicaid and CHIPbeneficiaries throughout the country.Access to Midwifery CareMidwifery care is associated with fewer unnecessary interventions, increased positive experienceof care and patient satisfaction, and lower health care costs. However, restrictive regulations andinsufficient Medicaid and commercial insurance reimbursement rates make midwivesinaccessible for many, particularly people of color and people enrolled in Medicaid. We urge youto provide funding for midwifery education programs in order to grow, strengthen, and diversifythe midwifery workforce, especially for midwives of color and those working in healthprofessional shortage areas. Specfically, a funding stream should be established within theHealth Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Title VIII and Title VII programsspecific to Advanced Midwifery Education Grants, to support university-based accreditedschools of midwifery and to establish programs for increasing the number of midwife preceptorsacross the country. In addition, certified-nurse widwives should be eligible for reimbursementunder Medicare's Graduate Medical Education program, in order to ensure that midwives whowork in obstetrical training and teaching facilities can be explicitly reimbursed for performingthose services. Midwives should be reimbursed at 100 percent of physician rates for identicalservices under Medicaid and guaranteed inclusion in Medicaid managed care plans and equityand inclusion within private insurance plans. We also urge HHS to work with states to ensurethat midwives are being allowed and supported to practice to the full scope of their certificationin all states.Funding to Help Hospitals Prevent and Respond to Pregnancy ComplicationsStates and hospitals need dedicated funding to purchase supplies, train staff, and fully implementstandardized best practices to help reduce maternal deaths, and prevent and respond tocomplications arising from pregnancy and childbirth. The next COVID-19 relief package shouldinclude dedicated funding to support emergency responses at hospitals to protect women before,during, and after childbirth.Funding to Support Birth CentersFreestanding birth centers are evidence-based, safe alternatives to in-hospital birth, whichcan help relieve pressure on the physician workforce, minimize COVID-19 transmission, anddirect health system resources more effectively as the country continues to respond to theWe urge you to improve access tofreestanding birth center services for people with low-risk pregnancies, especially those enrolledin Medicaid, by funding a Medicaid demonstration program to develop and advance innovativepayment models for birth center care. CMS should also publish guidance for states to implementpayment for birth center facility fees and birth attendant provider fees. Additionally, in responseto the COVID-19 pandemic, regulations and financial support must facilitate the rapid openingand expansion of birth centers and auxiliary maternity units to meet the increasing demand forout-of-hospital birth, following guidelines from national birth center accreditation organizations.These options require adequate reimbursement rates and facility fees to sustain their operationsand serve patients enrolled in Medicaid.Thank you for your consideration of our request. We look forward to continuing to work withyou on policies that will help all Americans as our nation continues to respond to the COVID-19pandemic.
