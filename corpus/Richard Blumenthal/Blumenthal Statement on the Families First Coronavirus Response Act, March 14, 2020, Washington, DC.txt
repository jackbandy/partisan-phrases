Blumenthal Statement on the Families First Coronavirus Response Act


U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) released the following statement on the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, a bipartisan agreement to respond to the ongoing public health crisis passed by the House of Representatives early this morning:

"This solid start to confronting a historic national crisis truly puts families first. The Senate -- which should be at work right now -- must now quickly approve it with the overwhelming bipartisan support that this emergency demands. This crisis has upended workplaces and homes, endangering lives and livelihoods, spreading disease and fear. It must be met with resolve, resilience, and compassion. These steps are a sound beginning to help families meet every day needs -- putting food on the table and paying their mortgage -- if workers must stay home or lose their jobs. It helps small businesses with the financially backbreaking shock of economic disruption. It helps states meet dire healthcare needs through expanded Medicaid funding. Its overwhelming bipartisan support reflects the courageous leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer, and more will follow."
