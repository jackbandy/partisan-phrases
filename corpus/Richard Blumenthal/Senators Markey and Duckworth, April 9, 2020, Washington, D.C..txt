Senators Markey and Duckworth, Colleagues Outline Five Principles of Health & Economic Security to Guide Future Coronavirus Relief Packages


Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and seven of their Senate colleagues today released a set of five principles to guide future coronavirus relief and stimulus packages to protect workers and communities. In a letter to Senate leadership, the Senators recognized that choices being made during this response will shape society and policymaking for years, if not decades, to come and without consideration, policymakers risk exacerbating interrelated crises of income and wealth inequality, racism, and environmental and climate decline.

 

Also signing the letter are Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), and Ben Cardin (D-Md.).

 

"In this critical moment, we need to adequately respond to immediate needs and chart a path to a genuinely healthier and more equitable future through a just recovery," write the Senators in their letter to Senate leadership. "Adhering to these five principles as further relief and stimulus packages are crafted to address COVID-19 will be critical for the long-term health of this nation."
