Sens. Moran, Blumenthal Joint Statement on the IOC's Decision to Postpone 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games


U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) -- Chairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce Subcommittee on Manufacturing, Trade, and Consumer Protection, with jurisdiction over the health and safety of Olympic athletes -- today released the following statement in response to the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) decision to postpone the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games:

"Our athletes have worked years, some their whole lives, to be Olympians, and they deserve as much clarity as possible regarding the future of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. Postponing the Games was undoubtedly a difficult decision, but it is one that puts the health and safety of athletes first. Now, the IOC needs to be transparent and unified with its plans moving forward. Athletes deserve clear answers to when the games will be held and how their health will remain protected -- not just at the Olympics themselves, but during the trials and training beforehand. Clarity and transparency are vital steps to ensure the best possible outcome for the Tokyo Olympic Games."

Chairman Moran and Ranking Member Blumenthal sent a letter on March 11, to Thomas Bach, President of the IOC, inquiring on the IOC's plan to prevent the spread of COVID-19 during the Olympic Games in Tokyo.

Both senators have had conversations with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee regarding the health and safety of American athletes participating in the Tokyo Olympic Games. Through their roles on the subcommittee, Sen. Moran and Sen. Blumenthal will continue to make certain American athletes' health is a priority at the games and trials.
