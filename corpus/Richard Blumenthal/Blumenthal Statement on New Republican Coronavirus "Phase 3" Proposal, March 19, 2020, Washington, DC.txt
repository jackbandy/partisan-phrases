Blumenthal Statement on New Republican Coronavirus "Phase 3" Proposal


U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) released the following statement in response to the "CARES Act" proposed by Republican Senate leadership:

"The McConnell proposal fails to meet the magnitude of this moment. It falls far short of the massive commitment necessary to address the growing healthcare emergency and economic crisis."

"Confronting the medical surge is fundamental to addressing the economic crisis. A medical Marshall Plan is vital to match essential healthcare needs, including tests, ventilators, hospital beds, and the other critical equipment our medical professionals desperately require."

"Direct cash payments must go to small businesses striving to survive and families and workers struggling to pay their bills and buy groceries -- including, critically, the working poor. Along with cash payments, there should be vastly expanded unemployment insurance compensation and comprehensive emergency sick, family, and medical leave."

"The McConnell plan is a blank check bailout for the airlines without any necessary worker and consumer protections. This proposal totally fails to prevent the corporate excesses and abuses that followed past taxpayer bailouts. A relief package for any industry must put workers first. Instead of corporate welfare, there should be grants and loan forgiveness for small businesses, which are the job creating backbone of our economy."

"American lives are on the line and America deserves better than this inadequate, incomplete proposal."
