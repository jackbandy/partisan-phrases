CT Congressional Delegation Announces Nearly $380 Million in COVID-19 Relief Funding


Today, the Connecticut Congressional Delegation announced that Connecticut will be receiving nearly $380 million in initial funding from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund that was allocated through the CARES Act.

"Today's announcement that Connecticut hospitals and health care centers will be receiving nearly $380 million is welcomed news, but more must be done to counter the hundreds of millions of dollars in losses suffered by these institutions. There is an additional $70 billion from the CARES Act that has yet to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services that must be directed to facilities in COVID hot spots.  We are fighting for additional funding through a fourth relief package to ensure our health care heroes fighting on the frontlines of this pandemic have the support and resources they need," said the members.
