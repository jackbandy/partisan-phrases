Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, earlier today, I was unable to vote on  Executive Calendar No. 80, David Perdue to be Ambassador to the  People's Republic of China, due to my attendance as ranking member at a  Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing on mental health care for  veterans. I would have opposed Mr. Perdue's confirmation had I been  present for the vote, rollcall vote No. 215.
