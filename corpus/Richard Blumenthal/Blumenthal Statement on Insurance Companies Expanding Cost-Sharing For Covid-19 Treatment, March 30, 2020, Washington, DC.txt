Blumenthal Statement on Insurance Companies Expanding Cost-Sharing For Covid-19 Treatment


U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) released the following statement after several major insurers -- including Aetna/CVS Health, Cigna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Anthem and Humana -- announced expanded coverage for COVID-19 patients:

"A crucial step in combating and eventually ending this epidemic is removing barriers to COVID-19 testing and treatment. I am glad to see major insurers, including Cigna and Aetna, step forward and waive out-of-pocket costs for COVID-19 patients in order to help meet this goal."
