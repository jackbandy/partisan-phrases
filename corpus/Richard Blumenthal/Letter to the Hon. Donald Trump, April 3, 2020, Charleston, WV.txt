Letter to the Hon. Donald Trump, President of the United States - Manchin Urges Administration to Continue Covering All Costs of National Guard Troops Activation


Dear President Trump:

During this time of national emergency, we write to request a revision to your March 30, 2020 "Memorandum on Providing Federal Support for Governors' Use of the National Guard to Respond to COVID-19." We are concerned that this order precludes troops from qualifying for the full benefits they would normally be permitted under Title 32 orders.

Section four of your memorandum stipulates that the 100 percent Federal cost share "shall terminate 30 days from the date of this memorandum." Unfortunately, the data clearly indicates that this global pandemic affecting all of our States will not be under control within 30 days. Furthermore, while it is not specified in statute, it is the policy of the U.S. Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget that many of the key benefits afforded to our National Guard troops are only available for deployments that exceed 30 consecutive days.

Therefore we respectfully request that you revise your memorandum to authorize Title 32 deployments for longer than 30 consecutive days, preferably through completion of response and recovery to this national emergency, or at least a minimum of 180 days. This simple change will provide peace of mind for our troops and a steady state to enable our Governors to continue to respond to this crisis.

Our National Guard troops are among the frontline workers in this pandemic, working to keep their communities and their Nation safe and healthy. We must make sure they receive the fullest protection and benefits available to them by law.

Thank you in advance for your consideration of this request.
