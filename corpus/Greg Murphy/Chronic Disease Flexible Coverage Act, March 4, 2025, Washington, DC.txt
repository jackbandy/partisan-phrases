Chronic Disease Flexible Coverage Act

Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, we have heard from great speakers talking  about the problem with chronic disease in the United States.

One of the issues that face people who have hypertension, kidney  disease, and diabetes is that they can't get the medicines or the  devices that they need to be able to regulate their condition.

This bill, H.R. 919, helps to solve that problem by giving  individuals access to those lifesaving devices prior to them fulfilling  their deductible. This is critical, as we fight chronic disease in the  United States. As we have heard, over 90 percent of the expenditures in  this country are due to chronic disease.

I know that in my district in eastern North Carolina, the rate of  diabetes, obesity, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure  are things that are really, truly killing our population. Being able to  access devices so that we can monitor these things is crucial. We have  to have availability for these devices for people before they have to  pay their full deductible.

I applaud Representative Buchanan, Representative Panetta, and  Chairman Smith for bringing this forward. This is common sense.  President Trump tried to do this in his first term. I am very grateful  that they are trying to do this again. We want to make America healthy  again. That starts with being able to give patients the tools that they  need to be healthy. I urge support for H.R. 919 to my colleagues.
