And Still I Rise

Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise to note that  tonight I have called for the impeachment of Donald John Trump,  President of the United States of America.

He is an abuser of Presidential power. He has called for the  execution of Members of the House of Representatives, of this very  House. He has demeaned Members of the judiciary.

He has conducted himself in office such that persons are now  threatening Members of the judiciary, threatening Members of the House  of Representatives, and threatening Members of the Senate.

Donald John Trump, by his conduct, merits impeachment, trial, and  conviction in the Senate of the United States of America and should  never hold any office of public trust ever again.
