No More Military Aid to Israel


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1693670/no-more-military-aid-to-israel


Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, tonight, I voted against sending  more military aid to Israel. I voted against it because I saw it as I  currently see it, as a vote against collective punishment, a vote  against ethnic cleansing, and a vote against genocide appearing before  my very eyes.

I refuse to have my fingerprints, my imprimatur on the killing of  innocent people, including children. I voted ``no.'' I will not become  a ``yes'' because Mr. Netanyahu doesn't want peace. He wants all of  Palestine. My imprimatur will not be on it.
