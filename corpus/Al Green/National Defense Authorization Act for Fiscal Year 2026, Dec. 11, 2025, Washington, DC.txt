Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to indicate my reasons that I  will not be voting to fund Israel's military, most of which are  contained in the letter that was delivered to Speaker Mike Johnson's  office on December 10, 2025.

I ask that funding for our military not be linked to funding Israel's  military. I support our military. I do not approve of attaching my  support for our military to Israel's military. We, who support our  military should be allowed to do so without having to fund Israel's  military. Those who support Israel's military should be able to do so  in a standalone bill. I cannot in good conscience vote to authorize  sending our tax dollars to a military whose prime minister has been  accused by the International Criminal Court of ``the war crimes of  starvation as a method of warfare and of intentionally directing an  attack against the civilian population; and the crimes against humanity  of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts;'' to a military that  has killed more than 70,000 thousand Palestinian men, women, and  especially children in Gaza.

If my request to detach funding our military from funding Israel's  military in legislation is not granted, I will oppose the legislation.  While I believe Israel should have a military, I will not vote to  support funding Israel's military. I make this request on behalf of  myself and no one else. On some issues it is better to stand alone than  not stand at all.
