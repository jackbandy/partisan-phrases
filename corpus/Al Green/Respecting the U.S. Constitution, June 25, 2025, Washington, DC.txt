Respecting the U.S. Constitution


https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1692934/respecting-the-us-constitution


Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a very special message--an admonition,  a prewarning--for the most powerful man in the universe, I am told, the  President of the United States of America.

Mr. Speaker, there is talk of having to go back into Iran. There is  talk of the job not having been done as expected.

I make no comments about whether he should or shouldn't go, but I do  comment on the Constitution. I do say to the most powerful man in the  universe: Mr. President, if you go back into Iran and do not get the  consent of Congress or appropriately notice Congress, Mr. President, I  will bring Articles of Impeachment against you again.

Mr. President, no one person should have the authority to take 300- plus million people to war on his own volition. The Congress of the  United States must be engaged in this process.

Mr. President, it is pretty simple. Either you will respect the  Constitution of the United States of America, or you will expect Al  Green.
