I Shall March on

Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise to announce that  last night I called for the impeachment of Donald John Trump, President  of the United States of America, for threatening judges and for calling  for the execution of Members of Congress.

If ever there was a person who ought to be impeached, it is Donald  John Trump. Now, there are many people who don't want to see this  happen. They don't want to vote for impeachment.

Well, there were people who didn't want to cross the Edmund Pettus  Bridge, but they marched on. I shall march on.

I have been told that this vote will take place sometime after 1:30  today. I assure you that I will be here for that vote. I will also  speak on Friday for about 1 hour after about 11 o'clock. I will explain  more about it at that time.

This President is a reckless, ruthless, lawless person who doesn't  deserve the title of President of the United States of America.
