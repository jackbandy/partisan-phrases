Mourning the Lost Lives in Minnesota


Mr. GREEN of Texas. Still I rise, Mr. Speaker, in mourning for the  lives that have been lost at the hands and the color of law.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Pretti and Ms. Good should not have lost their lives  as they did. Yes, I stand for impeachment of Ms. Noem, the Secretary,  but that is not enough. I believe that under these circumstances more  is required than a simple impeachment. I think it is a good thing to  do, and I support it. However, there is some question of criminality  involved with this. In such cases of criminality, we must do more than  impeach. We must convict. She should do time.

It is time for us to send a message to others that you cannot cover  up and you cannot condone this kind of behavior when you hold public  trust.

Mr. Speaker, still I rise, and I stand where I stand.
