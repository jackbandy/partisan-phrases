Senate Passes Bipartisan Hassan, Romney Bill to Confront Rise of China


The U.S. Senate yesterday passed the Indo-Pacific Cooperation Act of 2019, a bipartisan bill that Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Todd Young (R-IN), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) introduced that would require the U.S. to partner with allies in the Indo-Pacific region, Europe, and elsewhere to develop a unified approach to address the rise of China.

 

"As the United States works to hold China accountable for pursuing destabilizing actions in the Indo-Pacific region, our country must stand with our allies in developing and executing a plan to counter China's aggression," said Senator Hassan. "I'm encouraged that our bipartisan bill passed the Senate, and I urge my colleagues in the House to follow our lead so that this bill can become law."

 

"Addressing the threat that China poses to our fundamental values of freedom, human rights, and free enterprise is the central challenge facing us in the 21st century," said Senator Romney. "As the leader of the free world, America must link arms with our allies and partners to confront the rise of China. Senate passage of this legislation represents a first step in developing a unified approach and comprehensive strategy with our allies in Asia, Europe, and around the world to combat China's growing aggression."

 

Last year, Senator Hassan participated in a congressional delegation to Japan, South Korea, China, and Taiwan to advance U.S. interests in the critical region.
