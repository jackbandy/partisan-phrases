N.H. Congressional Delegation Calls on President Trump to Approve State's Request for Full Reimbursement of COVID-19 FEMA-Funded Projects


U.S. Senators Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen and Representatives Annie Kuster and Chris Pappas called on President Trump to approve the state's request for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fully reimburse costs that the state incurs under FEMA Public Assistance related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

FEMA is reimbursing states for 75 percent of costs under the FEMA Public Assistance program, but the law allows FEMA to cover the full cost of emergency work for Major Disaster Declarations with extraordinary impact. As the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation writes, "This global pandemic is unprecedented, as is the lengthy and sustained response it requires of emergency management officials at all levels. It is critical that New Hampshire receives the full support of the federal government as it works to save lives."

Many New Hampshire communities cannot afford the current cost share of covering 25 percent of critical emergency work. "Our state and local partners on the front line of this crisis have committed significant resources toward slowing the spread of COVID-19Â…. However, the demands of responding to this global pandemic have already outstripped many of the capabilities and resources of the state and local communities. New Hampshire communities, particularly small towns with small budgets, are making difficult operational decisions driven in part by whether they will be able to afford the 25 percent cost share."

The letter follows up on the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation's previous call for the President to approve a Major Disaster Declaration for New Hampshire, which the President granted earlier this month.
