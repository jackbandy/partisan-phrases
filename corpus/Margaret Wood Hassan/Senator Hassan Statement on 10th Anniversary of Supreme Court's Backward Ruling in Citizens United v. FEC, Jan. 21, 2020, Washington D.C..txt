Senator Hassan Statement on 10th Anniversary of Supreme Court's Backward Ruling in Citizens United v. FEC


Senator Maggie Hassan released the following statement on the 10th anniversary of the Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. FEC:

 

"The backward Citizens United decision helped unleash unlimited dark money in politics, giving corporate special interests even more power at the expense of hard-working Americans. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Congressional Republicans continue to block action on this urgent issue, I will keep standing with the majority of Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- who support strong action to rein in outside spending and reduce the influence of money in politics."

 

Senator Hassan has long fought for campaign finance reform to ensure that corporate special interests do not overpower the voices of everyday Americans. Senator Hassan joined her colleagues in introducing the Democracy for All Amendment, a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United v. FEC and other disastrous court decisions to help get big money out of politics. Senator Hassan is also a cosponsor of the DISCLOSE Act, which would require organizations spending money in federal elections to disclose their donors and help guard against hidden foreign influence. In 2018, the Senator voted to reverse an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rule that allows "dark money" groups to hide the identities of their major donors from law enforcement.
