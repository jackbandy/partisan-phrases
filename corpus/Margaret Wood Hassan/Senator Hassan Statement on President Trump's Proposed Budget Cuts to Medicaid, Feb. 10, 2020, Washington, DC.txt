Senator Hassan Statement on President Trump's Proposed Budget Cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and Other Health Priorities


Senator Maggie Hassan released the following statement about President Trump's federal budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2021, which includes cuts to Medicaid and Medicare, among other damaging cuts. While the budget heeds calls from Senators Hassan, Shaheen and the entire New Hampshire Congressional Delegation to support continued funding for the State Opioid Response grant program, it cuts other health priorities that would harm the response to the opioid crisis.

 

"President Trump's proposed budget would hurt hard-working Americans, particularly by undermining Americans' health care with sweeping cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and other health priorities.

 

"While I appreciate that the President heeded our New Hampshire Congressional Delegation's calls to support continued funding for the State Opioid Response grant program, the budget also proposes steep cuts to Medicaid, which would hurt those on the front lines of combating the opioid crisis. In addition to the nearly $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and Medicare, the Trump Administration is also proposing cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health in the midst of the coronavirus public health emergency.

 

"I will work with members of both parties to reject this harmful proposal and support a fiscally responsible budget that supports the health and well-being of all of our people, expands economic opportunity, and strengthens our national security."
