Following House Vote on Major Bipartisan PFAS Bill, Hassan Calls for Senate Action


Today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed major bipartisan legislation to address PFAS contamination in New Hampshire and across the country. In response, Senator Hassan issued the following statement:

"PFAS contamination has been linked to devastating health consequences, and there is much more that the federal government can and should be doing to protect Americans from PFAS exposure. The important bill passed by the House of Representatives today takes significant steps forward in combating the threat that PFAS poses, from helping local communities who face PFAS contamination in their drinking water to enacting PFAS standards to protect families from contamination moving forward.

"Protecting the health and safety of all Americans should never be a partisan issue, and I urge Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to stop blocking progress on this important issue and bring this key legislation to the Senate for consideration."

The government funding bill passed into law last year supported by Senator Hassan included key provisions to address PFAS contamination. Additionally, the annual defense bill that has now been signed into law included legislation that Senator Hassan cosponsored to identify and address PFAS and also included measures to protect fire fighters from PFAS. Senator Hassan also joined colleagues in reintroducing the bipartisan PFAS Accountability Act in the Senate, which would hold federal agencies accountable for addressing PFAS contamination at military bases across the country. In 2018, Senator Hassan participated in the first-ever Senate hearing on contamination of PFAS in drinking water.
