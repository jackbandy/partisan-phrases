Senator Hassan Recognizes Rahul and Karthik Chalumuri of Keene as January's Granite Staters of the Month


Senator Maggie Hassan recognized Rahul and Karthik Chalumuri of Keene as January's Granite Staters of the Month for their efforts to organize donation drives at their school to support patients at a local cancer center.  

 

Karthik and Rahul, who are fraternal twins, are currently seniors at Keene High School. Before heading off to college, they decided that they wanted to give back in a big way. They founded a club at their school, Students for Hope, to organize donation drives to send care packages to Cheshire Medical Center's Norris Cotton Cancer Center-Kingsbury Pavilion, which would distribute the care packages to their patients. The brothers' first donation drive in August brought in a substantial amount of items thanks to local businesses and individuals in their community. Since then, they have organized two more donation drives around both Thanksgiving and Christmas, and plan to hold another one in February around Valentine's Day.

 

Senator Hassan launched the "Granite Stater of the Month" initiative in 2017 to recognize outstanding New Hampshire citizens who go above and beyond to help their neighbors and make their communities stronger.
