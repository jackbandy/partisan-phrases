Senator Hassan Statement on President Trump's Veto of Bipartisan Measure to Protect Defrauded Student Borrowers


U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan, a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, released the following statement after President Trump vetoed a bipartisan measure that would overturn the Department of Education's "borrower defense" rule, a proposal that will effectively deny students who were cheated or defrauded by predatory for-profit colleges of the debt relief that they are entitled to under law.

"Even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic when so many students are struggling, President Trump and Secretary DeVos are continuing their efforts to deny students who were cheated by predatory for-profit colleges the debt relief that they deserve. Bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate supported this relief for defrauded students that the President vetoed, and I will keep doing everything I can to protect students from bad actors."
