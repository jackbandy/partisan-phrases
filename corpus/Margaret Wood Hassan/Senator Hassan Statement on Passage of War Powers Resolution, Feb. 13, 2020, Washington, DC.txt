Senator Hassan Statement on Passage of War Powers Resolution


U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) released the following statement after voting to pass a bipartisan war powers resolution aimed at preventing further escalation of hostilities with Iran without congressional authorization:

 

"The first priority of government is to keep America safe, secure, and free, and the Administration has a responsibility to consult with Congress on the use of military force. I joined Republican and Democratic Senators alike in supporting this resolution because it strikes the right balance of ensuring that the military can respond to immediate threats, while also requiring the Administration to fulfill its obligation to consult with Congress on military engagement. I will continue working with members of both parties to push the Administration to communicate with Congress and the American people about its long-term strategy to de-escalate the conflict with Iran, keep our troops safe, and protect our national security."
