In Recognition of Census Day, Senator Hassan Urges Everyone to Participate in This Year's Census


In recognition of Census Day, U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan is urging everyone to participate in this year's census. The census helps ensure that federal dollars are appropriately distributed to communities across the country to help them invest in services like schools, hospitals, and highways, and it is also used to determine political representation in Congress.

 

Rural areas of New Hampshire are particularly at risk of being undercounted in the census, which makes it more difficult for these areas to receive their fair share of federal support.

 

"An accurate and thorough census count is vital to our economy and our democracy, and I encourage all residents of the United States and New Hampshire to participate in this year's census," Senator Hassan said. "Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Census Bureau has postponed all census volunteers from going door to door, which means it is more important than ever that everyone take the time to fill out their census online, over the phone, or by mail."

 

Over the past few weeks, the Census Bureau mailed invitations to participate in the 2020 Census. These invitations include a 12-digit Census ID for respondents to use when completing the census online at 2020census.gov. Completing the census online is quick, easy, and secure. If your access to the internet is limited, you can respond by calling 1-844-330-2020 or fill out a paper questionnaire. Responses will continue to be collected over the next several weeks to ensure that everyone is counted. All census responses are confidential.
