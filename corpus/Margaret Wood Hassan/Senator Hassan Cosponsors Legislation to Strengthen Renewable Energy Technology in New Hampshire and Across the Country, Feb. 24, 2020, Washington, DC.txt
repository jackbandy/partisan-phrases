Senator Hassan Cosponsors Legislation to Strengthen Renewable Energy Technology in New Hampshire and Across the Country


U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan cosponsored the Grid Modernization Act, which would require the Department of Energy to conduct a research and development program to help strengthen renewable energy through improving electric grid energy storage technology in New Hampshire and across the country. The bill, introduced by Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), directs the Department of Energy to establish a grant program to fund projects to modernize the electric grid, such as investing in electric vehicle chargers and developing more microgrids.

 

"In order to meet the energy needs of the 21st century innovation economy and transition to a renewable future, it is essential that we invest in a modern electric grid that will help lower energy costs and reduce power outages," Senator Hassan said. "The Grid Modernization Act builds on my efforts to improve energy storage and provide clean, reliable, and affordable power to Granite Staters and all Americans."

 

Senator Hassan is focused on lowering energy costs for consumers and reducing carbon emissions. As part of those efforts, the senator reintroduced the National Evaluation of Techniques for Making Energy Technologies More Effective and Resilient (NET METER) Act to create a national study on net metering to guide states interested in developing effective net metering programs. Senator Hassan also led a number of her colleagues in introducing bipartisan legislation to support and expand programs such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a collaborative effort across northeastern states to use market-based tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector. Additionally, Senator Hassan joined Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) in introducing two bipartisan bills to lower energy costs for consumers and increase energy efficiency by reinstating and strengthening tax credits for the construction of new energy efficient homes and for energy efficient home upgrades.
