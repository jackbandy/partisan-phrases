Senator Hassan Statement on Iranian Ballistic Missile Attacks in Iraq


U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan released the following statement after today's address from President Trump regarding the Iranian ballistic missile attacks in Iraq last night:

 

"I join all Americans in denouncing Iran's ballistic missile attacks targeting U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, and am relieved that no Americans were harmed. I'm encouraged that President Trump spoke of reducing military tensions, however, it remains a very dangerous and volatile situation, and it is critical that the Administration continues working to de-escalate the conflict while protecting U.S. military and diplomatic personnel overseas. The Administration needs to brief and consult with Congress, and provide answers about its long-term strategy regarding Iran."
