Senator Hassan Cosponsors Bipartisan Legislation to Help Veterans Dispose of Unwanted Medication


U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan cosponsored bipartisan legislation to create safe, anonymous, and continuously available drop off centers for veterans to easily dispose of unwanted medications, including opioids.  

"One important way to help veterans who are at risk of substance misuse is to ensure that they have access to a consistent and safe location to dispose of unwanted medications," Senator Hassan said. "Amid the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, we must not forget about the other public health emergency, the substance misuse crisis, which has devastated communities across our state. I urge the Senate to swiftly pass this bipartisan, common-sense legislation to help prevent veterans from developing substance use disorders."  

The bipartisan VA Directly Returning Opioid Prescriptions (DROP) Act, introduced by Senators Mike Braun (R-IN) and Todd Young (R-IN), would direct the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure that certain VA medical facilities have physical locations for the disposal of controlled substances.
