Senator Hassan Statement on 47th Anniversary of Supreme Court's Decision in Roe v. Wade


Senator Maggie Hassan released the following statement on the 47th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Roe v. Wade:

 

"Protecting a woman's right to self-determination, including to make her own health care decisions, and ensuring access to important health services is essential to the economic vitality of our families, our communities, and our country. Right now, women's reproductive health care rights are under attack, and efforts to defund critical family planning centers like Planned Parenthood, put the health of millions of Americans at risk. I will continue fighting to protect the rights enshrined in Roe v. Wade and to help ensure that all women have the individual autonomy that is critical to our economic vitality and our democracy."

 

Senator Hassan will continue to fight against any efforts to chip away at the rights afforded under Roe v. Wade. Senator Hassan has led efforts in the Senate to protect Title X family planning centers, such as Planned Parenthood, which provide family planning services for low-income patients and serve nearly 18,000 Granite Staters annually. The Senator also strongly opposes the implementation of the domestic gag rule, a Trump Administration policy that is restricting women's access to critical health services at Title X funded centers across the country. Last year, Senator Hassan joined in introducing the Affordability is Access Act, legislation to make sure over-the-counter birth control is affordable and accessible for women across the country.
