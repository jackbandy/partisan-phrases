Senator Hassan Applauds $4.9 Million Released to New Hampshire to Help Combat Coronavirus


Senator Maggie Hassan released a statement following an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it has released an initial $4.9 million in funding to New Hampshire to help combat the coronavirus outbreak. This funding comes from the bipartisan emergency funding bill that Senator Hassan supported to help states address this evolving public health challenge.

 

"This federal funding is an important first step in supporting New Hampshire's efforts to address the ever-evolving coronavirus outbreak. I am glad that Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to provide this funding to New Hampshire and states across the country as one part of our efforts to support states' work to contain and mitigate the spread of this virus. I will continue to work closely with New Hampshire public health officials and ensure that the needs of communities across our state are met."

 

Senator Hassan is working to support federal, state, and local efforts to combat the spread of this virus. She has participated in numerous briefings and hearings where she has pressed administration officials about their agencies' efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus and provide consistent, accurate information to the public. Last week, Senator Hassan joined with the rest of the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation, Governor Sununu, and state health officials for a briefing on New Hampshire's coronavirus response.
