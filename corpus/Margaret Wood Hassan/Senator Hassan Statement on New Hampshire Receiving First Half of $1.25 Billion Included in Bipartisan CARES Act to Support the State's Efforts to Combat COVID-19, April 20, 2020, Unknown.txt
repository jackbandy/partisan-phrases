Senator Hassan Statement on New Hampshire Receiving First Half of $1.25 Billion Included in Bipartisan CARES Act to Support the State's Efforts to Combat COVID-19


U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan released the following statement on the announcement that New Hampshire has received the first half of the $1.25 billion included in the bipartisan CARES Act to support the state's efforts to confront COVID-19. The CARES Act, which was signed into law last month, included $150 billion to assist states incurring costs and other financial impacts due to the COVID-19 crisis.

 

"This significant injection of federal funding will support the state's efforts to provide frontline workers and communities with resources to slow the spread of this virus and save lives, as well as maintain essential services and support small businesses and workers. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause unprecedented and devastating impacts on Granite Staters and small businesses, I will keep pushing the administration to deliver the federal funding included in the bipartisan CARES Act without delay, including the rest of the $1.25 billion allocated for New Hampshire. I will also continue to work with Governor Sununu and the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation to secure additional funding and flexibility to help our state confront this devastating virus."   

 

Senator Hassan is working to get New Hampshire the resources that it needs to safely and effectively slow the spread of COVID-19. Senator Hassan recently led Senators Mike Rounds (R-SD), Angus King (I-ME), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) -- all former governors -- in calling for the administration to give states the flexibility that they need to put funds to use mitigating the short- and long-term economic impacts of this crisis -- including making up for financial impacts due to COVID-19. Senator Hassan also joined the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation in announcing federal funding from the CARES Act to support New Hampshire, including $164.5 million as an initial installment to New Hampshire's health care providers, $147 million to support priorities including education, public transit, and child care, and $15.2 million to the state's airports.
