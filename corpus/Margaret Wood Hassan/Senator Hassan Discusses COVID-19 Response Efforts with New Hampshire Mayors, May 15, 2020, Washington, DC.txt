Senator Hassan Discusses COVID-19 Response Efforts with New Hampshire Mayors


Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) today heard from mayors across New Hampshire about their priorities for future COVID-19 relief efforts and shared updates on what she is working on in Congress to get local governments the resources that they need to address public health and economic challenges.

 

"First to all of you, thank you so much for the service you give to your cities -- I'm really grateful for that, and I know that these are particularly difficult times," said Senator Hassan in opening up the video conference.

 

Many participants raised the impact that the pandemic is having on local budgets.

 

"Lost revenues are directly related to COVID-19 because of the shutdowns that were necessary public health actions, so I've been pushing to allow state and local governments to use the aid [from Congress] to plug revenue holes that were related to COVID-19. I'll keep pushing for that," said Senator Hassan.

 

In order to prevent layoffs of fire fighters, police officers, teachers, and other critical employees, as well as prevent the cancellation of construction and other projects, Senator Hassan has led efforts in the Senate to push for additional funding and flexibility for state and local governments to help backfill budget shortfalls.

 

Senator Hassan and mayors participating in the call also discussed a wide range of issues including remote learning challenges, the need for additional support for schools, and the long-term impacts of the pandemic.

 

Local leaders who joined the call included Berlin Mayor Paul Grenier, Claremont Mayor Charlene Lovett, Concord Mayor Jim Bouley, Dover Mayor Bob Carrier, Franklin Mayor Tony Giunta, Keene Mayor George Hansel, Laconia Mayor Andrew Hosmer, Lebanon Mayor Tim McNamara, Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig, Portsmouth Mayor Rick Becksted, Rochester Mayor Caroline McCarley, and Somersworth Mayor Dana Hilliard.
