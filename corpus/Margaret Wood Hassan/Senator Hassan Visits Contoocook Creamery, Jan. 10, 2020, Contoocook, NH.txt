Senator Hassan Visits Contoocook Creamery, Discusses Impact of USMCA on Dairy Farmers


Senator Maggie Hassan discussed how the bipartisan U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement will help support dairy farmers in New Hampshire during a visit today to Contoocook Creamery. Earlier this week, Senator Hassan voted in the Senate Finance Committee to advance the USMCA, which was the next major step forward in the trade agreement going into effect.

 

"One of the reasons I support this agreement is because it will help New Hampshire's dairy farmers--both by removing long-standing Canadian trade barriers and providing more trade certainty overall," said Senator Hassan. "I was glad to have the opportunity to discuss the bipartisan trade deal at Contoocook Creamery today, as well as tour the farm. New Hampshire's farms are a vital part of our economy and way of life, and I will continue working to ensure that Contoocook Creamery and farms across our state can thrive."

 

"The US-Mexico-Canada agreement that Senator Hassan worked on will be a big help to us, removing unnecessary barriers to accessing the Canadian market," said Nate Robertson of Contoocook Creamery. "We appreciate what Senator Hassan is doing to get the trade agreement implemented, and it was great to show Senator Hassan our farm and share with her what we're doing to grow our business and serve the community."

Last summer, Senator Hassan questioned former Agriculture Secretary and current President & CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, Tom Vilsack, during a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee focused on the USMCA. The Senator specifically highlighted the importance of strong enforcement mechanisms for dairy provisions.
