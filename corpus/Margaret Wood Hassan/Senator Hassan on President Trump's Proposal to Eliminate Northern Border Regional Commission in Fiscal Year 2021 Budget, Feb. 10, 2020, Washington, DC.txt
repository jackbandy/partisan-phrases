Senator Hassan on President Trump's Proposal to Eliminate Northern Border Regional Commission in Fiscal Year 2021 Budget


Senator Maggie Hassan issued the following statement in response to the President's budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2021 that would eliminate the Northern Border Regional Commission. The Northern Border Regional Commission provides grants that help spur community and economic development for communities in rural areas of the state.

 

"Once again, the Trump Administration proposed a budget that eliminates the Northern Border Regional Commission, which helps spur economic development efforts that can bring new jobs to northern New Hampshire and other rural areas of the state," Senator Hassan said. "These grants have funded projects that help improve efforts to combat the opioid epidemic, strengthen aging infrastructure, and promote workforce development. I will fight to defeat these misguided proposed cuts and ensure that the Northern Border Regional Commission receives the funding it needs to support rural communities in our state."

 

Senator Hassan has consistently worked to support the Northern Border Regional Commission. In the government funding bill for Fiscal Year 2020 -- which is now law -- Senator Hassan supported a $5 million increase for the Northern Border Regional Commission, bringing its total funding up to $25 million, the highest level ever. Last year, when the Trump Administration proposed eliminating the program, Senator Hassan joined the rest of the New Hampshire delegation in strongly opposing the President's proposal. Additionally, the bipartisan Farm Bill that passed in 2018 included a provision that Senator Hassan cosponsored to reauthorize the Northern Border Regional Commission for five years and expand the program to Cheshire and Belknap counties.
