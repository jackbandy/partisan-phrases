Senator Hassan Votes Against Anti-Choice Legislation on Senate Floor


Senator Maggie Hassan released a statement today after voting against two partisan, anti-choice bills that would infringe on women's reproductive health rights.

 

"I am very disappointed by Senator McConnell's decision to bring to the floor extreme anti-choice legislation that would undermine the personal and economic freedom of women, rather than bring up bipartisan legislation to lower prescription drug costs or protect maternal and infant health," Senator Hassan said. "These political attacks by Senate Republicans and the Trump Administration to strip women of their constitutional rights must stop -- they threaten women's autonomy, health, and economic freedom. I will never let up in my efforts to ensure that women receive fair and equal treatment in all aspects of their lives."

 

Senator Hassan will continue to fight against any efforts to chip away at the rights afforded under Roe v. Wade. Senator Hassan has led efforts in the Senate to protect and robustly fund Title X family planning centers, such as Planned Parenthood, which provide family planning services for low-income patients and serve nearly 18,000 Granite Staters annually. The Senator also strongly opposes the implementation of the domestic gag rule, a Trump Administration policy that is restricting women's access to critical health services at Title X funded centers across the country. Last year, Senator Hassan joined in introducing the Affordability is Access Act, legislation to make sure over-the-counter birth control is affordable and accessible for women across the country.
