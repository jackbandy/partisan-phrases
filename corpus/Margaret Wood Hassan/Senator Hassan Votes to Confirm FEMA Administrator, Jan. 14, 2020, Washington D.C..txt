Senator Hassan Votes to Confirm FEMA Administrator


U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management, voted today to confirm Peter Gaynor as the next Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

 

"When disaster hits, people across the United States must be able to count on FEMA to respond in a timely and effective way," said Senator Hassan. "As we face an increasing number of natural disasters tied to climate change, FEMA's work is even more critical to save lives and protect economic stability. As a leader on the Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management Subcommittee, I look forward to working with FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor to support our communities and to holding FEMA accountable through continued oversight."

 

In the nomination hearing for Gaynor, Senator Hassan emphasized the effects of climate change on U.S. safety and security, as well as FEMA's role in helping communities prepare for cyberattacks that have been affecting key services at schools, hospitals, municipalities, county governments and state agencies across the country. Last year, the Senate passed legislation cosponsored by Senator Hassan to improve the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) ability to efficiently and effectively respond to natural disasters. Senator Hassan pressed FEMA in 2017 over the federal government's inadequate response and relief efforts for Puerto Rico.

 

Last year, the President signed into law legislation cosponsored by Senator Hassan to support first responders by allowing federal employees to assist with FEMA's Urban Search and Rescue efforts. In addition, Senator Hassan supported a provision in the final bipartisan government funding agreement that was signed into law in December that will quadruple FEMA funding available to states to protect non-profit institutions, including houses of worship.
