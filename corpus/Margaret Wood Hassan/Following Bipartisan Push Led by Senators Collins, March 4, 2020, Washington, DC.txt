Following Bipartisan Push Led by Senators Collins, Hassan, Department of Education Halts Cuts to Rural, Low-Income Schools


Following the Department of Education's announcement to halt a change to the methodology that determines which rural schools are eligible for funding through the Rural Low-Income Schools (RLIS) program, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) released a statement on this major win for more than 800 rural, low-income schools nationwide:

 

"The Department of Education made the right decision.  We are pleased that the Department listened to the bipartisan opposition to this misguided change.  Had it not, more than 800 rural, low-income schools could have lost crucial funding and been forced to forgo essential activities and services, such as technology upgrades and expanded class offerings for reading, physical education, art, music, and distance learning," said Senator Collins and Hassan in a joint statement.  "We look forward to working with the Department to serve students learning in our rural communities in Maine, New Hampshire, and across our country."

 

Earlier today, Senators Collins and Hassan led a letter signed by 20 of their colleagues urging the Department to reverse this abrupt change.
