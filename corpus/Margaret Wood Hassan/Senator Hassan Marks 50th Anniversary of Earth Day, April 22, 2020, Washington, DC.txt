Senator Hassan Marks 50th Anniversary of Earth Day


U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan released the following statement in recognition of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day:

 

"As we all grapple with the terrible impacts of COVID-19, data that links air pollution to an increase in COVID-19 deaths is a reminder of why it's more important than ever that we work together to combat the existential threat of climate change and protect our land, air, and water. Yet the Trump administration refuses to strengthen protections for clean air and is still working to undermine critical environmental protections that help protect public health. Now more than ever, we need strong action to protect the health of our planet and our citizens. I will continue to push back against this administration's efforts to undermine environmental protections and to recommit America to be a global leader in the fight against climate change."

 

Following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) refusal to strengthen ambient air quality standards, Senator Hassan led a group of her colleagues in raising concerns about the decision. The EPA's decision pertains to fine particulate matter, which can travel deep into the respiratory tract and worsen lung and heart health and has been shown to increase the risk of death or serious illness for an individual who contracts COVID-19.
