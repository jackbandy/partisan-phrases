Senator Hassan Statement on VA Barring GI Funding for Colleges & Universities with Deceptive Marketing, Enrollment Practices


Following the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) announcement that it will end GI Bill payments to five colleges and universities due to deceptive marketing or enrollment practices, U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) released the following statement:

"Veterans working to earn a higher education degree already face many barriers, and it is unconscionable that some educational institutions take advantage of veterans with false or deceptive marketing and enrollment practices. I have long worked to hold shady for-profit colleges and universities accountable when they try to mislead veterans and taxpayers, and I am encouraged that the VA is barring new GI Bill funds from going to the five schools announced yesterday. I will continue to work with the VA and with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take action against institutions who engage in deceptive practices."

Last year, Senators Hassan and Dick Durbin (D-IL) introduced legislation to protect students -- including service members and veterans -- and taxpayers from predatory and anti-student higher education practices and ensure that higher education meets the needs of hard-working students.
