Senator Hassan Statement on Trump Administration's Decision to End National Guard Deployment One Day Before Many Would Qualify for Benefits During COVID-19


U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan released the following statement about the Trump administration's decision to end the deployment of the National Guard to help respond to the COVID-19 pandemic one day before members would qualify for additional federal education and retirement benefits.

"The men and women of the New Hampshire National Guard have bravely stepped up to serve their fellow citizens in the midst of this pandemic, and their assistance is still needed," Senator Hassan said. "The end of this deployment should be determined by the needs of the American people, and I urge the Trump administration to extend their deployment so that they can continue supporting state response efforts. If the Trump administration moves forward with this plan to deny National Guard members benefits, it will hurt both our Guard members and the American people who are struggling to weather this pandemic."

 

Senator Hassan joined the rest of the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation in urging the Trump administration to extend the authorization of the New Hampshire National Guard to serve Granite Staters through June 30. Despite their outreach, the Trump administration released an authorization for extensions that will end on June 24, one day before any National Guard members would reach the 90-day threshold to become eligible to qualify for certain federal education and retirement benefits.
