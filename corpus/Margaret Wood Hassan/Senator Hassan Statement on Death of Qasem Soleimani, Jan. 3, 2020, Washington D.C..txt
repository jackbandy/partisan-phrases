Senator Hassan Statement on Death of Qasem Soleimani


Senator Maggie Hassan issued the following statement following a U.S. military air strike that killed Iranian Quds Force Commander, Qasem Soleimani:

 

"Soleimani was an enemy of the United States who was responsible for the murder of thousands, including U.S. service members. This is an incredibly volatile situation, and our first priority must be protecting U.S. troops and interests around the world. The Administration needs to proceed with great caution, consult with Congress, and be clear with the American people about its strategy."
