Senator Hassan Statement on U.S. Death Toll from COVID-19 Topping 100,000


U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan released the following statement as the death toll in the United States hits 100,000 as a result of the COVID-19 virus:

"We should all stop today to mourn the more than 100,000 fellow Americans we have now lost to COVID-19. I want to express my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those we lost; their absences will be felt in our communities for years to come. As we pass this solemn milestone, I also want to thank all of the people who have served our communities during this time: health care workers, law enforcement, grocery store employees, postal workers, and the countless Granite Staters who are doing their part to contain the spread of this virus and support our recovery efforts. The road ahead will not be easy, but I am confident that the American spirit of perseverance and resilience will prevail, and that we will get through this. In the meantime, I will continue to do everything in my power to push for additional legislation that meets the magnitude and seriousness of this crisis and supports our families and businesses during this challenging time."
