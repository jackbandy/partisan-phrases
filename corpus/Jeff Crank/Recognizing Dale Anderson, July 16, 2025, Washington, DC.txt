Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank Dale Anderson  for his service to the Fifth Congressional District of Colorado for  over 18 years.

Dale served my predecessor, Congressman Doug Lamborn, in several  roles, and he served as a senior adviser in my office.

Before working for Congress, Dale served our country in the Army for  9 years, and his keen strategic eye and leadership are evident in  everything that he does.

Dale has served me in building relationships in the business  community, the defense sector, and our district. His extensive  knowledge of the district has proven invaluable to me and my team.

I am certain that these relationships and skills will serve him well  as he continues to serve the Pikes Peak region in his new role at the  Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce as the senior vice president.

I wish Dale and his wife, Jenni, the very best as they return to  Colorado Springs, and I thank them for their service and their  sacrifice to the Fifth Congressional District of Colorado.
