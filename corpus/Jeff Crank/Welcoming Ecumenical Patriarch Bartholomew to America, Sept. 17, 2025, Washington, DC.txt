Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew, the Spiritual Head of the second largest Christian church  in the world who is visiting our Nation's Capital this week. Back home  in Colorado's 5th Congressional District, Archangel Michael Greek  Orthodox Church is the home for many of my constituents of the Greek  Orthodox faith. I welcome the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, wish  him well during his time in America, and thank him for his leadership  for the Orthodox Christian faith around the world, numbering 300  million.
