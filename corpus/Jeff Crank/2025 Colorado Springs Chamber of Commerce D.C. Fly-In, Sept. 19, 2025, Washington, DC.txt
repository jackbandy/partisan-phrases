2025 Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce D.C. Fly-In


Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the Colorado Springs  Chamber of Commerce for hosting the chamber fly-in to Washington, D.C.,  this week.

Over 90 members of the Chamber, from the Aerospace and Defense,  Energy, Housing, and Community Development sectors, among others, made  the journey to our Nation's Capital.

I had the opportunity to meet with several of these business leaders  individually. We discussed how we can work together to lower  regulations, support businesses, and keep jobs in our community. Many  of these business leaders are the reason why the Pikes Peak region is  becoming one of the economic titans of the West.

Relationships are the most important part of the legislative process,  and I look forward to continuing to work together with these and every  business leader in the Fifth Congressional District to continue to grow  our thriving community.
