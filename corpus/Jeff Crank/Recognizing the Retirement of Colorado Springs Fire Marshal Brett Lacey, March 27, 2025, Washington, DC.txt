Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement of  Colorado Springs Fire Marshal Brett Lacey.

Marshal Lacey joined Colorado Springs Fire Department in 1992, and he  has faithfully served our community  for 32 years. Marshal Lacey was instrumental in helping protect our  community through his leadership in prioritizing structure and  vegetation management, as he established a nationally renowned wildfire  mitigation program.

Marshal Lacey was onsite and led the efforts to combat the Waldo  Canyon fire and saved my own home and thousands of others in the Black  Forest fire that devastated our community, in addition to helping  recover victims of Hurricane Katrina.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating and  thanking Fire Marshal Brett Lacey for his service to our country and to  the Pikes Peak region.
