Congratulating the United States Military


Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the United  States military on their successful bombing of the three nuclear  facilities in Iran over the weekend.

Imagine flying 37 hours in a B-2 bomber to defang a nuclear Iran.  These successful strikes proved to the world yet again that the United  States military is the best and most capable in the world.

I thank the men and women of U.S. Northern Command and Cheyenne  Mountain in my district in Colorado Springs for detecting missile  launches and helping pass on that intelligence.

I believe that under no circumstance should Iran, the largest state  sponsor of terrorism, have nuclear weapons. The President's decision  took courage, courage that other Presidents in the past just didn't  have.

I am an unwavering supporter of the Nation of Israel and in bringing  any Iranian nuclear weapons programs to a swift and decisive end.
