Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the resilience of  Harrison High School senior Zariea Patrick.

In 2023, during Zariea's sophomore year, she and her Harrison  classmates were playing basketball when Zariea took a hard elbow to the  side of her head as she went for a layup, leaving her with a  concussion.

As her symptoms worsened, an MRI at the hospital confirmed a tumor  lodged in the right side of Zariea's brain. What followed were regular  trips to the hospital for chemotherapy, which took a terrible toll on  her physical well-being.

In the spring of 2024, they believed that the tumor showed  improvement. Unfortunately, she recently learned that she would have to  start chemotherapy all over again. Despite this, her perseverance and  her bright smile continue to light up the entire community.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in praying for Zariea during her  battle with this tumor.
