Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight The Flying W  Wranglers band, who are part of The Flying W Wranglers Original Western  Stage Show at the Flying W Ranch in Colorado Springs. Flying W Ranch  was opened in 1947 by the Wilson family, who hosted their first potluck  in 1953. It has evolved into the entertaining and iconic dinner and  show that it is today which hosts hundreds of people on a regular  occurrence.

The Flying W Wranglers band, which was formally named in 1957, have  performed at every show at the ranch since 1953 and are the second  oldest Western performance band in the world. Mr. Speaker, I can  personally attest to the Flying W Wranglers' skill and musical ability.  They truly are talented and entertaining cowboys. I am proud to have  such a historic and family-friendly Western show in my district.
