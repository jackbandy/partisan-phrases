Raid in Colorado Springs

Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, the Colorado Springs Police  Department, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office, and the Drug  Enforcement Administration worked hard to do a raid in my hometown of  Colorado Springs, Colorado. They arrested over 100 folks who are very  likely illegally in our country. They found drugs, and they found sex  trafficking of minors and of women.

Colorado Springs is safer today because of the policies of the Trump  administration. As we celebrate 100 days of President Trump's  administration, this is part of what he has brought to us.

There were MS-13, Hells Angels, and Tren de Aragua there. They  frequented this nightclub that was shut down.

We are in this mess because of far-left policies from our Governor in  Colorado, Governor Jared Polis, our State legislature, and the Biden  administration.

I thank Sheriff Joe Roybal and all of the people from El Paso County  Sheriff's Office and the Colorado Springs Police Department.
