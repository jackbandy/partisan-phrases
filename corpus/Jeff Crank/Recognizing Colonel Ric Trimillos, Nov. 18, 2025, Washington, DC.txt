Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel Ric  Trimillos for his extraordinary dedication and service as Scoutmaster  of Troop 66 in Colorado Springs.

For years, Ric has served as a mentor and a role model to the Scouts  of Troop 66. His commitment to the principles of scouting has created a  nurturing environment where Scouts are encouraged to grow into  responsible, competent leaders.

Ric's ability to connect with youth, guide them through challenges,  and celebrate their achievements is a testament to his deep compassion  and unwavering dedication.

Under his guidance, Troop 66 has thrived. Ric has led countless  campouts, service projects, and leadership training events, always with  a focus on building resilience, teamwork, and respect.

His mentorship has helped many Scouts earn the rank of Eagle Scout  and, more importantly, has instilled in them a lifelong commitment to  service and integrity.

On behalf of all of those whose lives he has touched, I extend my  deepest gratitude and heartfelt recognition.
