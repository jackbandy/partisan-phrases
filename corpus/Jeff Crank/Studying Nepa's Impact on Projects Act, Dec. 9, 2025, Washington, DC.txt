Mr. CRANK.  573, the bill now under  consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 573, which would  consolidate prior NEPA data collection and reporting efforts into a  single report published annually by the Council on Environmental  Quality, or CEQ. This bill ensures that consistent, transparent  permitting data is available and accessible to the public.

It is well known that our permitting system is mired with substantial  delays. Many of these issues stem from burdensome and lengthy  environmental documents and lawsuits instigated by special interest  groups.

In past administrations, CEQ has published reports on NEPA litigation  and environmental reviews. From 2001 to 2013, annual surveys recorded  the defendant agency, plaintiff category, and case results, showing  that special interest groups, not individual citizens or communities,  were responsible for the most NEPA cases.

Although these CEQ studies provided useful data on the cumbersome  review timelines and resource strains resulting from NEPA analysis,  they have either been produced ad hoc or attention to their continued  production has fallen by the wayside.

Similar to CEQ's annual litigation surveys conducted between 2001 and  2013, the reports required by this bill would include information  related to any NEPA-related civil action brought against an agency and  would identify the lead Federal agency, each plaintiff, and case  outcome. This information will allow Congress to identify who is suing  to block critical infrastructure projects and examine the end result of  the litigation on the project itself.

This bill would also build off the first Trump administration's NEPA  reports conducted in 2020 by directing CEQ to review the page length of  environmental impact statements and the timelines to complete such EIS,  with updates published annually. This information will give Congress  better insight into whether agencies are respecting the NEPA deadlines  and page limits created in the Fiscal Responsibility Act.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the lead sponsor of this legislation,  Representative Yakym, for his hard work on this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, the Studying NEPA's Impact on Projects Act  will provide Congress with crucial information on NEPA litigation. It  will also provide transparency to help ensure that agencies comply with  the Fiscal Responsibility Act's NEPA deadlines and page limits.

I thank Mr. Yakym and Mr. Panetta for their work on this bill, and I  urge my colleagues to support the bill.
