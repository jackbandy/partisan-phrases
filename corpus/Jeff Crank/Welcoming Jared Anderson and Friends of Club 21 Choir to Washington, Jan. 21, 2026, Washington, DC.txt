Welcoming Jared Anderson and Friends of Club 21 Choir to Washington, D.C.


Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to welcome Jared Anderson and  the Friends of Club 21 Choir here to Washington, D.C.

The choir, composed of talented individuals living with Down syndrome  and who are based in Colorado's Fifth Congressional District, will be  performing the national anthem to launch the March for Life rally this  Friday.

Club 21 came and visited me just a couple of months ago here in  Washington, D.C., and it is really one of the highlights of my time as  being a Member of Congress. They have uplifted the Pikes Peak community  onto the national platform, amplifying and empowering these brilliant  performers through the arts and education.

I thank them for dedicating their time, their energy, and their  passion in advocating for every human life.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in giving a warm welcome to the  Friends of Club 21 Choir.
