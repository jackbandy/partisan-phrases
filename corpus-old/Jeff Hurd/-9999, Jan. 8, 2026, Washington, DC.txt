Mr. HURD of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, our colleague Doug LaMalfa passed  away on Monday, and I want to take just a minute--he would have liked  that--to honor him the best way that I know how: plainly.

Doug believed that we should speak clearly, not in jargon. He had a  whiteboard in his office labeled unacceptable words, and he meant it.  The words ``stakeholders,'' ``empower,'' and ``equity'' were banned. He  thought government should sound more like the people it serves. He  hated what I called LaMalfa-isms, overcomplicated government  explanations for simple things, like saying that the transportation  infrastructure is undergoing a temporary operational suspension pending  structural optimization instead of just saying that the bridge is  closed for repairs.

Doug loved this institution. He loved the West. He loved 1-minute  speeches. I will miss his humor, his directness, and the clarity he  brought to a town that too often hides behind big words. May he rest in  peace.
