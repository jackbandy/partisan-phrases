Recognizing Colorado State Champions, the Grand Mesa Little League Senior All-Stars


Mr. HURD of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  remarkable group of young men and their coaches from Western Colorado,  the Grand Mesa Senior All Stars baseball team.

This summer, these players, ages 14 to 16, won the Colorado Senior  Little League State Championship in Grand Junction. They went on to  compete in California for the regional title against some of the best  teams in the West, proudly representing Colorado with grit and  determination.

The team brings together players from across our district, including  Grand Junction, Clifton, Palisade, Parachute, and Rifle. They first  captured the district championship and then fought their way through  the state finals, defeating two tough Denver-area teams to claim back- to-back state titles--their third in just four years.

Their success is built not only on talent but also on the dedication  of their coaches, the support of their families, and the spirit of  their communities. I am proud of these young men and honored to  celebrate the Grand Mesa Senior All Stars for the way they represented  the Western Slope and the State of Colorado.
