Recognizing 2025 Small Community of the Year: Rico, Colorado


Mr. HURD of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  celebrate the town of Rico, Colorado, for being named the 2025 Small  Community of the Year by the Economic Development Council of Colorado.

Rico, known by its town motto, A Slice of Paradise, is home to just  under 300 residents and sits along the beautiful Dolores River, nestled  among the San Juan Mountains. The town of Rico was established in 1880.

Originally a mining community, the area has become known throughout  Colorado for its gorgeous scenery, its incredible outdoor recreation,  and its unique tourist attractions.

This year's award honors Rico for excellence in both leadership and  economic development. The town earned this distinction through its  commitment to revitalizing critical infrastructure, including a new  sewer system and reinvesting in community spaces like their town park.  These efforts reflect the vision and determination of a community that  takes pride in where they live and works hard to build a stronger  future.

Rico exemplifies what it means to be a small-town community in  western Colorado. Its commitment to progress and service will continue  to enrich the lives of many Coloradans.

I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the town of Rico for this  well-deserved recognition.
