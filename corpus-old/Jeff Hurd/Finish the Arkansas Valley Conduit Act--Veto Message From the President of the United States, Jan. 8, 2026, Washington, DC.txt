Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act--Veto Message From the President of the United States


Mr. HURD of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues  to vote to override the President's veto of H.R. 131, the Finish the  Arkansas Valley Conduit Act.

This is not a symbolic vote. It is not messaging. It is not partisan.  This is a test of whether Congress keeps its word not just to  southeastern Colorado but to every community in every State and  district that depends on Federal commitments being honored.

For those of us who represent the American West, this vote is  personal. In the West, water means survival. It means whether  communities grow or disappear, whether agriculture survives, and  whether moms can trust the water they give their kids out of the tap.  Westerners understand something instinctively: When the government  makes a water promise, it should keep it.

In 1962, Congress authorized the Arkansas Valley Conduit to deliver  safe drinking water to rural communities in southeastern Colorado.  These communities grow amazing watermelons, cantaloupes, and chilies,  and support families who ranch and raise livestock.

When we talk about honoring Federal commitments, we are talking about  whether the people who grow our food can have clean water.

Decades later, that promise remains unfinished. More than 50,000  Coloradans, across a distance spanning more than some Eastern States,  still rely on contaminated and radioactive groundwater. Eighteen  systems are under enforcement orders for violating EPA standards. These  are real families, real towns, and real public health consequences.

Rural Colorado and rural America more broadly voted overwhelmingly  for this President and for an agenda that promised they would not be  forgotten. They expected Washington to keep its word, not abandon them  midway.

H.R. 131 doesn't expand this drinking water project, authorize new  construction, increase the Federal share, or create any new  entitlement. It doesn't bail out any mismanagement. It simply gives  rural communities more time and flexibility to repay the Federal  Government. It extends the repayment period and lowers the interest  rate in cases of economic hardship. It prevents hundreds of millions of  dollars from being stranded mid-construction. It lets communities doing  their part and repaying the government finally access clean water.

This bill passed both Houses unanimously. Republicans and Democrats  from across the entire country all agreed: This is a project worth  completing, not abandoning.

Mr. Speaker, veto overrides are rare, and they should be. However,  the Constitution gave Congress this authority for moments exactly like  this: when the legislative branch speaks with unity and clarity, and  the executive branch says no anyway.

In modern congressional history, it is extraordinarily rare, and  perhaps unprecedented, for a President to veto a bill that passed both  Chambers unanimously while his party holds unified control of the  government. That should give every Member pause.

If Congress cannot keep a clear, longstanding, bipartisan commitment  like this, then what message does that send to communities in every  State and every district relying on similar commitments? What certainty  do they have that our word means anything?

Yesterday, the administration issued a statement opposing this  override, claiming it continues failed policies of the past and burdens  taxpayers with a local water project. This is not a new water project.  It is a federally authorized water system underway for decades with  consistent bipartisan congressional support. This exact project was  previously celebrated by this President himself. On October 3, 2020,  President Trump's Department of the Interior issued a press release  titled: ``Trump administration breaks ground on long-awaited Arkansas  Valley Conduit to bring safe, clean water to rural Colorado  communities.''

Earlier that year, the President visited Colorado and praised the  Arkansas Valley Conduit. He said that we got the money to begin  construction. His own Secretary of the Interior broke ground on this  project.

If the project was worth supporting in a campaign rally and  celebrating at a groundbreaking, then surely it is worth finishing. It  was the right position then, and it is the right position now.

Mr. Speaker, if a bill that passed unanimously that costs almost  nothing and fulfills a 60-year Federal promise and protects public  health can be vetoed under these circumstances, then bipartisan work in  this institution is at risk.

I ask my colleagues: How would you feel if a project like this in  your district that was passed unanimously and fulfilled a decades-long  promise was vetoed anyway? That is what these rural communities are  facing.

Mr. Speaker, my constituents are watching, and your constituents are  watching, to see whether Congress means what it says. This vote is not  about defying a President. It is about defending Congress. It is about  strengthening this institution and standing for the people who trust us  to fight for them.

For those of us who represent the West, this is also about standing  together. Western water projects are long-term, complex, and federally  driven by necessity. If Congress walks away from a 60-year commitment  mid-project, then no Western project is truly secure, and no district  anywhere in the country can trust that a Federal infrastructure promise  will be kept.

I ran for Congress to fight for my district, even when it is  difficult, even when it is uncomfortable, and even when the outcome is  uncertain. This is one of those moments.

Mr. Speaker, some of my colleagues may be feeling pressure today to  accept the veto. I get it. However, I would ask every Member to  consider the pressure felt by the communities they represent,  especially those in rural America who need infrastructure built, who  need clean water, and who need Washington to mean what it says.

What does it say to them, to all of our constituents, if this  institution makes this kind of commitment and walks away when it  matters most?

This override is about finishing what we started, honoring  commitments, protecting taxpayer dollars, and standing by rural  communities. Yes, it is also about protecting this institution.

For these reasons, I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote to  override the veto of H.R. 131.
