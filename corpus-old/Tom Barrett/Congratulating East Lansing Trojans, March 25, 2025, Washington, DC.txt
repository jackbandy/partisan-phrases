Congratulating East Lansing Trojans


Mr. BARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the East  Lansing Trojans on an incredible achievement, winning the State  championship with a hard-fought 66-46 victory just a couple of weeks  ago.

While the Michigan State Spartans are making a deep run in the  tournament in the men's college basketball tournament this month, they  need to look no further than across town at the East Lansing boys'  basketball team to see another championship team in East Lansing.

This championship is the result of countless hours of practice and  years of hard work, and it serves as a capstone to all of the time  spent perfecting their craft, playing as a team, and working under the  leadership of head coach Ray Mitchell.

A sincere congratulations to each and every one of them. This is a  wonderful achievement, and our city is very proud of them.                Congratulating Fowler Eagles Girls Basketball

Mr. BARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Fowler Eagles  girls' basketball team, who captured the State championship this past  weekend with a commanding 53-29 victory.

I was at the Breslin Center to watch the game with two of my  daughters: Eleanora, who just finished her first season of basketball,  and Gwen, who is excited to start playing next year. These young ladies  on the basketball court really served as a great example for my own  daughters and so many others across our State.

What we saw was more than just great basketball. We saw poise,  teamwork, and excellence, especially for young girls like my daughters  who could watch that in action.

I thank the Fowler Eagles for inspiring the next generation and  making our community proud. Gwen, my 7-year-old, wants autographs from  each team member, so I hope we can catch up with them sometime for  that.

Congratulations to the team on an incredible season. Our city is so  proud of them.
