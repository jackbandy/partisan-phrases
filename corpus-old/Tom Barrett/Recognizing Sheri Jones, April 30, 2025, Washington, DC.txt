Recognizing Sheri Jones


Mr. BARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true legend in  Michigan broadcasting, Sheri Jones, who is retiring after nearly 37  years as a trusted voice and compassionate presence on WLNS-TV 6 in  Lansing.

Since 1987, Sheri has been more than a news anchor--she's been a  steady, reassuring presence in our homes. Her warm demeanor and  unwavering professionalism have made her a beloved figure across mid- Michigan. Whether reporting breaking news or moderating debates. Sheri  brought clarity, dignity, and heart to every story she told.

Her excellence has not gone unnoticed. Sheri is a proud inductee of  both the Michigan Journalism Hall of Fame and the Michigan Association  of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. She's received multiple Emmy nominations,  accolades from the Associated Press, and recognition from the Michigan  Association of Broadcasting. Sheri is also a proud member of the Silver  Circle of the Michigan chapter of the National Academy of Television  Arts and Sciences--an honor reserved for those who have devoted a  quarter-century or more to broadcast excellence.

But Sheri's impact goes far beyond the newsroom. She's been a  tireless advocate on the frontlines of some of our most pressing  issues--raising awareness about the opioid crisis, mental health, and  human trafficking. Additionally. she has used her platform not just to  inform, but to inspire change.

Sheri Jones is more than a journalist--she is a storyteller, a  mentor, a community champion, and a true public servant. Her retirement  marks the end of an era for Michigan journalism, but her legacy will  continue in the lives she's touched, the issues she's illuminated, and  the community she's helped build.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and a grateful mid- Michigan community in recognizing Sheri for her decades of service and  wishing her all the best in this well-earned next chapter.
