Personnel Oversight and Shift Tracking Act of 2025


Mr. BARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3425) to direct the Director of the Federal Protective  Service to establish processes to strengthen oversight, performance,  and accountability of contract security personnel engaged in the  protection of certain buildings and grounds, and for other purposes, as  amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3425

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Personnel Oversight and       Shift Tracking Act of 2025'' or the ``POST Act of 2025''.       SEC. 2. IMPROVED DATA COLLECTION AND PERFORMANCE                     ACCOUNTABILITY.

(a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Director of the Federal Protective       Service shall establish processes to strengthen oversight,       performance, and accountability of contract security       personnel engaged in the protection of buildings and grounds       that are owned, occupied, or secured by the General Services       Administration Public Buildings Service.

(b) Oversight of Contract Security Personnel.--In carrying       out the activities described in subsection (a), the Director       shall--

(1) establish standards for the collection, maintenance,       and analysis of covert testing data, including the creation       of a comprehensive       and uniform method for documenting test outcomes, identifying       root causes of failures, and categorizing types of       vulnerabilities detected;

(2) begin conducting quarterly analytical reviews of covert       testing data to identify trends, recurring deficiencies, and       opportunities for operational improvement across all covered       facilities;

(3) direct the security contractor who is providing       security services to the Federal Protective Service to       establish a mandatory, cause-specific corrective training and       performance improvement plan for any contract security       personnel who fail a covert test and review the security       contractor's performance improvement plan to ensure that the       security contractor has and will provide appropriate training       and procedures to avoid any future covert testing failures;       and

(4) develop updated security training guidance for contract       security personnel to reflect findings from covert testing       data, emerging threats, and best practices.

Nothing in this Act shall be construed as designating an       employee of a contractor of the Department of Homeland       Security who is engaged in the protection of Federal property       pursuant to section 1315 of title 40, United States Code, as       a Federal employee.

Mr. BARRETT.  3425, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3425, the POST Act of 2025, strengthens the Federal  Protective Service, or FPS, and their ability to secure Federal  facilities and improve accountability for the contract guards who  protect them.

The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has conducted  bipartisan oversight of FPS operations and Federal facility security.  Both testimony at hearings and Government Accountability Office reports  have reinforced the need for these reforms.

The Federal Protective Service is tasked with securing approximately  9,000 GSA-leased and -owned facilities across America. To protect these  buildings, FPS oversees over 15,000 contracted guards, known as  protective security officers.

Despite the size and importance of the FPS' mission, serious  vulnerabilities exist in its oversight of contract guards. For example,  one GAO investigation found that contracted guards failed to detect  concealed weapons, including batons and pepper spray, in half of covert  security tests. While FPS uses covert testing to assess security  vulnerabilities, they lack a standardized system to track, analyze, and  respond to the results.

The POST Act addresses this critical gap by requiring the FPS  Director to establish and maintain a centralized database to capture  covert test data, including why a contract guard failed to detect  contraband.

The legislation mandates quarterly analyses of this data to identify  trends and training needs and requires targeted, corrective training  for guards who fail covert tests, which helps to close performance gaps  and improve public safety.

This is a commonsense reform that turns the tests that FPS is already  conducting into data that can drive actionable improvements, making  Federal buildings safer for employees and the American people who we  serve.

The POST Act also tackles another persistent problem: FPS' broken  shift tracking system.

In 2018, FPS launched the Post Tracking System to modernize its  paper-based guard sign-in process. Seven years later, the Post Tracking  System remains unreliable, and FPS still relies on paper records.

As a result, FPS has been unable to issue timely notifications to  tenant agencies about guard shortages. In some cases, this even forced  the closure of Federal buildings to the public.

The POST Act would require FPS to either fix PTS or replace it with a  modern, dependable solution.

H.R. 3425 contains practical measures to improve FPS' oversight of  contract guards, strengthen accountability, and improve safety at  Federal buildings.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Kennedy) for his  leadership on this legislation and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Figures) for working on this bipartisan bill.

Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3425, as amended, strengthens oversight of the  Federal Protective Service's contract guard program and ensures  protective security officers are properly trained and accountable.  Additionally, and importantly, this legislation modernizes critical  systems to make Federal buildings safer for employees and the public.

Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 3425, as amended, and I yield  back the balance of my time.

Mr. BARRETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
