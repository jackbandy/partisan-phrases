President Trump Tariffs


Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to say that tariffs on  Canada are going to blow a hole in the United States automotive  industry.

I ask the President to not put 25 percent tariffs on Canadian goods.  Our automakers, our supply chain, and our autoworkers cannot take this  hit.

Let's work together to come up with a plan to invest in manufacturing  in a bipartisan, commonsense way. These tariffs are not the answer.  This is a threat to too many livelihoods. Listen to the autoworker.
