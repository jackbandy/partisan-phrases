Community Violence Intervention Funding


Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the counselors,  outreach workers, and credible messengers who save lives as community  violence interrupters in Michigan and across the Nation.

These programs, supported by the Community Violence Intervention  funding, deescalate conflicts, mediate retaliation, and connect people  to essential services like jobs, housing, and mental health care to  break cycles of violence.

The impact is undeniable. From May to July of this year, Detroit's  CVI zones saw about a 30 percent drop in homicides and shootings with  some neighborhoods faring even better.

Despite this, cuts are taking their toll. This spring, the Department  of Justice rescinded over $800 million in grants, including $150  million for CVI efforts. Michigan programs lost millions, forcing  layoffs and cuts. Worse, the current budget would slash dedicated CVI  funding even further, jeopardizing these lifesaving efforts.

Congress must act to restore funding and protect proven prevention  strategies.
