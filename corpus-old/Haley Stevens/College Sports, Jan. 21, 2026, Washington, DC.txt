College Sports


Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, after Monday's college football national  championship, I rise to express my concern about the trend of private  equity firms attempting to buy up college sports. These deals will be  bad for athletes, students, and fans.

We have seen this play before. Media corporations' pursuit of college  football and basketball viewers created nonsensical conference  realignment that destroyed the regional nature of  college sport. For generations, the Big Ten was known as the Midwestern  Conference. In recent decades, that identity has slowly been eroded as  coastal schools were admitted in the name of more revenue and higher  profits.

Now private equity is looking to buy college sports revenue streams.  If these deals are normalized, it is only a matter of time before  private investors demand control over our university athletic  departments. This creates the risk of further conference realignment,  cutting nonrevenue sports, and expanding for-profit influence over  universities.

This is why I have sent a letter with my Republican colleagues to end  the NCAA.
