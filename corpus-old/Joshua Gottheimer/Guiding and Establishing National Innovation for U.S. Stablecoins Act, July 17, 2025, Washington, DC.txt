Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act


Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan  GENIUS Act. This legislation builds on the bicameral negotiations that  Chairman Hill, former Chairman McHenry, Chairman Steil, and I, and so  many others, have worked so hard on for the past years.

The GENIUS Act is smart bipartisan legislation that backs stablecoins  through the U.S. dollar on a 1-to-1 basis and allows States to make  future safeguards to further protect consumers.

The GENIUS Act, as I said, protects consumers and gives clear rules  of the road to allow America to lead the way in a space that is key to  our economy. It cracks down on illicit finance, helps counter bad  actors, and reinforces the global strength of the dollar, all while  lowering the cost of payments and making transactions happen in just  seconds.

The bill has already passed the Senate in a strong bipartisan way.  Now, it is time for us to clarify rules for stablecoins, protect  consumers, and promote American innovation.

As I said before, when we were talking about the CLARITY Act, the  question is: Do we want some rules of the road or no rules of the road?  To vote against this bill and to vote against the CLARITY Act is  irresponsible if you want to make sure that the Trump coin has  oversight and that consumers are protected.

Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, to not pass this legislation is deeply  irresponsible. It will allow the Wild West to continue.

This will protect consumers and ensure that the Trump coin and others  are overseen, with protection and oversight from the CFTC. It is  critically important for protecting consumers and protecting our  country.
