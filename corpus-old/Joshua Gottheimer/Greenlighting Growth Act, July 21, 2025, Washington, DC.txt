Greenlighting Growth Act


Mr. Speaker, as a special accommodation for their smaller size and to  reduce their regulatory burden, emerging growth companies, known as  EGCs, are typically only required to provide 2 years of audited  financials when they first go public. Other public companies, on the  other hand, are required to provide 3 years of audited financials when  they go public. In some situations, an EGC must provide 3 years of  financials, such as an EGC acquiring another company or conducting a  follow-on offering after its IPO.

This bill will eliminate this regulatory hurdle by ensuring EGCs only  need to provide 2 years, not 3, of audited financials across the board,  whether for an IPO, an acquisition, or a follow-on offering.

This bipartisan legislation will further reduce the burden on EGCs  trying to raise capital, cutting red tape and burdensome regulations to  help unleash economic growth.

Mr. Speaker, when emerging growth companies were created during the  bipartisan JOBS Act nearly a decade ago, the goal was to make it easier  for new companies to access capital with less red tape while still  ensuring their investors have critical disclosures.

This bill ensures that EGCs are treated consistently by balancing the  need for financial transparency while also ensuring burdensome  regulations are not so high that it stifles innovation and hinders  growth.

I thank Mr. Haridopolos for his bipartisan leadership on this  legislation.

Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
