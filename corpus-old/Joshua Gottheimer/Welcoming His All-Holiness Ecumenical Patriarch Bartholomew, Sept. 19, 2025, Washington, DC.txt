Welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to welcome the Ecumenical  Patriarch of Constantinople, His All-Holiness Bartholomew, to  Washington, D.C. this week, and to congratulate him on receiving the  distinguished Templeton Prize.

His All-Holiness has been a steadfast leader for the Orthodox Church,  and especially for my constituents in New Jersey. He continues to  encourage us all to reach toward peace, to love and respect our  neighbors, and to uphold our values as a Nation.

At a time when hate and intolerance are surging across the country,  His All-Holiness's focus on religious freedom is a powerful reminder  that we must work together and respect one another. In the greatest  country in the world, there should be no room for intolerance or hate  of any kind.

As His All-Holiness Bartholomew has said, ``We have it in our power  either to increase the hurt inflicted on our world or to contribute  toward its healing. The choice is ours.'' Together, we must work toward  a world filled with healing and hope.
