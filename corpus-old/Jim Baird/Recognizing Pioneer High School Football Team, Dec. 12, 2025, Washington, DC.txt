Recognizing Pioneer High School Football Team


Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Pioneer High School  football team. The Pioneer Panthers had an incredible season and a  well-deserved visit to the 1A State Championship finals.

While the end of this football season wasn't what the Pioneer team  really had hoped for, each and every one of the football players on  this team should be proud of the hard work that allowed them to reach  the State championship. Their dedication in every game is an  inspiration to their school and community.

I also thank the parents, teachers, staff, and coaches for all of  their contributions and support throughout this football season.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Pioneer Panthers on reaching the  IHSAA 1A Football State Championship. I know they will continue to  deliver great successes on and off the football field in the years to  come.
