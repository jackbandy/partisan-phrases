Recognizing the 100th Anniversary of the City of Coleman, Florida


Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize  and celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the City of Coleman, Florida.  While unofficial records indicate that Coleman was first incorporated  under general laws on June 20, 1908, it was in 1925 that the city  officially received its charter, thus marking the beginning of its  formal governance and development.

Coleman was first settled in 1882 by pioneers who farmed the fertile  lands of the Warm Springs Hammock. The Florida Gazette of 1886-1887  listed Dr. B.F. Coleman, a physician and one of the area's earliest  settlers, as the town's namesake.

Many early settlers came from nearby Adamsville, which had flourished  through orange cultivation until the devastating freeze of 1894 through  1895. That natural disaster forced many to seek new livelihoods, and  Coleman soon emerged as a center of diverse agricultural production. In  addition to citrus, settlers in Coleman raised cotton, cattle, sheep,  and hogs, with wool even shipped to Baltimore for processing. By 1923,  Coleman had earned national recognition as the ``Cabbage Capital of the  World'', attracting buyers from across the country.

Today, the City of Coleman is in the heart of Sumter County and is  home to approximately 700 residents. The city retains its Old Florida  charm, with a quiet rural character and deep historical roots. As we  commemorate this centennial milestone, we honor the generations who  have shaped Coleman's legacy as a city built on resilience,  agriculture, and a deep sense of community.

Happy Centennial to the City of Coleman.
