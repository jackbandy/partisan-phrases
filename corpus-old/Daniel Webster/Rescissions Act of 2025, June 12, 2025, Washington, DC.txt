Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the American people have called  on  their elected officials to do what they asked, and that is to cut  waste, fraud, and abuse. Today, we deliver.

Together with President Trump, we are eliminating billions of dollars  of spending, this wasteful spending on leftwing organizations that mock  millions of Americans. We will also eliminate wasteful spending on  radical programs in lands far, far away that do not put America first.

I have consistently voted to cut the spigot of spending, and I will  continue that record by voting to pass this bill today. I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
