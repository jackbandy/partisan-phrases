Recognizing Lake County Schools on Earning An ``a'' Rating From the Florida Department of Education


Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privilege to  recognize Lake County Schools in Lake County, Florida, for their  outstanding achievement in earning an ``A'' rating from the Florida  Department of Education for the 2024-2025 school year.

Lake County Schools currently operates 49 schools, serving students  from pre-kindergarten through grade 12, with approximately 48,285  students and 2,696 teachers. This marks the first time since 2008 that  the Lake County School District has earned this prestigious  distinction, reflecting the district's unwavering commitment to  academic excellence, student achievement, and community support.

Under the leadership of Superintendent Diane Kornegay and the  dedicated members of the Lake County School Board, the district earned  this ``A'' rating by achieving a high percentage of points based on  student performance across a wide range of academic indicators. These  include standardized assessments in English Language Arts, Mathematics,  Science, and Social Studies, as well as learning gains in English  Language Arts and Mathematics.

Among the most notable improvements were a 15 percent increase in  Algebra 1 proficiency, a 7 percent increase in English Language Arts  for grades 9 and 10, a 4 percent overall increase in English Language  Arts scores, and a 4 percent improvement in Civics end-of-course exam  performance. Additionally, the district proudly reports a high school  graduation rate of 93 percent, a significant achievement that speaks  volumes about the commitment of the students, educators, and families  of Lake County.

I am pleased to join our community in congratulating the teachers,  administrators, support staff, and especially the students of Lake  County Schools for their hard work, diligence, and determination in  making this achievement possible. I thank them for their continued  pursuit of educational excellence.
