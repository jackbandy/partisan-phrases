One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I want to compliment my friend and  colleague from Oklahoma. The One Big Beautiful Bill does have a lot of  really  good stuff in it. I think, to be perfectly blunt, my State probably has  more good stuff in it than anyone. So I am doing what Senator Lankford  is doing, primarily back home in Alaska: really trying to inform my  constituents on what is in this bill because it is a really good bill.

Boy oh boy, there is a lot of misinformation out there. My colleagues  on the other side of the aisle are spreading the falsehoods, maybe  because they are a little jealous that they can't legislate as well as  we do. But that is for another day.
