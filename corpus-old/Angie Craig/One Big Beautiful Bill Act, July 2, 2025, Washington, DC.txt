One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, this Republican budget is a betrayal of the  American people.

It puts in jeopardy food assistance for 42 million Americans. That is  children, seniors, the disabled, and working parents.

Mr. Speaker, 1.2 million veterans rely on SNAP for their food. This  budget turns its back on them. Mr. Speaker,  270,000 veterans, homeless, and former foster youth will lose their  food assistance entirely.

The vulnerable are left behind. The middle class gets screwed in  favor of the ultrawealthy. I am a hell no.
