United States Grain Standards Reauthorization Act of 2025


Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, every summer, grains planted by hardworking  Minessotans cover around 40 percent of my district.

U.S. grain standards are a key component of foreign trade and the  promotion of American agricultural exports. The inspections and  certifications done by the Federal Grain Inspection Service, states and  private agencies provide foreign importers with certainty regarding the  quality of the grain bought from U.S. farmers.

With parts of the existing U.S. Grain Standards Act set to expire on  September 30, 2025,  I am proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor to reauthorize and  improve this law.

This bill before reauthorizes annual appropriations for standard  development and maintenance, USDA's authority to collect fees for  supervision of inspections and weighing, an administrative/supervisory  cost cap and the Grain Inspection Advisory Committee. All important  components of the existing law.

It also makes key improvements, not least of all directing the USDA  to prioritize the modernization of grain grading technologies. The U.S.  grain inspection system is known around the world for quality and  reliability. By focusing USDA's attention on modernization, we can  continue to hold our place as the world's gold standard in grain  inspection.

Reauthorizing the U.S. Grain Standards Act is important for our  farmers and their customers, and I urge all my colleagues to support  this legislation.
