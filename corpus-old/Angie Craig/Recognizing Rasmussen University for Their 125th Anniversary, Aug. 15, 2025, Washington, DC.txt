Recognizing Rasmussen University for Their 125th Anniversary


Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Rasmussen  University on their 125th anniversary.

Founded in St. Paul, Minnesota, on September 1, 1900, Rasmussen  University has spent 125 years building a powerful legacy of  opportunity. What began as a small business school has grown into a  regionally and nationally recognized institution committed to career- focused education that transforms lives and strengthens communities.

Rasmussen has long served students who are often underrepresented,  underserved, or overlooked by traditional higher education--providing  the support, flexibility, and access they need to pursue a brighter  future. Over the last 125 years, they've helped students prepare for  careers that truly matter in health care, business, public service and  beyond.

I am proud to represent Rasmussen's Eagan campus, recognized as a  national leader in nursing education. They are a Minnesota staple with  other locations in Bloomington, Eagan, Brooklyn Park, Mankato, St.  Cloud, and Moorhead.

Rasmussen University serves more than 3,000 currently enrolled  Minnesotans and has proudly graduated over 28,000 students from across  the state.

I congratulate Rasmussen University and I look forward to their  continued success.
