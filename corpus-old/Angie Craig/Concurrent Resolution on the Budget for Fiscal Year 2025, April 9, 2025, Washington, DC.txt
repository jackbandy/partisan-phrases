Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I am actually stunned as we stand here today  because, as my colleagues talk about their plan, what they are doing,  in reality, is giving billionaires the national credit card and telling  them to go hog wild, racking up $14 trillion in national debt over the  next 10 years so that large corporations can pay less in taxes. That  doesn't lower costs for middle-class families in this country.

If this were a bill that we were talking about that would lower taxes  for the middle class, I would be all for it.

To make matters worse, part of how they want to pay for this  resolution is to cut the supplemental nutrition assistance program, or  SNAP, by $230 billion. This cut would force the average SNAP household  of four to spend over $2,000 more on food.

Who are the majority of SNAP recipients? They are seniors living on  fixed incomes, children, and disabled people. SNAP helps American  families buy American-grown food. This cut takes a chunk out of the  farm economy as well when they can least afford it because of the  whiplash of this administration and Donald Trump's tariffs. This  resolution would mean that farmers growing our food would make $30  billion less than anticipated in farm income, placing family farmers at  risk.

This Republican budget only stands to make America hungrier and  poorer so the rich can get richer. It is shameful, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no.''
