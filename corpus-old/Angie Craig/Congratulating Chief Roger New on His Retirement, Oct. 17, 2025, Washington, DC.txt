Congratulating Chief Roger New on His Retirement


Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Eagan Police  Chief Roger New on his retirement after thirty-one years with the  police force. From a young age, Chief New knew he wanted to be in law  enforcement. After graduating with a social science degree from  Concordia College he joined the Eagan Police Department as a Community  Service Officer in 1994. Over the next two decades, he took on several  roles with the department including as a DARE officer, School Resource  Officer, detective, sergeant and lieutenant. New also earned a master's  degree in public administration from Metro State University and  graduated from the FBI National Academy.

In 2016, New became a Deputy Chief before being named Eagan Chief of  Police in 2018. As Chief, New prioritized building strong community  partnerships, implemented innovative practices and invested in officer  mental health and well-being.

I am proud to have worked with Chief New and the Eagan Police  Department on trying to secure funding for the Valley Acres Range. I'll  always remember touring and shooting rounds at the facility myself.

I am grateful for Chief New's public service. He has created a  lasting impact in Eagan and across the state of Minnesota. He isn't  just our Chief, but a dear friend. I will continue to seek his input  and guidance on law enforcement and mental health policies. I wish  Chief New the best in retirement.
