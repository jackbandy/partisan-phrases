Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Act of 2025


Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Secure Rural  Schools Reauthorization Act of 2025.

The Secure Rural Schools program, or SRS, is a lifeline for rural  Utah communities.

When timber revenues from Federal lands declined, it threatened the  ability of counties to fund their schools, roads, and emergency  services.

Counties are responsible for providing these basic services, but what  if they can't?

SRS steps in to fill that gap in counties with overwhelming Federal  land ownership, counties that previously benefited from timber sales.  With the majority of Utah's land federally managed, our counties cannot  simply tax their way out of budgeting shortfalls.

The elected county commissioners in my district spend a lot of time  getting creative and stretching the dollars they have as far as they  can, and that includes working to get Congress to fund SRS. Kane County  is 87 percent federally owned. Garfield County is about 94 percent  federally owned, and Piute County is about 75 percent.

SRS recognizes that the Federal Government has an obligation to be  part of the communities surrounded by the land it manages. Replacing  lost funding is a step toward being part of those local communities.

This funding keeps schools staffed and keeps roads maintained. Our  rural counties need the stability and fairness that comes with  reauthorizing SRS. It matters a lot for Utah.

To be clear, rural counties, timber counties, would rather have the  jobs that come with timber production and sound forest management,  management for resource production. However, in the meantime, while we  are fixing the policies that prevented that, SRS is essential for the  rural counties.
