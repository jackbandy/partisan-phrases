Repealing Green Subsidies


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, I want to clarify something for some of my  colleagues and for leaders across this country because there seems to  be some confusion. There is a big difference between taking a knee and  bending a knee.

Taking a knee shows that you can hold many truths at once, you can  love our country and believe that there is still more work to do. It  shows that you are willing to do that work and to live up to our  country's ideals.

However, bending a knee is something quite different. Bending a knee  is capitulation. It is what you do when you have given up, when you  have lost your fight, when you have lost your way, when you are not  willing to show courage, to show up, or to speak up.

Taking a knee, you have got skin in the game. Bending a knee, you  have given in, you have lost your self-respect.

We were not elected to be obedient, to submit, to cower. We were not  sent here to worship one man. We have no kings in America. We were sent  here to work on behalf of the people. If you are not risking anything,  you are not being brave. Show some grit and stand up for your people.
