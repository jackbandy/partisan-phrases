What Happened to Aliya Rahman


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, what happened to Aliya Rahman is chilling,  and it is a warning for all of us.

Aliya is a U.S. citizen. She is a software engineer. She identifies  as disabled, autistic, and as someone suffering from a traumatic brain  injury.

On her way to a doctor's appointment, she was stopped by ICE. They  screamed conflicting orders at her, dragged her from her car, and  carried her while she screamed: I am autistic. I am disabled. She said:  Please, I am disabled.

It didn't matter. She was denied medical care. She lost consciousness  in detention. She suffered a concussion. She had to be taken out in an  ambulance.

Mr. Speaker, this is not about immigration enforcement. This is not  about public safety. Aliya was a victim of terror at the hands of her  own government.

We owe Aliya and all Americans real accountability, and I will not  stop demanding it on the floor of this House. It is repugnant,  absolutely disgusting what happened to her, and she is not the only  one.
