Stop Renaming Ships


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, Defense Secretary Hegseth should be one of  the busiest people on the planet, defending our country and leading  nearly 3 million courageous Americans in our Armed Forces. It is an  awesome responsibility.

This week, Pete Hegseth spent his precious time deciding that a naval  ship named after a veteran is just too gay for him.

Harvey Milk was an American hero, a civil rights leader, and the  first openly gay official in California. He served his country in the  Navy. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He was someone  who stood up for the rights and dignity of all, and he was assassinated  while serving in public office. His memory is worthy of dignity and  respect.

Removing his name from a ship is small and it is petty. It is  obviously an attempt to erase the history of anyone who shows  resistance to this administration. That is what autocrats and  authoritarians do.

Since Secretary Hegseth took the helm, the Department of Defense has  been fraught with national security risks and constant drama. I urge  him to stop spending his time renaming ships because he wants to  pretend that we don't exist. He should do his damn job.
