Ice


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, tonight, as I stand here, people across this  country are being terrorized by ICE with our tax dollars. Americans do  not support this, and I will be their voice tonight on the floor.

They don't want to live in a country in which you can be randomly  stopped by a masked man and have him demand from you your papers. They  don't want to live in a country where your First, your Second, and your  Fourth Amendment rights are being violated. They don't want Americans  gunned down because they are standing up for their immigrant neighbors.

Mr. Speaker, we warned Republicans. We told them. We said: If you  give a $170 billion blank check to Kristi Noem, you will create a  paramilitary force, a lawless force that will brutalize Americans. We  warned them, and I am sorry to say that we were right. Our predictions  were right, and our worst fears have been realized.

Americans are being traumatized. Immigrants are being brutalized. We  have to impeach Kristi Noem. We must dump Stephen Miller, and we have  to end this ICE terror and lawlessness.
