Be the Voice of Moral Grandeur and Spiritual Audacity


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Abraham Heschel once sent a telegram  to John F. Kennedy. Referring to racism in this country, he said: ``The  hour calls for moral grandeur and spiritual audacity.''

Now, 62 years later, we see the excessive brutality of ICE agents.  Peaceful protesters are tear-gassed in the face. A pastor was shot in  the head with a pepper ball. We have children being zip-tied, car  windows smashed, people tackled and dragged, and guns pointed at  unarmed bystanders. We have people targeted for the color of their skin  or the accents that they speak in. ICE agents are demanding entrance to  homes without warrants, and last week, an American citizen was gunned  down.

Americans know this is wrong, and they are horrified. People of  conscience across this country must come together and be that voice of  moral grandeur and spiritual audacity once again. We have to find our  courage and speak out. There is no other way.
