Juan Orlando Hernandez, Former President of Honduras


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, last Friday President Trump said he would  give a full and complete pardon to Juan Orlando Hernandez, the corrupt  former President of Honduras. It is disgusting.

Trump is going to erase a major drug trafficking conviction against  Hernandez, who is serving 45 years in Federal prison for his crimes. He  was convicted by an American jury for working with drug cartels to move  400 tons of cocaine through Honduras to the United States. He got  millions of dollars in kickbacks and bribes.

What the hell is the President of the United States doing giving this  thug a full pardon?

He is a man who helped bring deadly drugs into our communities. Trump  is literally rewarding a narco-terrorist.

What will it take for my Republican colleagues to speak up?

There is no way to spin this. He is literally standing with a drug  trafficker and against us.
