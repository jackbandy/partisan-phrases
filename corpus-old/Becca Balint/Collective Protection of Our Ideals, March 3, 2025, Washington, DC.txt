Collective Protection of Our Ideals


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues: What kind of man asks  for absolute fealty and bootlicking from the people around him?

What kind of man asks people to lie for him?

What kind of man is so petty that he can't admit obvious mistakes and  lies?

What kind of man mocks veterans and then callously fires them from  jobs?

What kind of man appeases and flatters our enemies?

What kind of man puts his own needs above country?

What kind of men and women make excuses for him and lie for him and  cover for him?

These are the questions that are haunting me today. We need so much  better than this in this moment. This is about the safety and security  of our Nation and our allies around the world. This is about our  collective protection of our ideals.

Americans of conscience, we must stand together and confront any man  so wholly unsuited for what we ask of him.
