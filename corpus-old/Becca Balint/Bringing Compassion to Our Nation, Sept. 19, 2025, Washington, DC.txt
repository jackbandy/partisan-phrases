Bringing Compassion to Our Nation


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in crisis. We are in a very  dark place. Americans are scared, and they want to see a way forward.  We all need to start with ourselves.

This morning, I sat, and I lit a candle. I thought about the anguish  and suffering of Representative Melissa Hortman's two children as they  try to cope with the assassination of their mom and dad.

Then I sat, and I thought of the pain and the torment of Charlie  Kirk's family as they try to cope with the killing of their dad.

Today, Mr. Speaker, I am inviting Americans across the Nation to do  the same. I invite them to sit for a few minutes in the pain of these  two families. If they can feel compassion for one family and not the  other, that should tell them about the work they need to do and the  work that we all need to do.
