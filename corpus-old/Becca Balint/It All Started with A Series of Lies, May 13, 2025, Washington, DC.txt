It All Started with A Series of Lies


Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, I am a history teacher so I know that we  have to do everything we can to document what is happening right now  because we are at a very dangerous moment, and it requires courage from  every single one of us.

Here is the truth of it: This national nightmare started with a  series of lies, the first one being that Barack Obama was not born in  this country. Then the second one, the ridiculous, easily disproved  claim was that the 2017 inauguration broke records that no one had ever  seen before. Then there was the lie about the weather map and the  Sharpie, and then so many other lies building up to that one big lie  that you all have heard about the 2020 election. It was an obvious lie,  and yet he lost over and over and over in court and continued to lie.  There was no evidence, but it didn't matter.

Why didn't it matter? It didn't matter because it wasn't about the  evidence. It was actually a test.

It was a test to signal your willingness to be loyal. If you promise  to spread our lies, you can be on the team. It was a qualification for  being able to work on that team. Slowly, like the rot in the foundation  of an old farmhouse, it continues to let the decay set in.
