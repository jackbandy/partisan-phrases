Upholding the Oath of Office


Ms. BALINT. Madam Speaker, it has been 5 days since President Trump,  when asked if he had to uphold the Constitution, told a reporter: ``I  don't know.''

Madam Speaker, it has been 5 days of silence from my Republican  colleagues. I keep waiting to see if a single Republican will speak up  about this and denounce this horrifying remark.

My Republican colleagues: What has happened to you? You know that, if  Obama or Clinton or Biden had said such an outrageous thing, you would  be tripping over yourselves to get in front of the cameras. Yet, now,  in this moment, you say nothing and you do nothing.

I was at the inauguration. I saw all of you. We sat together and  watched the President swear his oath of office to uphold the  Constitution.

I am pleading with you to speak up. Your fear is keeping you so  small, and it is to the detriment of our country and our constitutional  democracy.
