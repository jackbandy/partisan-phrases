Standing with Cbc in Shared Fight for Equality and Justice


Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, my Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus  and I are proud to honor Black History Month and stand with our  Congressional Black Caucus colleagues in the shared fight for equality  and justice.

There is a long and storied history of solidarity between the Black  community and the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander  communities.

In the 19th century, Frederick Douglass spoke out against the racist  Chinese Exclusion Act and used his voice to advocate for Asian  immigrants who wanted to earn the right to become U.S. citizens.

During the civil rights movement, Asian American activists protested  alongside Black Americans in the fight for equality.

The allyship between our two communities remains critically important  in the face of a vicious campaign to erase our stories, voices, and  contributions to this Nation.

Make no mistake, we will fight tooth and nail for our communities and  stand up to these attacks. We will not let anyone tell us that our  stories don't matter.

Our stories are American history, and without us, our Nation would  not be where it is today.
