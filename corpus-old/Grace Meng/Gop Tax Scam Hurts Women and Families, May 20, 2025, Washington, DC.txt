Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Asian American,  Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

There are 25 million Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific  Islanders in the U.S., representing the fastest growing racial group in  the country. We have made invaluable contributions to our country and  play a vital role in shaping America for the better.

However, at a time when we should be celebrating, our communities are  anxious and afraid. This celebration of our heritage, culture, and  stories is dampened by the Republican scheme to strip away benefits  from those that need them most.

This big, bad billionaire bill would impact nearly 200,000 Asian- American constituents, many of them senior citizens in my district  alone, not to mention the nearly 1 in 10 Asian Americans across our  country that rely on food assistance through SNAP and the 1 in 6 NHPIs  living in poverty.

Meanwhile, the top 20 percent of income earners will get nearly 70  percent of the benefits of this bill.

There are hungry grandmas, sick children, and veterans who were  promised care after serving our country. What a way to celebrate and  uplift our diverse AANHPI communities.

Our communities deserve not just to survive but to thrive.
