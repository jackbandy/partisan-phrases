Thanking Alex Cisneros, Legislative Director


Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to thank Alex Cisneros for his  decade of service to our Nation as a dedicated staff member in the  House of Representatives, most recently as my legislative director over  the last 4 years.

His diligent work ethic, sharp intellect, and the ability to build  trusting relationships on both sides of the aisle have made him an  invaluable part of my team.

His legislative team advised me each week in Congress and shepherded  more than 40 bills through the House and got more than 15 bills signed  into law.

These are real results that have made a difference in the lives of  the American people.

So I thank Alex, and I hope that he knows how proud we all are of  what he has accomplished.

We will miss Alex, but he will always be a part of our family.
