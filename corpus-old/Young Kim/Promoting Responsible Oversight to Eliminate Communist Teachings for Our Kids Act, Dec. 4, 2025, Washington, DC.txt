Promoting Responsible Oversight to Eliminate Communist Teachings for Our Kids Act


Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1069,  the PROTECT Our Kids Act.

The Chinese Communist Party is executing the most sophisticated  global influence campaign of our time. They are not just targeting our  military or U.S. companies. They are targeting our children.

One of the CCP's key tools is the Confucius classroom program. These  programs are funded, staffed, and overseen by the Chinese Government,  giving them direct influence over curriculum, teaching materials, and  the content presented to American children.

We cannot allow an authoritarian regime that censors information,  rewrites history, and silences dissent to have any role in American  education. Our classrooms must remain places of learning; not foreign  influence.

The PROTECT Our Kids Act sets a simple but necessary safeguard: If a  school chooses to host a CCP-funded Confucius program, then it should  not receive Federal taxpayer dollars. It is as simple as that. This  bill upholds academic integrity, protects parents' rights over their  child's schooling, counters communist propaganda, and strengthens our  national security.

The CCP is playing the long game: influencing minds early and often.  We must meet this challenge head-on.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and stand firm  against foreign indoctrination in American schools.
