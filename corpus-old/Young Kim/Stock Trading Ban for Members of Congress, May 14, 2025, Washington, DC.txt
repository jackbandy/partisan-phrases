Stock Trading Ban for Members of Congress


Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress are here to serve their  constituents and the American people; not themselves. Unfortunately, we  see this year after year with Members of Congress making lucrative  stock trades while their constituents struggle to make ends meet.

We must restore public trust in this body, and that starts with each  of us in this Chamber. There is no reason why Members of Congress  should be able to trade stocks while in office, period. American  taxpayers deserve better.

That is why I am proud to have helped introduce the TRUST in Congress  Act. This bipartisan bill would prohibit Members of Congress, in  addition to their spouses and children, to trade stocks while in  office.

This isn't rocket science. This is common sense. Let's just restore  trust back in Congress.
