Housing for the 21st Century Act


Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I rise today in support in the Housing for the 21st Century Act.  After years of inaction, my home State of California has earned an F in  housing affordability. Under Gavin Newsom and Sacramento leadership,  hardworking families are being left in the dust.

That is why I am taking action to help address this crisis for my  constituents in Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties.

Earlier this Congress, I worked with President Trump to secure  historic SALT relief for Californians. That relief, combined with the  provisions in the Housing for the 21st Century Act, will bring the  dream of homeownership closer to reality for working families in my  district.

For far too long, working-class Americans have been priced out of the  housing market. The Housing for the 21st Century Act confronts that  problem head-on by exploring where our housing system has left these  families behind.

For the first time since 2006, we are finally increasing the capital  that financial institutions can invest in affordable housing and  community development projects. There is finally the willingness to  tackle this housing crisis head-on.

Mrs. KIM. The Housing for the 21st Century Act builds on the success  of  the working-class families tax cuts and deserves swift passage so we  can deliver results for American families.
