No New Burma Funds Act


Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Davidson for yielding  time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4423, the No New Funds for  Burma Act. This bill would suspend disbursements and financing from the  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to Burma until  the Treasury Secretary identifies a meaningful change in regime and  restoration of democratic values.

In February 2021, the democratically elected members of Burma's  Government were deposed by the military junta. As we approach almost 5  years since the military's unlawful seizure of power, chaos has  overtaken Burma. Since the coup, more than 6,000 people have been  killed, 20,000 detained, and more than 3.5 million displaced from their  homes.

Caused directly by the Burmese military junta, this humanitarian  crisis makes one thing very clear: The regime cannot be trusted to  responsibly steward funds from international financial institutions or  deliver aid to the communities most in need.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Williams of Georgia for allowing  me to co-lead the No New Funds for Burma Act. I urge my colleagues to  join us in condemning the ongoing violence in Burma and supporting this  legislation.
