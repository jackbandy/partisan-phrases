Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025


Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Bilirakis for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 1479, the  Hotel Fees Transparency Act.

Hidden fees on short-term lodging, whether it is at hotels, motels,  inns, resorts, or rentals, make it harder for families to plan for a  trip.

Too often, what looks like an affordable overnight stay online turns  out to be far more expensive once these deceptive charges are added.  Additionally, the way these prices are advertised are fragmented and  not uniform.

Americans deserve price transparency so that they can appropriately  budget for their travels.

The Hotel Fees Transparency Act requires providers of short-term  lodging to disclose upfront the full cost of a stay, including all  mandatory and service fees. It would also require the lodging and  booking industries to clearly display the final price of a stay,  providing transparency for consumers and improving American tourism and  hospitality.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Castor, Fry, and Mullin for  their collaboration on this bipartisan, commonsense, pro-consumer  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the Hotel Fees  Transparency Act.
