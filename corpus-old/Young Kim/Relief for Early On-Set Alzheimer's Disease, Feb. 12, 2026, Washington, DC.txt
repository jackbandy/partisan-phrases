Relief for Early On-Set Alzheimer's Disease


Mrs. KIM. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of my bill, the BRIDGE  for Young Onset Alzheimer's Disease Act.

Right now, Americans diagnosed with Alzheimer's after age 65 receive  immediate Medicare coverage, but those diagnosed before 65, despite  facing the same devastating disease, are forced to wait nearly 29  months for the exact same care.

For the 200,000 Americans living with young-onset Alzheimer's, that  delay is devastating.

The BRIDGE for YOAD Act fixes this gap by eliminating the Medicare  waiting period for those with young-onset Alzheimer's. Early access to  care matters. This disease progresses very quickly. Many patients lose  the ability to work or support themselves long before coverage kicks  in, while families are left to shoulder an additional $20,000 a year in  out-of-pocket costs.

Congress has acted before for rapidly progressing diseases like ALS.  We should do the same here. As one of my constituents put it, this bill  puts health and dignity first.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the BRIDGE for YOAD Act.
