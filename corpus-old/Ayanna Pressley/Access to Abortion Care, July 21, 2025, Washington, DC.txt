Access to Abortion Care


Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn the cruelty of the Hyde  Amendment and reintroduce the EACH Act to end it once and for all.

It is 2025. In 1976, when I was a mere 2 years old, a Congressman  from Chicago was livid at the thought that a woman could be in control  of her own body, especially a Black or Brown woman. So he came to this  floor and put forward an amendment with a simple, cruel aim to ban as  many people as he could from getting abortion care.

With that robotic precision, this institution has rubber-stamped this  amendment in budget after budget.

The Hyde Amendment denies abortion care to patients who receive their  care through Medicaid, CHIP, and other government programs.

Once in my lifetime, we defeated this amendment in the House, a  testament to activists, organizers, and my mentor, Congresswoman  Barbara Lee.

Mr. Speaker, in my lifetime, we will defeat it once and for all  because everyone deserves access to fundamental healthcare, and that is  exactly what abortion care is.

No man, no king, and no coward should come between us and our bodies.
