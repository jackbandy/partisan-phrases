Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of every elder who  can't afford their prescriptions and every parent who went to work  hungry so their child could eat. In the United States of America, there  is no lack of resource, only a deficit of empathy, political will, and  courage.

At its best, government is a backstop, a compassionate steward of the  public good. At its best, government catches people when they stumble  at a moment of hardship. At its best, government does right by the  people, all the people.

Struggle does not discriminate, Mr. Speaker. Hardship is not a  character flaw and has zero to do with work ethic. Every single person  is one diagnosis and one layoff away from hardship. Life can change in  an instant.

What we are bearing witness to is not only a lack of political  courage, but it is a fundamental betrayal of the people, incompetence  and indifference to the suffering of our neighbors, the shame and the  sham of it all.

Any Member of Congress who would vote to deny a child a meal or  medication, it is child abuse and neglect. I ought to file a 51A on  Republicans for that. Every person in this Chamber and every person in  our country has lost a loved one to cancer, and yet Republicans would  vote to deny people lifesaving cancer treatment and research.

Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House, and  with a majority they have chosen to enact harm to make people hungry,  poorer, sicker, and less safe.

The shame and the sham of it all. You the people deserve better. We  the people deserve better, and I won't stop fighting until you get it.
