Constituent Testimony During the Congressional Field Hearing on Haitian Tps Termination


Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, as part of the Congressional Field Hearing  on Haitian TPS Termination held in the Massachusetts 7th Congressional  District, constituents from the community were invited to discuss the  importance of extending TPS for Haitian nationals. Therefore, I include  in the Record their testimonies:

Thank you, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley and Senator Ed       Markey, for holding this public forum to hear directly from       TPS holders like myself.

My name is Jose Urias, and I am a TPS holder from El       Salvador. I am also one of the Co-Coordinators of the       Massachusetts TPS Committee and a member of the National TPS       Alliance.

I have lived in Malden, Massachusetts for over 20 years       with my wife and two U.S. citizen children. I work hard every       day to provide for my family and to be a productive member of       my community in Malden. I am very proud of my two children.       My oldest is 19 years old and is in the second year of       college. I would love to be able to go to his graduation. My       youngest is 13 and is in middle school in the Malden schools.

Like nearly 15% of other TPS holders, I've started a       business, employing others and generating economic activity       for my local community. I run a construction and real estate       business that is helping to rebuild and revitalize housing       throughout my community. Over the past few years, my company       has worked on 56 houses. I'm proud of my team's ability to       fix up homes and provide high-quality housing to new       homeowners in my community.

Across the country, TPS holders like me generate $21       billion for the U.S. economy each year. But it's incredibly       hard doing that, especially now with so much uncertainty       about our status. Bank financing is very important to my       business. I need loans to purchase properties and to help       finance       the upgrades and repairs I make to those properties. How can       I get a loan to finance one of my development projects when I       don't know what my legal status will be in a year?

If TPS is canceled, I would be forced to close my business.       This would not only have a negative impact on my family, it       would have a negative impact on my local community. My       employees would no longer have work. Most of my vendors are       other local businesses, and they would no longer have my       business. The closing of my small business would have       hundreds of thousands of dollars of negative economic impact       on my local community.

I have lived in the United States for over 30 years. There       is nothing ``temporary'' about the life I have built here. I       have set down roots, grown a family, and built a business.       Instead of canceling TPS, we need a legislative solution that       creates a path to permanent residency for families like mine.

Immigrants like myself have been the economic engine of the       United States since its founding. Please help me continue to       do that by protecting TPS and creating a permanent path to       residency in this country.

Thank you for your time, Jose Urias

Business Owner & Co-Coordinator of the Massachusetts TPS       Committee                                __________

Hello, my name is W.V., and in 2009 my life changed       unexpectedly.

I traveled to Florida for a brief vacation. During that       time, a family member living in New Jersey became seriously       ill, and I traveled there to assist her. Before I was able to       return to my home country of Haiti, a devastating earthquake       struck. The place where I lived collapsed, and the building       where I worked was completely destroyed. I could not return       home. When Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was designated       for Haiti, it brought me immense relief during an incredibly       painful and uncertain time.

While mourning the loss of so many family members and       friends, I knew I had to find a way to move forward. In 2011,       a close family friend helped pay for my nursing assistant       training. This opportunity allowed me to begin working in a       nursing home, where I provided care to elderly Americans.       Through this experience, I realized how many workers in the       caregiving field are immigrants who dedicate themselves to       serving others.

I later worked in an adult day care setting, assisting       veterans diagnosed with schizophrenia and ensuring they       received compassionate, dignified, and respectful care. This       work has been more than a job--it has been my way of giving       back and contributing meaningfully to the country that       offered me protection.

In 2018, conditions in Haiti worsened significantly       following the assassination of the president. Gang violence       and widespread kidnappings escalated, making everyday life       unsafe. The level of insecurity has made it impossible for me       to return, leaving no realistic hope of safely going back. As       a result, I have remained in the United States--continuing to       work, pay taxes, and provide daily living assistance to       Americans with disabilities, while contributing positively to       my community.

I have now lived in the United States for 16 years as a TPS       recipient. I have no home to return to because of ongoing       gang violence and political instability in Haiti. I do not       know where to turn if TPS is ended. I currently rent an       apartment in Boston and purchased a car so I can get to work.

My community here is all that I have built over the years.

I am deeply worried about the possibility of losing my       ability to work if my work permit expires with the       termination of TPS. The thought of losing everything I have       worked so hard for is overwhelming. I am worried about my       patients who love me so much because I take good care of       them.

I pray that the Supreme Court will consider the plight of       all TPS recipients across the United States--people like me       who have built lives here, serve our communities, and have       nowhere safe to return.

Thank you so much for your support.                                __________

I am a Haitian national living legally in the United States       under Temporary Protected Status (TPS). I was forced to leave       Haiti following the devastating 2010 earthquake and the       extreme rise in kidnappings and violence that made daily life       unsafe.

I am a compassionate, reliable, and hardworking individual.       Since arriving in the United States, I have worked       consistently to support myself. I do not rely on government       assistance such as food stamps or public benefits. I pay       taxes on my earnings and contribute fully through all       required payroll deductions.

My work is centered on caring for American citizens who       need support with daily living activities. I help individuals       with tasks such as bathing, personal hygiene, dressing, meal       preparation, and mobility. I perform this work with       compassion and dignity, ensuring that those I care for feel       safe, respected, and comfortable.

Many of the people I assist live with serious conditions       such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, stroke, multiple       sclerosis, physical disabilities, depression, or advanced       age. Caregiving work like this is demanding, yet it is often       carried out by immigrants--people who did not grow up in this       country--who take care of homes, yards, children, and the       most vulnerable members of society.

This work is not easy, but I am proud to do it. I am proud       to help improve the quality of life for vulnerable       individuals, and I am proud to contribute to the well-being       of my community and to the values that make America strong.

I hope that one day my country will improve. However,       current conditions in Haiti remain dangerous, and even the       U.S. government has stated that it is not safe for Americans       to travel there. For this reason, I have chosen to remain in       the United States to protect my life.

God bless America.                                __________

My name is Rebecca Zama, and I serve as Legal Services       Coordinator and Immigration Policy Analyst with SOIA. As a       proud first-generation Haitian-American, an immigration       attorney, and the Legal Service Coordinator and Immigration       Policy Analyst for the City of Somerville, I submit this       written testimony to address the devastating impact that       terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian       individuals and families would have on our communities in       Somerville, across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and       throughout our nation.

The Haitian community in Somerville and across       Massachusetts is vibrant, thriving, and essential to who we       are as a Commonwealth. Since 2010, TPS has been a lifeline       that allowed Haitian families to find safety in the United       States during times when conditions in Haiti have been, and       continue to be, unstable and unable to facilitate the safe       return of Haitians living in the United States. TPS has       enabled Haitians across the country to contribute to the       fabric of our cities, states, and country as a whole. They       have planted roots here and sown seeds of community, culture,       and connection.

Some may point to the word ``temporary'' in Temporary       Protected Status and suggest that termination was always       inevitable. However, the guidelines are clear as to what the       law says. TPS exists precisely because conditions in certain       countries make safe return impossible. The statute grants the       Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to designate       countries for TPS when there are conditions such as ongoing       armed conflict, environmental disaster, or other       extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevent safe       return. The program is designed to be responsive to facts on       the ground, not to operate on arbitrary timelines, quotas,       and motives that ignore documented country conditions. The       Haitian community has been granted TPS because Haiti has       faced continuous, documented instability that meets the       statutory criteria. That instability has not disappeared, but       rather, it has intensified. To terminate protection now would       contradict the very purpose of the program and violate the       humanitarian spirit of the law that created it.

It is critical to understand that people who have TPS have       done things the ``right way.'' They followed the law and       applied for this relief, which has allowed them to live and       work lawfully in the United States for over 15 years. They       have registered with the government, undergone background       checks, paid fees, and maintained their status through       regular renewals. They have complied with the requirements       placed upon them. The termination of TPS is not simply the       expiration of a benefit, it is stripping individuals of their       lawful status and forcibly rendering them undocumented.       People who have been authorized to work, pay taxes,       contribute to Social Security, and build their lives legally       would overnight become subject to deportation through no       fault of their own.

Haiti currently faces tremendous hardship. Political       instability, humanitarian crisis, natural disasters, and       economic collapse have created conditions that make return       not just difficult, but dangerous. To terminate TPS now, at       this moment of unprecedented crisis, would be to ignore       reality and abandon the moral and legal framework of TPS. We       would be sending children, mothers, fathers, workers,       students, and community members back to circumstances where       their safety cannot be guaranteed.

In addition, TPS termination would have catastrophic       consequences for mixed-status families; households where       parents hold TPS, but their children are U.S. citizens. The       termination of their parents' protected status would force       parents to weigh impossible choices: Do they uproot their       children and take them to a country they may have never       known, away from the only home they've ever had? Or do       families face separation, with children growing up without       their parents, their stability shattered, and their futures       uncertain? This is not a theoretical issue. These are the       very real questions that our residents and community members       are asking themselves as TPS for Haiti is set to expire on       February 3rd. For our children, what is next for them if this       protection is stripped away? Separating families in this way       undermines everything we claim to value about family unity,       community stability, and opportunity.

When we protect TPS, we protect families. We uphold a       fundamental human value, a value that implores us to not turn       our backs on people in their time of need. This is not merely       an ``immigrant'' issue, the termination of TPS impacts all of       us, citizens and noncitizens alike. This issue is about       whether we will honor our commitments, protect vulnerable       families, and recognize the immeasurable contributions of our       Haitian neighbors. The path forward is clear: we must       preserve and protect TPS for Haitians.

Thank you for your consideration of this testimony.

Respectfully submitted,

Rebecca Zama
