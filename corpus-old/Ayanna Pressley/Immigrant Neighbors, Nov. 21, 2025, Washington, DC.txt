Immigrant Neighbors


Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to denounce the terror  campaign this administration has launched against our immigrant  neighbors.

At the direction of the Trump White House, masked Federal agents are  ripping children away from their parents' arms. They are pepper  spraying moms in parking lots. They are pulling childcare workers from  classrooms in front of desperate toddlers.

This is unacceptable.

The world is watching as the United States Government violates the  rights and due process of our neighbors. Families are frantically  trying to locate their loved ones who have been hauled away to  detention centers, for-profit makeshift prisons, prisons where meals  are inedible and medical care is denied, prisons where women are denied  cancer treatment and endure miscarriages while their screams are  ignored.

Mr. Speaker, this situation is desperate and it is not the result of  a natural disaster or an act of God. Instead, it is the direct action  of a narcissistic, cruel dictator who occupies the Oval Office who has  contempt for every person that calls this country home.

None of us is free until all of us are free. No one is truly safe in  Donald Trump's America.

For our immigrant families, they belong here, and I will not stop  fighting for them, their rights, and their dignity.
