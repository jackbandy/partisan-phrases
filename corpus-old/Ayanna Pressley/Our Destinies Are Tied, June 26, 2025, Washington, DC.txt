Our Destinies Are Tied


Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the traumatic  loss of life around the world and to reaffirm a simple truth: Our  destinies are tied.

Too often, in moments of crisis, we are bombarded with abstract  numbers and detached headlines describing casualties and missiles, but  behind every number is a name. Behind every headline is a story: a  story of a little girl whispering prayers beneath her blanket hoping  the night sky stays quiet or a story of a father digging through  rubble, his hands bloodied, desperately searching for his wife and  child.

Nations are not just governments and regimes. They are people. They  are mothers, sons, teachers, taxi drivers, people whose stories echo  our own because they are us. No matter where someone is born or what  language they speak, our grief over losing a loved one is the same.

We are bound together by that shared humanity, so we must be  relentless in our commitment to peace: peace rooted in diplomacy, peace  that is sustained with dialogue, and peace that insists, without  exception, that every single life matters.

From Boston to the Middle East, our destinies are tied, and everyone  deserves to live free from fear and know peace.
