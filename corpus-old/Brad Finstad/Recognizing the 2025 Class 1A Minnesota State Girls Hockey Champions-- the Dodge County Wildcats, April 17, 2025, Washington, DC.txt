Recognizing the 2025 Class 1A Minnesota State Girls Hockey Champions-- the Dodge County Wildcats


Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2025 Class 1A  Minnesota State Girls Hockey Champions: the Dodge County Wildcats.

On February 22nd, the team won their first-ever state title at the  Xcel Energy Center in a suspenseful overtime game against Warroad. The  Wildcats claimed the win with a 4-3 final score.

The deciding goal almost went unnoticed, sneaking over the goal line  during a dramatic scramble at the net. Warroad came away with the puck,  but junior forward Zoe Heimer, who made the shot, knew the puck had  crossed the goal line, prompting a video review that ultimately ruled  in favor of the Wildcats.

The top-seeded Dodge County team has been nothing but impressive all  season, finishing strong with a record of 24-3-2. Their championship  win marks the first state title--not only for the program--but for any  girls hockey team south of the Twin Cities.

It is my honor to recognize this year's Class 1A Minnesota Girls'  Hockey Champions today. Thanks to the strong leadership and  encouragement from Coach Gunderson, and relentless support by the  team's staff, families, classmates, and community these talented young  women earned a state championship title. All of us across the First  Congressional District are incredibly proud to call them our own.

Congratulations to Coach Gunderson and the entire Wildcats family on  an unbelievable season.
