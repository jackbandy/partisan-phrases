Recognizing Sheriff Dave Lange


Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sheriff Dave  Lange, who is retiring this month after a nearly 40-year career in law  enforcement, including 29 years with the Nicollet County Sheriff's  Department.

A proud son of southern Minnesota, Sheriff Lange joined the  department right out of high school as a jailer-dispatcher. He then  went on to work briefly in North Mankato before returning to the  sheriff's department for good.

In 2002, he was elected sheriff, a position he has proudly held for  the past 23 consecutive years. Since joining in the mid-1980s, Sheriff  Lange has seen the department navigate decades of change. During his  years of leadership, he spearheaded the procurement of new vehicles and  equipment and oversaw the implementation of new technologies within the  department.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Sheriff Lange for his years of service and the  example that he has set for all of us in southern Minnesota. I offer  congratulations to Sheriff Lange on his retirement and best of luck in  this next chapter.
