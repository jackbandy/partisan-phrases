Recognizing Brian Mathiowetz


Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a community  leader and my good friend, Brian Mathiowetz, who received the 2024  Lifetime Achievement Award from the Associated General Contractors last  Tuesday.

Brian joined the family business, Mathiowetz Construction, full-time  in 1981, working for his father Richard.

Brian quickly proved to be a driving force behind the company's  growing success, recognizing early on that good businesses invest in  good people.

Across southern Minnesota, Mathiowetz Construction has become a  respected name in the industry, relied upon by federal, state, and  local partners, as well as commercial and private customers who have  trusted Brian and his family business to bring these important projects  to completion.

His leadership has grown the now-fourth-generation company into one  of southern Minnesota's leading employers. Brian has contributed in  many ways to the growth and development of Minnesota's First  Congressional District, building many of the roads and bridges that  connect us to our families and neighbors.

To me, there is no one more deserving of this Lifetime Achievement  Award. I congratulate Brian on earning this accomplishment and thank  him for his years of dedication to building a better community for all  of us in southern Minnesota.
