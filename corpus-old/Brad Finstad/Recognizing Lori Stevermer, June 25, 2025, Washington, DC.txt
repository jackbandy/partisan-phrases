Recognizing Lori Stevermer


Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend and  fellow Minnesota farmer, Lori Stevermer, who recently completed a  successful term as president of the National Pork Producers Council.

Lori has dedicated her career to advocating for Minnesota's pork  producers. In addition to raising pigs with her husband, Dale, on their  farm near Easton, Minnesota, Lori served 9 years on the executive board  of the Minnesota Pork Producers Association, including 2 years as  president, and on various State and national committees.

The time and effort she invests on behalf of not only Minnesota pork  producers but all American pork producers has helped shape a better  business climate, expand American producers' market access, and promote  the benefits of pork to a wide audience.

Lori often says: ``The world is run by the people who show up.'' And  show up she does. Lori has made countless trips to Washington, as well  as all across the country and internationally, to advocate for her  fellow pork producers.

I thank Lori for her years of relentless dedication and leadership,  and congratulate her on a successful year as president of the National  Pork Producers Council.
