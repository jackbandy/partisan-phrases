Cuts to Forest Service Endanger Millions


Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Schrier for her  leadership, her friendship, and for being an advocate on behalf of her  constituents.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to demand answers on the recent funding and  staff cuts to the U.S. Forest Service. Last week, I led a letter to the  administration urging a reversal of these shortsighted decisions. We  are still waiting for a response.

In my district, a wonderful, nonpartisan organization called Keep  Indianapolis Beautiful has helped people and nature thrive. They work  with local government, businesses, community groups, and schools to  plant trees, clean up litter, and transform vacant lots into vibrant  community green spaces.

Mr. Speaker, they work so hard. Their work makes our neighborhoods  healthier, safer, and more connected, but this administration  terminated grants that made this great work possible. It appears that  DOGE has flagged words like ``equity'' and ``diversity'' in grant  applications even when it is biodiversity and tree equity. That is just  not bureaucratic overreach, it is absurd.

Tree equity is the idea that every neighborhood deserves trees.  Without them, underserved areas become heat islands--trapping heat,  raising energy bills, and degrading quality of life. This is not  theory. It is science.

Investing in greener, healthier neighborhoods benefits Hoosiers and  Americans. These cuts undermine that very goal.

I urge the USDA to reverse its course, and I call on our colleagues  to join us in demanding the restoration of these critical investments  in our communities.
