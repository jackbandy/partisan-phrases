Introduction of the National Amusement Park Ride Safety Act


Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the National  Amusement Park Ride Safety Act. This month, 22 patrons were suspended  in the air for two hours on a pinwheel ride at Knott's Berry Farm in  Orange County, California. Incidents like the Knott's Berry Farm  accident happen far too often, and it is time for the federal  government to start regulating permanently affixed amusement park rides  to protect the American public. This should never have happened and was  preventable. I believe that we need better oversight and enforcement of  existing laws, and we also need to close the gap in coverage,  particularly since there is currently no federal oversight of  permanently affixed amusement park ride safety. That's why I'm  introducing this legislation today.

Over 300 million people visit amusement parks every year in the  United States. From school groups to family vacations, amusement parks  are an integral part of our culture and have a significant impact on  our economy. Ensuring that every rider has a safe experience on these  rides is of paramount importance.

The National Amusement Park Ride Safety Act will investigate  accidents, develop and enforce action plans to correct defects, help  improve safety training for ride operators, and act as a national  clearinghouse for accidents and defect data. These enforcement efforts  would be under the jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety  Commission and would increase their budget to ensure that experts in  the commission can effectively develop safety standards for permanently  affixed and no affixed amusement park rides.

Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  legislation and ensuring every American can enjoy a safe experience on  permanently affixed amusement park rides.
