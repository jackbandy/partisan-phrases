Congratulating College of San Mateo's Football Team


Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the College of San  Mateo's football team, the Bulldogs, on becoming back-to-back  champions. Their dramatic 28-27 victory in the California Community  College Athletic Association Championship was their impressive third  title in 4 years.

While the San Francisco Bay Area welcomes the NFL for Super Bowl LX,  I would like to also properly call attention to this remarkable  program. Bulldogs Coach Tim Tulloch says it best: These students work  hard to overcome adversity, and this transformational program builds  young men for the rest of their lives. The team has a 3.4 GPA. Thanks  to their academic achievements and talent on the gridiron, many earn  scholarships to transfer to 4-year universities.

Congratulations to the College of San Mateo Bulldogs on another  historic championship title. They represent the Nation's best of  community college athletes in the heart of my district, and they make  us all proud.
