Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act


Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, free and fair elections are the foundation  of any functioning democracy. The SAVE Act is a blatant attempt to  undermine our election system, weaken American democracy, and unfairly  suppress millions of eligible citizens from voting.

If the SAVE Act becomes law, eligible Americans would have to provide  either a passport or a birth certificate to register to vote and cast  their ballots. About half of American citizens, roughly 150 million  people, don't own a passport.

If an eligible voter doesn't have the means to pay for a passport,  they would need a birth certificate that states their current legal  name. This act could suppress the votes of millions of women in this  country who have changed their names after marriage.

To be clear, if you are a married woman, I guess Republicans don't  want you to vote. If you can't afford a passport, Republicans don't  want you to vote. If you are a college student whose birth certificate  is back home, Republicans don't want you to vote.

Congress has a responsibility to ensure that all eligible citizens  can participate in free and fair elections. The SAVE Act would do the  opposite.
