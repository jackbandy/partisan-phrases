In Memory of Bishop Dr. Frederick Williams, Sr.


Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with profound sorrow and deep  thanksgiving to honor the life and legacy of Bishop Dr. Frederick  Williams, Sr.--a faithful servant of God, an apostolic visionary, a  devoted husband and father, and a tireless advocate for justice,  healing, and transformation. His transition from labor to reward marks  the close of a life lived in humble service and bold leadership, and  his memory will continue to inspire generations to come. A funeral  service to celebrate his remarkable life will be held on Saturday,  January 31, 2026, at The Gethsemane Worship Center International in  Albany, Georgia.

Bishop Williams was born in Dougherty County, Albany, Georgia, to the  late Roosevelt Williams and Evangelist Katie Mae Anderson. The youngest  of seven children--Johnny Bell, Patricia, Gloria Jean, Roosevelt, Jr.,  Larry, and Barbara--he was reared in a home firmly rooted in faith,  discipline, and service. Those foundational values shaped a life that  bore fruit in ministry, civic engagement, and community building.

At an early age, Bishop Williams accepted Jesus Christ as his  personal Savior and was baptized at Antioch Missionary Baptist Church  under Pastor R.B. Smith. Under the pastoral leadership of Reverend  George Daniels, he exercised his gifts faithfully--serving as church  clerk, armor-bearer, organizer of the first Pastor's Aide Board, leader  in the music ministry, and deacon board member--early signs of a  servant's heart and a shepherd's calling. He  formed The Voices of Tabernacle and served as minister of music for  churches across southwest Georgia, gathering and guiding people in  worship.

In 1991 Bishop Williams answered a divine call to preach the gospel.  He pursued nonprofit and leadership training at Clark Atlanta  University and, in 1992, launched Gethsemane Worship Center  International in Albany from a small building on Baldwin Street leased  by then-Mayor Paul Keenan. With only nine members, that congregation  grew into a thriving interdenominational ministry impacting lives  locally and globally. He also served as Pastor of New Zion Hill Baptist  Church and later organized Divine Covenant International Fellowship,  providing apostolic covering and mentoring more than 100 ministers,  preachers, and leaders--many in Liberia--under his apostolic anointing.

Bishop Williams was united in holy matrimony on May 7, 1988, to  Felicia Jones, and together they raised a loving family: Victoria,  Vanessa, Frederick, Jr., Fredesha, Lawanna, Natasha, and Nazarelle-- children who were a constant source of joy and pride.

A lifelong learner, Bishop Williams was a proud graduate of Dougherty  Comprehensive High School (Class of 1980) and Albany Technical College.  His studies continued at Georgetown College, Regents Park College at  the University of Oxford, The Interdenominational Theological Center of  Morehouse College, and culminated with a Doctorate in Theology from  North Carolina University Wilmington, where he was recognized as a  distinguished member of the President's Club.

Before full-time ministry, Bishop Williams worked at McGregor Golf  for eleven years and later served the community as a bus driver for the  Dougherty County School System and as a dispatcher with the Albany- Dougherty 911 Communication Center. An entrepreneur, he owned The  Gentlemen Shop, G & W His & Hers Accessories, and the Albany Christian  Book & Gift Store.

His ministry and mission were global in scope--Bishop Williams  traveled extensively to Haiti, Africa, London, Paris, Amsterdam,  Belize, Jamaica, Honduras, Mexico, and beyond, and he established two  ministries in Liberia. He served as Bishop Ordinary for the Diocese of  St. James the Just in Florida, was consecrated to the office of the  bishopric in 2016, served as State Bishop of Georgia, and in 2025  joined Lifted Reformation as State Bishop of Georgia.

Bishop Williams' public service and civic leadership were exemplary.  He founded and led Stop the Violence initiatives, co-chaired Albany- Dougherty Community-Oriented Policing, served on the Easter Seals  Southern District Board, and led civic and ministerial coalitions that  bridged faith, law enforcement, education, and the legal community in  pursuit of collective healing and progress. At the time of his passing,  he faithfully served as Chairman of the Board of the Albany-Dougherty  County Board of Elections.

His life of service earned numerous honors: the NAACP Religious  Award; Outstanding Georgia Citizen Award presented by then-Secretary of  State Cathy Cox; Excellence in Community Award from the NAACP; the  Trailblazer Award from 100 Black Men of Albany; Citizen of the Year  from Omega Psi Phi--Eta Omicron Chapter; the Liberty Bell Award from  the Dougherty County Bar Association; a Certificate of Special  Congressional Record from yours truly for his leadership in Stop the  Violence initiatives; eight Mayoral Proclamations; Albany's STRIDE  Award; and many additional commendations recognizing his humanitarian  and civic contributions.

Bishop Williams was also an author and creative minister--writing  Order in the House and The Church Under Siege, producing the gospel  recording Zion Is Calling, and hosting the podcast Plug In With  Bishop--platforms through which he taught, encouraged, and lifted up  his community during seasons of trial and renewal.

In 2009, following the tragic loss of his sister, Bishop Williams  convened leaders at Albany State University and asked, ``What can we  do?'' Out of that conversation grew a sustained, collaborative response  to violence and community pain--an enduring testament to his capacity  to turn grief into constructive action.

Mr. Speaker, Bishop Dr. Frederick Williams, Sr., was a man who  married conviction with compassion, preaching comfort while organizing  for justice. He answered calls to both prayer and practice, building  institutions, mentoring leaders, and offering pastoral care to  countless families. He bore witness to a faith that moved beyond  sanctuary walls into streets, schools, and global mission fields.

I ask my colleagues to join me, my wife Vivian, and the more than  765,000 people of Georgia's 2nd Congressional District in honoring  Bishop Dr. Frederick Williams, Sr.--a pastor, a prophet, a builder, and  a beloved servant whose life of faith, intellect, and action made our  communities stronger and kinder. We mourn his passing, we celebrate his  harvest, and we pledge to carry forward his work of healing, justice,  and spiritual formation.

May his memory be for a blessing. May his family find comfort in the  countless lives he touched. And may his legacy continue to light the  way for leaders who follow in the Holy work of service.
