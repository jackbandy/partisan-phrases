Women in the Military


Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a veteran of the United  States Air Force on this national Women Veterans Day to tell Secretary  Hegseth and President Trump that women who raise their hand and swear  an oath to protect and defend this Nation are not going anywhere and we  will not be silent.

From the earliest days of our Nation, women have always served, both  officially and unofficially, facing off against America's enemies.  Today, women make up nearly 18 percent of the Active-Duty force and 22  percent of our National Guard and Reserve.

Studies prove that their service improves innovation and mission  outcomes, making our military stronger, smarter, and more prepared to  face the challenges of modern warfare.

The administration's artificial barriers on who can lead and who can  serve are disrespectful and irresponsible. Firing and pushing aside  decorated female leaders who earned their positions diminishes military  readiness and devalues the standards and integrity of the very military  itself.

Women in our military are not insignificant or inconsequential. We  are indeed essential, and we cannot be pushed out or erased.
