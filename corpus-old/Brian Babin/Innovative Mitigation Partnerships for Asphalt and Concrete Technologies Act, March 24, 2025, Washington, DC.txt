Advanced cement, concrete, and asphalt production                research program.''.

Mr. BABIN.  1534, the bill now under  consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1534, the Innovative  Mitigation Partnerships for Asphalt and Concrete Technologies Act, or  IMPACT Act.

Today, much of the world is reliant on cement and concrete produced  in China, which is home to the world's largest cement industry. It  should go without saying that it is a big problem to be at the whims of  the Chinese Communist Party when it comes to materials that are  absolutely critical to our national defense, economic security, and our  energy independence.

Beyond that, this reliance comes with severe negative environmental  impacts. China's greenhouse gas emissions exceed all of the developed  nations in the world combined. In fact, U.S. industrial manufacturing  is nearly 28 percent cleaner than our competitors, including China.

If we want a cleaner, healthier environment and global security, U.S.  leadership in this sector is an absolute must. The IMPACT Act ensures  this by propelling America to the front in the cement, concrete, and  asphalt industries. It will increase our Nation's competitiveness  against global adversaries while also achieving significant reductions  in emissions from manufacturing processes.

Specifically, this bill supports the research and development of  innovative technologies, primarily at the Department of Energy. It  builds off the cross-cutting Industrial Emissions Reduction Technology  Development program established by the Energy Act of 2020 and provides  specific direction for the advancement of tools, technologies, and  methods related to cement, concrete, and asphalt production.

Concrete is the second most commonly used material on Earth,  surpassed only by water. The demand is unlikely to decrease soon,  making it crucial to allocate the Federal Government's top scientific  resources to assist manufacturers in meeting our strategic goals, while  ensuring the concrete supply that supports our economy continues to  grow and thrive.

The IMPACT Act positions our country to rise to that challenge and  become a resource for the entire world.

I thank Science, Space, and Technology Committee members, Mr. Miller  and Mrs. Foushee, for cosponsoring this bill and working in a  bipartisan fashion.

Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I am  prepared to close. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1534 is commonsense legislation that passed  unanimously last Congress. It has the support of major industry  associations, including the Portland Cement Association, the National  Asphalt Pavement Association, and the National Ready Mixed Concrete  Association. It also has the endorsement of those groups affected by  downstream impacts, like the U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association and  Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions.

This diverse support is a testament to just how important it is for  the United States to retain its global competitive edge when it comes  to advanced industrial technologies.

I urge my colleagues to join me in backing this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.

Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
