Rewriting History


Mrs. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Stansbury for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, national parks hold a sacred mandate. They are not just  places of extraordinary beauty. They are places of truth. Their purpose  is to preserve and interpret the full breadth of the American  experience: the good, the bad, the inspiring, and the painful.

Erasing history doesn't make it disappear. It makes us more likely to  repeat it. History shows us in this country and around the world that  when governments begin scrubbing uncomfortable truths from public  spaces, they are often moving toward something darker and more  dangerous.

People don't visit our national parks to not only marvel at the  mountains or coastlines. They come to understand who we are. They come  to confront the complex tapestry of our past: our triumphs, our  failures, and the lessons that bind them together.

That is why the recent removal of the interpretive materials titled  ``Life Under Slavery,'' ``The Dirty Business of Slavery,'' and signage  addressing climate change should alarm every American.

These changes don't make us more patriotic. They make us more  ignorant. Let's be clear: These materials were not factually incorrect.  They weren't misleading. They weren't partisan. They were accurate  reflections of our history and our present. They are histories that  make some people uncomfortable, but discomfort is not a justification  for censorship.

If we allow history to be erased in our national parks, places meant  to endure beyond political cycles, we normalize the idea that facts are  optional and truth is negotiable.

That is not just an attack on historians or park rangers. It is an  attack on democracy itself, and the timing could not be more ironic.

As we approach America's 250th birthday, our national parks should be  a place of reflection, learning, and honest celebration. Instead, we  are fighting simply to ensure that these public lands continue to  represent the full dimension of the American experience.

National parks are not propaganda tools. They are not instruments of  partisan comfort. They exist to preserve and interpret the full  American story, not just the parts that make some politicians feel at  ease.

That is why the work of the Coalition to Protect America's National  Parks is so critical. This nonpartisan organization is made up of more  than 4,800 current, former, and retired National Park Service  professionals, people who have devoted over 50,000 years of combined  service to caring for our most valuable, natural, and cultural  resources. These are experts. These are the stewards of our shared  history.

We owe it to them and to future generations to protect the integrity  of our national parks because a nation confident in its values does not  hide from its history; it learns from it. It tells the truth, even when  the truth is hard.
