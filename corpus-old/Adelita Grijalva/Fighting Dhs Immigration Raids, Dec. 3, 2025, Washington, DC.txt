Fighting Dhs Immigration Raids


Mrs. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of his second term,  Donald Trump has directed an enforcement machine that is not only cruel  but unconstitutional, targeting longtime residents, law-abiding visa  holders, U.S. citizens, and even veterans who have fought for this  country.

In border communities like the one I represent in Arizona's Seventh  Congressional District, we see the impact of these abuses every single  day. We have seen Border Patrol waiting outside of hospitals, literally  arresting women after they have given birth--no due process, no regard  for human rights.

Last week, we saw a disturbing example near the ranching community of  Arivaca. Humanitarian volunteers with No More Deaths reported that  Border Patrol agents forced their way into their desert aid station  known as Byrd Camp, without a warrant and arrested three migrants who  were resting inside a trailer. Volunteers told agents they could not  enter without a warrant. Agents left, then returned claiming that they  were in hot pursuit, even though there was no chase, no threat, and no  legal justification that would allow entering a protected structure.

This camp has existed for decades to keep people from dying in the  desert. More than 4,400 men, women, and children have died crossing the  border in Arizona since 2000. The camp has been raided before, but  previously with a warrant. What happened on November 23 was different.  It was lawless, intentional, and part of a broader pattern of unchecked  enforcement that treats border communities as if the Constitution does  not apply.

Let me say this clearly. The Fourth Amendment does not disappear in  southern Arizona. Due process does not disappear because someone is a  migrant. And humanitarian aid is not a crime.
