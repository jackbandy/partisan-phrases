Raising A Question of the Privileges of the House


Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to stand here today to  talk about one of the most important leaders in the city of Chicago for  many, many years, helping person after person, making sure that his  community and our communities have been safe, to stand up and fight for  the people of the city of Chicago, a city that my colleague does not  really understand the kind of faith that they have in Chuy Garcia all  of these years.

For someone who doesn't know about the city of Chicago and the role  that he has played and to find some outside idea that he has somehow  cheated the city of Chicago or the people of the city of Chicago--are  you kidding?

There has not been one single person that has stood up in Chicago and  said that there should be some sort of punishment for our great friend.  I mean, he has been there every day of the year helping people, every  day of the most recent years helping people because we know that people  have been in Chicago trying to take away people's lives, taking them  out of the country, people who are fine, wonderful people in the city  of Chicago.

I say: Shame on you for deciding that this is the issue that you, who  have no idea about the role that Chuy Garcia has played in the city of  Chicago and continues to play in the city of Chicago, will take on.  This should be diminished right now.
