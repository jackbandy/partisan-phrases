Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Bureau of Land Management Relating to Public Land Order No. 7917 for Withdrawal of Federal Lands; Cook, Lake, and Saint Louis Counties, Mn


Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, we have heard this song and dance over and  over again: No mining. That is big key because my State of Arizona has  taken the brunt of this.

This CRA needs to be done away with because we have to have that  ability. The predecessor of the gentleman across the way advocated no  mining. In fact, he used a national monument, disgracefully, to  actually bring in a tin-silver mine. Yes, that is bad, but we can have  our cake and eat it too. That is technology.

Mr. Speaker, if you look at the Boundary Waters that everyone is  debating, we have Canada actually doing gold mining up here with more  toxic chemicals.

Have they had a break?

I don't think so.

I am wondering what makes the difference here. It is not in my  backyard.

I sit on the Natural Resources Committee. We kept asking the other  side, the opposition: Where would you like to have it? Have you been to  a mine? Yes.

Guardians actually made that comment.

I said: Which mine did you go to? They actually said: Resolution  Copper. I said: Really? How did you like the information and the  precautions that you have to take going down in the pit that takes 20  minutes on an elevator?

Obviously, they had to rescind it because they didn't go down there.

There have been problems from way past, but that has been 100 years  ago. We have technology like this I am holding in my hand that will  actually take away any oil and anything that comes out. That is where  our future is, but to bind this up where you don't have a future is the  wrong answer. This CRA needs to go back and get serious about mining.
