Recognizing the 100th Anniversary of the Rotary Club of Lincoln


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this  opportunity to congratulate and recognize the Rotary Club of Lincoln on  their centennial anniversary.

The Rotary Club of Lincoln began meeting one hundred years ago in  1925 and, since then, have become a pillar of the Lincoln community and  a symbol of our region's character. Weekly, the organization comes  together to provide aid and comfort to the less fortunate, to honor  community leaders, to promote integrity, and to work towards performing  meaningful service with the purpose of building a better world. The  Rotary Club of Lincoln is an award-winning service club that has  obtained a wide diversity of accomplishments over the years. Some of  the programs they have sponsored include blood drives, food  distribution, supporting Downtown Lincoln and our local agricultural  industry, advancing education initiatives and extracurricular  activities for students, organizing tree-planting events, and awarding  scholarships, among many other efforts.

I am grateful for their significant contributions in our community  and am confident that the legacy of service they have built over these  past 100 years will only continue to grow in the years to come. Their  efforts have made a lasting and meaningful impact in the city of  Lincoln and the surrounding region, contributing towards the quality of  life and well-being in our community.

It is my distinct honor to represent exemplary organizations, such as  the Rotary Club of Lincoln, in Congress. Therefore, on behalf of  California's 3rd Congressional District and the United States House of  Representatives, I extend my most sincere congratulations to them on  this remarkable milestone.
