Ending Waste of Taxpayer Dollars in California


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, this last week, we won a  momentous victory in cutting off further Federal funding for the  California high-speed rail disaster. Yet, no sooner had the  announcement been made than the Governor of California ran to court to  file his latest frivolous lawsuit.

I say ``his latest'' because it was just a couple of weeks ago that  Governor Newsom was unanimously defeated before the Ninth Circuit Court  of Appeals on his National Guard lawsuit.

Yet, this frivolous lawsuit is particularly perverse because the  Governor is now wasting taxpayer dollars suing so that he is able to  continue wasting taxpayer dollars on an epic scale on a project that  will go down as the single biggest waste of taxpayer dollars in U.S.  history.

The good news is that this lawsuit is going nowhere, and we now have  a chance to finally wind this embarrassing project down so that the tax  dollars of Californians can go where they are needed: toward fixing our  crumbling roads.
