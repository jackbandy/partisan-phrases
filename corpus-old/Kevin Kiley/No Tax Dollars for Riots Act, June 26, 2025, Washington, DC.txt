No Tax Dollars for Riots Act


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, this week I am introducing the  No Tax Dollars for Riots Act, a bill that will assure that public  funding is not used to create the sort of horrifying scenes that we  just witnessed in Los Angeles.

In the wake of the L.A. riots, we have learned that a group claiming  nonprofit status known as CHIRLA received $34 million in State funding  and some Federal funding, as well. This group played a central role in  organizing the riots, providing real-time locations to the rioters of  where Federal officers could be found. Several of these Federal  officers were subsequently assaulted with bricks and Molotov cocktails.

My bill will assure that an organization like this, whose officers  are convicted of assaulting, resisting, or impeding Federal officers,  or of organizing, promoting, encouraging, participating in, or carrying  on a riot under sections 111 or 2101 of title 18 of the U.S. Code loses  their nonprofit status and is ineligible for Federal funding going  forward.

This is a commonsense step that will prevent the sort of lawlessness  that we saw in Los Angeles from reappearing in our State or elsewhere  in the country.
