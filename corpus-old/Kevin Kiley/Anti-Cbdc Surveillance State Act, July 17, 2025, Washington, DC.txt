Anti-Cbdc Surveillance State Act


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration  started us down the road of adopting a Central Bank Digital Currency  issued by the Federal Reserve without the consent of the American  people or their Representatives here in Congress.

Today, we are saying no. We are not the Chinese Communist Party. We  are not going to turn the central bank of the United States into a  giant panopticon, capable of tracking and surveilling every American  citizen, while keeping a watchful eye on each and every one of your  financial transactions, crediting or discrediting, or punishing you  based on your personal behavior, and restricting that behavior with the  tap of a button. Nothing could be more inimical to the liberty and  privacy on which American greatness depends.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a sponsor of this critical legislation  and look forward to its passage on the House floor today.
