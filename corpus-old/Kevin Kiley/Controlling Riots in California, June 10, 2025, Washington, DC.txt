Controlling Riots in California


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, over the last few days, the  country has been shocked by the horrifying images coming out of Los  Angeles, but what is also shocking are the brazenly false statements  made by the Governor of California.

Governor Newsom has asked us not to believe our eyes, not to believe  the scenes that we are all seeing of officers being attacked, of cars  being lit on fire, of roadways being blocked. The Governor has claimed  that everything was fine and that everything was perfect until the  National Guard arrived.

This is completely inaccurate, as a matter of the timeline. Things  had spun out of control well before the Guard got there. That is why  the Guard was called in. It is also deeply offensive to attack the men  and women in our National Guard by claiming that their presence has  somehow catalyzed this violence.

The Governor owes an apology to the men and women in our National  Guard who are serving our State and our country. He owes an apology to  the people of Los Angeles for his role in egging on the riots.

The good news, if there is any good news at all, is that I believe  the people of California have had enough. There is a coalition for  common sense emerging in our State, and I believe we will return sanity  and safety to our communities.
