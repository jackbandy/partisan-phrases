Bring the Senseless Redistricting War to An End


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, this is the moment to bring the  senseless redistricting war to an end.

Today, a Federal District Court tossed out the gerrymandered map in  Texas with an appeal headed straight to the Supreme Court. California's  gerrymandered map is facing a similar legal challenge. We don't know  how these cases will turn out, so there is uncertainty at this moment  whether the whole redistricting war is going to end as a wash or with a  modest advantage for one party or the other.

Now, it really shouldn't matter. I am against gerrymandering wherever  it occurs no matter which party stands to benefit, but this present  uncertainty has created a window of opportunity for a bipartisan  agreement to bring this madness to an end.

Mr. Speaker, I have introduced H.R. 4889 to ban mid-decade  redistricting in every State in the country. I am calling on House  leadership to do the right thing and bring this bill to the floor for a  vote. Not only is it supported widely by Members in this body but a  poll showed that the American people support this proposal by a 3 to 1  margin. Let's pass this legislation and restore a dose of sanity to  politics in this country.
