Protecting Medicaid Benefits in California


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, the moment of reckoning for  California Governor Gavin Newsom has arrived. While I have been  fighting to protect Medicaid benefits for Californians, the Governor's  irresponsible actions are now threatening deep cuts for Medicaid in  California.

Mr. Speaker, Newsom has made California the only State that offers  Medicaid to everyone in the State illegally. It has already cost us  $9.5 billion just this year in State funds, and now it also threatens  to cost us even more in Federal funds.

Governor Newsom faces a very clear choice: He can continue a policy  that no other State has and cost us hundreds of billions of dollars in  Medicaid benefits that could have gone to legal California residents  over the next decade, or he can act now to reverse this irresponsible  policy.

Mr. Speaker, I am strongly urging the Governor and the legislature to  do the latter immediately.
