Investigation Into the Fireaid Concert in Los Angeles


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I have asked Attorney General  Pam Bondi to open an investigation into the  FireAid concert that took place in the aftermath of the devastating Los  Angeles fires.

What we have learned has happened is absolutely beyond belief. In the  aftermath of these fires, which destroyed 18,000 homes and tragically  killed 30 people, there was a FireAid concert in which a number of  high-profile musicians generously agreed to perform and people  responded in an amazing way. Tens of thousands of people donated,  raising $100 million for what they were told was direct relief for the  victims. Now we have learned that this money didn't go to the victims  at all. Instead, it went to nonprofits, some of which have nothing to  do with fire relief, where they promote things like voting and civic  engagement and multigenerational power building. Some of them aren't  even located in L.A.

I have asked the Attorney General to open an investigation in order  to restore the intent of the donors, make the victims whole, and to  bring accountability.
