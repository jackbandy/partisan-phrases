Standing with Brave Iranians


Mr. KILEY of California. Madam Speaker, today I rise to stand with  the brave Iranians who are protesting a repressive regime that has  wrecked havoc on its own people, the region, and the world at large.  The United States must stand with the Iranian people in this critical  moment.

For decades, the Iranian dictatorship has exported terrorism  throughout the Middle East and beyond, while tormenting its own people.  At this moment, it has shut down communications nationwide and is  inflicting violence and death on the courageous people taking to the  streets.

This latest wave of repression is a symptom of weakness. Indeed, the  regime has never been weaker. It is vainly trying to rebuild a nuclear  capacity that the United States can undoubtedly neutralize again. Its  economy has been ruined by the regime's self-sabotage.

It is my hope that the people of Iran do not have to bear the cost of  this malevolence for much longer. It is my ardent hope that a better  future, one of  peace, freedom, and democracy, is not far away for the people of Iran.
