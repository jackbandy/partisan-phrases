Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, the passage of this legislation  will kick off a 10-day negotiation around an issue that is causing deep  divisions throughout the country. I do believe we can come together  around a set of reforms that will advance and focus the mission of  Immigration and Customs Enforcement while protecting our officers and  protecting the public.

However, such reforms must go hand in hand with a commitment to stop  jurisdictions like Minnesota and California from releasing dangerous,  wanted individuals as some sort of act of defiance, thereby forcing  immigration authorities to go into communities rather than have an  orderly transfer in a custodial setting.

I want to read a quote on this topic. It reads as follows: ``I do not  consider it in the service of public safety to release an individual  into the community when that individual can be released to Immigration  and Customs Enforcement for prompt removal.''

That statement comes not from President Trump, not from Secretary  Noem, but from Alejandro Mayorkas, President Biden's Secretary of  Homeland Security.

Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, if even Secretary Mayorkas can  recognize the folly of these so-called sanctuary policies, then all of  us on both sides of the aisle should be able to as well.
