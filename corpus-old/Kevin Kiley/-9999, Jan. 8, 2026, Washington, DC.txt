Mr. KILEY of California. Mr. Speaker, Doug LaMalfa was my neighbor.  Our districts bordered one another. This was true during my time in the  State legislature as well.

The region of our State that he represented is an area where people  often feel like their voices are not heard in the corridors of power,  in places like Sacramento and Washington, D.C.

Doug LaMalfa made it his mission to make sure that their voices were  heard. He used every opportunity he had to make sure their voices were  heard, but he didn't just speak for the communities that he  represented. He advocated, and he used every policy tool available to  see that their values were reflected in policy here. He was a leader in  our delegation and in the whole Chamber on issues like water, forest  management, and agriculture, and that leadership, of course, culminated  in his chairmanship of the Western Caucus, the second largest caucus in  the entire House of Representatives.

I know we are all still so shocked and in grief over his loss, but  Doug LaMalfa's legacy in the North State will be felt for generations  to come.
