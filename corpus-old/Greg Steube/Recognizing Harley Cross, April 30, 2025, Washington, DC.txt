Recognizing Harley Cross, Gold Award


Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me  in congratulating Harley Cross. Harley is a member of Girl Scouts of  Gulf Coast Florida, Troop 5005, and has exemplified extraordinary  leadership, innovative problem-solving, and a demonstrated commitment  to making a lasting, positive impact, by earning the most prestigious  award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award.

Gold Award Girl Scouts are recognized as trailblazers who are willing  to tackle the most pressing challenges facing their communities and the  world with measurable, sustainable, and far-reaching results. To earn  the Girl Scout Gold Award, high school-age Girl Scouts must identify  and investigate an issue they care about, devise a plan, and then lead  a team of experts and community members to implement a project that  produces lasting change. Over the course of 1-2 years, Gold Award Girl  Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and leadership,  distinguishing them from their peers. Through their resourcefulness and  perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to truly make the world a  better place.

Harley's project, Community Food Pantry, in partnership with the  DeSoto County Sheriff's Office, Stamp Our Hunger, DeSoto Cares, All  Faiths Food Bank, and local Girl Scout troops, was an excellent  endeavor to address hunger in our community. Harley took action by  collecting food donations, educating community members about food  insecurity, and building a brand new food pantry to serve her  community, which will have a positive impact on our community for years  to come.

On behalf of the 17th Congressional District of Florida,  congratulations to Harley Cross for achieving the highest distinction  in Girl Scouts, the Gold Award. We thank Harley for her leadership and  making such a positive, lasting change in our community.
