Recognizing Wyatt Dickinson, Eagle Scout


Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me  in congratulating Wyatt Dickinson. Wyatt is a member of Boy Scout Troop  776 and has exemplified extraordinary leadership, innovative problem- solving, and a demonstrated commitment to making a lasting, positive  impact, by earning the most prestigious rank in Scouting--the Eagle  Scout.

Eagle Scouts are recognized as trailblazers who are willing to tackle  the most pressing challenges facing their communities and the world  with measurable, sustainable, and far-reaching results. To earn the  Eagle Scout rank, a Scout must identify and investigate an issue they  care about, devise a plan, and then lead a team of experts and  community members to implement a project that produces lasting change.  Eagle Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and  leadership, distinguishing them from their peers. Through their  resourcefulness and perseverance, they embody the Scout's Oath to `help  other people at all times.'

Wyatt's project, ``Blessing Bags'', was an excellent endeavor to  address homelessness in our community. Wyatt acted by collecting  snacks, stuffing bags, and distributing them to the homeless and less  fortunate teens. His compassion and dedication will have a positive  impact on our community for years to come.

On behalf of the 17th Congressional District of Florida, I  congratulate Wyatt Dickinson for achieving the highest distinction in  Scouting, the rank of Eagle Scout. We thank Wyatt for his leadership  and making such a positive, lasting change in our community.
