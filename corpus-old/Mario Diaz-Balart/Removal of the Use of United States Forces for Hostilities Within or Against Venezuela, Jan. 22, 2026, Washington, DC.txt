Removal of the Use of United States Forces for Hostilities Within or Against Venezuela


Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, here we go again. As Chairman Mast has  said, there are no troops in Venezuela.

Look, the only purpose of this resolution, let's be clear, is to  counter and stop narcoterrorism and drug traffickers in this  hemisphere.

I know that so many on the radical left are upset that Maduro, the  head of the Cartel de los Soles, was picked up and brought to New York  to stand trial. These narcoterrorists are responsible for the deaths of  thousands of Americans every single year because of drugs. Every time  the U.S. eliminates one of these drug boats, it actually saves American  lives.

Let's talk about what is actually going on. While there are no U.S.  troops, the men and women of the Armed Forces, what they are doing is  they have struck 35 drug boats smuggling drugs that kill Americans.  They have seized seven oil tankers attempting to evade sanctions.

It is very simple. Let's not protect those drug dealers, those  cartels. Let's protect the American people. The way to do that is to  vote ``no'' on this resolution.
