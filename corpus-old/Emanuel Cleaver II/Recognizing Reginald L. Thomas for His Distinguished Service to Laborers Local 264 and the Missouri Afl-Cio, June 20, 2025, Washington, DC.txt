Recognizing Reginald L. Thomas for His Distinguished Service to Laborers Local 264 and the Missouri Afl-Cio


Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a steadfast  leader, a tireless advocate, and a committed public servant, Mr.  Reginald L. Thomas, who has dedicated his time to improving the lives  of workers in Missouri's Fifth Congressional District and throughout  the state. As Mr. Thomas steps down from his roles as Vice President of  the Missouri AFL-CIO and Business Manager of Laborers Local 264, a  position he held for more than 15 years, let us celebrate the work he  has done to defend workers' rights, raise workplace standards, and  expand union access across numerous industries.

Mr. Thomas began his career in the labor movement with Laborers Local  264 in May 1996, earning promotions to Laborer Foreman and Crew  Supervisor. In these positions, he was responsible for managing job- site teams, ensuring safety compliance, and overseeing the timely and  effective completion of construction projects. In April 1999, Mr.  Thomas was appointed Secretary-Treasurer of Local 264, where he managed  financial operations, enforced fiscal accountability, and ensured  resources were directed toward member support and workforce  development. He then went on to serve as Assistant Business Manager and  Field Representative, where he coordinated grievance procedures,  negotiated collective bargaining agreements, and advocated for safer  job conditions on behalf of the local membership. These roles prepared  him well for his election as Business Manager of Laborers Local 264 in  February 2010, a position he held for over a decade.

As Business Manager, Mr. Thomas spearheaded numerous initiatives to  empower union members, improve labor protections, and expand job  opportunities. He worked to create training partnerships with local  school districts and technical colleges, building pre-apprentice and  apprenticeship programs aimed at opening doors for young people to  enter family-supporting careers in construction and skilled trades.

Throughout his career, Mr. Thomas has demonstrated strong leadership  and an unwavering commitment to the labor movement, and his  contributions have not gone unnoticed. In 2016, he received the Lillian  L. McKittrick Labor Advocacy Award from the NAACP, an honor named in  memory of Lillian L. McKittrick, a lifelong advocate for the rights of  minorities and women. Having worked for many years in the garment  industry, McKittrick witnessed firsthand the need for reform within the  labor movement. This honor recognizes individuals who have shown  outstanding dedication to labor advocacy while advancing the broader  goals of civil rights and economic justice. In 2019, Reggie was named  Labor's Representative of the Year by the Labor's Educational &  Political Club Independent in recognition of his effectiveness in  organizing, legislative engagement, and grassroots mobilization. These  accolades reflect the tangible, community-level impact of Mr. Thomas'  contributions toward creating more equitable hiring practices, greater  workplace protections, and a stronger pipeline for economic mobility.

Beyond the state of Missouri, Mr. Thomas' voice has been heard across  the country. As Special International Representative for the Laborers  International Union of North America and Vice President of the Missouri  AFI-CIO, he played a major role in supporting national labor efforts.  These included advocacy for the expansion of wage protections, along  with infrastructure-investment legislation such as the Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law. Mr. Thomas was also a vocal proponent of pro-labor  reforms to the National Labor Regulation Act, aligning Missouri's  agenda with national priorities.

Mr. Thomas' service is not only defined by awards and titles, but by  the lasting impact of his work. He forged partnerships between unions  and civic groups and strengthened the role of labor in addressing  housing, healthcare, and education challenges. Additionally, he led  efforts to remove systemic barriers to union jobs for communities of  color and championed a public education campaign on the economic and  social benefits of organized labor.

Now, as Secretary-Treasurer of the Greater Kansas City AFL-CIO, Mr.  Thomas continues to provide leadership and vision for the future. Those  who have worked with Reggie know him as a man of principle, integrity,  and resolve. He is respected by colleagues, union members, and public  officials alike. His legacy includes not only stronger institutions but  a more empowered, united labor force in Missouri and beyond.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing and  thanking Mr. Reginald L. Thomas for his years of extraordinary service  to the American labor movement. As he begins this new chapter, we  celebrate his legacy of progress and look forward to the continued  impact he will have in building a more equitable and empowered  workforce for Missouri and beyond.
