Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Judge Stephen  Vaden's nomination to be the Deputy Secretary of Agriculture.

Judge Vaden is no stranger to public service. He served as USDA  general  counsel during President Trump's administration and now sits on the  U.S. Court of International Trade, both roles confirmed by this body.

He brings a deep understanding of rural America because he has lived  it. His family has farmed in Tennessee and Kentucky for generations.  That firsthand knowledge, combined with his experience in ag policy,  makes him uniquely qualified to serve.

USDA needs proven leaders to support Secretary Rollins to carry out  the administration's mission in rural communities. Judge Vaden is ready  to serve again, and I urge my colleagues to confirm him.
