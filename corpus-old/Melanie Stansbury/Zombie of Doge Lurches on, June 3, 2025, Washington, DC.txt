Zombie of Doge Lurches on


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, Elon Musk has left the building. Yet,  unfortunately, his legacy of chaos and corruption lives on. The zombie  of DOGE lurches on here in the House with the delivery of a $9.4  billion rescission package to make those cuts permanent, a fiscal year  2026 budget delivered in front of the Committee on Appropriations to  eviscerate Federal programs, and, yes, the disgusting abomination of  reconciliation that is in front of the Senate right now.

Though Elon Musk has exited the building, a new villain has entered  the chat with OMB.

Let's evaluate the legacy that leaves behind thousands fired,  agencies dismantled, shattered lives, starving children, over 200  lawsuits, and a grift for the ages as Musk stole data, primed the pump  for billions in contracts, and set our agencies on a path for  privatization.

Yet, let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. No one is above the law; not Elon  Musk; not the OMB Director; not Donald Trump; not the grifter in chief.  We will hold them accountable.
