Call A Vote on Healthcare Now


Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, imagine being so ideologically  committed to destroying an imperfect healthcare bill that has helped  millions of Americans access care over the last 15 years that you would  block a vote--just a vote--to extend the lifesaving credits that help  keep millions of Americans on their healthcare.

Madam Speaker, imagine that you would block members of your own party  from bringing an amendment to extend those credits and that those  members would be forced to join all 214 Democrats to force a vote on  the floor. Also imagine that you would kill a motion to vote on that  one day before you plan to send everyone home for the holiday.

Welcome to Donald Trump's America and the Republican Congress where  the leadership would rather let children, seniors, veterans, and small  businesses lose their healthcare than even take a vote.

Thankfully, we have filed a discharge petition that will ripen in 7  legislative days, but we know that is not enough. We are calling on the  leadership to call a vote now.
