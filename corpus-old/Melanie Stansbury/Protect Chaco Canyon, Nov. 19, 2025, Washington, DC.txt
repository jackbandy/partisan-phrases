Protect Chaco Canyon


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, Chaco Canyon is sacred, the ancestral  homeland, and a living landscape and home to the Pueblo and Dine  people. It is a World Heritage Site and a landscape of ancient ruins,  kivas, and sacred lands as far as the eye can see, which is why I stand  here tonight in solidarity with Tribal leaders from across New Mexico  to say protect Chaco Canyon, protect it from the attacks of a Trump  administration that is trying to open these lands once again to oil and  gas drilling.

Can you imagine, one of our most sacred sites, which Secretary  Haaland protected in 2023, which the New Mexico delegation is trying to  permanently withdraw, a place the Pueblo leaders say holds the  footprints of their ancestors and countless generations; Navajo leaders  who say that it is deeply embedded in our way of life, the living  community, and our very culture.

However, this administration has forged ahead to open these lands to  the irreparable desecration of drilling on this sacred site.

I call on the administration and the American people to join us in  this fight to protect Chaco Canyon.
