Supporting Our First Responders


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, as we honor Police Week, I rise to take a  moment to thank all of our first responders who bravely put their lives  on the line every day across New Mexico and to honor all of those who  have fallen in the line of duty.

As we honor our heroes, we must honor them not just in words, but in  action, because our communities deserve real solutions: funding for law  enforcement, behavioral health programs, keeping fentanyl off the  streets, and real solutions that keep our communities safe.

That is why I have been working with State police, Tribal law  enforcement, county sheriffs, and police departments across New Mexico  to invest in technologies and tools to fund fire stations and emergency  response, to invest in healthcare providers and behavioral health  clinics, working with housing and homeless providers to help our  veterans, elders, families, and young people, and to keep our  communities safe. We do it by investing not only in the people who  serve our communities bravely every day, but by investing in the people  of our communities.
