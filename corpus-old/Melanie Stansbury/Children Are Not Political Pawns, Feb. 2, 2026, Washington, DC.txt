Children Are Not Political Pawns


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, what country is this?

Children are not political pawns or political props. Tonight, 5-year- old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father are back in their home in  Minnesota after being abducted and taken to detention in Texas, but  this never should have happened.

A 5-year-old taken from his home and detained in violation of his  basic human and constitutional rights is part of an ill-conceived and  incompetently implemented policy of daily deportation quotas that is  not just incompetent but inhumane.

This year, 3,800 children have been abducted across the country and  detained. It is shameful and an embarrassment to our country. That is  why we must act. It is why I will vote ``no'' and not give a single  other penny to DHS. It is why we must impeach Kristi Noem. It is time  to act. We will not be complicit.
