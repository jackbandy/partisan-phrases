Hands Off Our Education


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to say to our President  and to his administration: Hands off our education, hands off our  teachers, hands off our students, and hands off our schools. Last week,  the Department of Education sent a letter to thousands of public  schools across the country asking them to certify that they would end  programs promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility or  they would have their Federal funding cut.

Let us be clear. This is a direct attack on our communities on whose  histories, whose cultures, whose languages, and whose communities  count.

Last week, we met with the Secretary of Education and hand delivered  a letter calling on the administration to end these attacks on our  schools, on our communities, on Tribal communities, and our education  system.

We will continue to fight back because we cannot stand with a country  that is attacking our students.

Mr. Speaker, I say to our President: Hands off our schools, hands off  our students, and hands off our communities.
