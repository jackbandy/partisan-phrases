This is Not Normal


Ms. STANSBURY. America, continue to be courageous because what is  happening right now is not normal: The dismantling of agencies,  including today the Department of Education, the firing of teachers,  veterans, military, hacking your personal data, cozying up to foreign  adversaries. This is not normal.

We must continue to fight back, to push back in Congress, in the  courts, and in our communities, so here is what you can do. Raise your  voice. Push your Members of Congress, push the administration, push  your State and local leaders, engage in collective action, and engage  in everyday acts of resistance in your own life because, America, this  is not normal. We will not go back.

I say to you, stay strong, raise your voices, and engage in acts of  courage.
