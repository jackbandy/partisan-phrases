Providing for Consideration of H.R. Rescissions Act of 2025


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this harmful,  shameful, and offensive rescission package.

The GOP is canceling $9.4 billion, yes, billion, in funding for  programs that fund lifesaving work across the world. It is funding for  public television and public radio, for agriculture and research jobs,  in my own district, and to codify the DOGE cuts that two-thirds of  Americans oppose. Our own President asked his other Cabinet members,  just 2 weeks ago, if they were just total bullshit. That is a quote of  the President of the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I am here to tell Members of this Chamber to vote ``no''  on this rescission package.

Transmitted by the director of the Office of Management and Budget  and architect of Project 2025, Russell Vought: This package would make  permanent cuts to USAID and the State Department which was put into  motion illegally. They knew it because they were impounding funds. They  essentially admitted that in the rescissions package because they said  it was pursuant to the Budget Control Act. They knew that what they  were doing was illegal.

Now, 5, 6 months later, they have transmitted this package to cut $8  billion in programs that saves the lives of children across the world,  that would gut U.N. programs that would save thousands of lives, and  gut public broadcasting.

This is a full-scale attack on our international system, global peace  and security, the health and welfare of millions of children across the  world and on public television. We will fight back every step of the  way.

Mr. Speaker, not only am I a ``no,'' I am a ``hell, no'' on this  package.
