History Will Remember


Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to address the Members of  this Chamber and the American people, especially in the wake of remarks  by the President and actions by the GOP here in the House this week  which undermine the Constitution and the fundamental rule of law.

It is with that in mind that I say tonight that there is no situation  in which Donald Trump will serve a third term in these United States of  America. It is unlawful, unconscionable, and, yes, unconstitutional.

To my colleagues across the aisle who are supporting legislation this  week that would weaken and undermine the judicial system and the voting  rights of Americans, I say to you that history is watching and will  remember this moment.

Did you stand with the American people and our democracy or did you  stand with the lawless administration who is unleashing chaos on our  communities and our democracy and our Nation? I encourage my colleagues  to find your backbone. Right your minds and right your hearts because  history will remember.
