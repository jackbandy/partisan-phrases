Chaco Canyon is Not for Sale


Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, Chaco Canyon is sacred ground. It is  the ancestral homeland and living landscape to both Pueblo and Dine  people. It is a World Heritage Site, a place of ancient ruins, kivas,  and sacred lands as far as the eye can see. It is a place that is a  mere 50 miles south of the San Juan River where I was born.

I rise today in solidarity with Tribal leaders from across New Mexico  to say that it is time to protect Chaco Canyon and these sacred lands.  Before our very eyes, the Trump administration is trying to open these  sacred lands to oil and gas drilling that would irrevocably destroy  them.

Can my colleagues imagine? This is one of the most sacred sites, not  just in New Mexico but in North America. It is a place that Secretary  Deb Haaland worked to set aside in 2023 and a place which the New  Mexico delegation is seeking to permanently protect.

As Pueblo leaders tell us, Chaco holds the footprints of our  ancestors. Countless generations have carried forward their teachings  and traditions. As Navajo leaders have said, it is a landscape deeply  embedded in our way of life and which protects the living community,  youth, elders, and our culture.

Even as Tribal leaders are saying no, this administration is forging  ahead to open these lands to desecration of sites that could never be  recovered.

Madam Speaker, we call on this administration to stop. These sites  are sacred. We call on the American people to join us in this fight. We  must protect Chaco Canyon, and Chaco Canyon is not for sale.
