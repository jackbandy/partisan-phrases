No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025


Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration is the most lawless  in American history. That is why so many of his policies are being  blocked through nationwide injunctions.

Republicans see this as evidence of some liberal plot among the  judiciary, but the judges who have ruled against him, some appointed by  such noted liberals as George Bush and Ronald Reagan, are not part of  some grand conspiracy to stop the Trump agenda. They are following the  law and the facts wherever they lead them. In case after case, the law  and the facts are squarely against Donald Trump and his administration.

Whether it be his efforts to rewrite the 14th Amendment to eliminate  birthright citizenship or his scheme to deport immigrants without even  the barest hint of due process, the courts have properly acted as a  check on his power.

How do Republicans respond? They respond not by urging the  administration to stay on the right side of the law and the  Constitution. No, they simply want to make it harder for anyone to hold  this lawless administration accountable.

This bill would prohibit district courts from issuing nationwide  injunctions even when the policies they find unlawful or  unconstitutional have nationwide effects. That would be as if Brown v.  Board of Education applied only to Brown. To do so would mean that no  one could ever effectively check any administration's power, and no  administration could ever be held accountable. The President would be a  real, not a would-be, dictator.

This bill is a dangerous threat to the rule of law. This bill is not  intended to curtail rogue judges from issuing rogue rulings. It is  intended to enable a rogue administration to continue to violate the  law.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this legislation.
