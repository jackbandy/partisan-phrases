Recognizing Anita Altman


Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Anita Altman, a  distinguished New Yorker and cherished member of our community, who  will celebrate her 80th birthday on June 2, 2025.

Anita has devoted her life to building a more inclusive,  compassionate, and just society. A proud daughter of the Bronx, Anita  was raised in a working-class Greek Jewish household by her parents,  Jack and Sarah, and her grandparents Anna and Zadick Coffino, who  emigrated from the Ottoman Empire and made their home on the Lower East  Side. From these deep roots, Anita cultivated a lifelong commitment to  public service, Jewish communal life, and progressive social change.

After earning her B.A. from City College and a Master's in Health  Services Administration from the New School, Anita began a career that  would span urban planning, public health, and groundbreaking social  advocacy. From her early work at the New York City Planning Department  and Montefiore Medical Center to her service on Manhattan's Community  Board 7, Anita has been a tireless force for equitable development,  healthcare access, and community empowerment.

Anita's visionary leadership at UJA-Federation transformed the  landscape of aging and disability services in New York. She was  instrumental in launching the state's first programs for Naturally  Occurring Retirement Communities, helping thousands of seniors age with  dignity in the communities they helped build. She led one of the first  Jewish communal responses to the AIDS epidemic and convened the  Federation's Task Force on  Family Violence, for which she was honored with the Governor's Courage  Award and the Woman of Valor award from the New York Board of Rabbis.

Perhaps most widely known is Anita's creation of the Reel Abilities  Film Festival, the nation's largest showcase of films by and about  people with disabilities. Through ReelAbilities, Anita helped elevate  underrepresented voices, challenge public perceptions, and promote the  full inclusion of people with disabilities in American life.

As she celebrates 80 extraordinary years, I recognize Anita Altman  for her vision, her integrity, and her unwavering belief that all  people deserve to live with dignity, visibility, and respect.
