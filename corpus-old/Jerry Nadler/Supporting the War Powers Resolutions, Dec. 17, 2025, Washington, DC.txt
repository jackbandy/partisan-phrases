Supporting the War Powers Resolutions


Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, prior to the Trump Administration, the  United States followed a policy of interdiction to combat drug  trafficking in the Caribbean. Over the past decade, that approach led  to a steady decline in Venezuela's role as a major drug transit route.  It relied on stopping vessels, inspecting cargo, and arresting suspects  where evidence existed. This Administration has shamefully abandoned  that lawful and effective approach in favor of bombing boats and  committing extrajudicial killings at sea. There is no operational  reason for abandoning interdiction, which worked, respected the rule of  law, and avoided the use of lethal force where arrest and prosecution  were possible.

After decades of forever wars, the American people are sick and tired  of being dragged into needless armed conflicts. Despite that, President  Trump escalated his reckless campaign against Venezuela even further  last night, pushing the Nation closer to a war the American people do  not want.

For weeks, the Administration has carried out lethal strikes on small  boats in Venezuelan waters, killing dozens of people without any  authorization from Congress. These killings occurred without due  process and without any explanation for why the vessels could not have  been stopped, inspected, and the individuals on board arrested and  prosecuted. Most disturbing of all, the Administration carried out a  so-called ``double-tap'' strike, deliberately targeting wounded  survivors after an initial attack. That conduct is indefensible and  inconsistent with the rule of law and the values the United States  claims to uphold.

The President is also asking the American people to accept a  justification that does not withstand scrutiny. The Administration  claims these killings are about stopping drugs, but there is no  credible evidence that Venezuela is a significant source of fentanyl  entering the United States. The fentanyl crisis is driven  overwhelmingly by synthetic opioids manufactured elsewhere and smuggled  through established land routes, not by small boats off the Venezuelan  coast. And Trump's professed concern about drug trafficking rings  hollow when he issued a pardon to the former president of Honduras  after a U.S. jury convicted him of running a violent drug-trafficking  conspiracy to move massive quantities of cocaine toward the United  States. If Trump were serious about stopping drugs and not using  counternarcotics as a pretext for military escalation and regime  change, he would not be letting convicted traffickers walk free while  eyeing Venezuela's vast oil resources.

To this day, the Administration has not provided Congress with a  public legal justification for these killings, nor has it explained the  legal authority it claims to rely on. Congress and the American people  deserve to see the legal rationale for the use of lethal force carried  out in their name.

History teaches that unlawful uses of force cannot be excused by  secrecy or by claims of simply following orders. Responsibility does  not vanish up and down the chain of command when the law is violated.  As international tribunals have long made clear, including at  Nuremberg, individuals are responsible for war crimes and unlawful  killings even when acting under superior orders. That principle must  apply here as well. A future Administration committed to the rule of  law will have a responsibility to investigate these actions fully and  hold accountable those responsible for unlawful killings carried out in  the name of the United States.

The Constitution is clear: the power to authorize war belongs to  Congress, and Congress alone. No President gets a blank check to wage  war by decree. That is why today, I proudly voted for two War Powers  resolutions to block further escalation and reassert Congress's  constitutional authority. It is unfortunate that Democrats had to force  these votes under the War Powers Resolution just to ensure Congress  carries out its duties, despite Speaker Johnson's best efforts to keep  them off the House floor and avoid accountability.

The American people do not want another needless war, and I refuse to  let our service members be put in harm's way for an escalation that  Congress never approved.
