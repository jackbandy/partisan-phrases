Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, typically, when we come to this hallowed  floor, we are speaking on behalf of ourselves as Senators, but tonight,  I also want to speak on behalf of my good staff.

I would like to start with the Scripture from Psalms:

The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who       are crushed in spirit.

The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who       are crushed in spirit.

Tonight, many of us indeed are brokenhearted and crushed in spirit.  It is tonight that we gather with heavy hearts to honor the  extraordinary life of Charlie Kirk--a visionary, conservative leader  whose unyielding passion for freedom and faith ignited millions. Taken  from us far too soon by a tragic political assassination on September  10, 2025, Charlie's light continues to shine as a beacon for all of us  who cherish liberty.

Charlie was born in 1993 in a Chicago suburb, and he revealed his  political fire early on. As a high schooler, he volunteered tirelessly  for campaigns, and he penned sharp insights for Breitbart--already  challenging the status quo with the clarity of a born leader.

At just 18, in 2012, he founded Turning Point USA, a movement that  would transform the landscape for young conservatives, millennials, and  Gen Zers alike. Through electrifying campus activism, his influential  podcasts, and nationwide tours, Charlie mobilized a generation to stand  firm against the shadows of Big Government and socialism.

Today, many of those inspired young adults serve in our congressional  offices, carrying forward the fight to safeguard our traditional values  and constitutional rights from an ever-encroaching State. Many of these  people will someday be speaking from this same floor.

Now, Charlie wasn't just a preacher; he was a soul shaped by faith.  He was unafraid to declare himself a child of God. He opened his heart  and mind to every voice, fostering a genuine dialogue amid division. As  a champion of free speech and individual liberty, he urged the next  generation to reclaim traditional family values--the bedrock of a  thriving America.

Through Turning Point USA and his commanding media presence, he  didn't merely shape conservative thought; he empowered a movement,  defending our ideas against progressive overreach with grace, grit, and  unwavering optimism.

Though an evil act sought to silence him, it only amplified his  voice, transforming Charlie into a hero, a martyr whose sacrifice has  kindled a fire in us all. His spirit endures in the hearts of those he  empowered to fight for liberty, reminding us that true leaders don't  fade; they inspire.

So I ask you, everyone listening today, including those of us who are  brokenhearted and crushed in spirit, let us honor Charlie by living  lives worthy of his legacy. Let not your anger turn into hate. Let me  say that again. Let not your anger turn into hate. Please, don't let  Charlie's distractors win. Rather, channel your emotions into fighting  with renewed vigor--renewed vigor for the heart and soul of this great  Republic, nurturing the next generation of conservative leaders.

Charlie's flame burns brighter through each of us. May Charlie Kirk  rest in peace. And may God bless his memory, his family, and our shared  mission.
