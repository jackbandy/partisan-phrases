Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my longtime friend and  colleague and the chairman of Appropriations Committee, Mr. Cole, for  yielding me the time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5371. I look forward to  reopening the government. The shutdown has gone on long enough, and it  is time to end it.

Yesterday was Veterans Day. It is a timely reminder of the commitment  our Armed Forces personnel have made and the responsibility we have to  take care of those who serve our Nation.

The military construction and veterans affairs component of the  legislation meets that goal. The legislation includes $133.3 billion  for the Department of Veterans Affairs, including $113.8 billion in  discretionary funding for VA medical care.

It includes critical funding for mental health services, telehealth  services, veteran homelessness programs, medical research programs, and  rural health initiatives.

It invests in information technology, including robust investment in  VA's electronic health record modernization.

It fully funds all mandatory veteran benefits, including veteran  disability compensation programs, education benefits, and vocational  rehabilitation and employment training.

Nearly $20 billion is for the Department of Defense military  construction program. This amount funds nearly 300 projects at military  bases around the world.

Mr. CARTER of Texas. It includes $2 billion to improve and maintain  housing for servicemembers and their families. It provides requested  resources for the American Battle Monuments Commission, Armed Forces  Retirement Home, and operations at Arlington National Cemetery.

I thank Mr. Cole for his endless work to get us to this point.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the bill.
