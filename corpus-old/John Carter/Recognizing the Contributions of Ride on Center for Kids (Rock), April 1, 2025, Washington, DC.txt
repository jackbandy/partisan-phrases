Recognizing the Contributions of Ride on Center for Kids (Rock)


Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize the 20th  anniversary of the ROCK On Veterans program, a pioneering initiative of  the Ride On Center for Kids (ROCK) in Georgetown, Texas. Since its  founding in 2005, this program has provided equine-assisted services to  more than one thousand veterans, offering healing and support to those  who have served our Nation.

The program began as a collaboration between Lt. Colonel Scott Schule  of the 1st Cavalry Division Horse Detachment at Fort Cavazos (formerly  Fort Hood) and ROCK, with the goal of supporting wounded veterans  recovering at Brooke Army Medical Center Under ROCK's leadership and  with the expertise of team members such as Dr. Priscilla Lightsey, Joan  Cutler, Heidi Darning, and Dr. Nancy Krenek, the program has grown  significantly over the past two decades.

Today, ROCK On Veterans offers a no-cost, 24-week curriculum proven  to reduce PTSD and anxiety while enhancing overall quality of life. In  addition to its equine services, the program now includes the Sport  Clips Heroes Arena, the H-E-B Serving Kitchen, and the expanded Patti  Colbert Learning Center. It also benefits from valuable partnerships  with Texas A&M University and Parsons Mounted Cavalry.

This milestone reflects ROCK's unwavering commitment to those who  have worn the uniform. The organization's work is a powerful testament  to the impact of community, innovation, and compassion in the lives of  our veterans.

On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I commend  the Ride On Center for Kids for 20 years of exceptional service to our  veteran community and thank them for their continued dedication to  healing through horsemanship.
