Saluting the Service of Dr. Gary L. Gosney


Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is with great appreciation that  I present Dr. Gary L. Gosney, U.S. Army Veterinary Corps with a  Congressional Veteran Commendation. Dr. Gosney embodies service and  compassion through his commitment to the people and cherished animals  of his community.

Dr. Gosney began his military career as a Captain in the U.S. Army  Veterinary Corps in August 1968. While stationed in Vietnam from 1969  to 1970, he cared for animals and injured soldiers until they could be  medically evacuated. During his deployment, he served selflessly as a  Zoonosis Control Officer, cared for the animals of the 4th Infantry  Division, became the veterinarian for the 25th Infantry Division, and  volunteered at a Catholic leper colony outside of Saigon. His bravery  and patriotism in Vietnam earned him numerous commendations, including  the Bronze Star Medal with a ``V'' for Valor.

Upon returning to Texas, Dr. Gosney continued his dedication to  service. He opened his own veterinary practice in Temple, Texas in 1970  and was voted the top veterinarian in Central Texas for 17 years in a  row. Beyond his veterinary work, Dr. Gosney has made significant  contributions to his community. A past president and longtime member of  the Temple Founder Lions Club, he has raised thousands of dollars to  support local charities. Additionally, as an avid supporter of the  arts, he has contributed to over 100 Temple Civic Theater productions  and served as its president for seven terms.

Dr. Gosney is a shining example of service and a valued member of the  community. I  proudly join Dr. Gosney's friends, family, and colleagues in saluting  his contributions to the Army and to the Central Texas community.
