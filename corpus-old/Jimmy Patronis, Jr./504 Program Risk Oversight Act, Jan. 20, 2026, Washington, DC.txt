504 Program Risk Oversight Act


Mr. PATRONIS. Madam Speaker, I thank the lead of this bill, the  gentleman from California (Mr. Tran), for his work on this bill.

I appreciate the opportunity to serve as co-lead on this legislation.  The SBA's 504 program helps small businesses to grow, create jobs, and  invest in their communities. Since this program uses taxpayer-backed  loans, it is important that we properly review and manage risk.

Madam Speaker, H.R. 5788 makes a simple fix. It requires risk  assessments for the 504 loan program, just like we already do with  other major SBA loan programs. This helps to close the gap and improves  oversight.

Transparency matters. When we clearly understand how a program is  working, we can protect taxpayer dollars and make sure the program  stays strong.

This bill helps us to ensure that we are responsible with taxpayer  money while continuing to support small businesses.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5788.
