Recognizing Holy Family Catholic Academy


Mr. PATRONIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to include in the Record the  following proclamation recognizing Holy Family Catholic Academy:

Whereas, Holy Family Catholic Academy in Niceville,       Florida, opened its doors on August 8, 2025, marking the only       parochial elementary school to open in the State of Florida       that year and one of a small number to open nationwide,       bringing renewed hope and vitality to Catholic education in       the community;

Whereas, Holy Family Catholic Academy was established to       restore the tradition of classical Catholic education by       offering the area's first diocesan classical school, uniting       rigorous academics with vibrant Catholic faith formation;

Whereas, the school's mission is to ``educate children to       become scholars and form them to become saints,'' reflecting       a dedication to nurturing both intellectual excellence and       spiritual growth in every student;

Whereas, Holy Family Catholic Academy is devoted to forming       virtuous young leaders, instilling in its students the values       of virtue, courage, and conviction so that they may lead       lives of service, character, and integrity;

Whereas, through its rich classical liberal arts       curriculum, the school cultivates students to be deep, clear,       and independent thinkers by engaging them with the enduring       wisdom of Western civilization and challenging them to think       critically in pursuit of truth;

Whereas, Holy Family Catholic Academy maintains an       unwavering commitment to excellence in academics, rooted in       the Catholic tradition and built upon a timeless liberal arts       curriculum, thereby uniting faith with reason and providing       students a strong foundation for future learning and       leadership; and

Whereas, inspired by its Christ-centered educational       philosophy, the school nurtures in each child a lifelong love       of learning and a profound desire to seek truth, beauty, and       goodness in all things, thus helping to form well-rounded       individuals guided by wisdom and virtue;

Now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That Holy Family Catholic Academy is applauded       for its role in strengthening the Niceville community and       advancing educational opportunity through the formation of       virtuous, thoughtful, and service-oriented young leaders; and

Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to       Holy Family Catholic Academy as an expression of admiration,       encouragement, and best wishes for continued success in its       mission to educate and inspire future generations.
