Recognizing the Achievements of Northeast Delta Dental


Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Northeast  Delta Dental and their achievement in receiving the prestigious Malcolm  Baldrige National Quality Award.

Northeast Delta Dental was founded in 1961 as a not-for-profit dental  company administering care in Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire. In New  Hampshire, Northeast Delta Dental plays a crucial role in providing  dental insurance to over half of insured Granite Staters. Additionally,  through their Northeast Delta Dental Foundation, the organization  supports various oral health initiatives, contributing over 1.3 million  dollars in 2023 to programs that enhance community wellbeing.

The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality award is a recognition that  honors businesses and organizations that have the highest standards of  excellence, innovation, and sustainability. Northeast Delta Dental was  recently recognized as a 2024 recipient, one of only five companies in  the United States to receive the award and the first ever from New  Hampshire.

On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional  District, I want to congratulate Northeast Delta Dental for their  remarkable achievement. This well-deserved recognition highlights their  commitment to high standards of care and community involvement in the  Granite State.
