Cuts to Medicaid


Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because healthcare through  Medicaid, covering more than 10 percent of residents and more than 30  percent of all kids in New Hampshire, is on the line.

Their access to lifesaving preventative care, long-term care, and  mental health and addiction treatment will be put at risk by the cruel  and fiscally reckless budget being proposed by Republicans in the  House.

In addition, New Hampshire's Medicaid expansion, established on a  bipartisan basis, would end with any decrease in Federal funds, leaving  68,000 Granite Staters uninsured and devastating our hospitals and  community health centers.

I have heard from literally thousands of Granite Staters on this  issue, including a woman who contacted my office and shared her fears  that cuts to Medicaid would leave her family homeless. She is a  caretaker to two family members and worries they won't be able to  survive on one income if they lose their health coverage.

I will continue to do everything I can to stop a budget that places  the burden of cuts on New Hampshire families like hers to finance  massive tax breaks to the superrich. I urge my colleagues to stand up  against this betrayal of working families and instead focus on how we  can work together to make life safer, healthier, and more affordable  for all Americans.
