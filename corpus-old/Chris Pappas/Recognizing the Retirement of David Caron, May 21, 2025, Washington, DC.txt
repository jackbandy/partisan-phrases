Recognizing the Retirement of David Caron


Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of David  Caron as he retires after over eight years of service as Town  Administrator of Derry. Throughout his tenure, Dave has been a  tremendous public servant in his role, overseeing all the day-to-day  operations of Derry Town Departments.

Dave has managed numerous projects to improve the lives of Derry  citizens, including renovating and constructing long-awaited roads,  conserving land, and expanding police and fire stations. Throughout his  43 years of working in local government, David consistently ensured  Granite Staters received the support they deserved, greatly helping  residents across the state in Jaffrey, Londonderry, North Hampton,  Belmont, and Gilford.

Dave is not only a diligent public servant but a man of outstanding  character and passion. His own family full of hockey players, Dave  spearheaded the Belmont-Gilford cooperative hockey team, cultivating  the 16-year-old program that put numerous players on the ice.

In all, Dave Caron represents the very best of America's public  servants--dedicated, attentive, and unwaveringly committed to the  service of others. On behalf of a grateful district, I want to  congratulate Dave on a well-deserved and replenishing retirement.
