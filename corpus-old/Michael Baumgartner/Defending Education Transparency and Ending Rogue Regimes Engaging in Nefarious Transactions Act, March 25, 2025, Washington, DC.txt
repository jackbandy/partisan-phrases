Defending Education Transparency and Ending Rogue Regimes Engaging in Nefarious Transactions Act


Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Chair, it is an honor to be a Member of this  august body, and as the son of a university professor who cares deeply  about higher education and a former State Department officer who cares  deeply about American national security, I am excited and proud to  sponsor this bill.

Indeed, there are many wonderful things that happen on American  university campuses, but there are also some nefarious and concerning  issues on American campuses that deal with foreign adversaries.

Indeed, Mr. Chairman, the numbers do not lie. Foreign adversaries  have poured billions into American universities, and much of it remains  hidden from public view. In just two universities alone, congressional  investigators have uncovered nearly $40 million in unreported research  contracts tied to the Chinese Communist Party.

Nearly 30 percent of disclosed foreign funding lack even basic  details like contract dates or intended purpose. Current regulations  permit anonymous giving. These are not clerical errors. This is a  systemic failure, one that has left our institutions wide open to  foreign influence with real consequences for American society.

Let's be clear. Every dollar from an adversarial nation comes with  strings attached, expectations about what gets taught, which research  gets funded, and who gets hired or silenced.

We are already seeing the consequences. The committee report  accompanying the DETERRENT Act highlighted research from the Network  Contagion Research Institute, which analyzed foreign funding data  between 2024 and 2019 and found that universities receiving undisclosed  donations from Middle Eastern sources saw, on average, 300 percent more  anti-Semitic incidents than other institutions.

Correlation is not causation, but one thing is certain: Secrecy  allows these influences to operate unchecked and unexamined. The less  we know about where this money is coming from and what it is funding,  the easier it is for malign actors to push their agendas without  scrutiny.

The problem is far bigger than any one country. Sixty percent of all  foreign money in U.S. universities comes from just four sources,  including China and Qatar, nations that oftentimes have strategic and  ideological conflicts with U.S. interests. Despite this, 70 percent of  universities fail to comply with foreign funding reporting  requirements. Worse, universities can simply list foreign donors as  anonymous, further obscuring the source of gifts.

How can we claim to protect academic integrity when billions in  foreign influence remain hidden in the shadows?

This is why the DETERRENT Act is necessary. It closes reporting  loopholes; it requires universities to fully disclose the source,  purpose, and terms of all foreign gifts; and it imposes real  consequences for noncompliance, including fines and loss of Federal  funding. It also ensures transparency in private university endowments,  preventing foreign adversaries from quietly shaping campuses' culture  and academic research behind closed doors.

The American people want to know when foreign countries, including  our adversaries, are active on our college campuses. That is what this  bill is about. Universities have a choice to lead now with  accountability.
