Recognizing Eastern Washington University's Adaptive Athletics Program


Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, there are many things that make eastern  Washington the greatest place to live in these wonderful United States  of America. Today, I rise to recognize one of those wonderful things,  the Eastern Washington University Adaptive Athletics Program, home of  the first collegiate National Wheelchair Basketball Association team in  the Western United States.

Founded in 2019, this program embodies the values of leadership,  teamwork, positivity, and integrity, helping student athletes build  confidence, discipline, and independence both on and off the court.  These athletes balance the same rigorous demands as all EWU varsity  players--classes, practices, study sessions, travel, and competition-- all while setting a powerful example of determination and excellence.

They continue to raise the bar for what collegiate athletics can be,  showing that true greatness is defined by heart and perseverance.

I know, on a personal level, each and every time I see these  wonderful student athletes in person, I am inspired. I have seen the  team traveling to and from games on my own trips to D.C., and I  couldn't be prouder of their dedication and the way they represent  Eastern Washington University. Go Eags.                       Honoring Officer Kellsey Torres

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, last week was National Law Enforcement  Day, and I rise to recognize wonderful Officer Kellsey Torres of the  Spokane Police Department, who was named officer of the quarter, and to  shine the eastern Washington spotlight on her outstanding service.

This recognition is not just about one moment or one case. It  reflects a pattern of service, compassion, and integrity that defines  Officer Torres' work every single day. She embodies the values that  make eastern Washington so special: hard work, humility, and a deep  commitment to helping neighbors in need. Her dedication reminds us that  public service is about people and showing up, lending a hand, and  treating every person with dignity and respect while protecting us.

It is officers like Kellsey Torres who strengthen the trust between  law enforcement and our communities and give us pride in the place we  call home.

Today, we honor her not only for her outstanding service but for  embodying the very best of the eastern Washington spirit. We honor all  of our Nation's law enforcement officers, and may this body back the  blue.                     Celebrating North County Food Pantry

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate the North  County Food Pantry in rural Elk, Washington.

Nestled between the pristine forests and recovering farmland, this  small 1982 mobile home has nourished hundreds of families in body and  soul for decades.

The pantry does far more than provide food. It offers connection,  dignity, and a true sense of community.

At the heart of the community is the director, Lora Benzinger, who  has led the pantry for a little over a year after years and years of  service. Drawing on her background in social services, she has made it  her mission to ensure the pantry nourishes not only families' tables  but also a sense of belonging.

Families come not just for groceries but for fellowship,  encouragement, and a place to be seen and valued.

The pantry brings in volunteers from every walk of life. The North  County Food Pantry stands as a powerful reminder that fighting hunger  is about more than filling plates. It is about nurturing the human  spirit. It reflects the compassion and resilience that define eastern  Washington.
