Recognizing Brycen Phillips


Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, eastern Washington and Spokane are home  to many heroes and champions, but I would like to speak today of one  particularly exceptional young man, Brycen Phillips of Mt. Spokane High  School.

Brycen was named a two-time U.S. Paralympics Track and Field High  School All-American, and he is somebody who has overcome tremendous  challenges.

After suffering a stroke at age 3, Brycen was left with paralysis on  his right side, a condition called hemiplegia. Despite having to  relearn how to walk, talk, and perform daily tasks, he never gave up.

Brycen found his competitive spirit on the track. Representing Mt.  Spokane, he has won multiple State titles and competed on the national  stage, all while maintaining a 4.0 GPA.

Brycen Phillips is a total stud, and the entire Congress and the  entire Republic deserve to hear his story, and they now have.
