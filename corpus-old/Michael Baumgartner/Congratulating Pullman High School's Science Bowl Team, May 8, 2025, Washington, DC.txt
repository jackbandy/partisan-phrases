Congratulating Pullman High School's Science Bowl Team


Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate the Pullman High School's science bowl team for their  outstanding performance in the U.S. Department of Energy's National  Science Bowl held in Washington, D.C., on April 28.

Representing eastern Washington, these exceptional students, Sahil  Ganjyal, Jack Carper, Leon Liu, Kevin Chi, and Nathan Kostenko, earned  their spot at nationals by winning the Inland Northwest Regional  Science Bowl this spring.

At the competition, they joined 63 of their top high school teams  from across the country to compete in one of the most prestigious  science competitions in the Nation. This team from Pullman not only  showcased their talent on the national stage, but they reminded us why  it matters to invest in STEM education and to recognize young people  who are willing to push themselves, think deeply, and work together in  the pursuit of excellence.

They have made their fellow Pullman Greyhounds proud, including  myself, which includes their families and all of eastern Washington. I  offer my heartfelt congratulations and encourage them to keep reaching  higher. Their future and ours is bright.
