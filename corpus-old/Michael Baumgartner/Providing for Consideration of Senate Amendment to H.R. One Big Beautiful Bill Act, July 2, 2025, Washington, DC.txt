Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the big,  beautiful bill.

At its heart, the big, beautiful bill is a measure that will make  America both wealthier and safer. I am inspired in thinking about the  big, beautiful bill of not only this President but two of my favorite  former Presidents.

The first would be President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who realized-- getting the appropriate quote--realized the negative impacts of high  tax rates. Indeed, roughly 60 years ago, President Kennedy warned:  ``The largest single barrier to full employment of our manpower and  resources and to a higher rate of economic growth is the  unrealistically heavy drag of Federal income taxes on private  purchasing power, initiative, and incentive.''

Indeed, I have little doubt that President Kennedy would be a big fan  of the big, beautiful bill.

Similarly, President Reagan realized peace through strength was how  America could defeat the communist Soviet Union. He realized how  missile defense was key to facing up to the challenge of the  communists.

Today, the big, beautiful bill puts much-needed funding into missile  defense through the Golden Dome system.

I encourage every American that cares about making our country  wealthier and safer to support the big, beautiful bill.
