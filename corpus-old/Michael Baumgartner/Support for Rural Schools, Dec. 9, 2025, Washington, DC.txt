Support for Rural Schools


Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S.  356, the Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Act of 2025, which will  be considered under suspension of the rules this week. I urge its swift  passage so it can be sent to the President's desk without delay.

For generations, the Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline  for rural communities and school districts across America. Since 1908,  Federal law has required the U.S. Forest Service to share 25 percent of  revenues from Federal forest lands with local governments to support  public education.

As timber revenues declined due to foolish Federal regulations and  reduced harvests, Congress acted in 2000 to create the Secure Rural  Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, preserving vital funding  for most rural counties. When last reauthorized in 2023, this program  delivered more than $281 million nationwide to help keep teachers in  classrooms and students on the bus.

I represent rural counties like Pend Oreille, Stevens, Ferry, and  Columbia Counties, where school leaders tell me how essential these  funds are to keeping programs running.

This is not a partisan issue. It is a promise to rural America. Let's  reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Act of 2025 and  keep faith with the communities that steward our national forests.             Recognizing Environmental Stewardship in Our Forests

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the timber  industry and the harvest of trees in our forests.

When I was growing up, my father was a forestry professor at  Washington State University and my uncle was a smokejumper. I served in  the U.S. Forest Service.

Years of fear and hesitation around commonsense tools like select  timber harvest and controlled burns have left many of our forests  dangerously overgrown and chronically undermanaged. We need to harvest  more timber for the economic revenue it produces and for the reduced  fire danger it creates.

Good environmental stewardship means empowering these professionals  to be part of the solution and to help manage our Federal forest lands  responsibly for today and generations to come.               Gray Wolf Population Reduction in Washington State

Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, with gray wolf populations reaching  over 400 in Washington State and Oregon, I rise today to warn of the  danger they continue to pose for hunters, farmers, and livestock.

Gray wolves can consume up to 7 pounds of meat a day. Their primary  food sources include deer, elk, and cattle. In August 2025 alone, the  Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife reported that three calves  were killed and two injured in just one 30-day period.

Folks in our region know why our grandparents worked so hard to  control the gray wolf population. They understood that balance must be  kept between wildlife preservation and the livelihoods of those who  live and work the land.

With a significant number of these wolf packs now concentrated in  northeastern Washington and with no signs of their growth slowing,  Congress should take careful note of our ranchers' perspective. Their  continued loss, emotional toll, and frustration caused by inconsistent  State and Federal protections demand attention and action. A one-sided  policy of unchecked expansion is not the answer.

Gray wolf populations have recovered. Now it is time to ask whether  our current path reflects balance, fairness, and common sense for rural  America. As everyone in rural America knows, particularly in Washington  State, if there were wolves in Bainbridge Island or in the suburbs of  Seattle, the wolf population in Washington State would be a little  different.

Mr. Speaker, we need to bring common sense and balance back and  reduce our wolf population in northeastern Washington.
