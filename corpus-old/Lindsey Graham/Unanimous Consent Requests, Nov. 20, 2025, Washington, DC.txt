Unanimous Consent Requests


You said this was a lawful subpoena. What did I do wrong? What did I  do to allow the government to seize my personal phone and my official  phone when I was Senate Judiciary chairman? What did I do?

There was an order issued that said if I was notified of this breach  of my privacy, I am likely to intimidate witnesses or destroy evidence.  Based on what?

There are 10 of us involved here. What did we do to justify having  Jack Smith issue a subpoena for the phone records of a branch of  government--the Senate--where all of us had to decide whether or not to  certify the election?

So, no, it wasn't lawful. You have determined it was. You don't get  to decide; a court does. We are not going to let the Democratic Party  decide my fate; we are going to let a judge decide my fate. But I have  to get in court and prove my case.

To the majority leader, was this provision socialized with the  minority leader?
