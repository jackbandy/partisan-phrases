Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Madam Chair, I rise today not in favor or opposition. I rise in  defense, defense of 811,000 Nevadans and countless people across the  country whose lives are in danger. I rise in defense of my constituents  who will be impacted if Republicans are able to slash their healthcare  services to fund $4.5 trillion to the ultrawealthy and big  corporations.

Madam Chair, Nevada Democrats and Republicans worked together to  implement the Affordable Care Act, including the expansion of Medicaid.  We reduced the uninsured rate by a third, and 563,000 children were  able to receive coverage as a result. The fact that Nevada did the  right thing then means we have more to lose as Republicans do the wrong  thing now.

Our State would be the third hardest hit, including in rural  communities. This isn't a budget. It is the Republican screw America  bill. That is why I  am calling on every Member of this body to vote ``no.'' I will, in  defense of my constituents.
