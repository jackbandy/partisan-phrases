Thanking Roger Sarrault for His Service with the U.S. Army As A Member of the Dustoff Crews During the Vietnam War


Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Roger Sarrault  for his valiant service with the U.S. Army as a member of the Dustoff  crews during the Vietnam War. This recognition is presented in  correspondence with the Dustoff Crews of the Vietnam War Congressional  Gold Medal Act, honoring the individuals who served in these selfless  and heroic missions. Mr. Sarrault's service exemplifies the unwavering  dedication shown by members of these Dustoff Crews to both their fellow  servicemembers and their country. Dustoff crews--which include a pilot,  crew chief, and medic--served courageously aboard helicopter air  ambulances and are credited with saving over 900,000 lives throughout  the Vietnam War.

Serving with the 68th Medical Detachment (Dustoff), Mr. Sarrault  participated in numerous recovery missions, often under enemy fire. His  role in rescuing wounded soldiers from active combat zones demonstrated  extraordinary courage and was vital to saving countless lives. His  service reflects the bravely and sacrifice of so many Dustoff crew  members who risked everything to bring others to safety.

Following his military service, Mr. Sarrault has remained a steadfast  advocate for veterans and his community. He is an active member of the  Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter No. 274 in Cheboygan, Michigan,  where he serves on the Honor Guard and regularly participates in events  that honor fellow service members. In addition to supporting community  celebrations and veteran fundraisers, Mr. Sarrault volunteers his time  at Bishop Baraga School, teaching students about patriotism and proper  flag etiquette. His community commitment is further reflected in his  charitable efforts, including distributing toys at Christmas and making  pasties to support his local VVA chapter.

Mr. Speaker, let us all join in recognizing Roger Sarrault for his  extraordinary courage as a member of the Dustoff crews during the  Vietnam War and thank him for his unwavering commitment to his fellow  servicemembers, community, and country.
