Recognizing the 102nd Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of Turkiye


Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 102nd  anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkiye. On October 29,  1923, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk proclaimed the establishment of the  Republic, ushering in a new era of modernization and progress for the  Turkish people. Today, we honor more than a century of friendship,  alliance, and cooperation between the United States and Turkiye.

The relationship between our two nations has been anchored in shared  strategic interests and enduring partnership, particularly through our  joint commitment to NATO. As allies, the United States and Turkiye have  worked together to promote regional stability, strengthen transatlantic  security, and advance the values of freedom and democracy. Our  collaboration continues to play a vital role in addressing global  challenges--from counterterrorism and defense cooperation to  humanitarian efforts and energy security.

Our bilateral economic relationship is also significant and growing.  Trade between the United States and Turkiye reached nearly $33 billion  in 2024, underscoring the strong commercial ties that benefit both  nations. Here in Michigan, Turkish-American trade and investment have  contributed to local growth and job creation--totaling approximately  $545 million in 2024 alone. From advanced manufacturing and automotive  partnerships to agricultural exports, the economic link between  Michigan and Turkiye continues to strengthen our state's role in the  global economy.

Equally important are the contributions of Turkish Americans to our  society. Turkish Americans enrich our communities through their  entrepreneurial spirit, cultural traditions, academic and scientific  achievements, and civic engagement. Their success reflects the shared  values of opportunity and perseverance that define both our nations.

Mr. Speaker, as we mark this milestone in the history of the Republic  of Turkiye, I extend my best wishes to Turkish Americans in Michigan  and across the United States, and to the people of Turkiye. May the  friendship between our nations continue to grow stronger in the years  ahead, rooted in mutual respect, shared prosperity, and a steadfast  commitment to peace and security.
