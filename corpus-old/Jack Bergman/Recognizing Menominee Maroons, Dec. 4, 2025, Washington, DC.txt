Recognizing Menominee Maroons


Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Menominee  Maroons football team.

The Maroons proudly represented Michigan's First Congressional  District and the Upper Peninsula by winning the Michigan Division 7  State championship, capping off a 14-0 season.

This wasn't luck. This was discipline, toughness, and outright  superiority.

What makes this championship even more special is how the U.P. made  it possible. With just days to prepare for the long trip to Ford Field,  the Maroons suddenly needed tens of thousands of dollars for buses,  lodging, and meals. Our Yoopers stepped up, raising nearly $30,000 in a  matter of days with the entire community pulling together because they  believed in this team.

Coach Brandt restored U.P. Power to Michigan high school football,  bringing home the first State title to the Upper Peninsula since 2015.  As Coach Brandt said: ``We couldn't be here without our town and  community.''

Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I recognize the Menominee  Maroons for bringing the State championship back to the U.P. The  undefeated State champions are a true source of pride for our Yooper  community. I congratulate the Maroons. Well done.
