Recognizing Raymond E. Carlson As the 2025 Upper Peninsula Veteran of the Year


Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Raymond E.  Carlson for being named the 2025 Upper Peninsula Veteran of the Year.  This well-deserved honor reflects his steadfast dedication to his  fellow Servicemembers, the communities throughout the Upper Peninsula,  and our Nation.

Mr. Carlson has long demonstrated exceptional leadership within the  American Legion of Michigan, where his distinguished service has  included terms as Post Commander, District Commander, Zone Commander,  and as a member of the State Department Finance Committee. As president  of the U.P. Convention Corporation, he successfully bid for and  coordinated American Legion conventions for fourteen consecutive years.  In this role, he also secured future convention dates in Sault Sainte  Marie, ensuring the continued success of these important gatherings.

His commitment extends beyond organizational leadership. As Commander  of Post 44, Mr. Carlson spearheaded a $240,000 renovation project to  improve the post's facilities. He remains a constant presence at post- sponsored events, from Bingo at the Marquette County Fair and the  Jacobetti Veterans Home, to Boys State programs that promote youth  development and civic engagement.

In addition to his service to veterans, Mr. Carlson has been a pillar  of support for youth athletics in the Upper Peninsula. As a youth  baseball coach, he led his team to multiple district championships and  a coveted spot in the state tournament. During his twelve years as  chairman of the district baseball committees, he oversaw and organized  numerous successful district tournaments, enriching the lives of  countless young athletes.

Mr. Speaker, let us all join in recognizing Raymond E. Carlson for  receiving the prestigious honor of being named the 2025 Upper Peninsula  Veteran of the Year. I thank him for his enduring commitment to  veterans, his community, and our great country.
