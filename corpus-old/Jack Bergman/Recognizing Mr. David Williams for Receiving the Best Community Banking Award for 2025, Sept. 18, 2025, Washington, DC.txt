Recognizing Mr. David Williams for Receiving the Best Community Banking Award for 2025


Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize my friend, Mr.  David Williams, for being awarded the Best Community Banking Award for  2025 by the Community Bankers of Michigan. This prestigious and well- deserved distinction reflects his dedication to Michigan's banking  industry and his tireless contributions to communities throughout  Michigan's 1st Congressional District.

Mr. Williams' long and distinguished career in banking began at a  small community bank in Houghton, before spending 25 years working for  larger financial institutions in Ohio and lower Michigan. Throughout  those years, he remained committed to a personal goal: returning to the  Upper Peninsula to manage and grow a community bank.

For the past 25 years, Mr. Williams has led Upper Peninsula State  Bank with steadfast commitment to both customer service and community  engagement. His passion for serving his community extends beyond his  day-to-day work, as reflected in his advocacy for the industry at both  the state and federal levels. In addition to his role as President and  CEO, he serves as a Michigan Federal Delegate for the Independent  Community Bankers of America and is a long-time member of FIS's  Strategic Planning Advisory Council.

Mr. Speaker, let us join in recognizing Mr. David Williams for  receiving the distinguished Best Community Banking Award for 2025. I  thank him for his enduring commitment to Michigan's 1st Congressional  District and his invaluable contributions to our great Nation.
