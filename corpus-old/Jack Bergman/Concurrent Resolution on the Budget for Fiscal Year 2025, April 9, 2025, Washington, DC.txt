Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this Senate amendment  to the fiscal year 2025 budget resolution.

Let's be clear about what we are voting on today. We are not voting  on the budget. We are not voting on the numbers. We are voting on the  framework, a starting point for building a budget that delivers on  President Trump's priorities.

Those priorities are securing our border, strengthening national  security, energy independence, and preventing a tax hike of $4 trillion  set to hit at the end of the year if we don't act.

Think of the reconciliation process as a baseball scrimmage. The  House and Senate can't take the field and start crafting the budget  until we step out of the dugout. Approving this framework gets us into  the game.

Yes, there are concerns about how we achieve the spending cuts and  reduce the deficit. That is a critical conversation, but it starts  here.

In the last 100 years, Republicans have had just four chances to do a  reconciliation bill. We were given a mandate by the American people.  Let's not waste it. I urge my colleagues to support it.
