Recognizing the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, His All- Holiness Bartholomew


Ms. GOODLANDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Ecumenical  Patriarch of Constantinople, His All-Holiness Bartholomew, the longest- serving Archbishop of Constantinople in the two-thousand-year history  of Christianity and the spiritual leader of a church of 300 million  people, including more than 4,800 Orthodox Christians living in New  Hampshire. Ordained to the Diaconate in 1961 and to the Priesthood in  1969, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew served as Assistant Dean  at the Theological School of Halki before he was appointed Personal  Secretary to the late Ecumenical Patriarch Demetrios, Metropolitan of  Philadelphia, and Metropolitan of Chalcedon. I want to thank His All- Holiness for his commitment to religious freedom for all faiths as well  as his lifetime of service to all people and our planet. During this  visit, His All-Holiness will receive the Templeton Prize to honor his  environmental and spiritual leadership. I am honored to welcome him  back to the Capitol and recognize his contributions to our Nation and  the world.
