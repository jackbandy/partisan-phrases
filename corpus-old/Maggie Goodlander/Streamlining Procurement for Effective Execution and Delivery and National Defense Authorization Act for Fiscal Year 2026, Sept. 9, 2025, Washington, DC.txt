Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026


Ms. GOODLANDER. Madam Chair, exactly 249 days ago today, we came  together in this Chamber to swear an oath to this Constitution. I keep  it with me everywhere I go, and I remember that we did that not as  Republicans or Democrats. We took that oath as Americans.

We honor that oath by doing our jobs--it sounds simple, but it is  pretty rare--by working in good faith to get good things done and to  solve real problems for the real people who have put their trust in us.

That is what I came to Congress to do. That is what I joined the  House Armed Services Committee to do. That is what we worked to do in  the National Defense Authorization Act. We worked in good faith to find  common cause on cracking down on the high costs from housing to  healthcare that are crushing our servicemembers and military families  and to crack down equally on Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse.

Ms. GOODLANDER. Madam Chair, we worked in good faith to find common  cause to stand up for our servicemembers and our shipyards, to stand up  to determined and dangerous common enemies like Vladimir Putin, and to  stand up for our allies like the people of Ukraine.

I read every bill we vote on, as we all should. This one is 2,000  pages, and I fear that the 200 amendments that have just come to this  floor are going to make what was a bipartisan bill that was good for  America a bill that is not going to serve the best interests of our  country.

I hope that we can summon the spirit that brought us all to this  body.
