Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026


Ms. GOODLANDER. Mr. Chair, I thank Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz  for her leadership.

Mr. Chair, I rise today on behalf of the 88,000 brave American  heroes, veterans, who call the State of New Hampshire home.

We owe a sacred obligation to the women and men who served our  country in uniform. We have got to make sure that they receive the  high-quality healthcare they have earned.

There are 48 States here in the continental United States, and my  home State of New Hampshire is the only one without a full-service VA  hospital. My amendment before the House today would change that. It  will ensure the Trump administration follows through on its promise to  expand services to support a full-service VA medical center in New  Hampshire.

It is past time that we right this wrong and fill this gap.

Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues here in Congress to support my  amendment which will do just that.
