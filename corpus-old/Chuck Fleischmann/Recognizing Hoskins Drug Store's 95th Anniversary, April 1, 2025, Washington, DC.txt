Recognizing Hoskins Drug Store's 95th Anniversary


Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable  milestone in the history of Hoskins Drug Store & Soda Fountain, a  cherished community institution in Clinton, TN. For nearly a century,  Hoskins Drugstore has been a cornerstone of the community, providing  not only essential services but also a deep sense of connection and  tradition.

On April 4, 2025, Hoskins Drug Store will celebrate 95 years of  service. Founded by R.C. Hoskins in 1930, Hoskins Drug Store quickly  became more than just a place to fill prescriptions; it became a  trusted destination where people could count on personalized service,  quality products, and a warm, welcoming environment. R.C. Hoskins built  a legacy that has endured for generations, one founded on integrity,  commitment, and community care.

As the years passed, the legacy of Hoskins Drug Store was carried  forward by R.C. Hoskins' daughters, Dudley Hoskins Bostic and Molly  Hoskins Scarbrough, who continue to lead the business today with the  same dedication and vision that their father demonstrated nearly a  century ago. Their hard work and dedication have ensured that Hoskins  Drug Store remains a beloved part of the community, staying true to its  principles while adapting to the changing needs of the times.

Today, we celebrate the achievements of Hoskins Drug Store, Mr. and  Mrs. Hoskins, and the ongoing contributions of Mrs. Dudley Hoskins  Bostic and Mrs. Molly Hoskins Scarbrough. Their enduring legacy is a  testament to the power of family, tradition, and the unwavering  commitment to serving the needs of the community.

As Hoskins Drug Store enters its 95th year, we recognize and honor  the Hoskins family for their incredible contributions to the community  and the example they set for future generations of small business  owners.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Hoskins  Drug Store on this incredible milestone and in honoring the legacy of  Mr. Rolland Carvel ``Dudley'' Hoskins. May this wonderful meeting place  and business serve our community for many years to come.
