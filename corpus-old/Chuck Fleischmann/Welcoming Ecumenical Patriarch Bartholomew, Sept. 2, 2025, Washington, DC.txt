Welcoming Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend a warm welcome  to His All-Holiness Bartholomew, the Ecumenical Patriarch of  Constantinople and spiritual leader of Orthodox Christianity.  Recognized as ``First Among Equals'' among Orthodox bishops, he is  visiting our Nation's Capital to receive the Templeton Prize--the  world's most prestigious award honoring contributions to religion and  science.

As Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, His All-Holiness leads the  world's second-largest Christian church. Since assuming this role in  1991, he has earned global respect for his spiritual leadership and  commitment to peace. Guided by his belief that ``war in the name of  religion is war against religion,'' Patriarch Bartholomew has built  strong relationships with religious and political leaders in every  continent to promote unity among faiths.

In 1997, Patriarch Bartholomew became the first Ecumenical Patriarch  to visit the United States, and it is our great pleasure to welcome him  back as he meets with the President, the Secretary of State, and  Congress. I recognize and celebrate his lifelong dedication of  peacemaking and his steadfast efforts to build bridges between East and  West, Christian and Muslim, and all people of good will. May his  presence here remind us of our commitment to remain ``One nation under  God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''

I extend my warmest welcome to His All-Holiness and pray that his  visit will be blessed with success, fellowship, and hope for the future  of our common humanity.
