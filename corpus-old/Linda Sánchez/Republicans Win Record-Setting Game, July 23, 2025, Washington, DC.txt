Republicans Win Record-Setting Game


Ms. SANCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I congratulate Coach  Roger Williams and the Republican team on their victory in this year's  Congressional Baseball Game.

I have to say that I was very proud of the hard work and dedication  of the Democratic team. We came out, and we played hard. More  importantly, we raised a record amount of money for local charities  here in the Washington, D.C., area.

The Congressional Baseball Game is probably my favorite time of the  year, not the least of which is because every morning I get to yell at  15 men and tell them what to do. It is also because we can put  partisanship aside and play a good game for a good cause.

Together, we raised a whopping $2.8 million which will go toward  sports scholarships, local girls' and boys' clubs, and other youth  charities. That is something I think we can all be proud of.

Again, I congratulate Coach Williams and his team. I would say to my  friend, we are coming for that trophy next year.
