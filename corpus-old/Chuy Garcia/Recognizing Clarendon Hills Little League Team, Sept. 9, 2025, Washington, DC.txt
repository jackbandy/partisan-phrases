Recognizing Clarendon Hills Little League Team


Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  celebrate the outstanding athletes of the Clarendon Hills Little League  team, who recently finished an incredible season.

This remarkable group made local history by advancing all the way to  the 2025 Little League World Series, a testament to their dedication,  discipline, and work ethic.

Like so many baseball fans across the country, I was inspired by  their determination and spirit. They have certainly captured our  hearts. While they may have fallen short of the ultimate prize, their  accomplishments are something to be celebrated.

Congratulations to the Clarendon Hills Little League team. They have  made our community and all of us incredibly proud. We can't wait to see  what they will achieve next season.                            Honoring Michael Nolan

Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my  constituent, Michael Nolan, who dedicated 48 years of his life to serve  our country at the Social Security Administration.

He is a great example of dedication and service to his fellow  Americans.

Mike Nolan wanted to be a Catholic priest, but he left the seminary  system in 1975. When he heard of an agency that would help the aged and  the disabled, he felt the need to apply to work for the Social Security  Administration.

He ensured the Social Security Act worked for people and took his  calling seriously by serving and advocating for the rights of  beneficiaries.

We are grateful to Michael Nolan's contributions to the Social  Security Administration, including the modernization of the systems,  disability policy, and unhoused population advocacy.

I thank him for his service to our country and wish him the best on  his well-earned retirement.
