Congratulating Burbank American Little League


Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride to  celebrate Burbank American Little League, a beloved youth organization  in my district which started in 1954 and currently serves 350 kids,  ages 4 through 16.

As a lifelong baseball fan, I love watching these young players take  the field with determination and energy. Just this summer, the minor  league division, the 10-year-olds, made it to the State tournament,  while the senior team won the fourth consecutive Central Region  Tournament, something no other team has done before, and went on to  represent our State in the Little League Senior League Baseball World  Series.

Through every hard day of practice under the Sun, these young  athletes build character and grow into independent adults.

Congratulations to the Burbank American Little League for their hard  work. I look forward to many more seasons of teamwork and, of course,  playing ball.
