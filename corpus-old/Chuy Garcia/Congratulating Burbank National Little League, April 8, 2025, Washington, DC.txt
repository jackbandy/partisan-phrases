Congratulating Burbank National Little League


Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a  cherished tradition in my district, the kickoff of the Burbank National  Little League season. This year is special as it is the 70th year of  its existence.

As a lifelong baseball fan, there is nothing quite like watching  young players take the field. Their energy and determination fill me  with joy and hope for the future.

Sports are more than just games. They are a powerful tool to help our  children build confidence, discipline, and a strong sense of teamwork.

Burbank National Little League's mission is focused on core values,  good sportsmanship, honesty, loyalty, courage, and respect for  authority. These are the very principles that shape not just great  athletes but great civic leaders.

It is all about teamwork, a true community effort. From dedicated  coaches and supportive parents to local businesses and volunteers who  maintain the fields and sponsor teams, everyone plays a role.

Congratulations to the Burbank National Little League on 70  incredible seasons and over 80 league local and national championships.  Here is to many more.

Let's play ball.
