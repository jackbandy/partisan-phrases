Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act


Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, bless my colleagues' hearts on the other  side of the aisle for using married women as a gotcha for voting. I  have never had to bring my birth certificate to prove that I was a  registered voter. I have an ID that has a different name than my birth  certificate.

Also, since we are using women as bait here, maybe in the next round  of debates, Democrats could explain to us exactly what a woman is.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the SAVE Act. The American people  are done messing around with a woke, weak-kneed system that lets our  elections get hijacked. I am fighting for them, for me, and for every  American who knows that our vote is sacred. It is time to lock it down  with citizens only.

Mr. Speaker, let's cut the crap. Right now, people can walk up, check  a box claiming that they are a citizen, and, boom, they are registered  for Federal elections with no proof and no ID.

That is not a system built on trust. It is a system vulnerable to  error, fraud, and exploitation.

In Colorado, the process was just expedited for illegals to receive a  driver's license. In the State of Colorado, when you obtain a driver's  license, you register to vote.

The SAVE Act is a commonsense measure designed to protect the  integrity of our electoral process. At its core, it requires proof of  citizenship to register to vote in Federal elections.

This isn't radical. It is not extreme. It is a basic safeguard to  ensure that only those who are legally entitled to participate in our  elections can do so.

Let's be clear. This isn't about denying anyone's right to vote. It  is about protecting the rights of every American citizen, not adding  votes and subtracting American citizens' votes.

Mr. Speaker, I support the SAVE Act.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
