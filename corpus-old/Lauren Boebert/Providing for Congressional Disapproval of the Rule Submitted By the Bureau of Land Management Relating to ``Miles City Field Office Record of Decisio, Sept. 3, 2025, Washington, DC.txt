Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Bureau of Land Management Relating to ``Miles City Field Office Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment''


Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman) for bringing this important issue up today.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 104, which nullifies the  Bureau of Land Management's restrictive Miles City Field Office  Resource Management Plan.

This resolution is a critical step toward restoring American energy  dominance, a cornerstone of President Trump's agenda to secure our  Nation's economic and energy future.

The BLM's rule stifles resource development in Montana, limiting  access to our abundant natural resources and threatening the  livelihoods of our ranchers, energy workers, and small businesses. By  imposing burdensome land management policies, it undermines the very  communities that power our great Nation.

H.J. Res. 104 aligns directly with President Trump's vision to  unleash American energy by removing regulatory barriers and  prioritizing domestic production. This resolution ensures our lands are  used to bolster energy security and not obstruct it.

By passing H.J. Res. 104, we reject bureaucratic overreach and  champion affordable and reliable energy for all Americans. Let's stand  with President Trump's mission to make America energy dominant, protect  jobs, and empower our communities, and I urge my colleagues to vote in  favor of this resolution.
