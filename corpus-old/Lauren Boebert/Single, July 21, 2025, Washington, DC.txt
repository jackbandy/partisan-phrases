Single, Unique Zip Codes for Certain Communities


Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman so much for yielding.  Mr. Comer has been an amazing advocate in helping get this bill over  the line once again. I am proud to stand here today and explain why  this piece of legislation is so important.

I rise with a deep sense of purpose and conviction to advocate for  the passage of H.R. 3095, a commonsense, bipartisan bill that directs  the United States Postal Service to designate a single unique ZIP Code  for specific communities across our great Nation, including 15 in my  home State of Colorado.

This legislation is not just about postal efficiency. It is about  fairness, public safety, community identity, and ensuring that every  town and city in America has the tools it needs to thrive.

When the ZIP Code system was first introduced in 1963, it was a  revolutionary step toward modernizing mail delivery and streamlining  operations for a rapidly growing nation.

At the time, the United States Postal Service envisioned ZIP Codes as  a simple tool to improve sorting and delivery, but over the decades ZIP  Codes have evolved into far more than postal convenience. They have  become integral to how we navigate modern life.

Economic developers rely on ZIP Codes to attract businesses and plan  growth. Insurance companies use them to calculate premiums. Emergency  responders depend on them to locate homes and businesses in moments of  crisis. Even in our online shopping, our navigation systems are built  around the assumption that every community has a clear, unique ZIP  Code.

Yet for too many towns and cities across America, this basic building  block of modern infrastructure remains out of reach.

Mr. Speaker, in my home State of Colorado, I have heard from my  constituents who face daily frustration because they share ZIP Codes  with neighboring towns.

These are not abstract problems. They affect real people in tangible  ways.

Severance, Colorado, is a town of 11,500 people in Weld County, yet  they have six ZIP Codes that they correlate with.

Imagine a family who is waiting anxiously for an ambulance only to  learn that the first responders were dispatched to the wrong town  because of a shared ZIP Code. Picture a small business owner in Castle  Pines, Colorado, working tirelessly to grow their company and losing  critical deliveries and customers due to misdirected mail or wasting  time applying for a permit with the wrong municipality.

Consider the frustration of residents in towns like Silver Cliff,  Colorado, who are overcharged for insurance because their ZIP Code  inaccurately places them in a higher risk area.

Think of the local government already stretched thin that loses  millions of dollars in vital sales tax revenue because transactions are  mistakenly attributed to neighboring jurisdictions.

These challenges are not unique to Colorado. Across the Nation, over  65 communities, from rural communities to growing suburbs, are  struggling with these same issues. Governors, mayors, town boards, and  everyday citizens have raised their voices pleading for a solution.  They are not asking for handouts or special favors. They are asking for  the basic recognition of their community's existence, that they matter,  and that they deserve the same tools for success as their neighbors.

H.R. 3095 answers that call with a direct and practical solution.  This bill directs the United States Postal Service to assign unique ZIP  Codes to each community, empowering them to better serve their  residents, strengthen their local identities, and streamline their  operations.

A unique ZIP Code is more than a number. It is a lifeline. It  supports infrastructure planning by providing accurate data for  economic development. It reduces mail inconsistencies, ensuring that  packages and letters arrive where they are intended.

Seniors and veterans have suffered vital and lifesaving medication  delays just because they were lost in the mail, which is entirely  unacceptable and preventable. It enhances public safety by helping  emergency responders locate those in need without delay, and it ensures  that local governments receive the tax revenue they are rightfully owed  allowing them to invest in schools, roads, and community services.

The current process for obtaining a new ZIP Code is, frankly, broken.  Communities must navigate a labyrinth of bureaucratic hurdles,  submitting petitions to the USPS that are rarely approved. If their  petition is denied, then they are forced to wait up to 10 years before  they can even reapply, 10 years, Mr. Speaker.

That is 10 years of lost opportunities, 10 years of misdirected mail,  and 10 years of unnecessary risks to public safety.

This is not the kind of government our constituents expect or  deserve. They expect us to solve problems, not extend them.

H.R. 3095 cuts through this red tape with a clear directive to the  Postal Service to assign unique ZIP Codes to these deserving  communities.

This bill is not about creating a new bureaucracy or imposing heavy- handed mandates. It is about empowering local governments and residents  to take control of their future. It is about ensuring that every  community, no matter how small, has a seat at the table and a voice in  our Nation's progress.

I am proud to say that this bill has bipartisan support. This bill  was passed out of the House in the previous Congress, and it will pass  again. Republicans and Democrats alike recognize the importance of this  issue. Mayors, town councils, and community leaders from across the  political spectrum have rallied behind H.R. 3095, united by a shared  commitment to fairness and efficiency. Government efficiency is not  something that we hear a lot of.

This is not a partisan issue, it is an American issue, and it is one  that goes beyond political divides and speaks to our shared values of  community, opportunity, and, again, progress.

As we consider this bill, let us reflect on what it means to  represent our constituents. They sent us here to listen  to their concerns, to hear from them, to fight for their needs, and to  deliver results.

The communities affected by H.R. 3095 have asked for our help, and it  is our duty to respond. By passing this bill today, we can send a  powerful message that no town is too small to be heard, that no  community is too small to be overlooked or to matter, and that we are  committed to building a stronger and more equitable nation for all.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3095.  Let us give these communities and the millions of Americans the  representation, the recognition, the resources, and the respect that  they rightfully deserve. Let us ensure that every town has the tools it  needs to thrive, from accurate mail delivery to reliable emergency  services to robust economic growth.

This is a moment to act with purpose.

Let's be the bridge that heals this divide and make a meaningful  difference in the lives of our constituents.

Mr. Speaker, by receiving a unique ZIP Code, these communities will  hold on to more of their tax revenue, improve the response times of  first responders, and minimize issues with the postal delivery to  incorrect addresses.

I have been honored to lead on this issue. It has been a passion of  mine for the past 5 years, and I hope that we can finally get this  signed into law. Maybe we were waiting all along for President Donald  J. Trump's signature on this bill.

I thank Chairman Comer for his support of this, and I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3095.
