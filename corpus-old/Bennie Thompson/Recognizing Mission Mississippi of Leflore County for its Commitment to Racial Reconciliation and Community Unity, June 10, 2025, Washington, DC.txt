Recognizing Mission Mississippi of Leflore County for its Commitment to Racial Reconciliation and Community Unity


Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and commend Mission Mississippi of Leflore County, a remarkable  organization based in Greenwood, Mississippi, for its unwavering  commitment to racial reconciliation, spiritual healing, and community  building.

Founded as part of the broader Mission Mississippi movement, which  began in Jackson in 1992, the Leflore County chapter has become a  beacon of hope and unity in the Mississippi Delta. At a time when  division often dominates our national discourse, this grassroots  organization brings people together across racial and denominational  lines through intentional fellowship, shared meals, and mutual respect.

Mission Mississippi of Leflore County is led by Mr. Terry Williams, a  local painting contractor and pastor, and Mr. Luke Quinn, a minister  and clinical therapist. Together, they facilitate regular gatherings-- often breakfasts or luncheons--that rotate between churches with  historically Black or White congregations. These events are not mere  meetings; they are powerful acts of reconciliation, fostering honest  dialogue, trust, and deeper understanding among individuals of diverse  backgrounds.

Through these efforts, Mission Mississippi of Leflore County engages  in what Mr. Williams aptly describes as ``heart work''--emphasizing  their belief that the path to racial harmony begins with the courage to  know one another, to listen, and to love unconditionally. Their work  underscores that true unity is not achieved solely through laws or  policies, but through relationships and shared purpose.

In January of this year, the chapter hosted a luncheon at St. Francis  of Assisi Catholic Church, followed by a community meal in April that  featured remarks from Dr. Montrell Greene, pastor of Sycamore Street  Church of Christ. These are but a few examples of their ongoing efforts  to bring diverse voices to the table and create a space where  differences are acknowledged and celebrated.

Mr. Quinn, reflecting on his journey from Texas to Georgia to  Wisconsin before settling in the Delta, spoke candidly of Mississippi's  often misunderstood legacy. He rightly observed that Mississippi is too  frequently portrayed as a scapegoat for America's racial challenges,  when in truth, it is home to many individuals working tirelessly to  heal those very wounds--Mission Mississippi of Leflore County among the  foremost.

Grounded in faith and expansive in impact, their mission exemplifies  what it means to live out the gospel in a divided world--breaking  bread, building bridges, and showing that we have more in common than  in conflict.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mission  Mississippi of Leflore County for their vital work in uplifting their  community, challenging stereotypes, and leading with grace and love.  Their efforts remind us that reconciliation is possible--one  conversation, one relationship, and one act of compassion at a time.
