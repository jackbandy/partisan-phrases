Recognizing April As the Month of the Military Child


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  April as the Month of the Military Child. While we rightly honor the  service and sacrifice of the men and women in our military, April  reminds us that service comes in many forms.

We are celebrating the more than 1.6 million children whose parents  serve in the Active Duty, Guard, and Reserve Components of the United  States military.

Our troops answer the call to defend our Nation. Yet, when they do,  their children are quietly called to service, too.

These young people grow up in a world defined by constant change,  showing remarkable resilience, patriotism, and adaptability. They move  from base to base, often starting over time and time again. They say  good-bye to friends more times than they can remember.

They celebrate birthdays and holidays with one parent thousands of  miles away. They carry worry, pride, hope, and responsibility,  sometimes all at once.

This month, we pause to recognize that while our servicemembers  protect our freedoms, their children carry the emotional weight of that  commitment. They sacrifice stability, time with their parents, and the  comfort of staying in one place, and they do it all with a resilience  that is nothing short of remarkable.

This month is a special time to recognize and uplift a group of young  people whose strength and sacrifice often go unnoticed.

This is personal for me, not only as an American who deeply respects  our Armed Forces but also as a parent of a servicemember.

I have watched firsthand what it means to serve, not just for the  person in uniform but for the entire family. I have seen how military  children shoulder more than many adults will ever have to.

As a parent, I know how hard it is to be away from your child, but I  also know the pride that comes with seeing them live with purpose,  discipline, and honor.

Our military families, especially the children, live those values  every single day. That is why we celebrate them throughout April.  During this month, one of the most meaningful days we observe is Purple  Up! Day. On Purple Up! Day, people are encouraged to wear purple as a  visible show of support for military-connected youth.

Why purple? Because purple is the combined color of all the military  branches. It blends each branch's colors: the Air Force, Navy, Space  Force, and Coast Guard's blues, the Army's green, and the Marines' red.  Together, they create purple, symbolizing the unity and strength of our  military families.

Military children may not enlist, but they endure the impact of  service. Through it all, they develop strength, compassion, and  character that make them leaders in their own right.

Mr. Speaker, let's honor not just the men and women who serve but the  families behind them, especially the children who carry this unique  burden with incredible grace. They, too, are part of what keeps this  Nation strong.

I thank every military child--past, present, and future--for their  strength, sacrifice, and spirit.
