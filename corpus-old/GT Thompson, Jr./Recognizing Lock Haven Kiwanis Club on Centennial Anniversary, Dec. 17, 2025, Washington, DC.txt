Recognizing Lock Haven Kiwanis Club on Centennial Anniversary


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Kiwanis Club of Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, on its 100th  anniversary.

Since the club's founding on January 26, 1926, the members of the  Kiwanis Club have been a crucial part of the community in Lock Haven.

The club has 43 members, and it works to help children by improving  literacy rates, health, and educational outcomes.

Lock Haven Kiwanis sponsors two Key Clubs, one at Central Mountain  High School and the other at Jersey Shore High School. It awards annual  scholarships to Key Club members at both schools.

The club recently started a Bringing Up Grades, or BUG, program at  the Robb Elementary School in Lock Haven. It also partners with Sleep  in Heavenly Peace to build and deliver beds to children and youth who  do not have beds.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the Lock Haven Kiwanis Club for 100 years of  dedicated service to the Lock Haven community and wish them the best as  they work toward many more.
