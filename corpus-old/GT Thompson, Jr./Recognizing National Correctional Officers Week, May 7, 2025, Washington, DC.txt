Recognizing National Correctional Officers Week


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of National Correctional Officers Week.

In 1984, President Ronald Reagan designated the first full week of  May to honor correctional officers, calling them ``a vital component of  the field of corrections.''

Correctional officers carry out one of the most difficult and  dangerous jobs in public service: maintaining the custody, safety, and  well-being of inmates in our prisons and jails.

Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District is home to three such  Bureau of Prisons facilities: FCI McKean, FCI Allenwood, and USP  Lewisburg.

Throughout my time in Congress, I have worked closely with the  correctional officers at these facilities to find solutions in  addressing the BOP's biggest obstacles, including addressing chronic  staffing shortages plaguing these and other facilities nationwide.

Mr. Speaker, correctional officers serve with professionalism and  courage. As we recognize these important law enforcement officers this  week, I remain committed to resolving these challenges to protect those  who protect our communities. They deserve our full support, and I thank  all correctional officers for their service.
