Congratulating the Waterville Hotel


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize The  Waterville Hotel, a cherished institution in Waterville, Pennsylvania,  as it marks two centuries of service to the Pine Creek Valley  community.

In 1825, Abraham Harris founded what was then known as the Harris  Hotel, strategically positioned on Route 44 overlooking Little Pine  Creek.

It quickly became more than a simple roadside stop. It provided rest,  refuge, and warmth for lumberjacks, hunters, fishermen, travelers, and  politicians traversing our rugged Pennsylvania Wilds.

As the logging and lumber industry flourished in the 19th century, so  did the hotel's significance. It hosted community meetings, business  affairs, social gatherings, and even served as a way station for  elected officials, becoming an integral part of the region's political  and civic fabric.

Through wars, Prohibition, economic strangulation, and the decline of  rail, The Waterville Hotel pressed on. Under the stewardship of  generations, most notably under Jess and William Smith from 1933 to  1945, it reinvented itself, evolving along with its patrons and the  purpose it served, the Pennsylvania Wilds.

Fast-forward to 2023, when local residents Jason McConnell and  Vanessa Brown, whose families had roots and ownership of the adjacent  country store, joined forces with longtime friend Brad Wyland to  revitalize both the hotel and the restaurant.

Their vision has been rooted in pride and preservation, honoring  family ties and restoring beloved menu items including a throwback menu  featuring The Original Mountain Burger, a culinary emblem of community  heritage.

Today, The Waterville Hotel stands as a vibrant hub, serving hearty  fare from burgers and fries to vegetarian dishes, complemented by local  craft beers and wines. The interior is filled with photographs spanning  generations, each snapshot a testament to traditions, memories, and the  moments shared.

For many, this hotel is far more than a place to eat or sleep. It is  a community gathering place. It is their own Cheers, as longtime staff  member Dan Collar described. It is a place where locals and visitors  alike return year after year, bound by a shared experience of  belonging.

The Waterville Hotel serves as a gateway to the spectacular Pine  Creek Valley, the Pennsylvania Grand Canyon, and the Pine Creek Rail  Trail.

From summer activities like biking, hiking, kayaking, and fishing to  winter pursuits such as snowmobiling and snowshoeing, guests make the  hotel their base for outdoor adventures throughout the seasons.

As we celebrate 200 years from its humble origins in 1825 to its  enduring cornerstone status today, we honor not just a building but a  living legacy woven into the heart of Waterville.

It has cultivated community, supported local economies, and preserved  a connection across generations.

Looking ahead, under the stewardship of McConnell, Brown, and Wyland,  and buoyed by devoted staff and loyal patrons, the Waterville Hotel  embarks on its third century with the same spirit of resilience,  innovation, and community pride that has carried it this far.

Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in celebrating the  Waterville Hotel's bicentennial, a symbol of heritage, community, and  hope.

May its doors open to new chapters for generations to come.
