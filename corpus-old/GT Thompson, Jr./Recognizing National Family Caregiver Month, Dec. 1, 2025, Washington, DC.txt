Recognizing National Family Caregiver Month


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last month was National  Family Caregiver Month. Every day, more than 48 million family  caregivers provide essential care to loved ones who are aging, ill, or  disabled.

As a former healthcare professional, I have seen these caregivers  often go above and beyond for their families, sacrificing their own  time, energy, and well-being to ensure that those they care for receive  the support and love that they need.

Family caregivers are often the unsung heroes in our communities.  Many balance caregiving with full-time jobs, raising children, and  managing their own health.

They deserve our support and recognition, which is why I am proud to  support legislation like the Lowering Costs for Caregivers Act to help  ensure these caregivers have the financial resources to continue  providing care for their loved ones.

Mr. Speaker, let this month be a reminder of our shared  responsibility to support these caregivers who give so much to others.  By showing our appreciation and lending a hand where we can, we honor  the work that they do every day.
