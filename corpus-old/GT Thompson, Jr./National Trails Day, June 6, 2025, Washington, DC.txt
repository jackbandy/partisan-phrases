National Trails Day


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the upcoming National Trails Day, a celebration of America's vast and  scenic trail system.

June 7 is National Trails Day, a call to get outside and enjoy the  natural beauty that surrounds us.

I am especially proud to highlight a true gem in my district, the  Trails at Jakes Rocks, located in the heart of the Pennsylvania Wilds.

This stunning trail system was named Pennsylvania's 2024 Trail of the  Year and for good reason. It offers world-class mountain biking and  breathtaking views across the Allegheny National Forest, welcoming  everyone from beginners to seasoned outdoor enthusiasts.

In today's digital world, our trails remind us of the value of  unplugging and reconnecting with nature, with one another, and with  ourselves.

Trails like Jakes Rocks are more than just pathways. They are  investments in public health, economic development, and quality of  life.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the volunteers, local leaders, and outdoor  enthusiasts who have made this trail possible.
