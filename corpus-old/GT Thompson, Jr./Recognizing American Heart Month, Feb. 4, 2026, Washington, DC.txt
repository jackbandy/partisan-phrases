Recognizing American Heart Month


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  American Heart Month, observed every February, to raise awareness about  cardiovascular health.

The first CPR training occurred in the early 1960s. In 1964,  President Lyndon B. Johnson proclaimed February American Heart Month to  make heart disease and cardiac arrest prevention a national priority.

Since its formation, the American Heart Association has been helping  people recognize the signs of cardiac arrest and how to effectively  respond to these critical signals.

More than 350,000 cardiac arrests happen each year away from medical  facilities. The American Heart Association's goal is to ensure those  lives are saved. Heart disease causes one in four deaths in the United  States.

The American Heart Association provides resources on the many ways we  can minimize our risk of a heart attack or cardiovascular disease.

Mr. Speaker, as a former healthcare professional, it is important for  Americans to know that they are the first responders in the case of an  emergency. Americans who learn CPR can be ready to help save a life.

Happy American Heart Month.
