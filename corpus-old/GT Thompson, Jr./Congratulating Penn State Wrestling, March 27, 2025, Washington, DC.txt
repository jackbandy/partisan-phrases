Congratulating Penn State Wrestling


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Penn State wrestling, the 2025 NCAA Division 1 national  champions.

Continuing their dominance of NCAA wrestling, the Nittany Lions  brought  their 13th national title to Happy Valley.

Under the leadership of Coach Cael Sanderson, his team has won 12 of  the last 15 NCAA championships.

Penn State's two individual champions are a testament to the strength  of their program as well as their personal strength, talent, and  determination.

Carter Starocci made history by becoming the first wrestler to win  five individual NCAA titles, while Mitchell Mesenbrink claimed his  first national title with an outstanding performance.

Beyond individual triumphs, the Nittany Lions made history as only  the second team ever to have 10 All-Americans in one tournament.

This success would not be possible without the dedication of the  coaching staff, the families, and the unwavering support of the Penn  State community.

As a graduate of Penn State, I am proud to congratulate Penn State  wrestling on winning the 2025 national championship and on their  continuing success.

We Are.
