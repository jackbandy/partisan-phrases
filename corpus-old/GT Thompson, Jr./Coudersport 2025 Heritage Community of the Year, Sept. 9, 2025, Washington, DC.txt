Coudersport 2025 Heritage Community of the Year


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Coudersport, Pennsylvania, as the 2025 Heritage Community of the Year  through the PA Route 6 Alliance.

This award is presented each year to one designated heritage  community  that has embraced their heritage tourism work plan and has implemented  worthwhile projects that show impact and results in their community.

Coudersport will be officially recognized during a ceremony on  Wednesday evening at the Wilds Sonshine Factory in Kane. The PA Route 6  Alliance will also present awards in the categories of Heritage  Partnership, Heritage Tourism, Heritage Leadership, Lifetime  Achievement, and the Artisan of the Year Award.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Coudersport on this recognition. Located  in the heart of Potter County, Coudersport is often referred to as  ``God's country.'' The scenic countryside and nearby Allegheny River  create an outdoor paradise with recreation opportunities like fishing,  hunting, camping, kayaking, hiking, skiing, snowmobiling, and more.

Coudersport's historical downtown and charming shops make it a small- town community that has it all. Thank you to the PA Route 6 Alliance  for its efforts to preserve and promote our treasured communities like  Coudersport.
