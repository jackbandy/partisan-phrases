Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Denise Sticha for 30 years of dedicated service to communities across  Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District and beyond.

Denise recently retired as the executive director of Centre County  Library and Historical Museum, a position she has held for more than 7  years.

In this position, Denise oversaw library services for 29  municipalities. This included the main library in Bellefonte, branch  libraries in Centre Hall and Phillipsburg, a world-class research  library, and a local historical museum in Bellefonte.

In 1981, Denise began her career at the Murrysville Library.  Following her position at the Murrysville Library, Denise worked at  various institutions, including Seton Hill University in Greensburg,  Pennsylvania, Westmoreland County Federated Library System, Carnegie  Library of Pittsburgh, and Berks County Public Libraries.

Mr. Speaker, Denise has provided exceptional literary services to  communities across the State, being an outstanding leader and mentor to  many.

I wish Denise the best and thank her for her many years of service.
