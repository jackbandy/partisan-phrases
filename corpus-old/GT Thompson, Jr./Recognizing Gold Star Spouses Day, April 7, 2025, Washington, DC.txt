Recognizing Gold Star Spouses Day


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Gold Star Spouses Day.

On April 5, we honored the spouses of military servicemembers who  died while defending our freedom and serving our country.

This day serves not only as a moment of remembrance but also a  tribute to the strength, resilience, and sacrifice of these courageous  individuals.

As an Army dad, I consider myself profoundly blessed that my son  returned home. I recognize that not all families share that same  blessing. That truth weighs heavily on my heart and should remind us  all of the price that has been paid.

Gold Star Spouses Day brings much-needed awareness to the grief and  enduring strength of these spouses. Their sacrifice did not end with  their loved one's passing. It continues every day as they carry forward  the legacy of their fallen heroes.

Mr. Speaker, let us all take a moment to remember that our freedom is  not free.

Gold Star families have lost a loved one in the name of protecting  our freedom, and they deserve our gratitude today and every day.
