Recognizing Rock L. Butler Middle School


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  an outstanding group of students from Wellsboro, Pennsylvania.

The team from Rock L. Butler Middle School recently placed fifth in  the Nation in this year's Capitol Hill Challenge, a remarkable  achievement.

The 16-week financial education competition brings together thousands  of student teams from across the country, each tasked with investing a  hypothetical $100,000 in the stock market. The goal: to learn the  fundamentals of financial literacy, teamwork, and long-term investing.

Competing against students from every congressional district, the  Rock L. Butler team stood out not only for their strong returns but for  their discipline, collaboration, and commitment to learning. Their  performance reflects the dedication of their teachers and the support  of the Wellsboro community.

I had the pleasure of meeting these students during their visit to  Washington, and I can confidently say the future is in good hands.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Rock L. Butler Middle School team on  this incredible accomplishment.
