National Blood Donor Month


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  January as National Blood Donor Month.

Since its inception in 1970, National Blood Donor Month recognizes  the millions of Americans who help save lives by donating blood.  Statistics show that every two seconds, someone in this country needs  blood.

On average, one in seven hospital patients need blood, and  approximately 29,000 units of red blood cells are needed every day in  the United States.

Over the last 50 years, public awareness for blood donation has  increased. Now approximately 13.6 million volunteers donate blood  annually.

In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, more than 5,000 blood drives  were held in 2025, according to the Red Cross. I am encouraged to see  constituents ready to roll up their sleeves and help those in need. In  fact, one of the most challenging times of the year to collect blood  donations is in the winter months.

Mr. Speaker, I hope all Americans will take the time to consider  donating blood this month. It is important to know that one blood  donation can save lives.
