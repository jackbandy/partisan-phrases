Recognizing Constitution Day


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Constitution Day.

Today, in 1787, our brave Founding Fathers gathered in Pennsylvania  to  sign the United States Constitution, one of the most significant  documents in history.

For 238 years, this document has laid the groundwork for our Nation's  principles and has served as a beacon of freedom worldwide.

Our Constitution guarantees our freedoms, from the right to free  speech to the right to practice our faith. The Constitution is a  promise that we the people are at the forefront of our government.

Today, the Constitution remains as relevant as ever. As we face new  challenges, we must remember that our Constitution has provided us the  framework to debate, disagree, and, most importantly, unite.

I am proud to join my colleagues in supporting a resolution  recognizing today, September 17, as Constitution Day, highlighting our  Nation's beginnings as we approach our 250th anniversary.

Mr. Speaker, let us celebrate the principles that make our Nation  great on this Constitution Day.
