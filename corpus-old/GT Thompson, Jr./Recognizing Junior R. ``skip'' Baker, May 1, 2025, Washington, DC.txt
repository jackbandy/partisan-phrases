Recognizing Junior R. ``skip'' Baker


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Junior  R. ``Skip'' Baker for an incredible 70 years of service to the Genesee  Township Volunteer Fire Department.

In 1955, Skip joined the Genesee Township Volunteer Fire Department  and has been a steady presence through decades of change. He served as  fire police, EMT, and fire warden for 25 years. He even completed EMT  training alongside his late wife, Dorothy, and son Bill.

His sons, Bill and Steve, have both held leadership roles, and now  his grandson, Christopher, continues the Baker legacy. Skip has driven  nearly every apparatus the department has owned and still runs the  pumper and tanker with skill.

Skip played a major role in planning the current fire station, saving  the department tens of thousands of dollars through smart cost cutting.

Skip has been on the front lines of major incidents, from the Kane  tornado to floods, barn fires, and even a military plane crash.

At age 94, he remains calm, capable, and committed.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Skip for his lifetime of service and the  integral role he has played in ensuring his community's safety.
