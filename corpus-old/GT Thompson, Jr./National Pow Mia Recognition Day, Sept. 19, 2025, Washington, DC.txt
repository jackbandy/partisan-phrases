National Pow/Mia Recognition Day


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today is National POW/MIA  Recognition Day, a day to remember the brave men and women who served  their country and have not returned home.

Currently, there are more than 80,000 American servicemembers who are  still missing and remain unaccounted for from World War II, the Korean  War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War, and the Gulf wars.

Our servicemembers answered the call to protect and defend our  country in times of war and in times of peace. We have a sacred compact  with the men and women who serve, and we will never stop searching for  the ones who remain missing and unaccounted for until they are returned  to their loved ones.

That is why today I reintroduced a resolution that urges our trading  partners to aid in the search and recovery efforts of our Nation's  missing servicemembers.

Mr. Speaker, we will never stop searching until all our  servicemembers are brought home. They and their loved ones deserve no  less.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
