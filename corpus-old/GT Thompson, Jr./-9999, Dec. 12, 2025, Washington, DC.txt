Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Saturday is the National  Guard's 389th birthday. Nearly four centuries ago, the National Guard  was founded in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Since then, the National  Guard has exemplified the spirit of citizen soldiers. These are  ordinary men and women who answer the call to serve their community and  country at a moment's notice.

From the footprints that mark the snows of Valley Forge to the sandy  beaches at Normandy, from the skies above Vietnam to the deserts of the  Persian Gulf, the National Guard has been there for America every step  of the way. For 389 years, these men and women have represented  America's best.

Mr. Speaker, today we honor the men and women who have worn the  uniform of the National Guard, past and present. We salute their  sacrifice, their courage, and unwavering dedication to serving the  American people through war and peace, disaster and recovery, and every  moment in between.

Happy birthday to the National Guard.
