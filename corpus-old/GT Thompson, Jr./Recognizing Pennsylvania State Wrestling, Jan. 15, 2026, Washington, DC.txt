Recognizing Pennsylvania State Wrestling


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Penn State University wrestling team which set a new NCAA record on  Saturday.

The Nittany Lions won 78 consecutive dual matches. This record  surpasses the NCAA Division II record previously held by St. Cloud  State.

The Nittany Lions' current winning streak began in February 2020 when  they defeated the University of Maryland. Since 2020, the team has won  five consecutive Big Ten regular season titles, three Big Ten  championships, and four NCAA championships.

This past weekend marked the team's first Big Ten conference match of  the 2025-2026 season. The Nittany Lions won 46-0, performing in front  of a sellout crowd of more than 6,000 fans.

The team broke the NCAA Division I record in December, which had been  held by Oklahoma State University since 1951. The Nittany Lions are led  by Coach Cael Sanderson, who has been with the team since 2009.

Mr. Speaker, congratulations to the Penn State wrestling team on this  historic achievement.
