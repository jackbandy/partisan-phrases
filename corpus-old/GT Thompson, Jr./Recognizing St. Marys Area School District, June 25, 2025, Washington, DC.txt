Recognizing St. Marys Area School District


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the St. Marys Area School District for launching a new agriculture  education curriculum, an investment in both their students and the  future of our Nation's food system.

Agricultural education is not just for those in rural areas. It is  foundational to the future of our economy, environment, and our  national security. Programs like this one help students understand  where their food comes from, how it is produced, and the science and  technology driving modern agriculture.

Beginning next school year, St. Marys will offer ag curriculum  starting in seventh grade and extending through high school. Already  nearly 100 students have signed up, proof that our young people are  eager to learn more about the science, innovation, and business behind  agriculture.

As chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I applaud this  effort. It is exactly the kind of hands-on, forward-thinking program we  need to develop the next generation of farmers, scientists, and  entrepreneurs.

Agriculture puts food on our tables, clothes on our backs, and fuel  in our vehicles. Programs like this ensure it continues to do so for  generations to come.

Mr. Speaker, I commend the leadership, educators, and students of St.  Marys for their vision, and I look forward to seeing the impact of this  outstanding program.
