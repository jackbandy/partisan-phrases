Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Stan LaFuria as he retires from Moshannon Valley Economic  Development Partnership.

For 43 years, Stan has dedicated his career to championing community  and economic development throughout Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District.

After receiving a master's degree in public administration from Penn  State in the summer of 1982, Stan began his career in Titusville,  Pennsylvania, where he worked as the assistant director of the  administration of the Titusville Redevelopment Authority.

For 5 years, he was responsible for creating and managing  multimillion-dollar neighborhood revitalization and housing  rehabilitation programs, as well as recreation improvement projects.

In 1988, Stan took a position as the assistant director of the  Economic Development Corporation of Erie County, where he assisted in  the management of three industrial parks, a new incubator facility, and  a revolving loan fund program.

In 1990, Stan was named the executive director of the Moshannon  Valley Economic Development Partnership, a role he has held ever since.

For 35 years, Stan has been a driving force behind major economic  initiatives to enhance the communities and economy of the Moshannon  Valley and Philipsburg region.

Under Stan's leadership, the Moshannon Valley Economic Development  Partnership has developed two business parks, two multitenant  buildings, a revolving loan fund program, $2.9 million in housing  rehabilitation programs, and the Philipsburg Main Street Program.

In 1997, the organization was named Agency of the Year by the  Pennsylvania Economic Development Association, in recognition of its  outstanding accomplishments for the region.

Madam Speaker, Stan's commitment and leadership have shaped Moshannon  Valley for the better, and his legacy will be felt for generations.

Madam Speaker, I wish Stan the best as he enters retirement and  starts this new chapter of life.
