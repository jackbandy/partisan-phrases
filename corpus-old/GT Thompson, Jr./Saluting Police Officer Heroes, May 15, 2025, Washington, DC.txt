Saluting Police Officer Heroes


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, tens of  thousands of law enforcement officers from across the country traveled  to Washington, D.C., for National Police Week.

Established in 1962 through a joint resolution of Congress, National  Police Week is a time for our Nation to honor the courageous men and  women who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.

These officers gave their lives to protect our families, our  neighborhoods, and our way of life. Their legacy lives on in the  communities they served and in the continued service of those who wear  the badge today.

At a time when violent crime is rising and law enforcement officers  face growing hostility, we must stand firmly behind those who risk  their lives to uphold the law.

This is why I am proud to cosponsor legislation that honors fallen  officers and strengthens protections for those who continue to serve. I  thank every officer who puts on the uniform each day with courage and  conviction. On behalf of a grateful nation, we salute them.
