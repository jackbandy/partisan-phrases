Congratulating Ellie Sheehan


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Ellie Sheehan, drum major of the Penn State Blue Band this  season.

This is a historic milestone because Ellie is the first woman to hold  the position in the Blue Band's 126-year history.

Ellie hails from Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, and is pursuing a  degree in marketing with a minor in digital media trends and analytics.  She brings years of experience within the Blue Band, most recently as a  leader of the piccolos. The Blue Band's drum major leads the band  through warm-ups and performances.

Since 1977, it has been a tradition for the drum major to do a front  flip as the band enters the field at home football games. Ellie  continues this tradition.

As any visitor to Beaver Stadium can attest, the Blue Band plays a  central role in Penn State's game day and represents the highest level  of tradition, excellence, and pride.

Mr. Speaker, as a graduate of Penn State, I am proud to congratulate  Ellie Sheehan for being a fantastic Blue Band drum major.
