Recognizing Aybrah Zelenski and Elena Gourley


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  two outstanding students from West Shamokin Junior-Senior High School,  Aybrah Zelenski and Elena Gourley, who earned top national honors at  the Future Business Leaders of America National Leadership Conference.

FBLA is a nationwide student organization that prepares young people  to become community-minded business  leaders through career development and leadership opportunities. Their  annual leadership conference brings together over 11,000 students from  more than 2,000 schools nationwide to compete in career and leadership  building events.

While in Anaheim, California, Aybrah placed sixth in public speaking  and Elena placed seventh in career exploration.

West Shamokin's FBLA chapter, founded in the fall of 2023, has  quickly made a name for itself and has proven that a small, rural  school can leave a big mark on the national stage.

Mr. Speaker, I applaud both Aybrah and Elena and the entire West  Shamokin FBLA team for their leadership, hard work, and bright futures.  They make their school, their community, the Commonwealth, and this  Congressman very proud.
