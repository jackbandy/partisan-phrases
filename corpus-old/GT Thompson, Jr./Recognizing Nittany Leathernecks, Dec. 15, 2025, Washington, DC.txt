Recognizing Nittany Leathernecks


Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the  Nittany Leathernecks' contribution to Christmas throughout the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

The Nittany Leathernecks Detachment of the Marine Corps League is a  community service organization composed of active, retired, and former  Marines. Since 1947, the mission of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys  for Tots program has been to collect new, unwrapped toys through  October, November, and December each year and distribute them as  Christmas gifts to less fortunate children in the community.

The Nittany Leathernecks Detachment coordinates Toys for Tots for  Centre County. The detachment works with the Centre County Adult  Services Office, which coordinates with the Centre County food pantries  to identify needy children and to distribute toys.

The Nittany Leathernecks campaign annually provides a Christmas gift  experience to more than 9,000 children.

Mr. Speaker, I thank these selfless Marines for their service to our  country and their dedication to uplifting our communities.
