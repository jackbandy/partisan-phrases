Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I missed votes due to a previously scheduled  family commitment. My grandson, Thomas, graduated from Xavier High  School. The ceremony is at St.  Patrick's Cathedral in New York. Had I been present, I would have voted  YEA on Roll Call No. 169, YEA on Roll Call No. 170, and NAY on Roll  Call No. 171.                             personal explanation
