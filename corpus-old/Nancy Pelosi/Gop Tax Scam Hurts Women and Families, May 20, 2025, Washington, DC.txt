Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join our Democratic leader  and Democratic Women's Caucus colleagues in highlighting stories of  women and children who would be harmed by the House Republican agenda.

Republicans are slashing $300 billion--that is b, billion dollars-- from SNAP, in addition to cutting $700 billion from Medicaid. That is  $1 trillion in cruel cuts from our Nation's children in order to give  tax cuts to billionaires.

SNAP is our Nation's most effective antihunger initiative. The  devastating Republican cuts threaten children and families in  California and across America who are scared and crying out for help.

One single mom, Melissa, from California who lives in a district  represented by one of our Republican colleagues shared that if not for  SNAP, her family of three children every month would be running out of  money for food. She would have zero dollars for food. She attends  school full time and says that without SNAP they would be forced to  rely on food giveaways or starve.

Republicans shamelessly call this reform, but let's be clear: It is a  sinful betrayal of the Gospel of Matthew: ``When I was hungry, you fed  me.''

Mr. Speaker, Democrats will never stop fighting to ensure no child is  left behind. Hands off our Medicaid, and hands off our SNAP.
