Recognizing Captain Floyd Blair


Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor  Captain Floyd Blair of Marion County, Florida, who celebrated his 105th  birthday on November 15, 2025.

Captain Blair's life is a complete representation of the American  spirit--characterized by courage, service, and an enduring commitment  to his country. He was born in a 1920, a defining moment in history  when the world faced the threat of tyranny and oppression. Answering  his Nation's call to service, Captain Blair served honorably in the  United States Army Air Forces during the Second World War, where he  demonstrated the incredible valor that were the hallmarks of America's  Greatest Generation.

Throughout his service, Captain Blair embodied the values of duty,  honor, and sacrifice. As a fighter pilot in combat operations across  Europe, he placed himself in harm's way to defend the cause of liberty  and ensure a future of peace for generations to come. His courage and  leadership remain an inspiration to all who cherish freedom and  understand the profound cost at which it is preserved.

Following his military service, Captain Blair continued to exemplify  these same values in civilian life. For decades, he has been a devoted  member of the Marion County community, respected for his humility,  integrity, and steadfast patriotism. Even in his later years, Captain  Blair has continued to inspire others through his quiet strength and  lifelong commitment to his fellow veterans.

This year, as family, friends, and community members join together to  celebrate this remarkable milestone, we pause to reflect on the  profound legacy of a man who has given so much to his Nation. Captain  Blair's story reminds us of the resilience and selflessness that define  America's veterans and the importance of honoring those who have  safeguarded our freedom.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Florida's 3rd Congressional District, I  extend my deepest gratitude and warmest congratulations to Captain  Floyd Blair on his 105th birthday. May his life continue to be blessed  with health, joy, and the enduring appreciation of a grateful Nation.
