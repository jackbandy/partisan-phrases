Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, I chuckled when Ken mentioned pet peeves and  names. We need to add quinoa and potatoes to that list. He definitely  didn't like those. For the record, my nickname was Barracuda, so figure  that one out.

God works in mysterious ways. In the face of disaster, I found a  friend in Doug. Doug and I didn't agree on a lot of things, but we  always showed up for each other. We cosponsored bills, worked on  disaster funding and rural health, and traded a lot of jabs and took  funny pictures of each other in our Agriculture Committee hearings. I  gave him Spam musubis, and he brought me my favorite lemon almonds from  Oroville.

I will never forget November 8, 2023. Doug stood here on this floor,  and he marked 5 years since the Camp fire. I was marking 3 months since  the Lahaina fire in Maui. He came up to me and gave me a hug after, and  he said: We are going to get through this together.

I believed him. I still do. He gave me hope.

Doug and I are two very different people. It would have been the most  unlikely of friendships, except that he was one of the kindest, most  gentle, and genuine people I have ever met.

I don't know about you, Mr. Speaker, but the House floor feels a  little less warm and a bit empty without Doug, but maybe I just miss my  friend.

To his wife, Jill, and the LaMalfa ``family''; ``family,'' our  prayers, our aloha, and our love are with you.

May you rest in aloha, my friend, until we meet again.
