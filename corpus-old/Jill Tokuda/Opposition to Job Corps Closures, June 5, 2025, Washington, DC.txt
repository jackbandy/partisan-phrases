Opposition to Job Corps Closures


Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  Trump administration's abrupt, unjustified attempt to close Job Corps  centers nationwide.

I have been to the Job Corps graduation on Maui. I have looked into  the eyes of students whose lives were changed. I have walked the  grounds of the Waimanalo campus where young people, many of whom had  nowhere else to turn, found a path to a good job and a better life.

These are not statistics. These are real people, and they deserve  better than to be abandoned by a system that was supposed to lift them  up.

A mother in Hilo wrote to me and shared that no amount of mental help  was able to save her son, only Job Corps.

She told me: Please save my son. Please help save Job Corps.

Today, I rise not just for policy, but for people. Every young person  in Hawaii and across this country just needs a chance. We must not turn  our backs on them now.
