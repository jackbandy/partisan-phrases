Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the House  Republican budget resolution, a blatant attempt to strip healthcare and  food aid away from everyday Americans.

With up to $2.5 trillion in Medicaid cuts and $230 billion slashed  from SNAP, this budget plan would leave millions of families and  seniors without essential support. Rural America would suffer the most.

Nationwide, more than 12 million rural Americans rely on Medicaid,  and SNAP participation is higher in rural areas than urban ones. In my  home State of Hawaii, over 350,000 people rely on Medicaid, and nearly  one in five depend on SNAP to eat. Rural Americans, who live in 181 of  our congressional districts, red and blue, already face some of the  harshest health disparities, living 3 to 10 years less than their urban  counterparts. These cuts will only deepen such inequities and leave  them with no safety net.

Let me be clear. These cuts will cost lives. These are not just  numbers. They are real people. They are our neighbors, our  grandparents, and our children. At a time when too many are struggling,  Republicans are delivering tax breaks to billionaires on the backs of  our working families.

Americans in rural America deserve better. Our country deserves  better. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
