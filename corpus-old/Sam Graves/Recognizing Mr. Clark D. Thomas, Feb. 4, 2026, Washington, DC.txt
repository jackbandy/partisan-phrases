Recognizing Mr. Clark D. Thomas


Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Mr. Clark D. Thomas, a  special employee of the USDA Rural Development--Missouri State Office,  who recently retired after many dedicated years of service.

Mr. Thomas was a remarkable civil servant for nearly six decades and  deserves recognition for such an exemplary career in federal service.  Clark began his federal service with the former Farmer's Home  Administration on June 5, 1967. His federal service spanned 58 years, 3  months, and 25 days until his retirement on September 30, 2025. During  his federal career, Clark served two years active duty in the Army as a  First Lieutenant and was deployed to Vietnam. Upon returning from  Vietnam, Clark continued his federal service at Farmer's Home  Administration and then USDA Rural Development. During his tenure as a  Program Director, a role he served in until his retirement in September  2025, Clark was responsible for more than 3,700 obligations totaling  more than $2.4 billion in assistance to rural Missouri communities and  businesses.

Over the course of Clark's 58 years of service to the state of  Missouri, many changes have occurred, but his consistent dedication  remained. From water programs to broadband deployment, Clark made sure  rural communities had the infrastructure needed to thrive. The  unwavering support Clark received from  his wife, Donna, and his daughters, Tammy and Traci, was also  instrumental in him achieving such a successful career.

Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in recognizing Clark Thomas  for his long tenure of service to the citizens of the State of  Missouri, and in thanking him for being an outstanding public servant.  I wish him all the best in his retirement.
