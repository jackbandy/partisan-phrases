Protect Children's Innocence Act


Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Protect  Children's Innocence Act.

When we are talking about ``shameful,'' shameful is castrating a kid.  Shameful is chopping off the breasts of an underage girl, and that is  what the Democrats are doing today. It is obscene. It is disgusting.  You are seeing in real time Democrats wanting and defending grooming of  children, and it is abhorrent.

There is a lie at the heart of the debate that we are having today  that I have to correct. No child is born in their wrong body. There are  only two sexes. They are male, and they are female. There are no  others.

Every child is created in the Lord's image, and we cannot remain  silent while demonic forces are here today on the floor, the left, here  to groom children and defend it.

Children are innocent. For too long, Democrats have tried to  mainstream satanic, irreversible procedures which destroy the bodies of  young children and often lead to kids being sterilized for life. It  leads to disease, leads to cancer, and leads to suicide.

Democrats say to protect trans kids. I came here today to the floor  of the House of Representatives to say: There is no such thing as a  trans kid. Transgenderism is a mind virus perpetuated by the far left  to groom kids.

This is not gender-affirming care. It is genital-destroying child  abuse.

This chemical and surgical mutilation of children has devastating  consequences on their physical and mental health, and many live to  regret it. Many live to detransition if they make it out at all.

This is sick. This is disgusting. We cannot allow the left to prey on  underage kids any longer.
