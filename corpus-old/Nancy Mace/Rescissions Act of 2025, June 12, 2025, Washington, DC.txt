Rescissions Act of 2025


Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, under President Donald Trump's leadership,  this rescissions package codifies $9.4 billion in DOGE cuts by  canceling some of the most egregious Biden-era waste, fraud, and abuse.

Here is just some of the funding that we are canceling today: $4  million for sedentary migrants in Colombia; $3 million for  circumcision, vasectomies, and condoms in Zambia; $5.1 million to  strengthen the resilience of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,  intersex, and queer global movements; $3 million for Iraqi ``Sesame  Street''; $2.5 million for teaching young children how to make  environmentally friendly reproductive health decisions; and $833,000  for services for transgender people, sex workers and their clients, and  sexual networks in Nepal.

The American people are begging Congress to get off its ass, codify  the DOGE cuts, and stop this taxpayer-funded nonsense. Failure is not  an option.
