Probation Act of 1925


Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today, Tuesday March 4, is the 100th  anniversary of the Probation Act of 1925. The act created our Nation's  Federal probation system and, for the first time, authorized Federal  judges to impose a sentence of probation as an alternative to  incarceration. Alternatives to incarceration like probation facilitate  the fair administration of justice, enhance public safety, and  positively impact the lives of individuals who become involved with the  Federal courts. Our Nation's probation officers and staff do deeply  difficult and too-often unheralded work that plays a critical role in  the functioning of our criminal justice system, and I am committed to  doing what I can in the U.S. Senate to support them in what they do. I  firmly believe that we owe them a debt of gratitude for their service,  and I am especially grateful for the incredible work of Delaware's  probation officers and staff working to make Delaware safer every day.
