Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. COONS. The CEO of the U.S. African Development Foundation is one  Peter Marocco, known to all of us, who watched how DOGE came in and  tore up most of our foreign assistance organizations.

Yes, an individual pled guilty today to a $12,000 bribe. No, that is  not the reason to shut down abruptly and end the process that has gone  on since 1980, by which this organization--which has long enjoyed  bipartisan support--makes grants at a very modest level to dozens of  African organizations and countries using matching funds from private  donors and other countries.

The SFOPS bill, of which this is a part, already addresses concerns  about the ongoing investigation. This organization, which I have  visited in the field over the last decade, has a long and strong record  of delivering results. This one event today being misrepresented by  this entity leader, who is a DOGE individual who has locked out all of  the employees of this foundation and prevented it from functioning,  should not lead to its closure.                               Motion to Table

I move that it be tabled, that this amendment, Lee No. 4286, be  tabled.
