Cutting Americorps Deprives Americans


Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, one of the latest targets of  President Trump's vicious cuts is AmeriCorps, a program that engages  200,000 Americans every year in community service.

In Pennsylvania, AmeriCorps supports 1,000 service sites, more than  10,000 teachers in the Philadelphia region, and various food pantries  in the Lehigh Valley. However, with no justification, Musk and DOGE  laid off 85 percent of AmeriCorps' staff and unconstitutionally froze  more than $400 million.

Millions of Americans are losing access to services they rely upon:  veterans receiving mental health treatment, children enrolled in public  schools, homebound seniors in need of assistance and companionship.

AmeriCorps was born under President Bush and codified under President  Clinton. Its mission: to improve lives and strengthen communities  through the service of dedicated volunteers.

It has long enjoyed bipartisan support, and for good reason, because  it is one of the best ways our government can do good things for real  people right here at home.

To cut AmeriCorps is to deprive Americans. The Trump administration  does not care. Their goal is to serve the rich while forsaking the  poor.
