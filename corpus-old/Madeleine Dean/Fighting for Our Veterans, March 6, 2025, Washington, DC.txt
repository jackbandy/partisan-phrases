Fighting for Our Veterans


Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, my Pennsylvania district is  home to more than 32,000 veterans, many of whom rely on physical and  mental health care from three VA medical centers: Lebanon in Berks  County, Coatesville in West Norriton, and Philadelphia for Montgomery  County.

Yet, because of President Trump, the VA, which cares for more than 9  million veterans nationwide, has been gravely weakened. Already in  Coatesville and Philadelphia, they were forced to rescind job offers to  physicians and to lay off administrative and clerical staff.

The Trump administration has jeopardized care, putting lives and  health at risk. Many of the brave men and women who serve in our Armed  Forces continue to serve our Nation in the civilian workforce,  including in the VA.

So far, 1,400 employees have been dismissed and an internal memo  shows 80,000 more to come--the firing of 80,000 VA workers.

DOGE and this incompetent, chaotic administration are breaking our  most sacred promise to our veterans. They fought for us; we must fight  for them.
