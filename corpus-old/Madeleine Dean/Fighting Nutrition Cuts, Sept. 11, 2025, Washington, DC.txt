Fighting Nutrition Cuts


Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, in my suburban Philadelphia  district, more than 75,000 people struggle with not enough food. They  struggle with hunger every single day.

That is why I voted against the cuts to SNAP, our Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program. These cuts are going into effect now, and  my constituents will do with less. These nutrition cuts hurt seniors,  children, families, and veterans. The Gospel of Matthew teaches us to  do better.

For I was naked and you clothed me; I was a stranger, and you  welcomed me; a prisoner and you visited me; hungry and you offered me  food.

May we use the privilege of our voices and our votes not to inflame  but to inspire.
