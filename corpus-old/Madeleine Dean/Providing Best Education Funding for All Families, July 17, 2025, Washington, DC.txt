Providing Best Education Funding for All Families


Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, our children are under attack.

Mr. Speaker, $6.8 billion in education funding, dollars appropriated  by Democrats and Republicans, is frozen. These are funds that should  have been available on July 1.

In Pennsylvania, that is $230 million. Resources, including summer  programs and teacher training, hang in limbo.

Abington School District, my alma mater, is missing more than  $250,000. Some schools may be able to function while the President's  latest whims play out in court, but as is the case with most of his  orders, Trump has stolen the most from those who have the least.

The Norristown Area School District, just 15 miles from my district  of Abington, is owed three times as much, more than $750,000 in Federal  funds.

This is not about government efficiency. It is about greed,  incompetence, and cruelty.

When Secretary McMahon testified before the Appropriations Committee,  I asked her: ``Why are you in this job?'' Her response: ``I want the  best for my family,'' not all families, her family.

When Republicans tell us who they are, Mr. Speaker, we should believe  them.
