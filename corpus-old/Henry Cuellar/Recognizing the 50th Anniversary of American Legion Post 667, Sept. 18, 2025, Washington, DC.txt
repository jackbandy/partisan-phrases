Recognizing the 50th Anniversary of American Legion Post 667


Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th  anniversary of American Legion Post 667 in Universal City, Texas.

Since its chartering in 1975, Post 667 has stood as a cornerstone of  service, supporting veterans, active-duty service members, and families  across northeast Bexar County.

For five decades, the Post has served as a hub for camaraderie,  patriotic education, civic engagement, and community service.

From mentoring youth through programs that instill duty and honor, to  assisting veterans as they transition to civilian life, Post 667 has  embodied the American Legion's mission of service not self.

Their members have organized countless community events, supported  patriotic observances, and provided a strong voice for those who have  worn the uniform of our Nation.

Mr. Speaker, this milestone is an opportunity to celebrate a proud  legacy and to honor those who have selflessly given back to our country  and community.

I commend American Legion Post 667 for fifty years of leadership,  service, and sacrifice, and I wish them continued success in the  decades ahead.
