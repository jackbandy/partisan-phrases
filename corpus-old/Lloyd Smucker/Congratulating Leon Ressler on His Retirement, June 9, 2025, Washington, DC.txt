Congratulating Leon Ressler on His Retirement


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor and congratulate Mr.  Leon Ressler on his retirement after 37 years with Penn State Extension  in Lancaster County.

Across nearly four decades, Leon Ressler has served Penn State  Extension, a Pennsylvania-wide educational organization and network  focusing on science, agriculture, and the environment, in many roles.  Leon's tenure with Penn State Extension began in 1988. Ultimately, he  became Lancaster County Extension Director in 2001. Though his titles  and duties changed over the years with the reorganization of Penn State  Extension, he managed finances, developed budgets, and coordinated with  local counties on development and grants. He took a step back from his  role in 2017 to become an Extension Educator, where he served on the  agronomy team and assisted farms with his expertise in nutrient  management, water quality, and sustainable agriculture--just a few of  his areas of his vast knowledge of agriculture.

Beyond his time with Penn State Extension, Leon Ressler is a frequent  contributor to Lancaster Farming, a churchgoer, a political volunteer,  and is himself a farmer in Peach Bottom, Pennsylvania. He holds  bachelor's degrees in agronomy and plant science, and has a master's  degree in environmental pollution control, all of which are from Penn  State.

As he transitions his focus from Penn State Extension back to his  farm, I thank Leon Ressler for his service to the agricultural  community. His expertise and commitment have positively impacted not  just the farmers in Lancaster County, but the health of the people and  environment across Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District. I wish  him continued success in all that he does.
