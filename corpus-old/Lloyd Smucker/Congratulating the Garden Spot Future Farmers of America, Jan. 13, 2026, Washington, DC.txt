Congratulating the Garden Spot Future Farmers of America


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize  the Garden Spot Future Farmers of America chapter (Garden Spot FFA),  affiliated with Lampeter-Strasburg High School in Lancaster County,  Pennsylvania, on their success at the 98th National FFA Convention &  Expo.

The Garden Spot FFA represented themselves well during the 98th  National FFA Convention & Expo, which was held from October 24, 2025,  to November 1, 2025, in Indianapolis, Indiana. At the Farm and  Agribusiness Management event, which tested students on their economic  and agricultural knowledge, the Garden Spot FFA Team placed second.  Each student on the team--Antonio Franco, Will Gajecki, Rex Giberson,  and Jack Ross--earned silver for their individual performance.

Five Garden Spot FFA alumni also received American FFA Degrees in  2025, the highest honor bestowed to FFA members, and were recognized at  the convention. These individuals were Gracie Albright, Sydney  Albright, Kayla Frey, Jaclyn Martin, and Katelyn Ranck.

With their success at the 98th National FFA Convention, the students  at Garden Spot FFA demonstrated their remarkable work ethic and  devotion to agriculture--making all of Pennsylvania's 11th  Congressional District proud. I congratulate the Garden Spot FFA on  their accomplishments, and I wish them continued success.
