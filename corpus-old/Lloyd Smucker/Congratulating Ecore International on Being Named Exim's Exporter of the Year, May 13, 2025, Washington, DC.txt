Congratulating Ecore International on Being Named Exim's Exporter of the Year


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize  Ecore International for being named Exporter of the Year by the Export- Import Bank of the United States (EXIM).

Beginning as a small cork manufacturer in 1871, Lancaster-based Ecore  International is a global leader in circular rubber flooring. Ecore has  covered projects from local gyms, turf fields, and playgrounds to NFL  locker rooms and Churchill Downs. What makes Ecore truly special is  their dedication to sustainability and innovation. Ecore uses recycled  rubber and ensures it can be reused continuously, transforming 430  million pounds of rubber waste annually into 1,500 different products.

Ecore International operates in 76 different countries and has 13  facilities across the United States, including 2 in Pennsylvania's 11th  Congressional District. Their recognition as EXIM's Exporter of the  Year compliments their noteworthy pedigree of awards and  accomplishments.

It is with great pride that I can consider Ecore International among  my constituents. I thank the company for helping to solidify  Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District as a center for  manufacturing and innovation, and once again I congratulate them for  being EXIM's Exporter of the Year.
