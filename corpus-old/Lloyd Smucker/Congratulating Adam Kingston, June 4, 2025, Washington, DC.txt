Congratulating Adam Kingston, Gold Medal Runner


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate Adam Kingston  of Manheim Township on winning a gold medal in the Class 3A 3,200-meter  run at the PIAA track and field championship on May 24.

The 2025 PIAA Class 3A track and field championship saw students from  across Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District excel, but it was  Manheim Township senior Adam Kingston who took home the gold. Kingston  maintained the lead for the entire 3,200-meter race and crossed the  finish line with a time of 8:51:25, a Lancaster-Lebanon League record.

Kingston's state title finishes a storied career at Manheim Township.  He was also a part of Manheim Township's 4x800 relay team, alongside  Andrew Kemper, Ethan Peffley, and Cole Stevens, which won fourth place  later that day.

With his gold medal in the Class 3A 3,200-meter run, Kingston  solidified himself as one of Pennsylvania's best track and field  athletes. I sincerely congratulate Adam on his success this year and  wish him well in his athletic and academic endeavors at Penn State  University.
