Congratulating Goodhart Sons Inc. on Their 90th Anniversary


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize  Goodhart Sons Inc. on their 90th anniversary. Goodhart Sons Inc. is a  steel fabricator and installer based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Their  history began in 1935 when Frank G. Goodhart purchased the two-man  sheet metal shop that he was once an apprentice at. In the 90 years  since Goodhart's founding, Frank and successive generations of family  leadership have tapped into new markets, both in their customer base  and the regions they serve. The projects they have worked on vary,  ranging from food and beverage equipment to ductwork and even  hovercraft. Goodhart Sons moved to their current facility in 1971,  which has continued to expand with each generation.

Today, Goodhart Sons Inc. is under fourth-generation leadership and  employs over one hundred people. Goodhart Sons has built a reputation  for large industrial work, and their installation team has worked  across the United States and other countries. Goodhart Sons is also  committed to the local community, best shown through their charitable  donations and workforce development investments.

For 90 eventful years, Goodhart Sons Inc. has been a business and  community leader in Pennsylvania's 11th District. I am grateful for the  Goodhart family for their positive impact and wish them many more years  of success.
