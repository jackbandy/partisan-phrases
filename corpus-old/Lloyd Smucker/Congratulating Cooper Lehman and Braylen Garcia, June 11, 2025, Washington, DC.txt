Congratulating Cooper Lehman and Braylen Garcia, Tennis Doubles Champions


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate Cooper Lehman  and Braylen Garcia of Hempfield High School on winning the 2025 PIAA  Class 3A boys' Tennis Doubles championship on May 24.

Senior Cooper Lehman and freshman Braylen Garcia dominated the 2025  tennis season. Their doubles team was instrumental in Hempfield's 15- win start and claiming the Section One title, second place finish in  the Lancaster-Lebanon League, and fourth place finish in the district  3A team tournaments. Ending with a 16-4 record, the Hempfield Black  Knights advanced to states. On May 24, Lehman and Garcia defeated their  opponents from Dallastown after climbing back from a large deficit.

Lehman and Garcia crowned an excellent season with their state title.  The duo also won the Lancaster-Lebanon League title and the District  Three title weeks prior. This run wraps up a prolific high school  career for Cooper Lehman, who will be continuing to play tennis at the  University of Mary Washington, and it shows great promise for Braylen  Garcia who is just beginning his high school playing career.

Winning the Class 3A boys' tennis doubles championship is an  exceptional achievement for Hempfield's Cooper Lehman and Braylen  Garcia, and I congratulate them on their victory. May they hoist their  medals high with great pride in their efforts. I look forward to seeing  what these students accomplish next.
