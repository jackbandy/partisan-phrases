Congratulating the Linville Hill Christian School Boys Basketball State Champions


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize  the Linville Hill Christian School boys' basketball team on winning the  Class 2A PIAA Championship on March 28, 2025.

A small Christian school at the rural eastern edge of the 11th  Congressional District, Linville Hill Christian School has defied  expectations. After cruising through the regular season and the  playoffs, the boys' basketball team made their way to the Class 2A PIAA  Championship game.

Though they trailed with four minutes to go in the fourth quarter,  late game heroism cut the deficit to a single point. Senior captain and  Linville Hill's all-time leading scorer, Stephen Smucker, then sank the  go-ahead basket with under thirty seconds to go. A spectacular defense  from Linville Hill Christian sealed a 55-54 victory. Their state title,  the first in the program's history, crowned a historic 29-3 season.  Coach Mike Schatzmann and the players of Linville Hill Christian School  should be proud of this extraordinary accomplishment.

I congratulate them on their Class 2A PIAA Basketball Championship  and wish them the best in their future endeavors. I am certain that the  lessons that each of these students learned on the court will continue  to serve them well throughout their lives.
