Congratulating Ymca of the Roses Ceo and President Larry Richardson on His Retirement


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor and congratulate Mr.  Larry Richardson on his retirement as President and CEO of YMCA of the  Roses.

Prior to his time with the YMCA, Mr. Larry Richardson was an educator  and football coach. He joined the York YMCA in 1994 during a difficult  time for the organization, which has since seen tremendous positive  change under his leadership. During his tenure, the York YMCA expanded  to include a technology center, the Graham Aquatic Center near Kiwanis  Lake, a branch in Shrewsbury, and much more. He also strengthened the  York YMCA's impact on housing insecurity and homelessness--a mission  exemplified by the affordable housing programs and homeless shelter  they operate.

What was formerly known as the York County YMCA merged with the  Lancaster County YMCA in 2021 to become YMCA of the Roses. Mr.  Richardson was instrumental in this merger. At a time when the  Lancaster YMCA was financially struggling, his leadership saved the  organization from closure. Since then, the YMCA of the Roses has  continued to focus on housing, social responsibility, and healthy  living in both York and Lancaster County.

As President and CEO for the YMCA of the Roses, Mr. Larry Richardson  has provided an invaluable service to the community. The YMCA of the  Roses has transformed lives under his leadership, and I am proud and  thankful to have such a strong community-minded organization in  Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District. I wish the best in his  well-earned retirement.
