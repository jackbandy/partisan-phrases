Congratulating Kyle Welk on Being Named the 2025 Merle Howard Award Winner


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize and congratulate  Kyle Welk of Peach Bottom, Pennsylvania, on being named the 2025 Merle  Howard Award winner at the 58th World Dairy Expo in Wisconsin.

Having grown up on a dairy farm, Kyle has dedicated his life to the  dairy industry from a young age. On October 3, 2025, he received the  Merle Howard Award, which is one of the highest honors a young person  can achieve in the dairy industry.

Kyle's work ethic is demonstrated by his steady determination and  pursuit of excellence. He began by showing cattle at local shows and  progressed to state, regional, and national competitions. His  commitment took him from working on a prestigious farm in Lancaster  County to traveling across the United States and even to New Zealand.  Kyle also won numerous state awards for his homebred cattle and swept  the fitting contest at the 2024 World Dairy Expo.

Dairy farming is not an easy profession, but Kyle approached every  task--from washing animals to packing their bedding--with passion,  drive, and humility. These same qualities have made him stand out as  one of the very best in fitting, raising, and breeding cattle.

Agriculture is the backbone of Pennsylvania's 11th District, and we  are fortunate to have a strong dairy industry. The grit and  perseverance of individuals like Kyle Welk make this possible. His  character and grit have earned him well-deserved recognition as the  2025 Merle Howard Award winner.

Through his achievements, Kyle sets an excellent example for young  people in Pennsylvania's 11th District and beyond who aspire to careers  in dairy and agriculture. I congratulate him and look forward to seeing  all that his bright future holds.
