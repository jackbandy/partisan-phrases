Congratulating Chief Kerry Nye on His Retirement


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate Lititz Borough  Police Chief Kerry Nye on his retirement after 45 years in law  enforcement.

Kerry Nye began his career with the Lititz Borough Police Department  in 1980 and has remained there since, becoming a sergeant in 1994 and  the Chief of Police in 2016. A staple of Chief Nye's leadership was his  geniality and his visibility in the community. He planned emergency  services events, such as cancer treatment fundraisers, and was a  central figure in special occasions throughout Lititz Borough.

His dedication to serving the community extends beyond the Lititz  Borough Police Department, as he served with the Boy Scouts for more  than 30 years.

Once again, I want to thank Chief Nye for his selfless efforts  serving and protecting Lititz Borough. I wish him the best in his well- deserved retirement.
