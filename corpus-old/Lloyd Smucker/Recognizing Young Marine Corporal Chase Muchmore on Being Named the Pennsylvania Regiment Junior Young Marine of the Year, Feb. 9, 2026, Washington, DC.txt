Recognizing Young Marine Corporal Chase Muchmore on Being Named the Pennsylvania Regiment Junior Young Marine of the Year


Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize  Young Marine Corporal Chase Muchmore on being named the Pennsylvania  Regiment Junior Young Marine of the Year.

Chase Muchmore is a current student at Manor Middle School and is a  Corporal with the Young Marines of Lancaster County. As a member of the  organization's color guard, he has spoken and posted the colors for  events such as graduations, sporting events, and a Cold War Veteran  Recognition Ceremony that I held in November 2025. He has also led  community service efforts, such as donation drives, and organized a  Veterans Day program for his hometown.

The Young Marines is a national youth program that focuses on  community service, leadership, and a drug-free lifestyle. To be the  Pennsylvania Regiment Junior Young Marine of the Year, YM/Cpl Muchmore  completed Junior Leadership School, fulfilled requirements for rank,  education, and community service, wrote an essay, and completed an  interview process before being selected by the state board.

By being named Pennsylvania Regiment Junior Young Marine of the Year,  YM/Cpl Muchmore has demonstrated leadership qualities and a heart for  service not frequently seen by children his age. Congratulations to YM/ Cpl Muchmore and to the Young Marines of Lancaster County, and I look  forward to seeing what his bright future holds.
