Dismantling Social Security


Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, in January, a largely unknown midlevel career  employee at the Social Security Administration, Leland Dudek, was  caught sharing unauthorized data with Elon Musk's team at DOGE. Senior  officials were so alarmed they put him on leave and launched an  investigation. He may have violated privacy and tax laws.

Here is the stuff you can't make up. President Trump just promoted  him to be the Acting Commissioner of Social Security.

DOGE, which I think stands for destruction of government by Elon, is  reportedly demanding plans to gut the Social Security Administration,  firing up to 50 percent of workers and closing field offices across the  country, potentially including one in my district.

This isn't about efficiency. It is a back-door attack on Social  Security itself. If they succeed, tens of millions of Americans will  face delays, disruptions, and denials of benefits they have earned.

This is nothing more than an attempt to dismantle Social Security  from the inside. We cannot allow it. We need answers. We need  oversight. We need to stop this now.
