Recognizing Reverend Jason Coker and Reverend Jenell Coker As My December 2025 Co-Constituents of the Month


Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Rev. Jason Coker and Rev.  Jenell Coker as my December 2025 Co-Constituents of the Month.

Rev. Jason and Rev. Jenell Coker are being recognized for their  extraordinary leadership, vision, and longstanding commitment to  community transformation. Together, they have grown The Oceanside  Sanctuary into a thriving, historic congregation that serves as a hub  for inclusive, justice-centered ministry in North County San Diego.

Their work extends far beyond the church walls through ecumenical and  interfaith collaboration, nonprofit leadership, education, and  community organizing, and is grounded in a fully LGBTQ-affirming faith  that prioritizes dignity, equity, and belonging. Through decades of  service, the Cokers have demonstrated how thoughtful, courageous  leadership can strengthen institutions, empower communities, and create  lasting positive change.

They are immensely deserving of this recognition and our district is  better off because of their work.
