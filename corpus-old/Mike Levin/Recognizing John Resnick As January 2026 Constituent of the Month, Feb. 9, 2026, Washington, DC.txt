Recognizing John Resnick As January 2026 Constituent of the Month


Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize John Resnick as my  January 2026 Constituent of the Month.

John has helped establish Carlsbad as a premier culinary destination  through his leadership of four acclaimed restaurants, earning two  Michelin Stars and national recognition. His commitment to excellence,  sustainability, and community exemplifies the very best of the 49th  Congressional District.

Just as importantly, John's work brings people together. His  restaurants serve as welcoming gathering places where neighbors,  families, and visitors connect over memorable meals and shared  experiences. Through great food, thoughtful drinks, and warm  hospitality, John has helped strengthen the sense of community that  makes Carlsbad such a special place.

He is immensely deserving of this recognition, and our district is  better off because of his work.
