Rescissions Act of 2025


Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to President  Trump's rescission package that steals $400 million from PEPFAR, a  lifesaving global health program.

Let me remind my colleagues that PEPFAR is a bipartisan effort first  led by Congresswoman Barbara Lee and signed by President George W.  Bush. It has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis four times.

Right now, Republicans who are supportive of PEPFAR are calling the  White House seeking assurances that it will be protected. Do not listen  to the President's empty promises. Nothing in this bill protects  PEPFAR.

If I were to put it simply, PEPFAR saves lives. It has already saved  26 million lives. That is indisputable, and it should be enough to  continue to fund one of the most successful global health programs in  history.

If I cannot appeal to my colleague's humanitarian side, perhaps they  will listen to all the ways PEPFAR serves American interests. PEPFAR is  a cornerstone of global health progress and U.S. diplomacy. If Congress  was to bow to President Trump's demands to pull PEPFAR funding, it  would leave a gap for China to fill.

Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at  the desk.

Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
