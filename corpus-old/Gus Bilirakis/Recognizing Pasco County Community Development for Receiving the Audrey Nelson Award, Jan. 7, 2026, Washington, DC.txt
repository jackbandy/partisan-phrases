Recognizing Pasco County Community Development for Receiving the Audrey Nelson Award


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  work of Pasco County Community Development and to congratulate the  County on receiving the prestigious Audrey Nelson Award, a national  honor that recognizes exemplary achievement in serving communities and  low- and moderate-income residents through the innovative use of  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME Investment  Partnership funds.

The Audrey Nelson Award is bestowed annually on only a limited number  of projects nationwide. This year, just seven projects were selected,  making Pasco County's achievement especially noteworthy. Pasco County  is proud to once again be among this distinguished group, with  recognition for its Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center (UCC)--the  first Behavioral Health UCC in the State of Florida, This innovative  project was developed to address a critical gap in access to urgent  mental health and substance use services for vulnerable populations.  The Behavioral Health UCC provides immediate, voluntary access to  outpatient behavioral health care with extended hours, offering a vital  alternative to emergency departments. It also serves as an essential  access point for individuals transitioning from high-risk settings such  as jails and inpatient facilities, helping ensure continuity of care at  moments when intervention is most needed. The impact of this program  has been extraordinary. While the UCC initially anticipated serving 450  individuals during its first year of operation--from February 5, 2025,  through September 30, 2025--it ultimately provided services to 1,274  adults, exceeding expectations by 183 percent. Approximately 94 percent  of those served were successfully diverted from more acute inpatient  settings. Additionally, 71 percent of follow-up appointments were  attended, a remarkable improvement from the 34 percent follow-up rate  that existed prior to the establishment of the UCC for individuals  referred from critical transition points.

This success was made possible in part through a strategic investment  of $1,469,927 in CDBG funds, which supported essential infrastructure  and renovation needs at the facility. These funds not only enabled the  UCC to open its doors but also helped leverage additional operational  funding to sustain services in the years ahead. The Behavioral Health  Urgent Care Center now stands as a model for how targeted federal  resources can be used to drive innovation, improve outcomes, and  strengthen communities.

I commend Pasco County Community Development and all partners  involved for their leadership, vision, and commitment to serving those  most in need. Their work exemplifies the purpose of community  development programs and demonstrates how thoughtful investment  can change lives. It is fitting that this exceptional project has been  recognized with the Audrey Nelson Award.
