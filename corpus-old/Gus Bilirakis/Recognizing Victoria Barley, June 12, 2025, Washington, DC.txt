Recognizing Victoria Barley


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Victoria Barley has made through her volunteerism  with Youth and Family Alternatives. For more than 15 years, Victoria  Barley has been a remarkable champion for Youth and Family Alternatives  (YFA), leaving a lasting legacy that will continue to shape lives for  generations to come. Her journey with YFA began at the RAP House youth  shelter, where she selflessly volunteered her time to create meaningful  opportunities and provide vital resources to support and uplift the  youth we serve. Driven by a bold vision, Victoria imagined a large- scale annual event in New Port Richey--one that would not only generate  funds for the RAP House but also raise community awareness and  engagement with YFA's mission. Despite having no prior experience in  organizing a 5k race, her determination and passion quickly rallied a  team of dedicated volunteers around her dream. From that vision, the  RAP River Run was born. Today, it stands as one of Tampa Bay's premier  running events, drawing thousands of participants and volunteers each  year. Thanks to the continued enthusiasm and support behind this event,  the team is excitedly preparing for the 2025 RAP River Run, scheduled  for June 14th in downtown New Port Richey. Through sponsorships,  donations, and registration fees, the RAP River Run has raised over $1  million in support of the RAP House. Because of Victoria's relentless  dedication and can-do spirit, hundreds of runaway, homeless, and foster  youth have found safety, stability, and hope during their most  difficult times. Victoria Barley's impact is immeasurable. Her heart,  her leadership, and her unwavering support have made her a true hero to  YFA and to every young life touched by the RAP House.

It is clear Victoria Barley has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
