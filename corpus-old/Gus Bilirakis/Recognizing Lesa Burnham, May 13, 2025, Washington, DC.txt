Recognizing Lesa Burnham


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Lesa Burnham has made through her work with the  CARES Senior Clinic. Lesa is a tireless volunteer, eager to assist with  all clinic needs. She is quick to get the patients ready to see the  doctor, answer phones, and keeps the patient EMR updated. She is an  inspirational decorator, creating holiday decor throughout the clinic  that lifts patients' spirits.

It is clear Lesa Burnham has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
