Recognizing Mika Rotunda


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Mika Rotunda has made through her work with Habitat  Tampa Bay Gulfside. Born and raised in Brooksville, Mika Rotunda is a  dynamic professional with a background in media and real estate. With  years of experience in broadcasting and content creation, Mika has  developed a unique ability to connect with her audience, community and  customers. Her passion for people and the desire to empower others,  translates seamlessly into her real estate career. Combining her media  expertise and real estate knowledge, Mika has broad a unique  perspective to the Habitat Board, which she was voted onto in 2024.  Habitat Tampa Bay Gulfside has been working to create lasting  relationships in Hernando County. Mika has played a key role in making  introductions and working alongside our Hernando Executive Director to  provide information and dispel myths about the Habitat mission. Mika  has used her social media platform of over 100k followers to help  spread Habitat's mission and promote the Habitat program to Hernando  County individuals and families. Mika has worked with Habitat's  external relations team to create social media videos to promote major  events and invite people to apply to the Habitat program. Habitat will  celebrate the completion of its first home in Hernando this June. When  that happens, Mika will be one of the first in line to congratulate the  new homeowner and welcome them to the area.

It is clear Mika Rotunda has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
