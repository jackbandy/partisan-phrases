Recognizing Barbara Sprague


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Ms. Barbara Sprague has made to our community  through her work with the Community Food Bank, leading the charge in  our fight against food insecurity. Since Barbara joined the  organization, her leadership, tenacity, and compassion for those in  need have led the Community Food Bank to grow from supplying 1-2  million meals each year to over 5 million nutritious meals and critical  supplies to fill the meal gap and basic needs for over 70,000 of our  neighbors in need. She has taught the entire team to ``BELIEVE that  they will end hunger because they are BETTER TOGETHER!'' With Barbara's  continued vision and drive to end hunger, the Community Food Bank is  embarking on an expansion that will not only double its impact capacity  but will add a tremendous outreach opportunity for all service  organizations and providers to meet our most at-risk clients right  where they are with their programs and critical support as we work  together to dismantle the pillars of poverty.

The RISE Empowerment Center and Food Bank targets the specific needs  of residents with the collaborative power of our most effective  resources. Barbara's vision, outstanding leadership, and unyielding  drive to make a true difference not only make her a hero in her  organization's mission, but she is also a community treasure.

It is clear that Barbara Sprague has made a profoundly positive  impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we  all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and  humility.
