Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1664, the Deploying  American Blockchains Act of 2025, championed by my good friend and  fellow Florida Gator, Representative Cammack.

This legislation directs the Secretary of Commerce to take the  necessary actions to promote the competitiveness of the United States  in the development and application of blockchain technology.

Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize industries  by enhancing security, transparency, and efficiency. Whether it is used  as a privacy enhancement technology, a supply chain management tool, or  as a method to provide a secure ledger to enhance data security,  blockchain can usher in a new era in American technological leadership.

By fostering innovation and establishing best practices, this bill  positions the United States as a leader in  blockchain technology, driving economic growth and technological  advancement.

I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this very good bill  primarily sponsored by my good friend Mrs. Cammack from the State of  Florida. Let's get this done.

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on  this particular bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
