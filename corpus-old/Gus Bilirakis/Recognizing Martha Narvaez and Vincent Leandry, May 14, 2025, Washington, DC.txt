Recognizing Martha Narvaez and Vincent Leandry


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Martha Narvaez and Vincent Leandry have made to our  community through their volunteer service at the American Red Cross,  Mid-Florida Chapter. Every now and then, we encounter volunteers who  not only serve with dedication but inspire everyone around them. Martha  and Vincent are such a team. Partners in life and in service, this  dynamic Army Veteran duo continues to embody the very best of the  American Red Cross. After a lifetime of service in the military, they  chose to extend that calling with the American Red Cross for the last  five years--and we are truly grateful. Every day, they give their time,  energy, and hearts to advance the mission of the organization. Whether  responding to house fires in the middle of the night, supporting major  disaster operations, or assisting at Yellow Ribbon events for deploying  service members, their commitment never wavers. They are always the  first to raise their hands and often step in before the need is even  spoken. Their compassion knows no bounds. Fluent in Spanish, they  ensure no one is left out of critical recovery conversations--like when  a displaced family in a shelter needed urgent help. A FaceTime call  quickly turned into a 60-mile drive to provide in-person support, gifts  for the children, and hours of comfort and reassurance. Their actions  transformed a moment of isolation into one of connection and healing.  In the wake of hurricanes and amid logistical challenges, they've  served hundreds of meals, including stepping up at the last minute to  support a community feeding event for an elected official. They showed  up with no expectation of recognition--just a desire to help. Whether  at Moon Lake Park or on a roadside in rural Florida, Martha and Vincent  bring warmth and hope wherever they go. Their service touches every  corner of the Red Cross: Disaster Action Team (DAT), Disaster Relief  Operations (DRO), Service to the Armed Forces (SAF), and countless  outreach events. You'll find them at Homeless Veteran Stand-Downs, the  Mexican Consulate, VA hospitals, and more. They respond with empathy,  uplift fellow volunteers and staff with kind words and hugs, and lead  with quiet strength. Team SAF can always rely on them to take  initiative, represent the Red Cross with professionalism, and bring  their signature warmth to every event. They give so much of themselves  and ask for nothing in return. Their dedication, humility, and  boundless compassion serve as a beacon for what it truly means to be  part of the Red Cross family. Martha and Vincent don't just serve--they  show up, wholeheartedly and without hesitation.

It is clear Martha Narvaez and Vincent Leandry have made a profoundly  positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for their service.  May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and  humility.
