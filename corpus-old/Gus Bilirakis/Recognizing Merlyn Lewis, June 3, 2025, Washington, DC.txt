Recognizing Merlyn Lewis


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Merlyn Lewis has made to our community through her  work as an exceptional volunteer for Service Dog Alliance, an all- volunteer non-profit, which promotes and supports the rights and  responsibilities of service dog teams, businesses, and the community.  Merlyn Lewis exemplifies servant leadership by empowering volunteers,  the community, and individuals with disabilities to ensure safe and  unfettered access for service animal handlers. Volunteering more than  10,000 hours, Ms. Lewis has served as President of the Board and Lead  Trainer for the organization. She currently serves on the Executive  Board as Secretary/Treasurer. Ms. Lewis and her service dog, Sterling,  have traveled throughout Florida as role models of what to expect from  a well-trained team. She has assisted individuals with disabilities in  becoming better handlers and in understanding how to follow state and  federal law. Her training for health care professionals, first  responders, government staff, and private businesses about the vital  work service animals perform has reduced barriers to access in housing,  employment, and places of public accommodation and increased community  partnerships to combat the misrepresentation of service animals.  Service Dog Alliance achieves its mission because Merlyn Lewis is on  the front lines and in the trenches doing whatever is necessary to  ensure the organization and those served have all that is needed to be  successful.

It is clear that Merlyn Lewis has made a profoundly positive impact  on our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive  to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
