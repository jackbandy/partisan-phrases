Recognizing Shae Burgess


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Shae Burgess has made to our community as a  volunteer with Pasco County Schools. Shae's has been an integral part  of organizing a more robust support system for the school's athletic  teams. With a passion for sports and a heart for service, Shae took on  the challenge of revitalizing the athletic booster program. Under  Shae's leadership, the booster program has flourished. They have  organized numerous fundraising events and supported multiple school  organizations. These funds have been used to purchase new equipment,  upgrade facilities, and provide scholarships for student-athletes.  Shae's innovative ideas and relentless drive have not only increased  financial support but also boosted community involvement and school  spirit. In addition to her work with the booster program, Shae  volunteers directly with the sports teams. Shae is always there to lend  a hand and mentor other volunteers. Shae's commitment to the school  extends to the staff as well. Recognizing the hard work and dedication  of teachers and administrators, Shae has initiated several programs to  show appreciation for their efforts. She organizes staff appreciation  events, where teachers and staff are treated to breakfast or lunch, and  receive tokens of gratitude from the community. Through her actions,  Shae has fostered a sense of unity and pride within the school  community. Her ability to bring people together, whether it's parents,  students, or staff, has created a supportive environment. Shae's impact  is felt not just in the success of the athletic programs, but in the  overall morale and spirit of the school. Shae Burgess is a remarkable  volunteer whose dedication and hard work have made a lasting  difference. Shae's story is a testament to the power of volunteerism  and the profound impact one person can have when they commit to making  a difference.

It is clear Shae Burgess has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and  I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to serve our  communities with the same dedication and humility.
