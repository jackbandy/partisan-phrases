Recognizing Frank Cassara


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Frank Cassara has made to our community through his  volunteerism at A New Generation. Frank has dutifully served A New  Generation for five years as a Board member. He tirelessly champions  the cause of A New Generation in the community and within his  professional circles. From volunteering at events, helping to oversee  the bookkeeping and finances to fundraising, Frank does not stop.  Frank's commitment to promoting the many services offered by the  pregnancy center and speaking so highly of the services provided to  those seeking pregnancy and relationship related decisions, is truly  admirable. Not a week goes by without the center feeling the positive  impact of Frank's care and diligence to embracing and promoting  everything the organization does. Without a doubt, Frank is acutely  tuned to the needs of every aspect of the organization. He helps guide  and problem solve. He always follows through, and his cheery and  pleasant disposition makes him, not just a pleasure to be around, but a  great public face for the organization. Individuals, like Frank  Cassara, are a rare breed.

It is clear Frank Cassara has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
