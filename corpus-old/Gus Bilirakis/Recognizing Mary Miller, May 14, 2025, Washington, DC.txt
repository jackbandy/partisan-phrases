Recognizing Mary Miller


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Mary Miller has made through her work with Gulf  Middle School. Mary has been volunteering for Gulf Middle School since  2016. She has helped with the school's tutoring program, volunteers  weekly in the free school store (the Treasure Chest), helped with  securing English as a Second Language tutors for Gulf Middle School  families, and coordinated a free weekly meal to serve families and the  community. Mary has also been a big supporter of the school's annual  book fair and has supported its National Junior Honor Society. She  jumps in wherever needed and always goes above and beyond. She is kind- hearted and compassionate towards all students and families. She is  dependable, hardworking, and efficient. Mary has a great rapport with  our students, staff, and other volunteers.

It is clear Mary Miller has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
