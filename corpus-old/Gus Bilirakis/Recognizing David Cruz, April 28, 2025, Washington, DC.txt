Recognizing David Cruz


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that David Cruz made to our community through his  voluateerism with the Knights of Columbus. When Hurricane Beryl hit  Texas, Operation Barbeque Relief sent David to Texas. While there, he  organized 21 Knights in six days to make 7,500 meals a day. These meals  were fed to relief workers and victims of the hurricane. David is the  Disaster preparedness Coordinator for the Knights for the Dioceses of  St. Petersburg which encompasses Pasco, Pinellas, Hillsborough, and  Hernando counties.

After Hurricane Milton, David was assigned to accompany and work with  a Medical Crew from Ohio. Together, they treated over 400 patients  providing medical assistance to those in need. The team also worked  with Fresh Start for Pasco to feed shut-ins in East Pasco for  Thanksgiving. David has worked on bringing together many of the  spiritual groups and civic organizations within the community to help  hurricane victims. Thanks to these efforts, Our Lady Queen of Peace  served 12,000 families during the six weeks after the hurricanes. David  still works with Fresh Start for Pasco, Endeavors, and Pinellas  Emergency Operations Center to help victims of disasters. Most  recently, his volunteerism brought David to muck out homes where the  water has finally receded.

It is clear David Cruz has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
