Recognizing Joanne Gillespie


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Joanne Gillespie has made to our community through  her volunteerism at NAMI Hernando. Joanne is a retired Exceptional  Student Education (ESE) teacher and current Board Secretary of NAMI  Hernando since 2017. In these roles, she has been a dedicated champion  for mental health education and inclusion. As the mother of an adult  son living with schizophrenia, Joanne brings both personal insight and  professional experience to everything she does. NAMI is grounded in the  power of lived experience, and Joanne embodies that mission  wholeheartedly. For eight years, Joanne has taught Family-to-Family  classes and led Family Support Groups, offering encouragement and  understanding to others walking a similar path. She is also a certified  instructor for Mental Health First Aid and Wellness Recovery Action  Plan (WRAP), further extending her impact in the community. In addition  to her peer support and education roles, Joanne chairs NAMI Hernando's  Fundraising Committee and has been an active contributor to the Finance  Committee, helping guide sustainable growth for the organization. Her  thoughtful insight and nurturing spirit bring clarity and compassion to  board decisions, and she has played a key role in streamlining internal  communications and administrative processes. Joanne's background as an  educator gives her a unique perspective on the emotional and  developmental needs of families and youth. She frequently goes above  and beyond to offer support, guidance, and hope to those navigating  complex mental health systems. Whether advocating for youth mental  health, organizing community events, or mentoring families, Joanne is a  voice of wisdom, patience, and grace.

It is clear Joanne Gillespie has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
