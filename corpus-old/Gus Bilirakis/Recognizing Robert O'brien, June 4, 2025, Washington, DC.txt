Recognizing Robert O'brien


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Robert ``Bob'' O'Brien has made through his  volunteerism at Cypress Elementary School. Bob's talents and craft as a  Master Gardener are enjoyed by students and appreciated by staff.  Affectionately called Gardener Bob, he brings the art of growing one's  own fruits and vegetables to the Cypress Elementary Cubs. As part of  the school's 4th Grade Science Lessons, students learn the farm-to- table concept by preparing the soil, planting seeds, nurturing the  seedlings into mature plants, harvesting and finally preparing and  consuming fresh produce. They learn the life cycle of plants and the  value of working for your food. In addition to leading students, Bob  recruits and manages his Garden Crew; a handful of additional dedicated  volunteers that are passionate about the art of gardening and promoting  fresh and healthy eating. Where Bob primarily works with 4th grade  students, all students in the school benefit from his efforts. Located  by our playground, all students watch the progress of the plants as  they grow, building excitement for when it is their turn to garden. He  has helped instill a love of learning in students as look forward to  Garden Day when it is their turn to get their hands dirty and learn.

It is clear Robert ``Bob'' O'Brien has made a profoundly positive  impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all  strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
