Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2482, as amended, the NTIA  Reauthorization Act, led by my good friend, Chairman Latta.

Mr. Speaker, the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration plays a critical role in today's communications  ecosystem, but Congress has not reauthorized NTIA since 1992.

The NTIA Reauthorization Act ensures that NTIA has the tools it needs  for today's needs. It elevates the head of the NTIA to an  Undersecretary of Commerce to reflect the important role that NTIA  plays. It eliminates unnecessary reports, codifies two critical  offices, and authorizes NTIA for 2 years.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2482, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Latta and Ranking Member  Matsui for this very important, vital bill.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on this particular bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
