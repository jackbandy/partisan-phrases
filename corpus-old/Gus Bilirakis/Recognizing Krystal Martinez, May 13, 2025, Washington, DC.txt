Recognizing Krystal Martinez


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Krystal Martinez has made to our community through  her work with New Beginnings Youth Shelter which serves homeless kids  aged 10-17 who are between foster homes, abandoned, or homeless. The  whole team jumps in to take care of the kids that have no one else  looking out for them. They teach kids structure, respect, understanding  and so much more in a loving environment. The team really cares and  each member is deeply invested in the kids' long-term success.

It is clear Krystal Martinez has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
