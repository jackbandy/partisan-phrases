Recognizing Marie Bienkowski


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Ms. Marie Bienkowski has made to our community  through her volunteerism as part of the Save Crystal River Board of  Directors. She has helped forge a path to secure more than $50M in  funding to meet the agency's original goal of restoring nearly 100  acres of waterways by the City of Crystal River's 100th Year  Anniversary on July 3, 2023. To date, more than 850 new spring vents  have been opened, 107 plus acres have been cleaned of 680M plus pounds  of lyngbya algae and detrital materials from the riverbeds, and 590,000  plus eelgrass plants have been hand-planted. The native grasses provide  a natural healthy habitat for fish, birds, and crabs, and are a source  of nutrition for the manatees. Marie's generosity of her time,  guidance, and commitment to educate elementary school children,  business owners, and State of Florida leadership about the importance  of clean water and environmental health, reflects her personal nature  of resiliency as a resident of Crystal River. Like so many other  residents, she has expenenced the hefty challenges of multiple  hurricanes and tornadoes, and she has always come right back to lead  the charge to make Florida and our spring systems one of the  outstanding gems of the United States, not only for residents but also  for the millions of visitors who come here every year to fish and swim  with the manatees in Crystal River, the ``home of the manatees.'' In  this year of our focus on resiliency, Marie embodies the very essence  of resilience, and she is therefore a ``Hero Among Us'' for Save  Crystal River.

It is clear that Marie Bienkowski has made a profoundly positive  impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all  strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
