Recognizing Felicia Jones


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Felicia Jones has made to our community through her  work with New Beginnings Youth Shelter which serves homeless kids aged  10-17 who are between foster homes, abandoned, or homeless. Led by  Felicia, the whole team jumps in to take care of the kids that have no  one else. They teach the kids structure, respect, understanding and so  much more in a loving environment. The team seems to really care and to  really be invested with the kids. It takes a special breed of people  who can handle working with this population and carry on loving every  single kid that comes through in the exact way he or she needs to be  loved.

It is clear Felicia Jones has made a profoundly positive impact on  our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
