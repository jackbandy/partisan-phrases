Recognizing Tom Prior


Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Tom Prior has made in our community through his  volunteerism at the Good Samaritan Clinic in Pasco County since 2014.  Tom began volunteering in the clinic's pharmacy and quickly became one  of the clinic's Eligibility and Referral Specialists. Tom reviews the  applications for the clinic's new and requalifying patients, assuring  that patients meet the income and residency requirements necessary to  receive free medical care. Tom always treats all potential patients  with respect and dignity. He is an inspiration to the staff and his  fellow volunteers. Tom volunteers at the clinic two to three times a  week for eight months out of the year. Tom always goes above and  beyond, always putting the patients' well-being first. Tom is also a  loyal supporter of Metropolitan Ministries in Holiday, where he donates  food and other needed supplies to their program. Pasco County is a  better place because of dedicated, caring volunteers like, Tom Prior.

It is clear Tom Prior has made a profoundly positive impact on our  community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to  serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
