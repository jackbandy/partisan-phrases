Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act


Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 331, the  HALT Fentanyl Act.

Mr. Speaker, opioid overdoses have become an epidemic in this  country. Last year, over 100,000 Americans lost their lives to  overdose, and fentanyl poisoning is the driving force behind that.

Mr. Speaker, it is not just the country at large that has experienced  this problem. In my own district, we have seen an over 1,000 percent  increase in the rate of fentanyl poisoning and deaths.

Mr. Speaker, I had the most difficult day in my over 20 years in  public office recently when I had to console one of my constituents, a  mother who lost both of her sons on the same day to the same fentanyl  poisoning event.

We must give our law enforcement the tools to combat this problem.  This bill does exactly that. It permanently reschedules fentanyl and  its analogues as a schedule I narcotic, and it gives our law  enforcement agencies the tools that they need to begin dealing with  this problem.

That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of the House version of this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of it.
