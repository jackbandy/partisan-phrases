Recognizing the Mojave Water Agency on the Occasion of its 65th Anniversary


Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 65th  anniversary of the Mojave Water Agency, an institution that has stood  as a pillar of responsible stewardship, innovation, and public service  in California's High Desert since its founding in 1960.

For over six decades, the Mojave Water Agency has safeguarded one of  our region's most precious resources: water. Formed by local voters in  response to declining groundwater levels, the Agency has grown into one  of the most respected and visionary water management organizations in  our state.

As one of California's original State Water Project contractors, the  Mojave Water Agency was instrumental in bringing imported water to the  region. That achievement helped pave the way for responsible population  growth, economic development, and long-term sustainability in one of  the most arid areas of our Nation. Today, the Agency's service area  spans nearly 5,000 square miles and provides water resource management  for nearly half a million residents.

Over the past 65 years, the Mojave Water Agency has distinguished  itself through its technical excellence, long-range planning, and  commitment to the efficient and responsible use of water. Its  leadership has fostered strong partnerships with local governments,  businesses, and residents, building a foundation of trust and shared  responsibility.

Equally commendable is the Agency's focus on public education and  outreach. Through this work, the Mojave Water Agency has not only  fulfilled its operational mission but has cultivated a strong culture  of civic pride and community stewardship.

The Mojave Water Agency has helped ensure that life across our region  remains sustainable, secure, and well-prepared for the challenges  ahead. On behalf of California's 23rd Congressional District, I extend  my deepest appreciation to the leaders, staff, and partners of the  Mojave Water Agency for 65 years of exemplary service. I ask my  colleagues to join me in honoring this remarkable institution and in  wishing it continued success for decades to come.
