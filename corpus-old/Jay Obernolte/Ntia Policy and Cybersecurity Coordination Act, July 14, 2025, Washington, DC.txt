Ntia Policy and Cybersecurity Coordination Act


Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in proud support of my bill, H.R.  1766, the NTIA Policy and Cybersecurity Coordination Act.

Mr. Speaker, as more and more of Americans' lives move into a digital  format, it is leaving the information of Americans more and more  vulnerable to cyberattacks. That is why it is critical that we  establish cybersecurity protocols and capabilities to counter the  threats not just of foreign actors but of cybercriminals and  transnational criminal organizations who attempt to breach our data  security and access the data of Americans.

This bill is an important step towards doing that. It establishes a  new Office of Policy Development and Cybersecurity within the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration. The role of this  office would be to research the cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the  American economy and within our government and to coordinate efforts to  counter cyber threats within those organizations.

Mr. Speaker, cybersecurity is national security, and this bill is a  meaningful step towards achieving that for the people who we represent.

I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their  support on this bill, as well as my bipartisan co-lead, Congresswoman  McClellan, and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
