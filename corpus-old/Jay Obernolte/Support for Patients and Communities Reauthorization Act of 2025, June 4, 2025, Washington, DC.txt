Support for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025


Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan  bill that reauthorizes the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act  programs from 2018.

Mr. Chair, we are facing an epidemic of fentanyl overdoses in this  country and this bill provides meaningful steps in countering them. The  programs that this bill reauthorize provide naloxone for first  responders, funding for prevention programs, funding for treatment  programs, funding for recovery services, and the efficacy of these  programs  is shown in the difference in overdose deaths that we have seen in this  country between when the program was first implemented in 2018 and last  year.

We have seen, Mr. Chair, a dramatic decline in overdose-related  deaths, but more work remains to be done.

Last year, Mr. Chair, over 50,000 Americans lost their lives to  opioid overdoses. That is why this bill is so important to reauthorize.  I thank my friend and the chairman for including my bill, the 9-8-8  Lifeline Cybersecurity Responsibility Act in this bill. I hope everyone  in the Chamber is aware of the 9-8-8 lifeline and the vital services  that it provides. It provides 24/7 crisis mental health counseling to  Americans that are facing mental health crises and are in danger of  committing suicide.

Mr. Chair, recently the crisis line was taken down by a cybersecurity  incident and I think we should all be able to agree that that is  unacceptable. My bill will solve that problem by improving information  sharing between law enforcement agencies and the operators of the  lifeline, which will keep that lifeline up for the people who need it.

Mr. Chair, this is a great bipartisan bill. I urge its support.
