Recognizing the Service of Debra Jones on Her Retirement


Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the  service of Victorville City Councilwoman Debra Jones. During her nearly  fourteen years of dedicated public service, Debra has advocated  tirelessly for the Victorville community and its citizens' most  pressing concerns. Debra is renowned in our community as a selfless and  caring servant and is a true friend to all who have the privilege of  knowing her.

Elected to the City Council in November 2018 and sworn into office  the following month, she went on to serve as Mayor from December 2020  through December 2023. Debra was instrumental in championing Measure P,  which expanded law enforcement, strengthened code enforcement, and led  to the development of a new police station and civic plaza, enhancing  public safety and revitalizing the city's core. She also helped  establish the Victorville Wellness Center, the first facility of its  kind in San Bernardino County, which reduced the city's unsheltered  homeless population by fifty-seven percent and now serves as a model  for other communities.

In addition to her work in public office, Debra has been deeply  involved in education and community service. She co-founded the  Adelanto Elementary School District's first Special Education Parent  Advisory Committee, served two terms on its Governing Board, and has  devoted herself to volunteerism, philanthropic writing, and foster  parenting--particularly for infants prenatally exposed to illicit  drugs.

Debra has also represented Victorville on numerous regional boards  and commissions, including the San Bernardino County Transportation  Authority, the San Bernardino Council of Governments, and the Victor  Valley Wastewater Reclamation Authority. Her service on these bodies  has been marked by professionalism, collaboration, and a deep  commitment to transparency and good governance.

Debra's accomplishments would not have been possible without the  support of her family. Her husband, Gene, and their six children have  stood by her side throughout her many years of public service and  community leadership.

Debra has had a profound impact on the Victorville community. Heather  and I deeply appreciate her years of service, and we wish her and her  family well as she enters this next stage of her already eventful and  purposeful life. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing  Councilwoman Debra Jones and celebrating her retirement.
