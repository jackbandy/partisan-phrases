Recognizing Jennie Fregoso and Her Distinguished Military Career


Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Major Jennie Marie  Fregoso for her outstanding 25 years of service in the United States  Army. From May 2000 to July 2025, Major Fregoso exemplified the Army's  core values of duty, honor, and selfless service, leaving a lasting  impact on every unit she served with.

Major Fregoso began her career as a Medical Logistics Specialist with  the 349th General Hospital and later served with distinction in the  349th Combat Support Hospital and the 349th Field Hospital. Throughout  her career, she held key roles including Executive Officer, S1, S3, S8,  Projects Manager, and Conversion Coordinator. Her versatility and  leadership were pivotal during the transformation of the 349th Combat  Support Hospital into the 349th Field Hospital and 380th Hospital  Center, and she was personally commended for her performance as Battle  Captain during CSTX.

During her 2004 to 2005 deployment in support of Operation Enduring  Freedom, Major Fregoso served at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center,  took part in a humanitarian mission in El Salvador, and led a cost- saving initiative that saved the Army over $600,000. She completed key  leadership courses and earned multiple awards, including the Army  Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the Humanitarian  Service Medal.

Major Jennie Marie Fregoso's service has strengthened the operational  readiness of the Army Reserve medical community and shaped the careers  of countless soldiers. Her legacy is one of dedication, leadership, and  unwavering professionalism. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring  her exceptional career and in wishing her continued success and  fulfillment in retirement.
