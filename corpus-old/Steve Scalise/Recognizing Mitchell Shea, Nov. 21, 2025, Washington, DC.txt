Recognizing Mitchell Shea


Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank one of the  longest-serving members of Team Scalise, a graduate of the University  of Louisiana at Lafayette, and a native of Louisiana's 1st  Congressional District, Mitchell Shea.

Mitchell first joined Team Scalise as an intern and later moved onto  my full-time staff as a Staff Assistant. Over the past ten years, he  has been promoted multiple times and is currently serving as my Senior  Legislative Assistant.

Throughout his tenure in my office, Mitchell has faithfully served  the constituents of Louisiana's 1st Congressional District and has  become a trusted advisor to me and an invaluable part of our team.  Whether giving tours, meeting with constituents, or working on complex  policy issues, Mitchell has approached every aspect of his job with a  servant's heart, a strong work ethic, and a positive attitude. While we  will feel his absence on our team, I am excited for him as he takes on  a new challenge in the Senate and am pleased to welcome him to our  esteemed Alumni Club.

I know his parents, Scott and Alicia, are so proud of all he has  accomplished. I wish Mitchell the best of luck in this next chapter,  and I thank him for his nearly 10 years of dedicated service to  Louisiana's 1st Congressional District.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Mitchell  Shea and in wishing him continued success in all his future endeavors.  He makes Louisiana's 1st District, the United States House of  Representatives, and the great state of Louisiana proud.
