Recognizing Seth Hernandez, Billy Carlson, Brady Ebel, and Ethin Bingaman


Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud recognition of four  Corona High School students, Seth Hernandez, Billy Carlson, Brady Ebel,  and Ethin Bingaman who were selected in the 2025 Major League Baseball  Draft. Seth Hernandez, Billy Carlson, and Brady Ebel were selected in  the First Round on Sunday, and Ethin Bingaman was selected in the  Twentieth Round on Monday. This is the first time in Major League  Baseball Draft history that three players from the same high school  were drafted in the first round. I am always proud to calI myself an  alumnus of Corona High School, but I am especially proud this week.

Corona High School has a long history of excellence on the baseball  diamond. Seth, Billy, Brady, and Ethin are the latest in a long line of  Corona High School players who have made their way to Major League  Baseball. The Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers,  and Arizona Diamondbacks are all incredibly lucky to draft Seth, Billy,  Brady, and Ethin, respectively, and I know they will represent the  school and our community well. I wish them all the best in the next  step of their journey, and along with all Corona residents and Corona  High School alumni, I look forward to cheering them on in the Major  League.
