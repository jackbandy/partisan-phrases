Veterans Scam and Fraud Evasion Act of 2025


Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, through their service and sacrifice, our  veterans willingly put themselves in harm's way to ensure the security  of our country. It is our turn to ensure that they are protected from  scams and fraud. That is why I introduced H.R. 1663, the Veterans Scam  And Fraud Evasion Act, or VSAFE Act.

The sophistication and frequency of scams and fraud targeting our  veterans are constantly increasing. According to a report from the  Federal Trade Commission, U.S. veterans and military retirees reported  $350 million in total fraud losses in 2023.

While a number of departments and staff work in an uncoordinated  manner to combat fraud within the VA and other agencies, the VSAFE Act  will establish a comprehensive effort that will assist our veterans by  establishing a veterans scam and fraud evasion officer in the  Department of Veterans Affairs who is responsible for all fraud  prevention efforts.

By providing veterans with more consistent guidance on how to  identify, report, and avoid fraud and scam attempts, we can reduce the  occurrences that are occurring.

I thank Chairman   Mike Bost and all the cosponsors of this bill for  their support. I encourage all of my colleagues to protect our veterans  by supporting the VSAFE Act.
