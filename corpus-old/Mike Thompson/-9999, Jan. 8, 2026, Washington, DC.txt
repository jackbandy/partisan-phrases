Mr. THOMPSON of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding and I  thank him especially for holding this Special Order hour for someone  who we are all going to miss. He was a really great guy.

I am honored to be able to reflect a little bit on the life and the  service of an extremely dedicated Member of Congress, Doug LaMalfa.

I served northern California alongside Doug from the day that he was  sworn in to this body. His area was an area that I represented when I  was in the State senate. In Congress, we represented neighboring  regions of our State. We shared many of the same challenges and worked  together on issues that matter deeply to the people that we both  served.

I was proud to work with him on bipartisan efforts to support our  farmers and ranchers, to strengthen wildfire prevention, to build Sites  Reservoir, and to address the growing home insurance crisis facing  families across all of northern California.

He and I worked together to deliver over $500 million in tax relief  to fire victims in our district that lost their homes then had to sue  in order to get the financial relief to rebuild their homes only to  find out that they were going to be taxed on that money that they got  in the suit, which wasn't in itself enough to even rebuild their homes.  He was caring, and he was a terrific fighter for the folks that we  worked for in delivering this.

He believed in practical solutions, and I always respected and  appreciated his collaboration on the issues important to our  constituents.

I am saddened by the loss of my longtime colleague and friend. Jan  and I extend our deepest condolences and keep Doug's wife, Jill; their  children; their grandchild; and his devoted staff in our prayers during  this very difficult time. I thank the gentleman again for hosting this  Special Order hour.
