One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me time.

Mr. Speaker, this bill shamelessly hurts our constituents, cuts  healthcare for 17 million Americans, and closes one in four nursing  homes and many rural hospitals. It rips nutrition assistance away from  11 million Americans, and it cedes leadership in the green energy  economy to China--to China.

It raises energy bills for hardworking Americans. It cuts Pell grants  for millions of students. It adds $5 trillion to our national debt to  give a tax break to billionaire donors who don't need the help in this  environment. Mr. Speaker, $5 trillion will be added to our national  debt.

It pushes the American Dream out of reach for millions of working- class Americans. Every Member who votes ``yes'' will forever carry the  shame of betraying hardworking Americans and put our kids and our  grandkids in great, great debt.

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. It is bad for our  constituents. It is bad for America. It is bad for our future.
