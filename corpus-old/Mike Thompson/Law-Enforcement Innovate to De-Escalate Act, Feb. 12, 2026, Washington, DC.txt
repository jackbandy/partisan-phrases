Law-Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, H.R. 2189, the taser  bill. I would note that the bill doesn't mention tasers anywhere in the  bill, other than in the title.

I am a supporter of innovation. I am a supporter of de-escalation. I  am a supporter of tasers. My son is a deputy sheriff. I support giving  him and all law enforcement every tool needed to keep them and the  people they serve safe, but let me be clear: This bill does nothing to  help law enforcement access tasers. The fact is, this bill recklessly  and needlessly weakens both the National Firearms Act and the Gun  Control Act.

Under current law, tasers are not regulated by the National Firearms  Act. That is the law that regulates especially dangerous devices like  machine guns and sawed-off shotguns.

Under current law, law enforcement in their official capacity are not  subject to the background check requirement in the Gun Control Act.  That is the law that prevents felons and domestic abusers from buying  weapons.

Under the current law, contrary to what the chairman just mentioned,  law enforcement is not subject to the excise tax for firearms or for  tasers.

Instead of helping law enforcement access tasers, this bill weakens  the law that regulates machine guns and opens the door to another flood  of unregulated, deadly ghost guns in our community. I don't know one  person in law enforcement who wants more untraceable ghost guns on our  streets.

Mr. Speaker, it is unclear what barriers law enforcement faces in  using long-range tasers. I have never received a complaint from law  enforcement in my district, nor have I seen any reports suggesting that  this is a problem. Long-range tasers are already used by law  enforcement--and listen to this--in all 50 States, and in all 50  States, law enforcement pays zero excise taxes on these devices. It is  important to know that long-range tasers can already be legally  purchased by civilians. All they need to do is pass a background check.

I support tasers. I support law enforcement. This bill does not  mention tasers once, and law enforcement is only mentioned in the  title. I don't know what they are trying to do, but it looks to me like  this might just be the proverbial wolf in sheep's clothing.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out, my good friend from New York  was talking about how important this is for law enforcement to have  access to these types of tasers. As I said in my opening remarks, all  50 States already have access to these tasers.

As a matter of fact, in New York, the gentlewoman who just spoke  talked about their need to have them. The New York Police Department  uses these tasers and the Syracuse Police Department uses these tasers.  As a matter of fact, their use is funded by a State grant. The Ramapo  Police Department uses these tasers.

In Arizona, where my good friend Mr. Schweikert is from, the Phoenix  Police Department uses these tasers. The Mesa Police Department uses  these tasers. The Scottsdale Police Department uses these tasers.

This is not about providing access for law enforcement to use these  tasers. They are already used in all 50 States.

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, yield myself such time as I  may consume.

I thank Mr. Stauber for his time in public safety. I thank him for  being a cop. We all owe a deep gratitude to those in uniform who keep  us safe.

As I mentioned when I first made my opening statement, my son is a  cop. I appreciate him, and I appreciate all his colleagues.

However, it is disingenuous to stand on this floor and say that this  bill is needed so cops can have access to this particular type of taser  technology.

Mr. Stauber is from Minnesota. I just want to point out that  Minnesota uses this. The Minnetonka Police Department uses this  technology. The Minneapolis Police Department uses these tasers. The  St. Charles Police Department uses these tasers. The Hastings Police  Department uses these tasers. The Brooklyn Park Police Department uses  these tasers.

This is not about police not having access to this taser technology.  They have it, and they can use it. It is not about that. Please focus  on the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for making my point.

If it is about the tax code, then let's address that. That is not  what this bill does. This opens a huge loophole that will allow people  who are a danger to themselves and others to have access to devices  that none of us believe that they should have access to.

If it was all about what Mr. Schweikert said, then why didn't the  majority take my amendment that I filed that would have taken the ghost  gun loophole issue off the table?

If it is about the tax code, then let's deal with the tax code.  However, as Mr. Doggett made the argument about domestic abusers, these  are people who perpetrate the most heinous of crimes. That is why when  this House and Senate passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, we  closed the boyfriend loophole to ensure that abusive boyfriends were  blocked from accessing firearms, the same way we block abusive husbands  from getting their hands on weapons.

The Gun Control Act is the Federal statute that requires background  checks which block these abusers from getting their hands on firearms.  This bill weakens the Gun Control Act and would allow convicted  domestic abusers to purchase long-range tasers and ghost guns. That is  not what my colleagues on the other side are suggesting that they want  to do.

So why don't we deal with the tax issue? We can do it. The chairman  of the Ways and Means Committee is right here. That is an easy one for  us to fix. But don't create a loophole big enough to drive a truckload  of ghost guns through.

Again, this bill does not do what my colleagues on the other side are  suggesting that it does. They say that police need this bill in order  to have access to and use this new taser, this new innovation in  tasers. As I have pointed out a number of times, everyone who has  spoken, in their home State they use these tasers. The police  departments have access to these, and they use them.

As a matter of fact, all 50 States use these tasers today. I have a  list of all those.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record that list of States.   Sampling of State and Local Law Enforcement and Correctional Adoption               of Axon's Taser 10 (Firearm-Classified Taser)

Despite the claim from proponents of H.R. 2189 and H.R.       4242 that the bills are needed for state and local law       enforcement to be able to obtain and use Taser 10, in       reality, law enforcement departments across the country in       every state have already obtained and use these devices--      making this legislation unnecessary.

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Also, on the issue of domestic abusers,  the idea that this body would make it easier for domestic abusers to  get new technology in tasers is just beyond explanation. We should be  extremely worried about these people getting this type of technology.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a February 9, 2026, to House  leadership.                                                     February 9, 2026.      Speaker Mike Johnson,      House of Representatives.      Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries,      House of Representatives.

To Speaker Johnson and Leader Jeffries: In 2014, a       Washington, DC resident (name withheld to protect the       victim's privacy) abused his wife with a TASER, repeatedly       shocking her in the face and head. While she was still       suffering the effects of the TASER, he repeatedly hit her in       the head with a baseball bat, punched her multiple times in       the face, and then sexually assaulted her. In 2018, a New       Jersey man threatened his girlfriend repeatedly with a TASER       in the course of raping her several times over multiple       incidents. Eventually, he carried through with his threat,       tasing her in the neck and raping and sodomizing her.

These incidents are both horrific and emblematic of a       larger issue: domestic abusers' use of weapons to exert power       and coercive control over their victims. Abusers threaten the       victim, the children, pets, and others. As a nation, we       should erect more barriers to domestic abusers acquiring       weapons, not demolish existing protections. But that is       exactly what H.R. 2189/S. 1283 would do by undermining laws       designed to keep so-called ``less-than-lethal projectile       devices,'' such as TASERs classified as firearms, and ghost       guns out of the hands of adjudicated abusers.

To be clear, despite their marketing, TASERs are not always       ``less-than-lethal,'' as claimed in H.R. 2189. Perhaps they       are less lethal than other firearms, but between 2012 and       2021, 538 people were killed by TASERs or stun guns. And       studies that have found TASERs have only minor health impacts       were not only primarily funded by the manufacturer, they did       not mimic real-life situations, having exclusively healthy       subjects, a short exposure time, and no long-term follow-up.       Moreover, domestic violence continues or for some populations       even escalates during pregnancy, and there is evidence that       the use of a TASER on a pregnant woman can cause her to       miscarry.

Under current federal law, adjudicated domestic abusers       (with a few notable exceptions) are prohibited from       possessing TASERs that are classified as firearms in addition       to ghost guns and traditional firearms. Removing such TASERs       and other ``less-than-lethal projectile devices'' modified to       be lethal from the definition of a ``firearm'' in 18 U.S.C.       921(a) will not only allow adjudicated domestic abusers to       acquire projectile weapons without a background check, it       will make it perfectly legal for a domestic abuser--and other       people convicted of violent and abhorrent crimes such as       felony child molestation--to possess these weapons. While       that might not be the intent of the bill authors, that will       be the real-life impact.

H.R. 2189/S. 1283 will have another chilling unintended       consequence: domestic abusers and others who are prohibited       under federal law from possessing firearms will modify       ``less-than-lethal projectile devices'' to circumvent federal       laws and regulations, including those regulating so-called       `ghost guns.' In 2022, an adjudicated domestic abuser who was       prohibited from possessing firearms used a ghost gun to       murder his three daughters in a Sacramento church during a       supervised visitation then murdered the chaperone and killed       himself. Unable to pass a background check, he assembled his       own firearm from untraceable gun parts which were unregulated       at the time. Since that incident, the Bureau of Alcohol,       Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives issued a regulation, upheld       by the United States Supreme Court in Bondi v. Vanderstock,       to require background checks and serial numbers on unfinished       frames and receivers and on some weapons parts kits. But only       firearms frames and receivers are thus regulated; removing       ``less-than-lethal projectile devices'' from the definition       of ``firearm'' in 18 U.S.C. 921(a) would also allow ghost       guns modified from such devices to proliferate among       individuals with criminal records. And since only firearms       frames and receivers are regulated, kits to modify such       devices into fully-lethal projectile weapons would be       entirely legal and unregulated. Plus, while the bill       stipulates that ``less-than-lethal projectile devices . . .       must be designed and intended to be used in a manner that is       not likely to cause death or serious bodily injury,'' the       bill fails to prohibit or even acknowledge the inevitable       modification of ``less-than-lethal projectile devices'' into       entirely-lethal projectile devices. Once again, adjudicated       domestic abusers who are prohibited from possessing firearms       under federal law would be legally permitted to possess a       firearm-equivalent, with the same lethal capacity, due simply       to semantics.

So, now, let us return to the depraved domestic and sexual       violence offenders whose heinous acts were detailed in the       opening paragraph. Despite their use of TASERs to physically       and sexually abuse their intimate partners and the attendant       criminal convictions that would prohibit them from possessing       firearms, immediately upon their release from prison these       individuals would legally be permitted under federal law to       acquire TASERs and other high-powered ``less-than-lethal       projectile devices'' that today are classified as       firearms. Moreover, once they obtained such weapons, there       would be no barrier in federal law to obtain the necessary       parts to modify them into lethal projectile weapons.

The purpose of this bill is truly perplexing. Not only will       H.R. 2189/S. 1283 arm adjudicated domestic abusers and others       who pose a danger to public safety, it in no way achieves its       stated goals and is a solution in search of a problem. The       federal classification of TASERs as firearms in no way       precludes law enforcement agencies from accessing TASERs,       just as it does not preclude them from accessing an array of       any of the ``less-than-lethal'' devices currently classified       as firearms. Law enforcement agencies are easily able to       procure firearms, including ``less-than-lethal projective       devices'' currently classified as firearms, with many       civilian requirements for purchasing firearm--and federal       taxes--being waived. And contrary to a further argument in       support of H.R. 2189/S. 1283, removing ``less-than-lethal       projectile devices'' from the federal definition of a       ``firearm'' will not decrease law enforcement's liability for       the use of deadly force. In terms of federal law, both       regulations and courts have held that, on its own, the use of       TASERs and other ``less-than-lethal projectile devices'' do       not constitute deadly force. Moreover, even if that were not       the case, changing the federal definition of a firearm to       exclude TASERs and similar devices would in no way impact       liability for using deadly force, because such liability       outside the context of federal law enforcement is established       in state and local law, which H.R. 2189/S. 1283 cannot alter.

So what, then, is the purpose of H.R. 2189/S. 1283? Perhaps       it is to exempt individuals attempting to acquire TASERs and       similar devices from undergoing a background check. In that       case, the benefits to public safety are unclear, while we       have amply demonstrated the risks. Perhaps an individual       seeks to acquire such a device for self-protection. If the       individual does not have a prohibiting record, they should be       able to pass a firearms background check with no       inconvenience to themselves--most firearms background checks       take only a few minutes to complete. And if they do have a       prohibiting record, for the safety not only of victims and       survivors of domestic violence but for public safety more       broadly, they should not have access to either a ``less-than-      lethal'' device or a fully-lethal firearm.

For all of these reasons, we oppose H.R. 2189/S. 1283, and       we urge you to oppose it as well. If you have any questions,       please reach out.            Sincerely,

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, for folks who make the  argument that people are afraid, they want to have the newest taser  technology to keep themselves safe in the civilian space, I understand  that. They are not precluded from being able to purchase and have this  new technology in tasers. They just have to get a background check to  make sure they aren't domestic abusers and to make sure they are not  prohibited individuals who couldn't otherwise get firearms.

This bill does a lot more than the proponents are suggesting that it  does. If, in fact, they want to deal with the issues that they stood on  this floor today and talked about, they are all good issues, everybody  will agree with that, let's do it. Let's draw the bill to deal with  those issues. We could have done that had the majority accepted my bill  that would have closed the ghost gun loophole, but they chose not to.

If they really want to make this bill do what they are claiming, then  let's write a bill that does that. This bill doesn't do it. This puts  American communities at risk.

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.

Mr. COURTNEY changed his vote from ``yea'' to ``nay.''

Ms. PEREZ changed her vote from ``nay'' to ``yea.''

Ms. KELLY of Illinois changed her vote from ``present'' to ``nay.''

So the bill was passed.

The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.

A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

Stated against:

Mr. GOLDMAN of New York. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote today due  to an urgent commitment in my district. Had I been present, I would  have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 70.
