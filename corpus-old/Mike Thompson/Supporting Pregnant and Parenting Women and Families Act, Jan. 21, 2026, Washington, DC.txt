Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act


Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this legislation that  prioritizes a partisan agenda over the health, privacy, and autonomy of  women.

Most of these so-called pregnancy centers are not licensed medical  clinics. What does that mean? It means they can and often do share  women's private medical information without their consent. It means  they can and often do provide false and misleading medical information  about abortion, contraception, and other reproductive health services  for women.

In California, my home State, our attorney general was compelled to  issue a consumer alert warning the public about deceptive practices  employed by these centers.

At a time when access to reproductive healthcare is under attack, our  Republican colleagues are advancing a bill that funnels resources to  organizations that mislead women rather than provide comprehensive  medical care.

Let me repeat: Most of these so-called pregnancy centers are not  licensed medical clinics. How can we, in good conscience, send our  constituents for healthcare to unlicensed facilities? I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on this measure.
