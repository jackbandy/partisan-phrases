Government Accountability Office Opinion Letter


Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land           Management--Applicability of the Congressional Review Act           to Buffalo Field Office Record of Decision and Approved           Resource Management Plan Amendment      File: B-337503      Date: September 18, 2025                                    DIGEST

The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land       Management (BLM) Buffalo Field Office issued a Record of       Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment       (Buffalo RMPA). The Buffalo RMPA makes areas of public land       administered by the Buffalo Field Office unavailable for coal       leasing consideration.

The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires that before a       rule can take effect, an agency must submit the rule to both       the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as the       Comptroller General. CRA adopts the definition of ``rule''       under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) but excludes       certain categories of rules from coverage. We conclude that       the Buffalo RMPA meets APA's definition of a rule, and that       no CRA exception applies. Therefore, the Buffalo RMPA is a       rule subject to CRA's submission requirements.                                   DECISION

In November 2024, the U.S. Department of the Interior       (Interior), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Buffalo Field       Office issued a Record of Decision and Approved Resource       Management Plan Amendment (Buffalo RMPA). We received a       request for a decision as to whether the Buffalo RMPA is a       rule for purposes of the Congressional Review Act (CRA). As       discussed below, we conclude that the Buffalo RMPA is a rule       for purposes of CRA.

Our practice when issuing decisions is to obtain the legal       views of the relevant agency on the subject of the request.       Accordingly, we reached out to Interior to obtain the       agency's views. We received Interior's response on August 8,       2025.                                  BACKGROUND       BLM Public Land Management

Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976,       as amended (FLPMA), BLM is responsible for developing,       maintaining, and, when appropriate, revising ``land use plans       which provide by tracts or areas for the use of the public       lands.'' BLM land use plans, referred to as ``resource       management plans'' (RMPs), establish goals and directives to       guide future land and resource management actions implemented       by BLM. Pursuant to FLPMA, BLM established procedures for the       development, revision, and amendment of RMPs.

The objective of resource management planning is to       maximize resource values for the public through a rational,       consistently applied set of regulations and procedures which       promote the concept of multiple use management. An RMP       generally establishes land use designations; allowable       resource uses; resource conditions, goals, and objectives;       program constraints and general management practices; areas       to be covered by more specific plans; and other related       information.

BLM may amend an RMP to account for, among other things,       new data, new or revised policy, or a change in       circumstances. Amendments are to be made through an       environmental assessment of the proposed change or an       environmental impact statement, if needed, and must involve       public involvement and interagency coordination.      Buffalo Field Office Resource Management Plan

In 2015 BLM issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for six       approved resource management plan amendments (2015 ROD).       According to BLM, the 2015 ROD reflected a broad and       unprecedented effort to address declining ecosystems in the       region and concerns about a potentially endangered species.       The 2015 ROD included the Buffalo Field Office Approved       Resource Management Plan (2015 Buffalo RMP).

Following its issuance, the 2015 Buffalo RMP was challenged       in the United States District Court for the District of       Montana on the basis that BLM improperly approved the plan in       violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).       The court found that BLM violated NEPA and ordered BLM to       complete a new coal screening and remedial NEPA analysis.

In response to the court's order, BLM issued an amended       Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan       (2019 Buffalo RMPA) in November of 2019. The 2019 Buffalo       RMPA was also challenged in court. Once again, the court       found that BLM violated NEPA. In its order, the court       directed BLM to consider no coal leasing and limited coal       leasing alternatives and to disclose the public health       impacts, both climate and non-climate, of burning fossil       fuels from the planning area.

On November 20, 2024, in response to the court's order, BLM       issued the Buffalo RMPA, which is the subject of this       decision. The Buffalo RMPA replaced the 2019 Buffalo RMPA's       decision regarding the availability of coal resources for       leasing. The Buffalo RMPA designates 48.12 billion short tons       of coal as unavailable for further consideration for leasing.       It also precludes the acceptance of new coal lease       applications for the duration of the planning period, which       extends through 2038. However, it permits the development of       existing coal leases in accordance with lease terms and       conditions.      Congressional Review Act

CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires federal agencies to submit a       report on each new rule to both houses of Congress and to the       Comptroller General for review before a rule can take effect.       The report must contain a copy of the rule, ``a concise       general statement relating to the rule,'' and the rule's       proposed effective date. CRA allows Congress to review and       disapprove rules issued by federal agencies for a period of       60 days using special procedures. If a resolution of       disapproval is enacted, then the new rule has no force or       effect.

CRA adopts the definition of ``rule'' under the       Administrative Procedure Act (APA),       which states that a rule is ``the whole or a part of an       agency statement of general or particular applicability and       future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe       law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or       practice requirements of an agency.'' However, CRA excludes       three categories of rules from coverage: (1) rules of       particular applicability; (2) rules relating to agency       management or personnel; and (3) rules of agency       organization, procedure, or practice that do not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties.

Interior did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the       Comptroller General on the Buffalo RMPA. In its response to       us, Interior provided additional information about the       Buffalo RMFA but did not state a position as to whether it is       a rule under CRA.                                  DISCUSSION

At issue here is whether the Buffalo RMPA meets CRA's       definition of rule, which adopts APA's definition of a rule,       with three exceptions. As explained below, we conclude that       it does and that no exceptions apply. Consequently, the       Buffalo RMPA is subject to review under CRA.      The Buffalo RMPA is a Rule under APA

Applying APA's definition of rule, the Buffalo RMPA meets       all of the required elements. First, the Buffalo RMPA is an       agency statement as it was issued by BLM, a federal agency.

Second, the Buffalo RMPA is of future effect as it is to be       used prospectively to guide and direct the leasing and       allocation of coal within the federal government's mineral       estate administered by BLM's Buffalo Field Office. The       management decisions made in the Buffalo RMPA became       effective November 20, 2024, when the Record of Decision was       signed. As of that date, the Buffalo RMPA replaced prior       decisions on the availability of coal leasing by making       certain areas unavailable for such leasing until 2038. Any       subsequent program- or activity-level management actions must       adhere to the directive established in the Buffalo RMPA.       Therefore, the Buffalo RMPA has future effect.

Finally, the Buffalo RMPA implements, interprets, or       prescribes law or policy, because it designates which areas       of BLM-administered land are available for coal leasing       consideration in accordance with BLM's responsibilities for       land use management under FLPMA. Specifically, the Buffalo       RMPA designated approximately 48.12 billion short tons of       coal as unavailable for further leasing consideration to help       reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Our conclusion here is consistent with our previous       decisions finding similar land use plans and RMPs implement,       interpret, or prescribe law or policy. See, e.g., B-337163,       June 25, 2025; B-337175, June 25, 2025; B-329065, Nov. 15,       2017; B-238859, Oct. 23, 2017; B-274505, Sept. 16, 1996. For       example, in B-337163, June 25, 2025, we concluded that BLM's       Miles City Resource Management Plan Amendment (Miles City       RMPA) implemented law and prescribed policy by foreclosing       coal leasing on BLM-administered land pursuant to its duties       under FLPMA and other applicable statutes to manage land use       and the government's mineral resources. Similarly in B-      337200, June 25, 2025, we concluded that an RMP issued by BLM       implemented law and prescribed policy by designating or       foreclosing specific activities or land use on BLM-      administered land within its Central Yukon planning area       (Central Yukon RMP).

Like the Miles City RMPA and the Central Yukon RMP, the       Buffalo RMPA carries out BLM's legal mandates related to land       use planning and resource allocation. It prescribes policy by       modifying prior decisions for the allocation of BLM       administered coal and prohibiting all coal leasing within the       Buffalo Field Office planning area. As such, the Buffalo RMPA       meets the third element of the APA definition of rule. Having       satisfied all the required elements, the Buffalo RMPA       meets the APA definition of rule.      CRA Exceptions

We must next determine whether any of CRA's three       exceptions apply. CRA provides for three types of rules that       are not subject to its requirements: (1) rules of particular       applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or       personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or       obligations of non-agency parties.      (1) Rule of Particular Applicability

Consistent with our previous decisions, the Buffalo RMPA is       a rule of general applicability, rather than particular       applicability. For example, in B-337163, June 25, 2025, BLM       issued the Miles City RMPA that established land use       designations to govern all coal activities by any person or       entity within the planning area of its Miles City Field       Office. Because the Miles City RMPA governed all coal       activities by any person within its purview, we concluded       that the Miles City RMPA was a rule of general applicability.       Similarly, the Buffalo RMPA establishes land use designations       that prohibit coal leasing by any person or entity within the       Buffalo planning area, making it a rule of general       applicability.      (2) Rule of Agency Management or Personnel

The Buffalo RMPA is not a rule of agency management or       personnel. We have previously held that rules that fall into       this category relate to purely internal agency matters.       Because the Buffalo RMPA is concerned with public use of the       areas it governs rather than management of BLM itself or its       personnel, it does not meet CRA's second exception.      (3) Rule of Agency Organization, Procedure, or Practice that           Does Not, Substantially Affect Non-Agency Parties

Lastly, the Buffalo RMPA is not a rule of agency       organization, procedure, or practice that does not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties.

We have previously explained that this exception was       modeled on the APA exception to notice-and-comment rulemaking       requirements for ``rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice.'' The purpose of the APA exception is to ensure       ``that agencies retain latitude in organizing their internal       operations,'' so long as such rules do not have a substantial       impact on non-agency parties.

Following this interpretation in the CRA context, we have       only applied CRA's third exception to rules that primarily       focus on the internal operations of an agency. For instance,       in B-329926, Sept. 10, 2018, we found that updates to a       Social Security Administration (SSA) hearing manual governing       SSA adjudicators' use of information from the Internet       qualified as a rule of agency organization, procedure, or       practice. There, the manual outlined procedures for SSA       employees to follow in processing and adjudicating benefits       claims. Because the manual was directed to and binding only       on SSA officials without imposing new burdens on claimants,       we concluded that the manual met CRA's third exception.

In contrast, rules that are directed at and primarily       concerned with the behavior of non-agency parties do not fall       within this category. Thus, in B-337163, June 25, 2025, we       declined to apply CRA's third exception to BLM's Miles City       RMPA, because it was not limited to changes in BLM's internal       operations. Instead, the Miles City RMPA foreclosed non-      agency parties from leasing coal within designated areas of       the government's mineral estate. Similarly, in B-337200, June       25, 2025, we declined to apply CRA's third exception to the       Central Yukon RMP because it foreclosed certain actions by       non-agency entities, through the establishment of land use       designations and delineation of the activities that may be       undertaken in the planning area.

Here, the Buffalo RMPA does entail some changes to agency       procedure in that BLM will no longer consider coal leasing       applications within the designated planning area. However,       like the Miles City RMPA and the Central Yukon RMP, the       Buffalo RMPA is not limited to changes to internal agency       operations. Instead, the Buffalo RMPA is directed at, and       concerns itself primarily with, regulating the allocation of       coal and coal leasing by non-agency parties. Therefore, the       Buffalo RMPA does not qualify as a rule of agency       organization, procedure or practice.

We must also consider whether the Buffalo RMPA       substantially affects the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties. When analyzing this aspect of CRA's third exception,       ``the critical question is whether the agency action alters       the rights or interests of the regulated entities.'' Along       similar lines, courts have determined that ``[a]n agency rule       that modifies substantive rights and interests can only be       nominally procedural, and the exemption for such rules of       agency procedure cannot apply.''

In previous decisions, we have concluded that where an RMP       designates use by non-agency parties in the areas it governs,       it has a substantial effect. See, e.g., B-337163, June 25,       2025; B-337175, June 25, 2025; B-329065. Nov. 15, 2017; B-      238859, Oct. 23, 2017; B-274505, Sept. 16, 1996. For       instance, in B-337163, June 25, 2025, we explained that the       Miles City RMPA altered substantive rights and obligations of       non-agency parties by excluding 1,745,040 acres of BLM-      administered land from coal leasing, effectively precluding       these parties from pursuing coal leases within the Miles City       planning area. Similarly, in B-337200, June 25, 2025, we       concluded that the Central Yukon RMP substantially affected       non-agency parties by imposing, among other things, land use       restrictions, such as designating areas of critical       environmental concern and closing certain tracts for land for       mineral extraction and recreational use.

Consistent with our prior decisions concerning other RMPs,       the Buffalo RMPA has a substantial effect on non-agency       parties. The Buffalo RMPA designates approximately 481,000       acres of subsurface federal coal mineral estate as closed to       coal leasing by any person or entity. This action removes an       estimated 48.12 billion short tons of federal coal from       future leasing. As a result, BLM has precluded nonagency       parties from pursuing new federal coal leases in the planning       area, thereby altering their substantive rights and       obligations. Accordingly, the Buffalo RMPA fails to meet       CRA's third exception.                                  Conclusion

The Buffalo RMPA is a rule for purposes of CRA because it       meets the definition of a rule under APA and no CRA exception       applies. Therefore, the Buffalo RMPA is subject to CRA's       requirement that it be submitted to Congress and the       Comptroller General before it can take effect.
