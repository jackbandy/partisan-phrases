The Economy


Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor having just listened  to my colleague, the senior Senator from New York, the minority leader,  talk about the upcoming efforts from the Republicans with regard to  America's economy.

And if you ask me what is the No. 1 goal of the legislation that is  being proposed, it is we want to prevent a $4 trillion tax increase  that will hit every working family in this country that the Democrats  are for.

So he goes on and on about different things in the bill. Let's get  down to the purpose of the bill, and it is to prevent a $4 trillion tax  increase that the Democrats support.
