Recognizing the Savannah Christmas Market


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate a great  seasonal tradition in our home state of Georgia: the Savannah Christmas  Market at Plant Riverside District.

This year, it was ranked as one of the top holiday markets in the  entire country by USA Today, drawing visitors from all over and  spotlighting the rich culture and community spirit of Savannah.

The market transforms historic River Street into a festive  destination filled with local vendors, holiday entertainment, seasonal  food and drink, and family-friendly activities. It brings together  residents and visitors alike and highlights the unique charm that makes  Savannah such a special place. This recognition not only celebrates the  creativity of our local artisans and businesses but also brings  positive economic impact to the region during the holiday season.

I encourage everyone to experience this celebrated market while it is  open, and I thank all who worked to make it one of the best in the  Nation.
