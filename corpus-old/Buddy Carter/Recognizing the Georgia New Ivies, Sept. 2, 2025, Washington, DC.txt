Recognizing the Georgia New Ivies


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two  esteemed universities in Georgia.

This year, Forbes Magazine introduced a list of 2025 ``New Ivy''  league schools.

The list highlights 10 public and 10 private institutions across the  country that are at the Ivy-League-level of prestige.

Because of their academic rigor, competitive admissions, and strong  career outcomes, Georgia Tech University and Emory University stood  out.

Georgia Tech is renowned for its innovation and return on investment.

Their recent graduate career placement rates consistently hover above  90 percent, which is an impressive figure.

Emory has earned praise for its research programs and global health  initiatives, with a history of groundbreaking medical discoveries.

One of these discoveries includes the first successful bone marrow  transplant in a human patient.

The recognition cements both schools as academic powerhouses--and  proves Georgia continues to rise as a destination for elite higher  education.

We should all be proud of both universities for this tremendous  accomplishment.
