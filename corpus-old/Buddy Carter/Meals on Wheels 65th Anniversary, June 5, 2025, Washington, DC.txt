Meals on Wheels 65th Anniversary


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  65th anniversary of the Meals on Wheels program led by Senior Citizens,  Inc. in Savannah, Georgia.

For 65 years, this program has provided thousands of nutritious meals  and vital daily contact with elderly, homebound adults.

This year, to celebrate the milestone, Senior Citizens, Inc.  partnered with local chefs, including James Beard Award winner Chef  Bailey. Chef Bailey assisted in crafting special gourmet meals as a  tribute to the people they serve.

Meals on Wheels delivers care, compassion, and peace of mind to  families in Savannah and beyond. The partnership reflects the power of  community engagement and shows what is possible when local  organizations and volunteers work together to lift others.

I thank Senior Citizens, Inc., Meals on Wheels, and Chef Bailey for  their initiative and congratulate them on the anniversary of this most  important service.
