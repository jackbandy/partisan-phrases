Cordele Watermelon


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  Georgia town that has earned itself an unusual title, Cordele, Georgia.

Georgia's agricultural staples are widely known as peanuts, pecans,  and peaches; but Cordele has become a major producer of another crop:  Watermelon.

This central-Georgia town plays an impressive agricultural role  within the state, with a population of just under 10,000, it boasts a  massive contribution to the region's agricultural production of cotton,  peanuts, and oddly enough watermelon.

Southern Living magazine just named Cordele, Georgia as the  Watermelon Capital of the World, yes you heard that correctly.

This town produces a plethora of summertime fruit, supplying much of  the state and the Southeast region with a sweet, refreshing treat to  beat the heat.

Cordele also hosts the Watermelon Days Festival which invites  thousands of visitors each year.

Today, we congratulate the town of Cordele on being recognized for  another agricultural contribution of the state of Georgia, and the  title ``Watermelon Capital of the World''.
