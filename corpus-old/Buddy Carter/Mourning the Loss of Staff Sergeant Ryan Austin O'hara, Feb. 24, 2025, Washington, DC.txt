Mourning the Loss of Staff Sergeant Ryan Austin O'hara


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of  Staff Sergeant Ryan Austin O'Hara, who was unfortunately among the  three soldiers who passed away in the tragic helicopter accident in  Washington, D.C., on January 29.

Sergeant O'Hara was a native of Lilburn, Georgia, who began serving  in the Army in July of 2014 when he enlisted at the age of 18. He  served a tour in Afghanistan in 2017 and then was deployed at Hunter  Army Airfield in Savannah, Georgia. Most recently, he was serving at  Fort Belvoir in Virginia.

Sergeant O'Hara was frequently recognized for his hard work and  sacrifice during his time in the Army. He received accolades including:  the Army Commendation Medal of Valor, National Defense Service Medal,  Afghanistan Campaign Medal with campaign star, and Senior Aviation  Badge. He was a four-time recipient of the Army Achievement Medal and  three-time recipient of the National Defense Service Medal.

In addition to being remembered for his honorable service to our  Nation, Sergeant O'Hara will always be remembered for his dedication,  fearlessness, love for his family, and passion for flight and serving  others.

Sergeant O'Hara is survived by his parents, his wife, and his 1-year- old son.

I extend my deepest condolences to Sergeant Ryan O'Hara's family and  friends and all of those impacted by this tragic accident.
