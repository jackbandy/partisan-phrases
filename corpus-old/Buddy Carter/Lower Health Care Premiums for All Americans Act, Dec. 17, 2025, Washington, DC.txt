Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, which is the  right prescription to lower healthcare costs and provide American  citizens with more affordable coverage.

Nearly 15 years ago, the Democrats unaffordable care act broke our  healthcare system. They broke our healthcare system. Since its  inception, ObamaCare premiums have skyrocketed by over 220 percent. A  family of four now pays $10,000 more for coverage today than they did  before ObamaCare, and their deductibles have doubled, in part to offset  waste, fraud, and abuse that runs rampant throughout the program.

Rather than fix the problems of the unaffordable care act, Democrats  in Congress want to continue to send billions of taxpayer money  directly to giant insurance companies and leave families with thousands  of dollars in healthcare costs that they cannot afford.

The unaffordable care act is broken, and throwing more hard-earned  taxpayer money after bad policy is not going to fix it. That is why we  must give power to the patient, not to the big insurance companies.

While Republicans are working to make life more affordable,  Democrats' prescription is to raise taxes. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my  colleagues to support the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans  Act.
