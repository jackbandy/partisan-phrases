Recognizing Ben Chapman


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  late Ben Chapman, who passed away on July 2, 2025.

Mr. Chapman was a well-known figure in Georgia's First Congressional  District, as he was a respected businessowner in Savannah, Vidalia, and  the Richmond Hill areas.

After graduating from the University of Georgia--go Dawgs--Mr.  Chapman founded the Richmond Hill Pharmacy with the motto: ``It's like  having a pharmacist in the family.''

Since then, his locally owned business has grown and moved locations  to expand its services to include diabetic and asthma care, blood  pressure monitoring, compounding, and a gift shop. The pharmacy is  known for its commitment to customer service and community focus.

Overall, Mr. Chapman is remembered for his generous spirit, wry sense  of humor, keen insight, and love of all things mechanical. In fact, one  of his favorite pastimes was tinkering on engines, along with pulling  weeds, long conversations on the front porch, kayaking, eating hearty  meals, and rescuing animals, like Charlie the dog and Gus the goose.

Mr. Chapman was also known for his work ethic and perseverance  despite the challenges faced as a polio survivor.

Today, I ask that we all take a moment to remember Ben Chapman and  his contributions to his local community.
