Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Lori  Frazier Bearden, a resident of Savannah, Georgia, who will serve as the  Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Employment and Training  Administration, ETA, at the United States Department of Labor.

Ms. Bearden earned her bachelor's degree in political science from  Columbus State University in Georgia and her master's degree in public  administration from Auburn University.

In this role, Ms. Bearden will assist Labor Secretary Lori Chavez- DeRemer in executing President Donald Trump's mission of prioritizing  American workers, veterans, and retirees.

She will work to advance the ETA's mission of contributing to the  more efficient functioning of the U.S. labor market by providing high- quality job training, employment, labor market information, and income  maintenance services, primarily through State and local workforce  development programs.

Ms. Bearden's dedication to public service and expertise in  navigating complex policy landscapes make her an asset to the Trump  administration.

I congratulate Ms. Bearden on this exciting achievement. We all look  forward to watching her succeed and wish her the best in her new role.
