Recognizing Hunter Thomas


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  heroic actions of Deputy Hunter Thomas of the Ware County Sheriff's  Office, who recently saved a life through his quick thinking and  decisive actions.

On January 29, Deputy Thomas responded to a severe accident on U.S.  1/Georgia 4 near mile marker 8. A semitruck had collided with a Ford F- 150, leaving several people injured.

Upon his arrival, Deputy Thomas found the semitruck driver severely  wounded, suffering from a deep bleeding cut on his elbow. Without  hesitation, he used his training and experience to apply a tourniquet,  effectively stopping the excessive blood loss. His immediate response  undoubtedly saved the driver's life.

Deputy Thomas' professionalism, dedication, and courage exemplify the  best of law enforcement. His actions not only protected a life that day  but also set a standard of excellence for his department and  colleagues.

He was rightfully honored with the lifesaving ribbon commendation bar  by Sheriff Carl James. We are beyond grateful for his bravery and  service to the Ware County community.
