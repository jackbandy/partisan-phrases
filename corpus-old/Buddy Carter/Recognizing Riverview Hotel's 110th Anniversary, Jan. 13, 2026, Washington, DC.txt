Recognizing Riverview Hotel's 110th Anniversary


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  110th  anniversary of the Riverview Hotel in St. Marys, Georgia, one of our  State's most cherished historic landmarks.

Built in 1916, the Riverview Hotel rests on the banks of the St.  Marys River and has welcomed travelers and locals for more than a  century. For generations, this hotel has offered hospitality and a  sense of belonging to visitors from near and far. It has welcomed  notable guests over the decades and stood as a testament to seaside  Georgia's heritage.

The spirit of Riverview reflects the heart of St. Marys. Its veranda  overlooking the river and its proximity to the ferry for Cumberland  Island connects visitors with the history and natural beauty of our  coastal region.

Today, we honor the Riverview Hotel for preserving tradition,  welcoming families and travelers, and contributing to the vibrant life  of southeast Georgia for 110 years.

Recognizing the 50th Anniversary of Gallery 209 in Savannah

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate Gallery 209, located at 209 East River Street in Savannah,  on celebrating 50 years at its historic location.

Founded in February 1975 by a group of Savannah artists, Gallery 209  has remained a member-driven space where artists come together to sell  their work, share resources, and support one another.

For five decades, it has been a cornerstone of Savannah's artistic  community and a vital part of River Street's identity. The gallery has  showcased the work of countless local artists, offering visitors  ceramics, fiber art, jewelry, paintings, photography, woodworking, and  other handcrafted pieces that reflect the creative spirit of our  region.

Artists like Randee Powell and Sharon Saseen speak to the sense of  family and shared purpose that defines Gallery 209.

As Savannah continues to grow, Gallery 209 stands as a reminder that  local art and culture remain essential to our community. I commend its  artists for sustaining this tradition and wish them continued success  for generations to come.                           Recognizing Swann Seiler

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Swann  Seiler, named the 2026 Woman of the Year by the United Way of the  Coastal Empire at the annual Women Who Rule event in Savannah, Georgia.

Ms. Seiler's leadership, service, and commitment to community reflect  the very best of civic engagement and personal dedication. A graduate  of the University of Georgia's Henry W. Grady School of Journalism, Ms.  Seiler built a distinguished career in corporate communications and  public affairs before retiring.

Ms. Seiler served Georgia Power and contributed her talents to  community boards and nonprofit organizations throughout the region. Ms.  Seiler's service includes leadership roles with cultural institutions,  historic preservation efforts, education foundations, and civic  organizations that strengthen families and neighborhoods across the  Coastal Empire. She has lifted up countless causes and encouraged  others to give back in meaningful ways.

The Women Who Rule campaign supports reliable transportation for  women and caregivers, helping them to get to work, school, and medical  appointments. Ms. Seiler's example inspires us to build stronger  communities through service. I congratulate Swann.                     Recognizing Special Agent Joe Cephus
