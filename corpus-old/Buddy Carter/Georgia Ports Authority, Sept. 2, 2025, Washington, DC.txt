Georgia Ports Authority


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Georgia  Ports Authority for their decades of servitude to Georgia, the United  States, and the entire world.

Georgia Ports authority operates the national gateway ports of  Savannah and Brunswick, allowing customers to compete and succeed in  global markets.

The Savannah Port is one of the most connected ports in the United  States with over thirty-five ships, forty-two double stack trains, and  sixteen thousand trucks moving in and out every week.

Consisting of more than six hundred and nine thousand jobs throughout  Georgia, they look towards the future with enriching intern and  community involvement programs that pave the way for future  generations.

In the picture next to me is one of Savannah's own, Ross Goodman, a  rising senior at the University of Georgia, who is interning at the  Savannah Port.

Over the next decade, Georgia Ports Authority will invest $4.5  billion in port and inland infrastructure to ensure that the state and  entire southeast region continue to have the most competitive ports in  the Nation.

Today, we honor Georgia Ports Authority for their unwavering effort  in providing a strong future for American commerce.
