Moment of Silence in Remembrance of Staff Sergeants Jose Duenez, Jr., Edvin F. Franco, Troy S. Knutson-Collins, and Private First Class Dante D. Taitano


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, we are gathered here today to  honor the lives of Staff Sergeants Jose Duenez, Jr., Edvin F. Franco,  Troy S. Knutson-Collins, and Private First Class Dante D. Taitano.

These men, these heroes, were part of the 3rd Infantry Division out  of Fort Stewart, Georgia, and members of the 1st Armored Brigade Combat  Team. Tragically, they were found deceased last week after a training  accident in Lithuania. Our hearts break for their families and all who  were lucky enough to know these brave men.

While none of these men were native to Georgia, they are forever part  of our States' and our Nation's story, thanks to their selfless and  courageous service. Their loved ones, the Fort Stewart community, and  all those impacted by this tragic loss of life have been in our  prayers, and we humbly request that they be in yours, as well.

Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that the House join us in observing a  moment of silence.
