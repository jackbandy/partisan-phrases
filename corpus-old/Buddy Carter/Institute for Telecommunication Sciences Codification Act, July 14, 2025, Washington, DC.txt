Institute for Telecommunication Sciences Codification Act


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1455, the ITS  Codification Act.

This legislation would codify the Institute for Telecommunication  Sciences, ITS, which plays a critical role in making spectrum available  for commercial use.

As we examine how Federal and commercial spectrum is allocated, it is  our job as Members to ensure the agencies tasked with managing spectrum  have the technical resources they need to be successful in their  missions.

ITS is an essential part of the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration, NTIA, and we must strengthen its statutory  authority to ensure it continues informing important spectrum policy  decisions.

This testing center will also play an important role in America's  ability to stay ahead of international competitors like China on  spectrum policy.

I am confident that ITS will continue to contribute to innovative  advancements that are crucial to our global competitiveness.

This bill also directs ITS to establish an initiative to support the  development of emergency communication and tracking technologies for  use in locating trapped individuals in confined spaces. This is an  important initiative that has the potential to protect and save  American lives.

Last Congress, this bill went through regular order and enjoyed  unanimous support on the House floor.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation.
