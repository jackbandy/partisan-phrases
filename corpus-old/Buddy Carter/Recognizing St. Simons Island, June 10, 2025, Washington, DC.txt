Recognizing St. Simons Island


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize St.  Simons Island's designation by U.S. News and World Report as one of the  best underrated travel destinations in the U.S.

They evaluated over 1,500 vacation destinations worldwide and ranked  them across numerous categories. St. Simons Island, the largest barrier  island on Georgia's Golden Isles, offers low-hanging Spanish moss,  salty air, and warm ocean water. It is home to pristine beaches, miles  of walking paths and trails, ice cream shops, and award-winning  restaurants. Despite this, St. Simons has still managed to keep a low  profile and is often overlooked by out-of-State beachgoers.

I am proud that St. Simons Island, my new home, is being recognized  for the stunning views and coastal relaxation it offers patrons.
