Frederica Academy Baseball Team


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  Frederica Academy baseball team who won the program's first-ever State  championship this season.

Since 1969, Frederica Academy has earned 76 State titles across all  its athletic programs, except for one. Their baseball program had  battled a history of ups and downs, not quite being able to finish the  drill, until now.

Fighting back from near elimination early in the playoffs, the St.  Simon's team overcame adversity to make their first State title series  since 2018. The boys swept their opponents from Pinewood Christian to  earn the GIAA Class 3A baseball State championship and made history for  their athletic program.

Under Head Coach Tim Orlosky, these young men exhibited persistence,  sportsmanship, and humility in their title run.

Mr. Speaker, join me in congratulating this team of incredible young  men and everybody who supported them in their journey to achieve  history for Frederica Academy.
