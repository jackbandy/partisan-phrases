Recognizing Dr. William Clark


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr.  William Clark, who is stepping down as chair of the Okefenokee Swamp  Park Board of Trustees after 15 years of hard work and dedicated  service.

Since 2010, Dr. Clark has advanced the mission of Okefenokee Swamp  Park, promoting a community connection with nature and preserving its  ecological health through stewardship, education, and outdoor  recreation.

While serving as chairman, Dr. Clark was instrumental in expanding  the park's mission to promote tourism and education. Under his  leadership, the park strengthened partnerships with organizations such  as the University of Georgia, focusing on conservation efforts to  maintain the swamp's native alligator population.

He was instrumental in expanding ecotourism by acquiring the visitor  concession at the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge headquarters and  the nomination by the U.S. Department of the Interior as the next  American World Heritage site.

After his successful tenure in this role, Dr. Clark has expressed  enthusiasm for this transition and remains confident in the ongoing  excellence of the Okefenokee Swamp Park board.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Clark for his commitment to improving the  Okefenokee Swamp Park and I wish him the best in his future endeavors.
