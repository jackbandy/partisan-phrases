America's Foresters Are in Need of Help


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for  America's foresters, who are in desperate need of our help. Under our  current tax code, forest owners do not receive tax relief from the loss  of their timber crops.

We are in the heart of hurricane season, and countless foresters are  left wondering if the next storm will be the one that shuts down their  family farm for good. This is unacceptable.

My bill, the Disaster Reforestation Act, offers a simple fix to an  issue that has harmed American foresters for far too long. Under the  Disaster Reforestation Act, foresters will be able to deduct the true  value of timber destroyed by natural disasters from their taxes. This  would help provide immediate relief for landowners affected by  wildfires, hurricanes, or other disasters.

This bill will save family forestry in America, and I urge my  colleagues to cosponsor this bipartisan, bicameral piece of  legislation. I urge its immediate passage.
