Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution denouncing  the horrors of socialism, and there are horrors.

Socialism has no place in our country. Unfortunately, so-called woke  liberals in New York City don't seem to understand that socialism is  nothing more than mutually assured poverty and recently voted to bring  these failed policies to their own once-great city.

While I am saddened that New Yorkers will be willing victims of  Zohran Mamdani's destined-to-fail socialist policies, I have filed  legislation ensuring not one dime goes to fund his un-American agenda.  The rest of the country should not be forced to subsidize one mayor's  destructive actions.

Today's resolution builds on those efforts, making it clear that the  United States does not stand for, does not support, and does not  condone a system of government that makes people poorer, less free, and  less safe.

With this resolution, we reiterate our Nation's commitment to  remaining a free and prosperous society.
