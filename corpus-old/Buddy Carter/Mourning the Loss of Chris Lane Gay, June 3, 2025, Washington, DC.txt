Mourning the Loss of Chris Lane Gay


Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of  Chris Lane Gay of Pooler, Georgia.

Chris started his career in the grocery industry in Garden City  Piggly Wiggly, playing a key role in developing Red & White Food Stores  in Savannah. He owned Midtown Market on 37th Street, Claxton  Supermarket, and Food Fresh in Claxton, Georgia.

Beyond his profession, Chris was a member of the Claxton community,  serving on the Claxton-Evans County Chamber of Commerce board of  directors for over 25 years. He played an instrumental role in forming  the Chamber Junior Board, served on the Claxton Downtown Development  Authority and the Georgia Food Industry Association, and was a past  member of the Claxton Rotary.

It is clear that Chris would go above and beyond for the community he  cared so deeply about. He was the kind of supporter and cheerleader  everyone would be lucky to have.

Chris, a talented storyteller and comedian, made connections wherever  he went, creating valuable memories for his friends and loved ones.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in prayers for his family and all  privileged enough to know him and to love him.
