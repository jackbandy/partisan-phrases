Congratulating Mr. Travis Trejo on 8 Years of Service to Maryland's First Congressional District


Mr. HARRIS of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my  Legislative Director, Travis Trejo, on celebrating his eighth  anniversary of employment with my office. Travis is a dedicated staff  member who has repeatedly demonstrated his commitment to my legislative  goals. With loyalty as rare as Travis' on Capitol Hill, I am truly  grateful to have him as the leader of my legislative team.

Mr. Trejo has risen through the ranks of my office, beginning as  Staff Assistant to currently serving as my Legislative Director. He has  always taken on a supporting role, working tirelessly to ensure my  legislative agenda is met. He is a mentor to not only the legislative  team, but also to other members of my staff.

It is important that Representatives recognize outstanding staff such  as Mr. Trejo. Oftentimes, the work of these staffers goes unnoticed but  is nonetheless critical in maintaining the functions of our government.  Travis is a true patriot, and Maryland's First Congressional District  undoubtedly owes him a great debt of gratitude.

I thank Travis.
