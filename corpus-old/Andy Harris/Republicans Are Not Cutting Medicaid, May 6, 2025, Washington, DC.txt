Republicans Are Not Cutting Medicaid


Mr. HARRIS of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, a lot of times on this floor and  in the press you hear about how the Republicans somehow are cutting  Medicaid or slashing Medicaid, but the facts are that in the Republican  budget resolution, we increase Medicaid expenditures by at least 25  percent over the next 10 years.

Yes, we will fight fraud, waste, and abuse. We think the American  people agree that fraud, waste, and abuse robs the Medicaid system from  covering the people like the disabled, the elderly, pregnant women, and  children. It robs money from those programs and wastes it.

Even after we eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse, we have enough to  increase Medicaid expenditures by at least 25 percent over the next 10  years. Those are the facts. There is no cutting going on. There is no  slashing. There is elimination of fraud, waste, and abuse, and it is  about time that happened to the U.S. Government bureaucracy, not only  in Medicaid, but across the government.
