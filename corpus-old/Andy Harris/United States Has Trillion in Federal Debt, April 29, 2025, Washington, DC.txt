United States Has Trillion in Federal Debt


Mr. HARRIS of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, the United States has $36  trillion in Federal debt. Our debt-to-GDP ratio is greater than Greece  and Italy when they had their debt crisis, and we are incurring a  deficit of $2 trillion a year.

The most rapidly growing part of the Federal budget is Medicaid. You  will have people come to the floor and they will talk about Medicaid  cuts, but Mr. Speaker, only in Washington is a slight decrease in the  increase in a program called a cut or slashing because that is not the  way anybody's budget works at home, but that is the way it works in  Washington.

The Medicaid budget has increased 40 percent over the last 5 years  and is out of control. We have to control the growth in it to preserve  it for the future. A little known fact is that in many States,  providers are paid more to take care of a Medicaid patient than a  Medicare patient. That ought to scare every senior in this country when  Medicare is going to be crowded out by an out-of-control Medicaid  budget.
