Empowering Employer Child and Elder Care Solutions Act


Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, Pursuant to House Resolution 988, I call up  the bill (H.R. 2270) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to  exclude child and dependent care services and payments from the rate  used to compute overtime compensation, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. WALBERG.  2270.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Empowering  Employer Child and Elder Care Solutions Act, a bipartisan proposal that  meets working families where they are and strengthens our economy at  the same time.

Across this country, millions of Americans are doing two full-time  jobs at once. They are employees striving to be productive and  dependable at work, and they are caregivers--parents of young children,  sons and daughters caring for aging parents, or both. These  responsibilities do not disappear when the workday begins. They shape  whether a worker can show up on time, stay focused, or remain in the  workforce at all.

Along with many other affordability challenges, the increasing cost  of child and dependent care is a serious issue facing our country.  Parents leave jobs they want to keep. Caregivers turn down promotions  or reduce hours. Businesses lose skilled workers, productivity  declines, and the entire economy pays the price.

Many employers want to provide child and elder care for their  employees, but the law discourages them from  doing so by asserting that routinely provided childcare must be  included in an hourly employee's regular pay rates.

The Empowering Employer Child and Elder Care Solutions Act removes  this longstanding obstacle for employers wishing to provide these  highly valued accommodations to their workforce and aligns the  treatment of these pro-family benefits with other employer-provided  benefits.

For workers, employer-supported care can be the difference between  staying in the job or being forced out of the workforce. It reduces  stress, improves mental health, and allows parents and caregivers to  focus on their work, knowing their loved ones are safe and supported.

Supporting caregivers should not be a partisan issue. Every one of us  represents constituents who are struggling and juggling with the work  that they have and the care that they give.

Every district in every State has employers struggling to attract and  retain workers because care options are limited or unaffordable.

The Empowering Employer Child and Elder Care Solutions Act sends a  clear message: We value work. We value family. We understand that the  two are deeply connected.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, not  only because it is good policy but because it reflects the lived  reality of millions of Americans who are doing their very best every  day to care for their families and contribute to our economy.

Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I would make mention that for gym  memberships offered by an employer and other benefits, health insurance  benefits, they aren't calculated in overtime either.

This brings us together on those issues. In fact, I believe it makes  certain that there is more opportunity for small businesses especially  to have the ability to have dollars that could be put toward the  childcare.

He is also a member of the  Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.

My colleague on the other side of the aisle has said this bill is an  assault on working families. That could not be further from the truth.

H.R. 2270 is a narrowly tailored solution to the growing challenge  working families are facing when it comes to childcare. I fail to see,  again, how excluding the value of an employer-sponsored childcare  subsidy in the calculation of an employee's regular rate will result in  lower take-home pay as my colleagues have said on the other side.

The issue this legislation attempts to fix is that in many cases,  employers are currently unable to offer childcare to employees due to  the prohibitively high overtime cost.

H.R. 2270 rights that wrong by excluding child and dependent care  from regular rate calculations as has been done several times, as I  mentioned earlier, for other benefits and bonuses because Congress  rightly saw that, without exclusion, employers would not be able to do  more for their employees even as they want to.

This bill enhances the opportunity for the care that we need for  childcare as well as dependent care.

Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I know I spent my opening remarks discussing how the  Empowering Employer Child and Elder Care Solutions Act helps empower  working families. In closing, I would like to highlight how access to  affordable childcare benefits job creators and our Nation's economy.

For employers, the return on investment is well documented. Companies  that offer care solutions see lower turnover, reduced absenteeism, and  higher employer/employee engagement. In a competitive labor market, the  ability to offer these benefits is vital to attracting and retaining  talent and ensuring American businesses remain competitive at home and  abroad.

For our economy, the stakes could not be higher. Labor force  participation, particularly among women, continues to be constrained by  caregiving responsibilities. When caregivers are sidelined, we lose  talent, experience, and economic growth potential. This bill helps  remove one of the biggest barriers to keeping willing workers on the  sidelines and strengthens our overall economic resilience.

This legislation also recognizes that caregiving does not end with  childhood. As our population ages, more workers are caring for elderly  parents or relatives. Eldercare challenges can be just as disruptive  and unpredictable as childcare needs, and yet they are often overlooked  in policy decisions.

This bill addresses both, reflecting the real-life responsibilities  families face. This is a smart use of policy to align incentives with  outcomes we all support: stronger families, a more resilient workforce,  and a healthier economy. Let's give employers the tools to help give  workers the support they need and move our country forward.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Messmer for bringing this bill  before us. I encourage my colleagues to support it, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
