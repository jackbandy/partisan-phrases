50th Anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act


Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the  50th anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or  IDEA.

We all know a strong education can unlock a lifetime of  possibilities. Yet for students with disabilities, sometimes even going  to school can be challenging. Thankfully, IDEA changed all of that.

At its core, IDEA is about providing a tailored education that meets  a student's unique needs. As chairman of the Education and Workforce  Committee, I am committed to expanding strong, personalized educational  opportunities so every student can succeed.

IDEA was an incredible first step in making education possible for  our Nation's students. As we look to the future, we must maintain and  remain steadfast in our commitment to making high-quality, tailored  education possible for every American student.

Here is to another 50 years of IDEA.
