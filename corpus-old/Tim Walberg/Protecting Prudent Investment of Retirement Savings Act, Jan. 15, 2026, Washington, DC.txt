Protecting Prudent Investment of Retirement Savings Act


Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 988, I call up  the bill (H.R. 2988) to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security  Act of 1974 to specify requirements concerning the consideration of  pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. WALBERG.  2988.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 2988, the  Protecting Prudent Investment of Retirement Savings Act, introduced by  Representative Rick Allen, chairman of the Subcommittee on Health,  Employment, Labor, and Pensions.

At its core, this legislation is about one simple principle:  Retirement savings should be managed to protect workers' futures and  not to advance political agendas.

Over the past several years, the Biden administration pushed a rule  that encouraged retirement plan fiduciaries to consider environmental,  social, and governance--ESG--factors, when making investment decisions.  That might sound harmless, but in practice, it shifts the focus away  from what retirement investing is supposed to be about: maximizing  returns and minimizing risk for workers and retirees.

Americans set aside money in their 401(k)'s and pension plans to  retire with dignity. They do it so that they can pay their bills, cover  medical costs, and support their families. They do not invest their  hard-earned savings so that Federal bureaucrats can push ideological  priorities.

That is exactly the concern here. ESG investing has become a tool for  advancing a broader political agenda. Instead of asking: Is this the  best investment for the worker, the ESG framework often asks: Does this  investment align with certain social or environmental goals?

Those goals are not what ERISA was created to promote. ERISA, the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act, was established to ensure that  fiduciaries act in the best interests of plan participants. It requires  loyalty, prudence, and a clear focus on financial outcomes that workers  rely on.

Mr. Speaker, the problem with the Biden-Harris rule is that it  created permission and, in many cases, pressure for fiduciaries to  prioritize ESG factors over the economic interests of participants.  When that happens, retirement security is placed at risk.

ESG funds are often more costly and less transparent. In many cases,  they underperform compared to traditional options. That means that  workers may be paying more and getting less--less growth, less  stability, and less certainty about their future.

This is not a theoretical issue. When a fiduciary chooses investments  based on nonfinancial criteria, the person paying the price is not the  bureaucrat in Washington or the corporate executive on a conference  call. The person paying the price is the worker who depends on that  retirement account to survive. That is why H.R. 2988 is needed.

Mr. Speaker, this bill restores the proper purpose of retirement  investing: financial security. It makes clear that retirement plan  decisions must be made based solely on economic factors--things like  risk, return, liquidity, and diversification. It also addresses how  fiduciaries use shareholder rights, like proxy voting.

Under current practices, some fiduciaries use the shares held in  retirement plans to push political policies through proxy votes,  whether or not those policies benefit the workers whose money is at  stake.

H.R. 2988 stops that. It makes clear that exercising shareholder  rights, including proxy votes, must be done in the economic interests  of plan participants, not to advance radical political initiatives, not  to appease advocacy groups, and not to satisfy trends in the corporate  boardrooms.

In addition, the bill strengthens fairness and nondiscrimination in  the selection of service providers. It states clearly that race, color,  religion, sex, or national origin may not be considered when selecting  fiduciaries, counsel, employees, or service providers for ERISA plans.  Retirement plan service providers should be chosen on performance and  price, not on ideology or race-based preference.

Finally, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2988 increases transparency for workers.  It includes a notice requirement for defined contribution plans that  explains the difference between selecting investments chosen by ERISA  fiduciaries and selecting investments through a brokerage window.

Why does that matter? It matters because many workers do not realize  that when they move money into a brokerage window, they may be stepping  outside the protections provided by plan fiduciaries. This bill ensures  workers are informed and can make decisions with clarity. In short,  H.R. 2988 is a course correction. It protects retirees from financial  experimentation. It protects workers from political interference, and  it reinforces the idea that retirement plans exist for one reason: to  help Americans retire with stability and security.

H.R. 2988 codifies the principles in the Trump Department of Labor's  2020 rule on retirement plan ESG investing.

Under the bill, as with the 2020 Trump rule, if a fiduciary finds  that an ESG factor is a financial factor, then that factor can be  considered when investing and exercising shareholder rights.

Nothing in H.R. 2988 prevents a fiduciary from appropriately  considering any material risk of an investment. Like the 2020 Trump  rule, H.R. 2988 recognizes that ESG factors can present an economic  risk or opportunity, which qualified investment professionals would  appropriately treat as material economic considerations under generally  accepted investment principles.

H.R. 2988 neutrally applies these principles to all investment  decisions.

To suggest this bill bars a fiduciary from appropriately considering  any factor that may be material to investment is blatantly false.  Unlike the Biden-Harris rule, this legislation ensures neutrality and  prudent decisionmaking by fiduciaries.

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made many claims  about the supposed advantages of ESG investing.

Allow me to set the record straight. ESG funds have underperformed  for years. According to Morningstar, ESG funds lagged the U.S. Market  Index and the S&P 500 in 2023 and 2024. To make matters worse, ESG  products charge higher fees to participants than traditional investment  funds, which can significantly limit the growth of participants'  retirement savings over time.

Finally, according to researchers at George Mason University, ESG  funds expose workers and retirees to additional investment risk that  traditional investments typically do not face. Increased costs,  increased risk, and lackluster returns make for a bad cocktail.

Participants and beneficiaries of employer-sponsored retirement plans  rely on the expertise of fiduciaries, who are required by law to act  solely in the financial interests of participants. Weakening that  expectation to advance partisan ideological objectives is wrong and  hurts the safety and stability of Americans.

Finally, Mr. Speaker, in response to my friends on the other side,  many Democrats want to make race and sex the most important factors in  choosing ERISA retirement plan service providers. In so doing, they are  advocating for blatant race and sex discrimination, which we should all  strongly oppose.

Discrimination is never justified, and the use of quotas is  inherently discriminatory. ERISA plan service providers must be  selected using a prudent and nondiscriminatory process. That is what  H.R. 2988 requires.

Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, we are getting to a point, I think, that  the old adage that everything has been said, just not everyone has said  it yet. But with fear of offending that specific adage, I must  respectfully, again, address the fact of the misconception that is  being put forward about the Biden ESG rule as being neutral. That was,  is, and always will be patently false.

The Biden-Harris ESG rule was explicitly intended to advance the  left's radical climate and social agenda that harms Americans'  retirement and long-term financial well-being. Even though the debate  can be made about ESG issues, that is not what we want to see taking  place for the best benefit of retirees.

This legislation is needed to combat the Biden rule which was issued  in response to not one but two executive orders on climate change. The  Biden Labor Department expressly stated that the intended effect of the  rule is to loosen restrictions on fiduciaries and encourage them to  consider ESG factors in their decisionmaking; to encourage them, not  simply allow it, but to encourage them.

The Biden Labor Department's explanation of the rule lists ESG  factors that it believes are relevant to investment performance,  including impacts to climate change, corporate board composition, and  workplace diversity and inclusion.

H.R. 2988 is essential to restore the neutrality of financial factor- only evaluation when investing to protect America's retirement savers.

Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Let me close with this: H.R. 2988 is about keeping retirement  investing focused on what matters--protecting workers and retirees.

The Biden-Harris ESG rule encouraged fiduciaries to consider  political and ideological factors in retirement plans, even when that  could increase risk and reduce returns. That is unacceptable.

Representative Rick Allen's bill restores the ERISA standard by  requiring that investment decisions be based only on economic factors.  It ensures proxy voting and shareholder rights are exercised solely in  the financial interest of plan participants, not to push radical  policies. It bans discrimination in selecting plan fiduciaries and  service providers based on race, religion, sex, or national origin. It  almost sounds American in its idea. It improves transparency by  requiring plans to explain the difference between fiduciary-selected  investments and brokerage windows.

This bill puts retirement savers first, and I urge my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on this bill.

Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
