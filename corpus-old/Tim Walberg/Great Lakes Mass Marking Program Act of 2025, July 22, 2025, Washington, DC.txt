Great Lakes Mass Marking Program Act of 2025


Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.

Mr. Speaker, to Michiganders, the Great Lakes are more than just a  natural resource. They are a source of pride for our State, a  cornerstone of our identity, and a home to our world-class fisheries.

From Lake Michigan to Lake Erie, generations of anglers have cast  their lines into these great waters, and families like mine have taken  their children and grandchildren to make their first catch, creating  meaningful and lasting memories.

These fisheries are also a lifeline for our local economy. Taken  together, the Great Lakes commercial, recreational, and Tribal  fisheries generate over $7 billion annually and support over 75,000  jobs.

That is why I am proud to join Representatives Debbie Dingell and  Bill Huizenga on the Great Lakes Mass Marking Program Act, which will  build on the success of the Great Lakes Mass Marking Program to  implement the large-scale marking of fish in all hatcheries.

In 2023, an angler from Sheboygan caught a 35-inch lake trout--I am  jealous--which was marked as part of the program. Its coded tag  revealed that the trout hatched in 1984 and was raised at the Iron  River National Fish Hatchery before being stocked on Sheboygan Reef in  1985.

Data like this allows us to better understand migratory patterns and  population changes. By expanding the program to all Great Lakes  hatcheries, we can improve fishing practices, increase efficiencies,  and save resources wherever possible.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Great Lakes Mass  Marking Program Act so that we can preserve our fisheries and be better  stewards of this great national treasure.
