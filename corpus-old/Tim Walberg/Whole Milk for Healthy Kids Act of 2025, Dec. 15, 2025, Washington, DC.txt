Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025


Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 222, the  Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025.

For nearly 80 years, the National School Lunch Program has provided  low-cost or free lunches to children each school day. We know that  healthy diets can improve student success both in and out of the  classroom. Whole milk is a nutrient-rich food, and its higher fat  content allows children to stay fuller longer.

Unfortunately, misconceptions about certain types of fat or calories  have prevented schools from offering whole milk as an option to our  children. The bill gives us a chance to ensure that children have  access to nutritional milk options they want to drink.

Some children struggle to consume enough of the right calories to  support healthy growth and stay energized throughout the entire school  day. For some, school meals may be the only meals they receive that  day.

This notion that whole milk consumption is linked to childhood  obesity is deeply flawed. In fact, studies suggest that higher cow's  milk-fat intake is associated with a lower risk of childhood obesity.  While it is important to limit fatty, sugary, and highly processed  foods, whole milk does not fit into this category. In fact, many  schoolchildren are at risk of dairy underconsumption, not  overconsumption.

Whole milk provides critical nutrition for growing minds. We need to  follow the science and pass the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act.
