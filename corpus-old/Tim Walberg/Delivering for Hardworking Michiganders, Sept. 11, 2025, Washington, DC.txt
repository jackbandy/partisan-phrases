Delivering for Hardworking Michiganders


Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, last month I traveled across Michigan's  Fifth District to visit hardworking Michiganders who are excited about  the benefits of the bill that will include working family tax cuts.

I heard from a farmer in Horton who is relieved that it will be  easier to pass his family farm to the next generation because this  historic legislation doubles the death tax exemption.

I spoke to a small business owner in Monroe who will now be able to  invest more in his operations and grow his family business due to the  progrowth policies.

I talked to a waitress in Cassopolis who called this legislation  life-changing because she will be able to pocket more of her hard- earned money thanks to no tax on tips and overtime.

As I travel across my district, it is clear that we are delivering  for hardworking Michiganders and ushering in a new era of prosperity,  and that is great.
