Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding.

Mr. Chairman, in November, the American people delivered a clear and  resolute mandate to this Congress: Rein in out-of-control spending.

For too long, bureaucrats in Washington recklessly spent Americans'  hard-earned tax dollars and drove up our national debt to nearly  catastrophic levels, hurting all Americans, especially the most  vulnerable.

For example, the Biden-Harris administration attempted to spend as  much as $1 trillion through his illegal and irresponsible student loan  bailouts. Virtually nothing was done to control the cost of Federal  student loan programs, meaning students will be able to take on even  more in student loan debt and drive up the burden on all Americans,  even those who never went to college or received a degree.

Why should we continue to spend Americans' tax dollars on a system  that is clearly not working?

Something must change, and Americans are sick and tired of this  wasteful spending.

With Republicans in control of the House, Senate, and White House, we  have a real opportunity to cut through the waste, fraud, abuse, and  falsehoods in Washington.

Reconciliation provides us with a chance to address Washington's  spending problem.

Under the new Trump administration, we can cut spending, deliver on  the mandate given to us by the American people, and put more money back  in Americans' pockets.

As I begin to yield back, I will await the false report on Medicaid  in Michigan.
