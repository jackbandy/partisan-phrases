Recognizing National Peo Week


Mrs. HOUCHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National PEO  Week, which starts May 18 and ends May 24, 2025.

National PEO Week will celebrate the important contributions of the  professional employer organization (PEO) industry, which provides  payroll, employee benefits, compliance assistance and HR services to  hundreds of thousands of small and mid-sized businesses that employ  more than 4.5 million people.

PEOs help small businesses improve productivity and profitability,  focus on their core mission and grow. Through a PEO, the employees of  small businesses gain access to important employee benefits such as:  401(k) plans; health, dental, life and other insurance; dependent care;  and other benefits they might not typically receive as employees of a  small company.

PEOs also take over the back-office tasks that consume time, energy  and resources, enabling small businesses working with a PEO to grow two  times faster, have employee turnover that is 12 percent lower and a  higher business survival rate.

I know the value that PEOs provide. Before coming to Congress, I  worked for a PEO, and I saw firsthand the positive impact they had on  small businesses in my home state of Indiana.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the PEO industry for all  they do to help our nation's small businesses, and their employees  prosper.
