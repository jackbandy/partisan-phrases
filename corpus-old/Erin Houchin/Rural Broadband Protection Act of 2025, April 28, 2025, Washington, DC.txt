Rural Broadband Protection Act of 2025


Mrs. HOUCHIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr. Bilirakis, for  his leadership on this important issue. I also thank my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle for their support.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud support of H.R. 2399, the Rural  Broadband Protection Act of 2025, a bill that I am proud to sponsor.

Across Indiana and throughout rural America, families, farmers,  students, and small business owners still struggle with slow or  unreliable internet access. It is not just inconvenient, it is a  barrier to opportunity, to education, to healthcare, and to economic  growth.

When Congress invests in rural broadband, we must ensure those  dollars are getting where they are intended and that providers that are  receiving those funds are capable of getting the job done.

That is exactly what the Rural Broadband Protection Act does. It puts  accountability and transparency in the grant review process by  requiring the Federal Communications Commission to vet applicants for  broadband funding based on experience, capability, and performance.

As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, this is a smart,  bipartisan, commonsense piece of legislation, and I know my  constituents back home agree.

That is why today I will be voting ``yes'' on the Rural Broadband  Protection Act, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.
