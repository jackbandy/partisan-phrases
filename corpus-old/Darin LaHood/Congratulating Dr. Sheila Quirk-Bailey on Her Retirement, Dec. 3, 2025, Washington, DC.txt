Congratulating Dr. Sheila Quirk-Bailey on Her Retirement


Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Dr. Sheila Quirk- Bailey, President of Illinois Central College, for her outstanding  leadership and over three decades of dedicated service to higher  education. Since becoming president in 2016, Dr. Quirk-Bailey has  guided Illinois Central College through a period of significant  progress focused on student success, equity, and workforce development.

Under her leadership, Illinois Central College achieved five  consecutive semesters of enrollment growth, improved graduation and  retention rates, and reduced developmental education placements by  sixty-six percent while maintaining strong student outcomes. Dr. Quirk- Bailey led the creation of nationally recognized workforce programs  including the Workforce Empowerment Initiative, the Information  Technology Workforce Accelerator, and the first prison education  program in the Nation funded by federal Pell grants. The Workforce  Empowerment Initiative alone has helped lift more than 1,200  individuals out of poverty, with participants seeing an average  increase of nearly thirty-three thousand dollars in yearly earnings.

Dr. Quirk-Bailey also laid a strong foundation for ICC's next decade  of growth. Through the College's strategic plan, she advanced a year- round eight-week scheduling process, expanded micro and stackable  credential pathways, supported the development of boot camps and  competency-based education models, and guided the implementation of a  new enterprise resource planning platform to modernize operations and  meet future workforce demands.

Central Illinois is fortunate to have had a leader whose vision,  professionalism, and dedication to expanding educational opportunity,  have strengthened our region for many years. Dr. Quirk-Bailey's  unwavering commitment to student success and workforce advancement is  truly inspiring, and her retirement marks the closure of a remarkable  career devoted to improving lives through education. I am honored to  recognize her for her extraordinary service and congratulate her on her  well-earned retirement. I wish Dr. Quirk-Bailey and her loved ones the  very best in the years ahead.
