Mr. BIGGS of Arizona. Madam Chair, Taiwan is a great friend of the  United States, and it is a unique friend to Arizona.

The CCP uses every tool it can, including maps, to undermine truth  and assert illegitimate claims over sovereign territory. Congress  should not fund anything that supports the CCP's disinformation  efforts, and now is the time for strategic clarity, with rising  bellicosity coming from the CCP.

We cannot allow authoritarian regimes to dictate how our government  communicates facts. If we truly stand for freedom, sovereignty, and  truth, then we must also stand with Taiwan. This is one way to do so.
