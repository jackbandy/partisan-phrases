Roe V. Wade Anniversary


Mr. BIGGS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the 43rd  anniversary of the devastating Roe v. Wade decision. For nearly 50  years, Roe distorted our Constitution and did great harm to our Nation.

The decision was not rooted in the text of the Constitution. Instead,  the Court invented a constitutional right grounded in a vague,  undefined concept of privacy that the Court itself struggled to  explain.

Roe silenced voters, sidelined legislatures, and eroded respect for  the judiciary by turning judges into policymakers. Worst of all, it  cost millions of innocent lives.

In overturning Roe, the Supreme Court rightly corrected a grave legal  error and returned authority to the States where it belongs. That  restoration of constitutional order was long overdue.

I also bid hello and welcome to my friends from the Center for  Arizona Policy who are in the gallery today.
