Mr. BIGGS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to  honor the life and legacy of my friend and colleague, Congressman Doug  LaMalfa.

As you know, Doug was a happy warrior who cared immensely about his  country, his State, and the people he served. A few years ago, he took  time out of his busy schedule to travel with me to Arizona to better  understand the border crisis and the serious impact it was having on my  State as well as his own. Doug was always willing to listen, learn, and  engage on the issues that matter most. He was the most curious man.

I thoroughly enjoyed working with him on a wide range of policies and  challenges that uniquely affect the West and the hardworking  communities we both represent.

Doug was a true friend. He will be deeply missed in this Congress and  beyond. My team and I continue to pray for Doug, his family, and for  all who loved him during this particularly difficult time.

May God bless Doug LaMalfa's memory and may he rest in peace.
