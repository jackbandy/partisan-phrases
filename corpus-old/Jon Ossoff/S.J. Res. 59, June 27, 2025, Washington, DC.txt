S.J. Res. 59


Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, on Saturday, June 21, 2025, at President  Trump's direction, U.S. forces struck certain nuclear facilities in  Iran. As I stated this week in the Intelligence Committee: Those  strikes having been taken, I certainly hope they were effective. Most  of the Congress is united in our conviction that Iran must not build or  acquire a nuclear weapon. An urgent unanswered question is whether the  administration's use of force meaningfully advanced that longstanding  foreign policy objective. Members of Congress are seeking further  information from the administration in order to determine whether these  strikes were effective.

Tonight, I voted to discharge S.J. Res. 59 from the Foreign Relations  Committee. Such discharge would require the Senate to debate whether  congressional authorization should be required for any further  offensive military action against Iran. Given the stakes for U.S.  national security, the safety of military servicemembers we represent,  and the security of our allies, Senators owe the American people that  debate, consistent with our constitutional role in the formation of  U.S. foreign policy.

The administration has argued that last Saturday's strikes were  within the President's inherent article II authorities as Commander in  Chief. That debate is not relevant to Senator Kaine's S.J. Res. 59,  which would pertain to future military action.

Indeed, the question for the Senate tonight was not whether the  President's use of force to date has been legal and constitutional or  whether the strikes themselves were necessary and effective. The  question was: Should the Senate robustly debate whether any future  offensive military action should require congressional approval? Given  the stakes for our national security  and our constituents who serve in the Armed Forces, I regret that  Senators refused to bring this measure to the floor for debate.
