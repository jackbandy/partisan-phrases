Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join my colleagues this  evening to honor a dear friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa. Being from  the great State of Idaho, the land of famous potatoes, I am the one the  good Congressman referred to as ``Mr. Potato Head.'' I had the  privilege of working with Doug on the pressing issues facing the West  and America's rural communities.

There are no adequate words to express my sorrow upon learning of his  passing, but his legacy and spirit lives on. My prayers are with his  wife, Jill, and the entire LaMalfa family during this time of  unimaginable grief.

Mr. Speaker, from Mr. Potato Head to that rice farmer from  California, here is my final: Way to go, Idaho. God bless.
