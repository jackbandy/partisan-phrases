Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, the Democrats rejecting a clean CR,  shutting the government down, creating all of the havoc, the pain and  suffering for our fellow Americans is so obviously disingenuous.

They never vote against clean CRs. For 4 years under Biden, you all  didn't reject one clean CR. Chuck Schumer in 44 years never rejected a  clean CR.

Mr. Speaker, what is it about? They say policy. They put forward a  proposal, Mr. Chairman. They said it is about healthcare, healthcare  for illegals. They repeal work requirements for able-bodied adults.  That is an 80/20 issue in this country. They put forward a spending  bill of $1.5 trillion. That is twice the discretionary budget.

Mr. Chairman, they are spending more money than we have ever spent  outside of COVID. That is their counterproposal. It is not only  disingenuous. It is unserious.

What is it about? It is about politics. It is about resisting and  fighting and undermining Donald Trump. Here is the deal: They are not  fighting and resisting Donald Trump. They are undermining the will of  the American people that gave Trump the Presidency.

Mr. ARRINGTON. They undermine the will of the people who  overwhelmingly elected President Trump and gave him the mandate of the  America First agenda. They are not resisting us. They are posturing and  placating the radical left. They are holding back what the American  people wanted and that was a new direction for this country.
