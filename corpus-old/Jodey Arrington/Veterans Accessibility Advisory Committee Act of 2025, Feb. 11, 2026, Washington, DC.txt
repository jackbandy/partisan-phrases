Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025


Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from Wisconsin for  yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, there is not a better example of political expediency  than my Democrat colleagues opposing a voter ID law on the grounds of  States' rights.

First, the Constitution is clear. Rules for running elections have  been delegated to the States. But in that same provision, the  Constitution says Congress may at any time alter the process. I  certainly think our Founding Fathers would support strengthening the  integrity of our elections.

Democrats know this, Mr. Speaker. They must think the American  people, though, have forgotten about their for the politicians act in  the 117th Congress, where they basically codified a COVID-era and  fraud-ridden election law. They included, ironically, prohibiting voter  ID essentially. It also included ballot harvesting, promoting mass  voting by mail, and taking taxpayer dollars to fund political  campaigns.

Let's be clear. Democrats believe Congress has the power to ban voter  ID but not the power to require it. This shouldn't be controversial.  Requiring proof of citizenship to register and a valid voter ID is as  common sense as it gets.

Mr. Speaker, American elections are for American citizens. I urge a  ``yes'' vote on the SAVE America Act.
