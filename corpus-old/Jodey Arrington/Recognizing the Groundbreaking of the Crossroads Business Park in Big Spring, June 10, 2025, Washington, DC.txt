Recognizing the Groundbreaking of the Crossroads Business Park in Big Spring, Texas


Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to hail from the Food, Fuel,  and Fiber Capital of the World, which powers, feeds, and clothes our  great Nation and beyond. Today, I am honored to celebrate an occasion  that represents the true embodiment of the spirit and unparalleled  ingenuity of West Texas--the groundbreaking of the Crossroads Business  Park in Big Spring, Texas.

This development is the first major business park in West Texas tied  to the Ports-to-Plains initiative, which will transform the I-27  corridor from Dumas to Laredo. The hundreds of acres of new office  space the Crossroads Business Park will create is a model of how Ports- to-Plains will fuel investment in West Texas and represents a major  boon for Big Spring, Howard County, and the entire region. This  business park offers a new hub for commercial opportunities and job  creation, and I am proud to recognize such a remarkable commitment to  our community.

This project is also thanks to the strong investment made by Howard  County, the City of Big Spring, the Big Spring Economic Development  Corporation, the Cross Ell Ranch Corporation, the Permian Basin  Regional Planning  Commission, and the Texas Department of Transportation and their  commitment to making this vision a reality. On behalf of the 19th  Congressional District of Texas, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you  to all involved in this project for their dedication to our community.  God bless, and go West Texas.
