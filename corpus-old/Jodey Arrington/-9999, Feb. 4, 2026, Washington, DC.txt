Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true west Texas  giant and American hero, Mr. J.L. Stevens of Big Spring, USA, a World  War II veteran who just turned 100 years old this past week. He is a  living monument to the grit, courage, quiet humility, and service that  define both west Texas and America's Greatest Generation.

In 1943, at just 17 years old, Mr. Speaker, this gentleman enlisted  in the United States Navy, serving as a gunner's mate aboard the USS  Hambleton, where he directly engaged the enemy on D-day while  supporting the Allied invasion of Normandy. Despite suffering combat  injuries in Europe, Mr. Stevens continued his service, which concluded  in 1945 in the Pacific theater, where he personally witnessed the  signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender in Tokyo Harbor,  bringing World War II to its official end.

After the war, Mr. Stevens returned to his home in west Texas, where  he worked as a carpenter, helping to build the firehouse there in Big  Spring and the city's original VA hospital.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. J.L. Stevens represents the very best of west Texas  in his heroic service to our country and a lifetime of hard work,  faith, and devotion to his family, his community, and this great  country of ours. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing him a happy  100th birthday and thanking him for a legacy of service that will long  endure.

Mr. Stevens, here is to many more. God bless you, and God bless  America.
