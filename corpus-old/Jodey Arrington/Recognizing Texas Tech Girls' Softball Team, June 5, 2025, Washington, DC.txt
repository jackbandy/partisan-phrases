Recognizing Texas Tech Girls' Softball Team


Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a group of  remarkable young women from the plains of West Texas who are making  history on the national stage, our Texas Tech Lady Raiders' softball  team.

These athletes have battled all season long, with an impressive  drive, determination, and an unmistakable West Texas will to win that  has taken them from the first Big 12 Championship in program history  and a chance this week to win the College World Series.

Coach Glasco and his Lady Raiders represent the best of West Texas  values, hardworking, humble, and pure class on and off the field.

All of West Texas and all of Red Raider Nation are cheering on the  Lady Raiders, our fearless champions, as they fight for the scarlet and  the black.

The Lady Raiders need to go out there tonight, all gas and no brakes,  and beat those Texas Longhorns and then turn around and beat them again  and bring that championship trophy home to Lubbock, Texas, where  it belongs.

Guns up and go West Texas.
