Reliable Power Act


Mr. ONDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3616, the Reliable  Power Act.

Mr. Speaker, if the Democrats cared one whit about affordability,  they would join me in that support. In Missouri's Third Congressional  District, families, farmers, and manufacturers rely on affordable,  dependable electricity. Our district is powered by a diverse mix  of nuclear, hydropower, natural gas, and coal. That diversity is a  strength, which is why Missouri consistently enjoys lower energy prices  than the rest of the Nation.

However, reliability is threatened when Washington policies force  premature plant closures and prioritize ideology over affordability.  The Reliable Power Act restores common sense. It ensures that grid  reliability is not sacrificed and that critical baseload generation is  protected when reliability is at risk.

This bill protects consumers from price hikes, safeguards American  manufacturing, and keeps power flowing in communities like mine.

Mr. Speaker, reliable power is not a luxury. It is essential.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3616.
