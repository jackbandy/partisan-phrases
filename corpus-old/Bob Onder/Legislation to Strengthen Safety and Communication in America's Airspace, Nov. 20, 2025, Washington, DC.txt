Legislation to Strengthen Safety and Communication in America's Airspace


Mr. ONDER. Mr. Speaker, I introduced today the House companion to  Senator Ted Cruz' ROTOR Act, legislation that I believe, as a pilot, is  essential to strengthening safety and communication in America's  airspace.

Earlier this year, the devastating collision between an American  Airlines flight and an Army Black Hawk helicopter claimed 67 innocent  lives. Among those on board was Asra Hussain, a neighbor of mine from  the St. Louis region.

Asra was a newlywed and a brilliant young professional whose life was  ended far too soon.

That disaster exposed troubling gaps in how Federal aircraft operate  in complex airspace.

The families who lost loved ones deserve answers, and the American  people deserve swift action to rebuild trust in the safety of our  skies.

The ROTOR Act closes loopholes that allow military aircraft to  disable location sharing during routine flights and requires aircraft  in high-traffic airspace to use modern tracking and location-sharing  technologies. This reform is backed by ATCs, pilots and, most  importantly, the families forever changed.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the ROTOR Act's timely  safety reforms.
