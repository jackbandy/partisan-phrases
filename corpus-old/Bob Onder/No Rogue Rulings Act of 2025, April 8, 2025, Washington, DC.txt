No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025


Mr. ONDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the No Rogue Rulings  Act.

Historically, district court rulings only applied to the parties  before the court, but over the past 15 years, district courts have  increasingly asserted that their rulings apply nationwide, interfering  with the legitimate Article II powers of the President of the United  States.

We are experiencing a constitutional crisis, a judicial coup d'etat.  In February alone, district judges issued more nationwide injunctions  against President Trump than against Bush, Obama, and Biden during  their entire administrations.

District judges from Democratic jurisdictions are preventing the  President from fulfilling his duty to keep us safe.

Last night, the Supreme Court called out judge shopping and reversed  an order issued by a Democrat-appointed D.C. judge that blocked the  Trump administration from removing violent Venezuelan gang members from  our country. The Supreme Court said that this case should never have  been brought in D.C. but rather in Texas where the individuals can file  individual petitions challenging their individual cases.

The Supreme Court can and should rein in these rogue courts. In the  meantime, the No Rogue Rulings Act rebalances the separation of powers  as the Founders intended.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this critical  legislation.
