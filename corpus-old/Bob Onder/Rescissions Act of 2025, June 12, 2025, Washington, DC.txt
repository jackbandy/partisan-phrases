Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. ONDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4 to codify  President Trump's DOGE tax cuts.

Americans have been awash in unsustainable debt and waste, and  Americans have known it long before DOGE began its work. What many  didn't realize is just how bad the problem is: $14 million in cash  vouchers for illegals at the southern border, $3.3 million for being  LGBTQ in the Caribbean, $47,000 for a transgender opera in Colombia,  and $1.5 million to promote LGBTQ employment in Serbia, not to mention  the hundreds of millions wasted on the politically biased government  media known as NPR.

Enough is enough. We must rein in Washington's reckless spending and  hold bureaucrats accountable.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me and put Americans and  fiscal sanity first in what I hope will be the first of many rescission  bills.
