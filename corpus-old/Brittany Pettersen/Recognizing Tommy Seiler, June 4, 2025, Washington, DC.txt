Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tommy Seiler  for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

Tommy has overcome many challenges along his journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Tommy, develop crucial skills and a  work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award  is a testament to Tommy's hard work, determination, and perseverance at  Three Creeks K-8 and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and  promising future.

It is my honor to congratulate Tommy Seiler on achieving the Arvada  Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
