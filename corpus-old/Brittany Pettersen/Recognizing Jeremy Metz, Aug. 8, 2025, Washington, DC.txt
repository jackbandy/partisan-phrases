Recognizing Jeremy Metz


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jeremy Metz for  his promotion to Chief of the West Metro Fire Protection District.

Deputy Chief Jeremy Metz has served the West Metro Fire Protection  District for over 27 years. In his previous roles, Jeremy oversaw  emergency medical services, administration, special teams operations,  and strategic planning for personal safety and benefit. He has over  three decades of on-the-ground experience in fire science and emergency  services administration. West Metro and all the Coloradans they serve  are lucky to have an incoming Chief with such an impressive and lengthy  record of public service.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to congratulate Jeremy Metz for his promotion to Chief  of the West Metro Fire Protection District. We thank him for his  continued commitment to the safety of our community.
