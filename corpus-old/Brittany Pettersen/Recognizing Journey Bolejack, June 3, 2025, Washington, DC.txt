Recognizing Journey Bolejack


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Journey  Bolejack for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for  Youth Award.

Journey has overcome many challenges along her journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Journey, develop crucial skills and a  work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award  is a testament to Journey's hard work, determination, and perseverance  at Wayne Carle Middle School and is clearly just the beginning of a  bright and promising future.

It is my honor to congratulate Journey Bolejack on achieving the  Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
