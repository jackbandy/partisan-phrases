Recognizing Mayor Bud Starker


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mayor William  ``Bud'' Starker for his years of public service and dedication to the  City of Wheat Ridge.

As a more than fifty year resident of Wheat Ridge, Mayor Starker has  long been a pillar of the community. As both a city councilor and a  mayor, Mayor Starker has guided the City with steady leadership,  including navigating the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19  pandemic and championing efforts to expand housing affordability in  Jefferson County and across the State of Colorado.

Beyond City Hall, Mayor Starker has promoted economic development  throughout the Denver Metro Area through his work in the private  sector. Through Starker Construction, he helped build more than 100  restaurants, including transforming an older property in his  neighborhood into West 29th Restaurant and Bar--a beloved local  gathering place that stands as a quintessential example of his  commitment to revitalizing our community.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it  is my honor to thank Mayor Bud Starker for his years of service and  wish him the best in all his future endeavors.
