Recognizing Red Rocks Elementary School


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Red Rocks  Elementary School on its 70th anniversary.

Public schools play a critical role in shaping our communities. For  over 70 years, the teachers, administrators, and support staff at Red  Rocks Elementary School have helped their students achieve academic  excellence by providing a rich education at their outdoor campus at the  foot of the Rocky Mountains. The staff at Red Rocks Elementary School  go above and beyond by focusing on lessons that integrate art,  technology, music, and the outdoors. This award-winning school has  provided excellent education to children in Colorado and produced  generations of creative and innovative leaders in our state.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to congratulate Red Rocks Elementary School on its 70th  anniversary and thank all the educators and dedicated individuals who  work there for their commitment to our community.
