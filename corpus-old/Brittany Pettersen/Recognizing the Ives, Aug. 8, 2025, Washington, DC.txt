Recognizing the Ives


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize The Ives in  Wheat Ridge, Colorado, for receiving an Eagle Award from Housing  Colorado.

The Ives is an affordable housing development owned by Foothills  Regional Housing Authority, dedicated to prioritizing the needs of its  residents. This complex offers reduced rent prices for its tenants  while also providing easy access to quality-of-life amenities such as  their community garden, BBQ area, and many nearby food choices and  transportation options. The Ives has added 50 units of affordable  housing to Jefferson County since its opening in June 2024, and their  peers in the affordable housing industry recognized the community  development team with Housing Colorado's Eagle Award.

At a time when housing costs continue to rise, The Ives keeps housing  prices down in Wheat Ridge without compromising on quality. We are  grateful for the community development team at Foothills Regional  Housing for making this a reality for families in Jefferson County.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to thank The Ives for its service to the Jefferson  County community.
