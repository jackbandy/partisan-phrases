Disastrous Republican Budget


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my newborn, Sam, who is  just 4 weeks old.

Unfortunately, I wasn't given the opportunity to vote remotely after  giving birth. Nevertheless, I wasn't going to let that stop me from  being here to represent my constituents and vote ``no'' on this  disastrous Republican budget proposal.

Republicans and Trump promised to lower costs on day one, and instead  their priorities have been focused on  ripping healthcare away from kids, seniors, moms, and others who need  it most. This is not going to save money.

It includes people like my mom who work for hourly wages but are  still unable to afford healthcare. When you don't have access to  healthcare, Mr. Speaker, you show up in the E.R. This is going to place  a huge burden on our hospitals and, unfortunately, we will have  skyrocketing costs. Hospitals will bear this burden.

It also slashes SNAP, taking food off the plates for seniors,  veterans, and kids all to fund tax breaks for billionaires like Elon  Musk while increasing our national deficit by trillions of dollars.

How can anyone show their face in their district after voting ``yes''  for this?
