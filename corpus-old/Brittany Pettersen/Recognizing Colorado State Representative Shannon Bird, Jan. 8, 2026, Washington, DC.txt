Recognizing Colorado State Representative Shannon Bird


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colorado State  Representative Shannon Bird for her public service.

Throughout her time in the legislature, Representative Bird has  worked tirelessly to fight for all individuals. She served on the Joint  Budget Committee for 6 years, serving as vice chair and later  chairwoman, ensuring that corporate loopholes were closed while still  protecting small businesses. Representative Bird has been a champion  for affordable housing, passing legislation to lower the cost of  housing and offer more Coloradans the ability to own a home.

Though Representative Bird and I held different positions during my  time in the State Legislature, we collaborated to cut through the red  tape surrounding professional licensing and keep Colorado one of the  best places to work. She is my colleague, my friend, a mother, and a  steadfast advocate for her community.

Representative Bird has been serving the Westminster community for  decades, starting as a city council member, serving as board chair of  the Five Star Education Foundation, and as citizen chair for a school  district's bond campaign. Representative Bird spent countless hours  volunteering in students' classrooms, which led to her co-founding the  Adams 12 Community Action Network, dedicated to empowering students by  providing equal learning opportunities at local schools.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it  is my honor to thank Representative Bird for her dedication to serving  her community. I wish Shannon and her family all the best on their next  endeavor.
