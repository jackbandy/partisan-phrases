Recognizing Isabella Garcia


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Isabella Garcia  for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

Isabella has overcome many challenges along her journey to success,  demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make  the most of their education, like Isabella, develop crucial skills and  a work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This  award is a testament to Isabella's hard work, determination, and  perseverance at Three Creeks K-8 and is clearly just the beginning of a  bright and promising future.

It is my honor to congratulate Isabella Garcia on achieving the  Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
