Recognizing Dr. Angela ``angie'' Paccione


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Angela  ``Angie'' Paccione for her service to constituents in Colorado as  Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Higher Education  (CDHE).

Dr. Paccione has been a lifelong public servant, working in education  for over 27 years before joining CDHE. Since her appointment to this  role in 2019, Dr. Paccione has worked to expand access to higher  education for students of all backgrounds. Dr. Paccione has helped  implement a variety of programs to increase access and affordability  for low-income students, including the FosterED and EmpowerED  scholarship programs for students who grew up in foster care and who  are experiencing homelessness. Furthermore, Dr. Paccione helped  implement the Colorado ReEngaged Initiative to allow thousands of  Coloradans who did not finish a four-year degree the opportunity to  earn an associate's degree. And under her leadership, Colorado was  ranked first in the Nation for educational attainment in 2022.

Throughout her tenure, Dr. Paccione has been a dedicated advocate,  working to expand opportunities and improve educational outcomes for  thousands of Colorado students. She has conducted robust outreach to  prospective students about educational opportunities and resources  offered by the state, including speaking with high school students and  families at a FAFSA resource fair held by my office at Bear Creek High  School in April of 2025.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it  is my honor to thank Dr. Paccione for her years of service and to wish  her all the best in her future endeavors.
