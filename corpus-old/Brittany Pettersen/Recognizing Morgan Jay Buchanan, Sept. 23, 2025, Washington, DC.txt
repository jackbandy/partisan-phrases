Recognizing Morgan Jay Buchanan


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Morgan Jay  Buchanan, who recently retired after nearly ten years as President of  the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), Local Union  68.

President Buchanan dedicated his life to service. He served honorably  for 17 years in the U.S. Army before enrolling in the Denver Joint  Electrical Apprenticeship program, and went on to become Vice President  of IBEW 68 and eventually President.

As a part of Local Union 68, he worked tirelessly to ensure his  fellow electricians had safe, rewarding careers. President Buchanan  embodies the qualities essential to being an effective leader. His  union brothers and sisters benefited from his hard work and commitment  to creating a better future for all, and his absence will be felt by  the community he served so well.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it  is my honor to thank President Buchanan for his hard work and  dedication to serving his country and his community.
