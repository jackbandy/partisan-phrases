Recognizing Chancellor Joe Garcia


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Chancellor  Joe Garcia on his retirement from the Colorado Community College System  (CCCS). Joe spent more than 35 years working in higher education and  leaves CCCS in a strong position for the future.

Joe is the former Lieutenant Governor and Executive Director of the  Colorado Department of Higher Education, becoming the first person in  our state's history to hold both roles at once. Joe was a strategic  advisor to then-Governor John Hickenlooper to increase the state's  investment in higher education and expand opportunities for students  from low-income backgrounds. Throughout his career, he has prioritized  access to education for students of all ages and backgrounds, fought  for college affordability, and invested in workforce development  efforts to meet the needs of our changing economy. Joe is a true public  servant, and generations of students will remember his dedication to  higher education long after his retirement.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to congratulate Joe Garcia and thank him for his  commitment to the people of Colorado.
