Recognizing Major General Laura Clellan


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Major General Laura  Clellan of Broomfield, Colorado, on the occasion of her retirement  following 36 years of service to the United States Army and the  Colorado National Guard.

Major General Clellan began her military career in 1989, when she was  commissioned as a Military Police Officer. Over the next three decades,  she would shape readiness and emergency response both at home and  abroad through five major operational deployments, including missions  in Honduras, Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm, Afghanistan  during Operation Enduring Freedom, Joint Task Force Panama, and the  Hungarian Stabilization Force. As a senior commander in the Colorado  National Guard, Major General Clellan led during some of the most  challenging times in our state's history. Whether responding to natural  disasters, public health crises, or civil unrest, she ensured that the  Guard remained a trusted force for stability and service in our  Colorado communities.

Major General Clellan's remarkable career has had a lasting impact  and has inspired generations of service members, particularly women  pursuing leadership roles in uniform. Her service reflects the very  best of our military.

In recognition of her outstanding contributions, Major General  Clellan has been awarded the Legion of Merit with Bronze Oak Leaf  Cluster, the Bronze Star Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal with two  Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Parachutist Badge.

On behalf of the people of Colorado and the United States Congress, I  extend profound gratitude to Major General Laura Clellan for her  remarkable service.
