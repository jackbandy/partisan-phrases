Recognizing Nathan Whittington


Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nathan  Whittington of Broomfield, Colorado for receiving the 2024 Statewide  Emergency Manager of the Year Award.

As the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office's Emergency Manager, Nathan  leads coordination and response plans during natural disasters and  other emergencies. He was instrumental in developing Jeffco's new  Emergency Operations Center. During the Quarry Fire in 2024, Nathan  managed the EOC and re-entry plans--ensuring all evacuees were able to  return home safely. Nathan's commitment to public service extends  beyond Jefferson County--he also deployed to Sarasota County, Florida  to provide critical support during Hurricane Milton.

Nathan has led the way in adapting innovative technology and  strategies that have strengthened our community's preparedness and  resilience. We are grateful for his leadership and commitment to  keeping our communities safe.

On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District,  it is my honor to thank Nathan Whittington for his service to the  Jefferson County community.
