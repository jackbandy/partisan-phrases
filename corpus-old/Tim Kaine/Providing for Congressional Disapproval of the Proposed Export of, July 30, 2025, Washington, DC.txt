Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Proposed Export of


Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I will only take 1 minute.

A little over a year ago, the Senate voted for $18 billion in defense  aid to Israel. On the Democratic side, the vote was 47 to 4. On the  Republican side, the vote was 22 to 27. Democrats support defense aid  to Israel.

This is not a vote to retract a single dollar of that $18 billion in  aid; it is a vote to say that defense aid to Israel, which Democrats  overwhelmingly supported, should be defensive in nature, not offensive  weapons that are likely to lead to unnecessary civilian suffering and  destabilization in the region.

I support defensive aid to Israel. I will support Senator Sanders'  resolutions to not allow the transfer of these offensive weapons.
