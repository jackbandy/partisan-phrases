H.R. 4


Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I oppose H.R. 4 and believe it reflects  profoundly misplaced priorities for America. Accordingly, it is my  intention to make the following motions to recommit the bill:

A motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on       Appropriations with instructions to report back to the Senate       with changes that include eliminating the rescission of       Migration and Refugee Assistance funds and International       Disaster Assistance funds, including such funds that support       activities of faith-based organizations or their local       partners.

A motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on       Appropriations with instructions to report back to the Senate       with changes that include eliminating the rescission of any       funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting that       supports pre-K educational programming.

A motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on       Appropriations with instructions to report back to the Senate       with changes that include eliminating the rescission of any       funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for any       broadcasts and media stations that disseminate information       during natural disasters and national emergencies.
