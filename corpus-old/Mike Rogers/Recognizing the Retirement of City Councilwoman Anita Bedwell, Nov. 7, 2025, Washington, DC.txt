Recognizing the Retirement of City Councilwoman Anita Bedwell


Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the  retirement of Anita Bedwell, a City Councilwoman for Rainbow City,  Alabama.

Anita was born in Rainbow City to Eugene and Loretta Wimpee on August  27, 1961, along with her sisters, Lisa Abernathy and Susie Carr. She  graduated from Southside High School in 1979, attended Gadsden State  Community College, and graduated from the University of Alabama at  Birmingham with a degree in Dental Hygiene.

After working as a dental hygienist for 15 years, Anita joined her  family's construction business and eventually started her own business,  Rainbow Pipe and Metal.

Councilwoman Bedwell has tirelessly served on the Rainbow City  Council for 17 years. She was first elected in 2008 and has served four  terms. As a member of the City Council, she  has been an integral part of growing Rainbow City into the fastest- growing city in Etowah County. Rainbow City would not be the thriving  community it is today without her leadership. Anita has served on the  Utilities Board since 2013 and served as the chairwoman in 2019.

Anita married Jeff Bedwell on October 22, 1983. They have one son,  Andrew (Chance), and two grandsons, Britton and Cotton Bedwell. A  devout Christian, she has been a member of Riddles Bend Baptist Church  since 1981 and has served as a children's Sunday School teacher. In her  free time, Anita enjoys volunteering for Renew our Rivers and Rainbow  City Clean Up Day, as well as traveling, boating, cattle farming, and  spending as much time as possible with friends and family.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Councilwoman Anita  Bedwell, and thanking her for her service to Rainbow City, Alabama.  Congratulations to Anita.
