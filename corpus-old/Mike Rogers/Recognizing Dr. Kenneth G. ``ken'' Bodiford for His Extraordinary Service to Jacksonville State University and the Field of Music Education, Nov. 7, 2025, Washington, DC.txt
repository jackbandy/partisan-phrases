Recognizing Dr. Kenneth G. ``ken'' Bodiford for His Extraordinary Service to Jacksonville State University and the Field of Music Education


Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and honor Dr.  Ken Bodiford. Dr. Bodiford served as Director of Bands at my alma  mater, Jacksonville State University. During his 32-year tenure, he  transformed the Marching Southerners into one of the most respected and  accomplished collegiate marching programs in the Nation.

Under Dr. Bodiford's leadership, the Marching Southerners expanded  from approximately 140 members to more than 500, becoming one of the  largest collegiate marching ensembles in the country. His vision and  commitment to excellence elevated the Southerners to national and  international acclaim, representing Jax State and the State of Alabama  on some of the world's most prestigious stages.

Throughout his tenure, Dr. Bodiford led the Southerners in  performances at the 80th Anniversary of D-Day in 2024, the World Peace  Parade in 2019, the Bands of America Grand National Championships in  2019 and 2002, the 75th Anniversary of Pearl Harbor in 2016, the London  New Year's Day Parade in 2012 and the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in  1995.

Dr. Bodiford served as Director of the Spirit of JSU Drum and Bugle  Corps from 2001 to 2007, guiding the ensemble to multiple Top 12  finishes at the Drum Corps International World Championships. He also  served as Director of the United States Army All-American Marching Band  from 2016 to 2017, leading some of the nation's most talented young  musicians in performances of the highest caliber.

His contributions to music education have been recognized nationally  through his election to Phi Beta Mu, the International Bandmasters  Fraternity, which honors exceptional leadership and lifelong dedication  to the advancement of band music. Beyond his professional achievements,  his greatest legacy lies in the generations of students, educators and  performers he has mentored.

Dr. Bodiford's career stands as a testament to the power of vision,  passion and leadership in shaping both institutions and lives. His  tireless dedication has brought great honor to Jax State, the Marching  Southerners and the State of Alabama.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Jax State fans and family, I ask my  colleagues to join me in recognizing and celebrating the extraordinary  career of Dr. Kenneth G. ``Ken'' Bodiford.
