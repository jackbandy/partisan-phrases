Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026


Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now  rise.

The motion was agreed to.

Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker having assumed the  chair, Mr. Ellzey, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on  the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 3838) to authorize appropriations for  fiscal year 2026 for military activities of the Department of Defense,  for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department  of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal  year, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.
