Disinterment of Remains of Fernando V. Cota From Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, Texas


Ms. ELFRETH. Mr. Speaker, I will start by thanking Chairman Rogers  and Ranking Member Smith for their leadership.

I came to Congress wanting to join the Armed Services Committee in  particular because it is one of the few committees that still works  together to collaborate and legislate.

We don't always agree on every position, as reflected in this year's  bill and even in this floor debate, but the final product before us  represents the bipartisan nature in which the committee is run, and the  wins within the NDAA are proof.

It represents the work that my friend on the other side of the aisle,  Representative Schmidt, and I collaboratively put into improving  availability and accessibility for healthcare for veterans in DOD  facilities, including the world-renowned Walter Reed National Military  Medical Center in my State of Maryland.

The bill also means that the United States Naval Academy and all  military academies will be better equipped to brace for the impacts of  extreme weather and sea level rise. I worked on that with  Representative Wittman.

The bill delivers a well-deserved pay increase for our servicemembers  and ensures DOD cannot arbitrarily RIF its employees.

This bill includes crucial support for our allies like Ukraine and  provides critical checks on this administration's power.

I spent most of this year, including yesterday, visiting every  military installation in Maryland, meeting with and listening to  servicemembers of all ranks. It helped inform my priorities, and today,  I am proud to stand before this Chamber requesting that my colleagues  support this bill.
