Safe Kits


Ms. ELFRETH. Madam Speaker, on March 13, the Department of Defense  issued new guidance: Military health clinics overseas would no longer  provide rape test kits to American civilian workers and contractors  serving alongside our servicemembers abroad. These are our intelligence  analysts, our teachers, our doctors, and our support staff performing  critical roles all in support of our national security. We broke a  fundamental promise with them, that when you serve your country in the  most dangerous of places, your country will have your back.

I have spent my time on this House floor urging for the reversal of  harmful cuts just like these, and I spend my time in committee  questioning Secretary Hegseth as to why this policy was ever changed in  the first place. Today, I am glad to report that 8 days after the  hearing with Secretary Hegseth, that policy has been reversed.

It is proof that when the general public leans in and engages their  government, and when Members of Congress amplify their voices, we can  make meaningful change.

I will continue to call out the cuts of this Trump administration  because the cost to all of us is far too great. There is too much at  risk when this administration blindly takes a sledgehammer to the  Federal Government and the services Americans deserve.

I urge my colleagues to follow this example.
