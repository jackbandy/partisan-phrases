Unlocking Our Domestic Lng Potential Act of 2025


Ms. ELFRETH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1949, the  Unlocking our Domestic LNG Potential Act.

Mr. Speaker, I asked for 2 minutes. I only need seven words: We  should not be fueling our adversaries.

This bill strips the Department of Energy's authority to provide  oversight on exports of liquefied natural gas to foreign adversaries  like China and Russia, which poses what should be an obvious and grave  threat to our national security.

Unfettered sale of LNG to countries like China and Russia would power  their data centers, AI systems, and cyber missions, all by using  American energy.

This legislation, importantly, is a departure from how we regulate  all other energy sources. Sources like oil and coal, we have laws that  impose certain restrictions on exports to foreign entities of concern,  like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.

Mr. Speaker, under this new bill, LNG would not be subject to this  policy, and I have to ask: Why?

If this bill is really about better supporting our allies in Europe  and the Indo-Pacific, I support that, but there are currently no  restrictions from literally fueling our adversaries. In fact, by  exporting LNG, we could be risking higher domestic natural gas prices,  meaning our constituents and our neighbors would face higher  electricity bills and pay more at the gas pump.

That is why I planned on introducing legislation requiring DOE to  certify that LNG exports to our foreign adversaries are actually in the  public interest and aligned with our Nation's national security needs.

We must close this current loophole exempting LNG from oversight and  affirm DOE's role in the process. The premise is simple. It is not and  should not be controversial or partisan. We should not be fueling our  adversaries.
