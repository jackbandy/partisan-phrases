Food Bank Cuts


Ms. ELFRETH. Mr. Speaker, 1.4 million meals have been lost at local  food banks across Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., because of  the shortsighted funding cuts to the Department of Agriculture.

That is 1.4 million times in the last few months alone when our  neighbors couldn't get a meal when they were in need. Maybe they opted  to stretch one meal into two or decided to go to bed hungry so that  they could afford rent.

Our food banks are there for our neighbors on their hardest days.  Today, they are raising the alarm as they see record-high demand  alongside very low unemployment.

Instead of solving this dire hunger problem, the Trump administration  is now slashing critical funds to USDA.

It is rare to have a hat trick in public policy: a program that helps  our small  farmers, supports our food banks, and gets healthy food into schools.  Yet, this administration is cutting the very funding that food banks  and local schools utilize to purchase food at farms, and they are  leaving our neighbors and kids with fewer healthy, affordable options.

Mr. Speaker, I cannot think of a more American program that serves  our communities, and that is why I will continue to fight for our food  banks and our neighbors.
