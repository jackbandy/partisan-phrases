Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026


Ms. ELFRETH. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.

Ms. ELFRETH. Madam Chair, House Natural Resources Committee Democrats  strongly oppose Biggs amendment No. 29, which seeks to weaken the  Department of Defense's work to preserve habitats crucial for military  readiness and recovering vulnerable species.

The DOD covers millions of acres, spanning a vast array of natural  habitats and providing that realistic backdrop for training and  testing. Healthy and well-managed natural ecosystems play an essential  role in maintaining the readiness of our military troops, an advantage  that is unique to the U.S. military.

The military has even used ESA-listed wildlife to add complexity to  training exercises, treating them as sensitive infrastructure to avoid  as they would for schools or hospitals in another environment.

This amendment not only erodes this longstanding work, but it also  doesn't reflect what the DOD actually needs. The DOD has not now or  ever before requested this language.

Ms. ELFRETH. Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).

Ms. ELFRETH. Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.

Ms. ELFRETH. Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Hawaii (Ms. Tokuda).

Ms. ELFRETH. Madam Chair, I will close by reiterating that the  Department of Defense has not now nor ever before requested this  language. Over 20 of my Republican colleagues recognize this very real  truth, having voted against this exact language and understanding that  responsible conservation and strong national defense go hand in hand.

Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.

Ms. ELFRETH. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
