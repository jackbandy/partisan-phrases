National School Counselor of the Year: Danielle Crankfield


Ms. ELFRETH. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise here today on behalf of  the 2026 National School Counselor of the Year, Ms. Danielle Crankfield  of Annapolis.

Ms. Crankfield of Crofton High School in Anne Arundel County is the  first Marylander to earn this national distinction for going above and  beyond and inspiring young minds.

When she first arrived at Crofton, she found that African American  and Hispanic students were underrepresented in advanced classes, so she  created a framework for teachers when making course recommendations and  worked from the ground up to better publicize high-level courses for  students.

Thanks to her efforts, the gaps in advanced coursework decreased and  now these advanced classes more closely reflect the composition and  diversity of our students.

As we all know, good teachers, good counselors, and good classes stay  with us for a lifetime. I would not be in Congress today if I did not  have my own Ms. Crankfield.

Mr. Speaker, closing disparities and exposing more students to new  ideas and opportunities sets them up for success in the years to come  and perhaps even a seat in this very Chamber.

Congratulations to Ms. Crankfield.
