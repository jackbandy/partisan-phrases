Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Colin ``Mac''  MacDonald, a community pillar and legendary broadcaster in Brainerd,  Minnesota.

For over 30 years, Mac has been the trusted voice of the Brainerd  Lakes Area. He began on the Power Loon in 1992, advanced to morning co- host in 1997, and for 25 years partnered with his friend Danny Wild-- until Danny's passing in 2025.

Since 1994, Mac called play-by-play for Brainerd Warriors sports,  covering over 2,000 games in football, basketball, hockey, baseball,  and more. In 2017, he was inducted into the Brainerd High School Hall  of Fame for his remarkable coverage.

Off the air, Colin served tirelessly--co-chairing United Way  campaigns, emceeing the Walk for Diabetes and Special Olympics Polar  Plunge, and coaching youth softball and baseball for over 15 years.

Mac delivered his final broadcast on 107.5 The Power Loon on January  31, 2026. I thank him for his dedication, leadership, and heart. The  Brainerd Lakes Area community is better because of Colin MacDonald.

I congratulate Mac on an extraordinary career.
