Great Lakes Fishery Research Reauthorization Act


Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2878) to reauthorize funding to monitor, assess, and research  the Great Lakes Basin, and for other purposes.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2878

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Fishery Research       Reauthorization Act''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF FUNDING TO MONITOR, ASSESS, AND                     RESEARCH GREAT LAKES BASIN.

Section 201(d) of title II of division P of the Further       Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (16 U.S.C. 941h(d)), is       amended by striking ``2025'' and inserting ``2030''.

Mr. STAUBER.  2878, the bill now under  consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2878, the Great Lakes Fishery  Research Reauthorization Act.

The Great Lakes Fishery Research Program is administered by the U.S.  Geological Survey, which works in concert with the Great Lakes Fishery  Commission to conduct research and collect data to support the  binational fisheries within the Great Lakes Basin.

This bill would continue the many tools that help manage and protect  these fisheries, which are integral to the region's economic and  ecological health. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, this bill supports effective fishery  management, which starts with accurate data. I thank Representatives  Quigley and Huizenga for their work on this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
