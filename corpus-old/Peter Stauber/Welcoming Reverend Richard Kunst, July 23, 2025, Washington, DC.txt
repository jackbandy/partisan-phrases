Welcoming Reverend Richard Kunst


Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to have my hometown  priest open up the House of Representatives this morning, Father  Richard Kunst.

Father Richard Kunst has been a priest in the diocese in and around  Duluth for 27 years. He is a faithful, faithful servant of our Lord,  Jesus Christ, as reflected by his homilies on a daily basis.

Not only is Father Richard Kunst a great friend to our family but to  the Catholic family in and around Duluth, Minnesota.

I thank him for traveling all this way from Duluth, Minnesota, to our  Nation's Capital to open up the House prayer this morning.

I am truly honored by his opening prayer.
