Recognizing the Garden Club of Alexandria's Centennial


Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary  of The Garden Club of Alexandria, which was founded in 1925 and  distinguished by a century of hands-on service, civic leadership, and  lasting contributions to our community.

For one hundred years, The Garden Club of Alexandria has been a  cornerstone of our community, dedicated to inspiring a love of  gardening, advancing civic beautification and championing environmental  stewardship.

Its members have transformed public spaces--such as the gardens at  the Ramsay House Visitor Center and Gadsby's Tavern in Alexandria--into  vibrant, welcoming places for all to enjoy. They have educated  generations on the importance of protecting our natural environment and  worked diligently to preserve historic gardens across Virginia,  including Mount Vernon and Green Spring in my district.

This centennial marks more than longevity; it also celebrates the  enduring impact of The Garden Club of Alexandria. Through their  tireless efforts and shared love of gardening, members have enriched  our community in countless ways. Their legacy of service exemplifies  the very best of civic involvement.

I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all past and present members  of The Garden Club of Alexandria and look forward to their continued  impact throughout our community.
