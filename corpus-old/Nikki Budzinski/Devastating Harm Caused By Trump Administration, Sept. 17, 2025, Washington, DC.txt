Devastating Harm Caused By Trump Administration


Ms. BUDZINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kaptur for  cohosting this Special Order hour alongside me today.

I rise today for my district, for our economy, for our workers, and  for our clean energy future. Last year, my district in central and  southern Illinois had investments through the Inflation Reduction Act  that would have been transformational.

Take the $32 million investment awarded to the Kraft Heinz facility  in Champaign. This was the single largest award among the 10 sites  approved under the Kraft Heinz $170 million grant from the Department  of Energy. These funds would have reduced emissions from this plant by  99 percent. Yet this administration chose to cancel this project, along  with countless others, simply because it did not fit their political  agenda.

This story isn't unique. Today, you will hear from other Members  whose districts received the same frustrating news. It is not just  canceling funds to help companies modernize and decarbonize. It is  canceling tax credits to help union workers find jobs and to help  working people keep the lights on.

The President's so-called big, beautiful bill isn't beautiful. It is  a big, ugly joke. The only thing this bill does is hand out tax breaks  to billionaires while making it harder for working people to get by.

As we know, the bill canceled tax credits designed to lower people's  energy bills, transform our Nation's clean energy economy, and create  thousands of good-paying union jobs.

The administration called these investments wasteful spending. I am  here to tell you that they are wrong. Good-paying union jobs are not a  waste. Building the clean energy infrastructure of tomorrow right here  in America is not a waste. Across the country, there were thousands of  clean energy projects planned, underway, or just finished that would  have benefited from the IRA incentives tied to good labor standards.

To get the full tax credit, these projects needed to meet wage and  apprenticeship requirements. This was a huge chance to raise pay and  improve job quality for clean energy workers nationwide. Estimates show  that without these tax credits, $522 billion in planned clean energy  investments are now at risk. More than $263 billion of this is wind,  solar, and energy storage facilities, while $110 billion of announced  clean energy manufacturing is at risk.

This will have direct implications for Illinois. For our State,  eliminating these tax credits means losing 21,000 potential jobs by  2030.

These tax credits are more than just financial incentives. They are  lifelines for working families and for working-class communities.  Without these tax credits, families' energy bills will go up around  $110 next year and over $400 per year in the next 5 years.

Yet, this administration has prioritized tax cuts for billionaires  over support for everyday Americans, leaving families struggling to  make ends meet in an increasingly difficult economy.

This is not just unfair. It is wrong. If this administration truly  cares about working people, now is the time to act. Now is the time to  invest in families, create jobs, and invest in a clean energy future.
