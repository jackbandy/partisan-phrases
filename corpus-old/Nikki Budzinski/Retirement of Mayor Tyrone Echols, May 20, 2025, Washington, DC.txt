Retirement of Mayor Tyrone Echols


Ms. BUDZINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Tyrone Echols  of Venice, Illinois, and to congratulate him on his retirement after  more than 40 years in office.

As a graduate of Madison High School and Southern Illinois  University, Mayor Echols is a true son of downstate Illinois. He has  dedicated his career to serving our community.

Before he was elected mayor, Mayor Echols worked as a city alderman,  a union steward for the International Union of Operating Engineers, and  a legislative aide to the State Representative Jim McPike. He also  proudly led as president of the Illinois chapter of the National  Conference of Black Mayors.

As mayor, he prioritized bringing new business opportunities to  Venice and making sure that his door was always open to constituents.

His dedication to public service is truly an inspiration, and I am  honored to call him my friend.

I thank Mayor Echols for all he has done for our community and  congratulate him on his retirement.
