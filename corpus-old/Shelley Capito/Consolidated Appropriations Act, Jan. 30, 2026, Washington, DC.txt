Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026


Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise to join my ranking member on the  subcommittee that we share leadership on. I do thank Senator Paul, but  I rise in opposition to his amendment. As she has stated, this  amendment would eliminate HHS funding provided in the bill--which the  Trump administration actually requested in their budget--that will  allow the Agency to drastically improve sponsor vetting for  unaccompanied children, ensuring that they are no longer released to  human traffickers.

The Biden administration spent 4 years creating this problem, and  while the Trump administration is making good progress in remediating  the damage, this funding is necessary to continue the work of improving  the safety and security of unaccompanied children. Thus, this funding  will help to reimburse States, like Texas and Florida, for the cost of  statutorily required assistance to certain legal refugees and to  support victims of trafficking and victims of torture.

I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.
