First of all, this couldn't come at a more inappropriate time. I  think my good friend knows that there is a very large delegation from  Saudi Arabia visiting Washington, DC, right now. They are a long, long- term ally of the United States going back almost 100 years. We have had  a long relationship with them.

Certainly, nothing I am saying here is to denigrate the murder of  Jamal Khashoggi. That happened. There is absolutely no question about  it. But nothing that--this resolution will do nothing to achieve  accountability for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi more than has already  accrued.

When Jamal Khashoggi was killed in 2019, President Trump and the  administration conducted a thorough investigation into his death and  determined that 17 Saudi nationals were responsible for Mr. Khashoggi's  death, and they were subsequently sanctioned.

In addition, the Saudis themselves took action. President Trump also  understands--and we should all understand--that the United States needs  stable and invested security partners in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia  has played an increasingly important role over the last 100 years and  an even more important role recently as we have had diplomacy, economic  growth, and especially regional security in the Middle East.

Justice and accountability for the past are important, but with a  thorough investigation complete and the responsible individuals held  accountable, we can look to a better and brighter future for the United  States-Saudi relationship.

With all of this in mind and the fact that, at this time and place,  this resolution is not in the best interest of the United States, I  object.
