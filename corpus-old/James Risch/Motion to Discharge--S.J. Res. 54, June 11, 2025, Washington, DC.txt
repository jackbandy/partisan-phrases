Motion to Discharge--S.J. Res. 54


Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to oppose the two  resolutions we are about to vote on. What they are is they have to do  with arms sales to Qatar and UAE.

These flawed resolutions aren't really about arms sales to our allies  in Qatar and UAE. If they were, the discussion would be about how Qatar  is one of our designated, major non-NATO allies, how it hosts the  largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, and how it is our 12th  largest foreign military sales customer. It would be about how the UAE  has fought alongside the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq, is a  participant in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and is working  against Iran and its terror proxies. The debate would mention that the  UAE was the first Arab state to join the Abraham Accords when it  normalized relations with Israel in 2020. The discussion would be about  how these proposed sales will support the national security objectives  of the United States by improving the security of two allies that  continue to be important forces for stability in the Middle East. We  would talk about how these agreements will lay the foundation for  investment, innovation, and good-paying U.S. jobs that will boost our  economy.

But, no, these joint resolutions do not conduct oversight or provide  congressional disapproval. Instead, they make arms sales to some of our  closest allies in the Middle East about partisan politics.

Mr. President, I yield back all time and request to proceed to the  vote.
