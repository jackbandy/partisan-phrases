Arms Sales Notification


Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is still available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the Record the notifications that have been  received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such  an annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign  Relations Committee, room SD-423.

Hon. Mike Johnson,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.

Enclosures.                            Transmittal No. 25-49       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as           amended

(i) Prospective Purchaser: Government of Singapore.

(ii) Total Estimated Value:

Major Defense Equipment * $0.

Other $353 million.

Total $353 million.

Funding Source: National Funds.

(iii) Description and Quantity or Quantities of Articles or       Services under Consideration for Purchase: Foreign Military       Sales (FMS) case SN-D-GFU was below congressional       notification threshold at $27 million ($0 in MDE) and       included U.S. government       and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support       services, and other related elements of logistics and program       support. The Government of Singapore has requested the case       be amended to include construction services at Ebbing Air       National Guard Base and other related elements of logistics       and program support. This amendment will cause the case to       exceed the notification threshold, and thus notification of       the entire program is required. The above notification       requirements are combined as follows:

Major Defense Equipment (MDE):

None.

Non-Major Defense Equipment:

Construction services at Ebbing Air National Guard Base,       including studies and surveys; transportation support; U.S.       government and contractor engineering, technical, and       logistics support services, and other related elements of       logistics and program support.

(iv) Military Department: Air Force (SN-D-GFU).

(v) Prior Related Cases, if any: None.

(vi) Sales Commission, Fee, etc., Paid, Offered, or Agreed       to be Paid: None known at this time.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology Contained in the Defense       Article or Defense Services Proposed to be Sold: None.

(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: October 31, 2025.

* As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export       Control Act.                             POLICY JUSTIFICATION      Singapore--Ebbing Air National Guard Base Construction Services

The Government of Singapore has requested to buy       construction services at Ebbing Air National Guard Base and       other related elements of logistics and program support that       will be added to a previously implemented case whose value       was under the congressional notification threshold. The       original Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case, valued at $27       million ($0 in MDE), included U.S. government and contractor       engineering, technical, and logistics support services, and       other related elements of logistics and program support. The       estimated total cost is $353 million.

This proposed sale will enhance the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a strategic partner that is an       important force for political stability and economic progress       in Asia.

The proposed sale will improve Singapore's capability to       maintain operational readiness and interoperability with U.S.       and coalition forces. Singapore will have no difficulty       absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.

The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.

There are no principal contractors associated with this       potential sale. At this time, the U.S. government is not       aware of any offset agreement proposed in connection with       this potential sale. Any offset agreement will be defined in       negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor.

Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. government or contractor       representatives to Singapore.

There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.
