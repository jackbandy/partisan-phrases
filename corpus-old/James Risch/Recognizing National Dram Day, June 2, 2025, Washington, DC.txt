Recognizing National Dram Day


Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, today, I rise to celebrate National DRAM  Day and recognize the historic invention of dynamic random access  memory, DRAM. Patented by Dr. Robert Dennard on June 4, 1968, DRAM  revolutionized computing and shaped the digital age.

Today, DRAM is an essential component of cutting-edge technologies,  such as artificial intelligence, and in everyday devices--from personal  computers to cell phones. This groundbreaking American invention  spurred innovation across industries, including defense and  manufacturing, strengthening our Nation's global leadership in advanced  technology. Furthermore, DRAM has led to the development of critical  devices that have improved Americans' access to technology, enhanced  our quality of life, and created millions of high-paying jobs,  including many in my home State of Idaho.

In the 57 years since this remarkable achievement, DRAM has become a  cornerstone of the U.S. economy. The semiconductor industry contributes  $246.4 billion to the Nation's GDP and employs over 300,000 people  across various roles, like chip design, electronic automation, and  manufacturing. DRAM is also a vital asset to America's national  security. Every fighter jet, missile defense system, and intelligence  operation depends upon the reliable, secure, domestically produced  memory technology inspired by Dr. Dennard's original invention.

As we celebrate National DRAM Day, we recognize the work of Dr.  Dennard as well as the engineers, manufacturers, and researchers who  continue to advance this critical technology. Their efforts have  enhanced our technology, fueled our economy, and bolstered national  security. I applaud their successes and commitment to advancing  America's leadership in technology.
