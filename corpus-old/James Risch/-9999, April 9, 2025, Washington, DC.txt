Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I have come here today in support of  President Trump's nominee for U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Gov. Mike  Huckabee, who was reported out of our Foreign Relations Committee  recently.

For years, the previous administration wrung its hands and withheld  American support for Israel in the wake of the horrendous, awful  October 7 terror attack by Hamas. Despite this, Israel had the courage  to confront Iran, Hamas, and its other proxies, and it has decimated  them.

Now, thanks to President Trump's negotiations and Israel's courage,  Iran is at its weakest point in decades and hostages are returning  home.

Israel is one of America's greatest allies, a bastion of freedom in  the Middle East, and our closest partner in countering Iran's  destabilizing efforts in the region.

To execute on President Trump's ironclad support of Israel, we  urgently need a qualified ambassador in the region. I have no doubt  Governor Huckabee is that person, and he will work alongside President  Trump and Secretary Rubio and our friends in Israel to bring peace to a  turbulent region and ensure both American and Israeli hostages are  brought home from the clutches of Hamas.

The other countries in the region, our Arab allies, our Arab friends,  are desperate to see peace in the region. They want it as badly as  anyone else does.

I urge all of my colleagues to support Governor Huckabee and to fill  this important national security position.
