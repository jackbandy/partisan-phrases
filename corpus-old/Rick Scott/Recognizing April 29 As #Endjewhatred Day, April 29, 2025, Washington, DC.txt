Recognizing April 29 As #Endjewhatred Day


Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize  #EndJewHatred Day and to affirm my unwavering support for the Jewish  community in Florida, across the United States, and around the world.  For millennia, the Jewish people have preserved their religious,  cultural, and ethnic identity in the face of persecution, enslavement,  genocide, discrimination, and unimaginable adversity. Since the arrival  of the first Jewish immigrants to America in 1654, Jewish Americans  have made extraordinary contributions to every facet of American life-- strengthening our culture, economy, and society.

This alarming trend has inspired a growing grassroots civil rights  movement, End Jew Hatred, dedicated to making antisemitism and Jew- hatred unacceptable in contemporary American society. This movement  empowers Jews to live openly and proudly, celebrating their heritage  without fear of discrimination or attack. On April 29, 2022, the first  official #EndJewHatred Day was recognized, marking a national  commitment to ending anti-Semitism and building a future free from  hatred and bigotry.

Today, I join in that commitment. We must stand firmly against anti- Semitism in all its forms, affirm the inherent dignity of every  individual, and ensure that the lessons of history are never forgotten.  Therefore, I am proud to recognize April 29 as #EndJewHatred Day, and I  call upon all Americans to condemn Jew-hatred, to speak out against  anti-Semitism, and to work toward a future of respect, security, and  freedom for the Jewish people.
