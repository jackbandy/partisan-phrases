Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Neguse), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave

Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, last night, the Rules Committee met and  reported out a rule providing for consideration of three measures.

The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3617, the Securing  America's Critical Minerals Supply Act, under a closed rule, with 1  hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, or their  designees, and provides for one motion to recommit.

The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 261, the Undersea  Cable Protection Act, under a closed rule, with 1 hour of debate  equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking minority  member of the Committee on Natural Resources, or their designees, and  provides for one motion to recommit.

The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 2189, the Law- Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act, under a closed rule, with 1  hour of debate equally divided among and controlled by the chair and  ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their  designees, and the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee  on Ways and Means or their designees, and provides for one motion to  recommit.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the  underlying legislation. The rule before us once again exposes a  fundamental divide in the House. Republicans are focused on protecting  American lives, American infrastructure, and American national  security. Democrats are focused on protecting bureaucracies, activist  pressure campaigns, and the broken systems they created.

For years, Democrats have governed by slogan instead of substance.  They talk about safety, but undermine law enforcement. They claim to  care about national security, but allow infrastructure critical to that  mission of security to decay. They give lipservice to the need to  reshore our supply chains, while time and again supporting policies and  legislation that ensure that America remains dependent on our foreign  adversaries.

Their opposition to the rule today undermines and underlines the  stark contrast between the left's words and their actions, which  threaten to undermine our country.

Mr. Speaker, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2189, the  Law-Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act. Every single day, law  enforcement officers are asked to make split-second decisions in  dangerous, unpredictable situations. In those moments, officers should  have access to every appropriate tool available to de-escalate  encounters, protect themselves, and save the public's lives.

Yet standing in their way is outdated Federal law. Under current  statute, less-than-lethal devices like tasers are still treated like  firearms. That classification no longer reflects modern technology,  modern training, or modern policing. It creates unnecessary barriers  for law enforcement agencies across this country.

These devices are designed to temporarily incapacitate an individual  without causing serious or permanent injury. They play a critical role  in real-world law enforcement encounters by giving officers a nonlethal  option to defuse potentially violent situations and protect both  officers and the public at large.

Because these de-escalation tools are misclassified under Federal  law, the consequences are real. Law enforcement agencies and  communities face higher costs, procurement delays, and unnecessary  regulatory hurdles, including taxes and rules written over 50 years ago  that were never intended to apply to modern, less-than-lethal  technology.

At a time when departments are investing in better training,  accountability, and modern technology to reduce fatal encounters,  access to less-than-lethal alternatives should be expanding, not  shrinking. Federal law should be keeping pace with innovation, not  trapping law enforcement in the past.

Mr. Speaker, the Law-Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act updates  this outdated framework and acknowledges a simple fact. Law enforcement  officers need access to better tools in order to do their job safely  and effectively.

The bill ensures less-than-lethal devices are treated for what they  are, which are tools in de-escalation, not firearms. It draws clear  lines, focuses on devices designed to incapacitate without causing  serious injury, and explicitly prevents any device that would be  converted into a lethal weapon from falling under the new definition.

Democrats will claim that this bill is dangerous. They always do. The  real danger is forcing our law enforcement officers into a false choice  between using deadly force or no force at all. If we are serious about  reducing violent encounters and saving lives, we should be focused on  giving officers more options to de-escalate situations when seconds  matter.

Mr. Speaker, the rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 261,  the Undersea Cable Protection Act of 2025. This bill is about  infrastructure most Americans will never see but every single one of us  rely on every single day. From sending an email to making a phone call  to moving money across the globe, undersea cables are the backbone of  the modern world.

In fact, undersea cables carry more than 95 percent of global  internet traffic. They support military communications. They move  trillions of dollars in financial transactions and keep the global  economy functioning.

Protecting this infrastructure is not just about speed or  convenience. It is about national security. Route diversity matters.  When too many cables are forced into the same landing areas,  vulnerabilities increase. Adversaries take notice.

Despite their importance, undersea cable projects face duplicative  and unnecessary regulatory hurdles. Even after projects receive all  required Federal and State approvals, agencies can still demand  additional authorizations, slowing installation, maintenance, and  repair work that is critical to keeping these systems secure.

We see this pattern far too often in Washington. Projects are  approved, but delays pile up anyway. Timelines slip. Responsibility  gets passed around. Bureaucracy grows, while real-world risks go  unaddressed.

We saw the same pattern play out in upstate New York. Micron is  making a historic investment in bringing advanced semiconductor  manufacturing back to the United States, creating thousands of good- paying jobs and strengthening domestic supply chains critical to our  national security.

Yet, even after clearing one of the most stringent State  environmental review processes in the country, the project is subjected  to duplicative Federal reviews that reached the same exact conclusions  again and again. Those delays were not about environmental risks. They  were bureaucratic duplication, years of lost time before construction  could even begin.

That is not environmental protection. It is regulatory paralysis. It  is  the same kind of post-approval delay and second-guessing that puts  critical projects, including our undersea cable installation,  maintenance, and repair, at risk.

At a time when adversaries are actively probing undersea  infrastructure, Washington should be focused on protection, resilience,  and readiness, not red tape.

That is exactly what the Undersea Cable Protection Act of 2025 does.  It prevents agencies from piling new permitting requirements onto  projects that have already been reviewed and approved. It allows  installation, maintenance, and repair to move forward without  unnecessary delay, while preserving coordination and oversight.

Nothing in this bill weakens environmental laws. Nothing strips  oversight and accountability. It simply says that once the government  has completed its review, it should not keep finding ways to slow down  critical security infrastructure.

If Democrats were serious about national security, we could pass this  on suspension. They would support protecting the infrastructure that  carries our communications, our commerce, and our defense information.  Instead, they will continue to defend a broken process that leaves  critical assets exposed and America more vulnerable than it should be.

Mr. Speaker, the rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 3617,  the Securing America's Critical Minerals Supply Act. Critical minerals  are essential to modern life. They are used in defense systems, energy  infrastructure, manufacturing, and the advanced technologies that power  our economy and keep this country secure. Without reliable access to  these materials, everything built on top of them becomes vulnerable.

Yet for years, Washington policies have discouraged domestic  production and pushed our supply chains overseas. The result was  predictable. The United States became dangerously dependent on foreign  sources for critical minerals, often controlled by adversarial nations  that do not share our interests or our values.

American jobs were lost and supply chains weakened. Foreign  governments gained leverage over materials our economy and national  defense rely on every single day. That is the damage this Congress is  now working to reverse.

Energy security has been a core national security concern before.  After the oil crises of the 1970s, Americans learned the hard way what  happens when adversaries control the resources our economy depends on.

Today, we face a similar threat not just in energy but across the  next generation of industries like artificial intelligence, advanced  manufacturing, and defense systems that all rely on critical minerals.

After decades of degrowth policies that drove energy production,  mining, and refining all overseas, our adversaries exploited those  vulnerabilities. The result is an economy that leaves American families  exposed to decisions made in places like Communist China.

We have already seen this play out. Communist China has taken steps  to restrict exports of key minerals including antimony, which is  essential to defense manufacturing for systems like radar. That is not  a theoretical risk. It is active leverage being used against the United  States today.

Under President Trump, the United States has begun to change course  by prioritizing domestic production, strengthening supply chain  security, and treating critical minerals as a strategic national  interest.

H.R. 3617, the Securing America's Critical Minerals Supply Act,  builds on that effort. It forces the Federal Government to take a hard  look at where America is vulnerable, improves coordination across  agencies, and ensures securing critical minerals is treated as a  priority, not as an afterthought.

The bill strengthens the Department of Energy's role in identifying  supply chain risks and supporting responsible domestic production,  refining, and processing, so America is not forced to rely on  adversaries for materials essential to our economy and to our defense.

Let's be clear about what this bill does not do. It does not  eliminate environmental review. It does not lower standards. It simply  says America should be able to responsibly produce what it needs here  at home instead of outsourcing our future to foreign powers.

Instead of trying to score political points, Democrats should support  efforts to close the supply chain vulnerabilities that Communist China  actively exploits to the detriment of the American people.

If Democrats were serious about supply chain security and national  defense, this is exactly the kind of bill that they would support.  Instead, they spent years defending policies that left America exposed.  Republicans are choosing strength, security, and self-reliance.  Democrats choose dependence and delay.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, my colleagues across the aisle would love to scapegoat  everything on the President's tariff authority. The question of  affordability, which they have all of a sudden gotten into their hands,  is rich given that they presided over the worst inflation spike in 40  years.

Under President Joe Biden, families paid more for everything, for  food, housing, transportation, and energy. It all exploded on their  watch when they ran three Houses of government.

Energy prices surged roughly 20 percent. In many parts of the  country, electricity rates rose 30 percent. Democrats didn't just miss  the problem. They caused it, and then they put their hands over their  face and pretended like everything was okay.

Those weren't abstract numbers. Those were kitchen table realities,  and they remain kitchen table realities for working families, who are  lectured by Democrats to be patient. Meanwhile, this transitory  inflation--their claim--they just spent trillions of dollars more and  inflamed the problem all the more.

The difference today could not be any clearer. Gas prices are coming  down. They are at their lowest level in 4 years. Real wages are rising  again. Regulatory costs are finally being rolled back after years of  Democrats using regulations as a weapon against affordability.

President Trump and congressional Republicans are cleaning up the  mess left behind, undoing the damage of the Biden economic policies,  restoring confidence, and rebuilding an economy that works for people  who actually earn a paycheck.

That brings us to the rule before us today. The three bills under  this rule all address affordability in the real world. They reduce  unnecessary delays that drive up costs. They protect the infrastructure  Americans rely on every single day. They support domestic production,  so families are not left paying more because Washington chose delay,  dependence, and dysfunction.

Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my friends on the other side of the  aisle that the Supreme Court heard arguments on November 5 on this very  issue of whether the Trump administration has the authority to impose  the tariffs under the debate right here. Our extension of the tolling  days is something Democrats did themselves back in the 116th and the  117th Congress.

Unlike when they did it, ours has a clear end date, sunsetting in a  matter of months, unlike the blanket prohibitions of COVID NEA  resolutions under Democratic rule.

This extension will allow the Supreme Court the time necessary to  provide a ruling on this extremely consequential issue. It is just  amazing to hear the arguments about affordability when they presided  over an era of government that exploded our national debt, exploded  prices, not to the tune of $1,000 but tens of thousands of dollars on  Americans across the board, and they still tried to convince people  that their policies had nothing to do with it.

That is why this House is in Republican hands, the U.S. Senate is in  Republican hands, and the White House is in Republican hands. That is  because it was part of the mandate given by the American people to  reset the global trade order and to renegotiate unfair trade deals that  have happened over decades. Both Republican and Democratic  administrations alike took advantage of the American worker, chased our  jobs overseas, and ruined our supply chains. All of those things  happened.

The tariffs have been an important tool that the President has been  able to use to create real trade deals, opening up markets for American  products. We have seen it firsthand. We have new trade deals around the  globe. America has come from a position of strength because of this  tool, not a position of weakness. We can't allow that weakness to  prevail.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2189 does not allow felons or violent criminals to  gain access to anything new. It does not override State or local law,  and anyone barred from possessing these devices today remains barred  tomorrow.

What this bill actually does is correct an outdated Federal  classification that treats tasers like deadly firearms. That outdated  and absurd classification has driven up costs, created delays, and made  it harder for law enforcement agencies to access less-than-lethal tools  designed to specifically de-escalate situations and to save lives.

Democrats are calling that clarity a loophole. In reality, the only  thing that this bill closes is the gap between outdated law and modern  policing. Instead of supporting officers who want safer alternatives to  deadly force, Democrats are trying to scare the public with cherry- picked statistics and misleading claims.

Let's be honest. If Democrats were truly concerned about public  safety, they would not oppose a bill that encourages de-escalation and  reduces the likelihood of fatal outcomes and encounters.

Despite all this rhetorical nonsense about policing in the United  States, Democrats are standing in the way of this commonsense measure.  They cannot seem to support legislation that empowers law enforcement  in any way, even when it keeps communities safe.

However, this pattern is not stopped with this bill. Across all three  bills before the House today, the choice is the same. Republicans are  offering practical solutions to strengthen public safety, protect  critical infrastructure, and secure our supply chains that our national  security depends on, and Democrats are choosing, again, to delay, to  distort, and to defend broken systems and outcomes.

Mr. Speaker, it has become impossible to ignore a defining feature of  today's Democratic Party, and that is Trump derangement syndrome, which  is a real disease. No matter what legislation is before this House, no  matter how unrelated it is to President Trump, Democrats find a way to  twist the debate back to him--his personality, what they hate about  him--not the text of the bill, not any of the real-world problems  families are facing, just Trump over and over and over. Every time they  do that, American people pay the price.

When inflation exploded in 2022, after trillions of dollars in  Democratic spending overheated the economy, families were drowning in  higher grocery bills, higher gas prices, and higher rents. All of it  exploded, went out of control. It is a matter of fact. It is not a  matter up for debate. It happened in this country.

Democrats were not focused on fixing those things. Instead, they are  focused on their latest Trump obsession. When the border collapsed and  millions of illegal immigrants poured into communities across our  country, Democrats once again ignored the consequences of their own  policies. Instead of securing the border or addressing affordability,  they leaned harder into the same tired talking points and hysteria  about President Trump.

Voters saw right through that in the last election, and Democrats  lost the popular vote. They lost the electoral college. They lost every  swing State on the map. Yet, even after that decisive rejection, Trump  derangement syndrome remains completely untreated.

Instead of course correcting, Democrats continue to defend wasteful  programs, failed policies, bloated bureaucracy, while reflexively  opposing every effort that President Trump and House Republicans are  making to clean up the mess that they created.

Here we are again today listening to the same theatrics. The American  people are no longer entertained by those theatrics. They are focused  on results: lowering costs, securing the border, strengthening energy  independence, restoring accountability in Washington, reshoring  American jobs, and bringing manufacturing here back to the United  States of America that their failed policies over decades have chased  away.

While Democrats remain stuck in the year 9--we are going on year 10-- of Trump derangement syndrome, Republicans are focused on governing and  delivering results for working families. Mr. Speaker, I would like to  once again remind my colleagues of what is actually in the rule before  us today.

The rule provides for consideration of three commonsense bills: the  Law-Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act, which we have talked  about; the Undersea Cable Protection Act of 2025; and H.R. 3617, the  Securing America's Critical Minerals Supply Act, which will strengthen  our domestic critical mineral supply chain so we can be stronger here  at home and across the world.

Mr. Speaker, for years, Democrats told the American people not to  believe what they could see with their own eyes. They said that crime  was under control, our infrastructure was secure, our supply chains  were resilient, and our energy systems were just fine.

The legislation under the rule today takes real steps toward fixing  broken systems, supporting our law enforcement officers, protecting  critical infrastructure, and rebuilding supply chains right here at  home.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the rule before us today.
