Recognizing the Jewish Community Center of Greater Buffalo on its 80th Anniversary of Service and Community Leadership


Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  constituents of New York's 23rd Congressional District to recognize a  true cornerstone of our community. For 80 years, the Jewish Community  Center of Greater Buffalo has been a pillar of strength, service, and  unity for Western New York--a place where generations have come  together to learn, grow, and celebrate Jewish life and values.

Since its founding in 1945, the JCC has embraced its mission to be  the town square for building and strengthening community through  recreational, educational, cultural, and social programs rooted in  Jewish values. For 80 years, the JCC has fulfilled this mission by  offering a wide array of inclusive services and programs open to people  of all faiths and backgrounds. From preschool classrooms to Camp  Centerland, from heated pools to the renowned Jewish Repertory Theatre,  the JCC has created a space where everyone is welcomed with warmth and  purpose.

Today, two vibrant campuses serve over 1,000 people each day--a  testament to the JCC's enduring mission and commitment to the greater  good. With a vision of ``Shaping Futures, Building Community,'' the JCC  continues to help families thrive and neighbors connect.

It is with great pride that I recognize the Jewish Community Center  of Greater Buffalo on this important milestone and urge all residents  of New York's 23rd District to join me in honoring the JCC's enduring  legacy of service and its continued contributions to our community.
