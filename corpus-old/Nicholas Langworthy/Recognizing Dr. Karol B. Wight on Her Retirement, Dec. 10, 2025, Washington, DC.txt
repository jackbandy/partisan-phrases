Recognizing Dr. Karol B. Wight on Her Retirement


Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the outstanding  leadership and service of Dr. Karol B. Wight, who retires this year  after fifteen years of exceptional stewardship at The Corning Museum of  Glass. Since joining the Museum in 2011 and becoming president and  executive director in 2015, Dr. Wight has guided the institution with  vision and distinction, advancing its mission and inspiring countless  visitors through her deep expertise in ancient artwork.

During her tenure, Dr. Wight curated landmark exhibitions,  strengthened the Museum's research and educational programs, and  championed initiatives that broadened public appreciation for the art  and history of glass. Her scholarly leadership and dedication to her  work have left a profound impact on the Museum and the community she  has served.

In addition to her executive achievements, Dr. Wight has been an  influential figure in the museum field. She has served on the board of  trustees of the American Alliance of Museums, played a leading role  within the Association of Art Museum Directors, and contributed her  expertise to organizations dedicated to the study of classical  antiquity and the history of glass. Through these roles, she has  strengthened professional collaboration, supported emerging leaders,  and advanced the highest standards of museum practice.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the United States House of Representatives  join me in recognizing Dr. Karol Wight for her exemplary contributions  and in celebrating her well-earned retirement. Her legacy will endure  in the institutions she strengthened and the communities she inspired.
