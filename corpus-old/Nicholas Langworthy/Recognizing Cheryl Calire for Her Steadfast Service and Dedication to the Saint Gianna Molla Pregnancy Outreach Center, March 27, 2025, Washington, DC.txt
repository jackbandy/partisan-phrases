Recognizing Cheryl Calire for Her Steadfast Service and Dedication to the Saint Gianna Molla Pregnancy Outreach Center


Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the steadfast  service and profound impact of Cheryl Calire, Director of Life  Ministries for the Diocese of Buffalo. For 15 years, Cheryl provided  guidance, leadership and service to the community as a strong voice and  advocate for women, mothers and children--including the unborn. Since  her announced retirement last year, she has continued to oversee the  Saint Gianna Molla Pregnancy Outreach Centers and Mother Teresa Home in  Western New York.

The Saint Gianna Molla Pregnancy Outreach Centers have a tangible  impact on our community, providing important material, emotional, and  spiritual support during and after pregnancy. This life-affirming work  has saved lives, eased the transition into motherhood, and directly  impacted over 1,500 families each year. Cheryl's continued leadership  has improved the lives and wellbeing of countless children, mothers and  fathers across Western New York, and I am so grateful for her good  work.

Life is a blessing, and as Cheryl Calire transitions into retirement,  my family and I are so grateful to have witnessed her passion and  dedication. We are all charged with leaving our community better than  we found it, and Cheryl certainly has achieved that mission.

I ask this body to join me in recognizing Cheryl Calire for her  commitment to life-affirming advocacy and service. On behalf of the  United States Congress, and the constituents of the 23rd Congressional  District, I thank Cheryl, and hope she enjoys her well-deserved  retirement.
