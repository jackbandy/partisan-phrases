Recognizing the Honorable M. William Boller


Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  exceptional public service of the Honorable M. William Boller, who is  retiring after more than four decades of legal and judicial service in  Western New York. Since beginning his public career in 1981, Judge  Boller has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to justice,  professionalism, and fair administration of the law.

Judge Boller began his career with the Erie County Department of  Social Services, handling hundreds of Family Court cases, and later  served for two decades with the Erie County Child Support Unit. In  1984, he was selected as Elma Town Justice, becoming at age 28 the  youngest Town Justice in Erie County, and went on to serve the Town of  Elma for more than twenty-two years.

In 2006, Judge Boller was nominated to the New York State Court of  Claims and later received full appointments in 2010 and 2019. He also  served as an Acting Justice of the New York State Supreme Court,  Supervising Judge of Town and Village Courts across four counties, and  Erie County Firearms Licensing Officer. His integrity, sound judgment,  and dedication have left a lasting impact on the judicial system in our  region.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the United States House of Representatives  join me in honoring Judge M. William Boller for his many years of  devoted service and in wishing him the very best in his retirement.
