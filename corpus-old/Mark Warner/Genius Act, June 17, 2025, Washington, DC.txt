Genius Act


Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for too long, stablecoins have operated in  a regulatory gray area, putting consumers, markets, and national  security at risk. The bipartisan GENIUS Act brings much-needed  oversight and standards to the $250 billion stablecoin market. It also  creates guardrails for responsible innovation and will enact sensible  consumer protections for payment stablecoins. As an early supporter and  negotiator of the final version of the bill, I pushed for provisions  which clearly preserve State consumer protection laws in the negotiated  rule of construction in section 7(f)(4). This provision is commonsense  and furthers the goal of ensuring that consumer interests come first.
