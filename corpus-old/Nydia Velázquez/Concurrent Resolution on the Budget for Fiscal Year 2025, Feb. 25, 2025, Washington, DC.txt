Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Madam Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to this Republican  rip-off. This budget slashes $880 billion from Medicaid, putting  286,000 people in my district, including nearly 100,000 children, at  risk of losing healthcare.

Madam Chair, cruelty is the point.

It also targets food assistance, leaving over 147,000 New Yorkers in  my district struggling to afford meals.

Cruelty is the point.

Why?

All this to hand out trillions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 1  percent. Republicans tried this trick before in 2017. They promised it  would raise wages, pay for itself, and boost the economy. It didn't.

Instead, it made the rich richer while working people fell further  behind.

Now they are doubling down, making America sicker, poorer, and  hungrier just to funnel more money to their billionaire donors.

This isn't fiscal responsibility. It is economic cruelty. Vote  ``no.''
