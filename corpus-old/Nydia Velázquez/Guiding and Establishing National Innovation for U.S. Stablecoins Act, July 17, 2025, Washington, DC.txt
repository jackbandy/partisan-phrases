Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act


Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the GENIUS Act.

From the beginning, I have said that Congress needs to tackle  stablecoin legislation, but we cannot pretend that this is happening in  a vacuum. We are creating a framework for stablecoins while the  President, his family, and members of his administration are personally  invested in this market and directly profiting from it.

Mr. Speaker, 3 days before taking office, President Trump launched  his own memecoin. When the coin's value collapsed, his insiders cashed  out. Everyday investors were left holding the bag. It is estimated that  they lost over $2 billion while the Trump circle walked away with more  than $350 million.

Now, his family firm, World Liberty Financial, has launched its own  stablecoin, once again netting the President's family tens of millions  of dollars.

The administration is rolling back enforcement and reshaping policy  to give these business interests a leg up.

These are such clear-cut conflicts of interest, yet this bill does  nothing to address them. It doesn't bar the President or Cabinet  officials from holding financial stakes in stablecoin issuers. It  doesn't address the foreign investors piling into these ventures. It  doesn't even try to draw a line between public office and private  banks.

This isn't a framework for innovation. It is a framework for more  corruption.

If we are serious about protecting consumers and about protecting our  markets, we have to start with ethics. This bill fails that basic test.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
