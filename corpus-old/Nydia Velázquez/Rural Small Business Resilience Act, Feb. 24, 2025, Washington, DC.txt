Rural Small Business Resilience Act


Mr. Speaker, today we are considering H.R. 804, which would require  the SBA to close out the GAO recommendation ensuring that individuals  in rural areas where a disaster declaration has been made have full  access to assistance, including targeted outreach and marketing  materials. SBA would have 1 year to close out the recommendation.

On February 22, 2024, GAO issued a report examining how SBA's  disaster loan program assists communities after disasters. GAO found  that rural areas have characteristics that make recovery difficult, and  they face challenges in seeking SBA disaster assistance.

While the SBA had taken steps to address challenges to recovery,  including portable outreach centers, virtual outreach, and a whole-of- SBA approach, GAO recommended that SBA distinguish between urban and  rural communities in its outreach and marketing plan and take actions  to mitigate the challenges encountered by rural communities.

This bill prioritizes SBA's efforts to close out this GAO  recommendation and focus on our Nation's rural communities.

I commend Dr. Morrison, Mr. Downing, Mr. Pappas, and Mr. Bean for  their work on this bill.

Ms. VELAZQUEZ.  Morrison).

Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
