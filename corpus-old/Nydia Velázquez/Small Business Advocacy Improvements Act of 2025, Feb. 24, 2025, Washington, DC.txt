Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act of 2025


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 832, the Small Business  Advocacy Improvements Act of 2025.

The Office of Advocacy was established in 1976 to be an independent  voice for small businesses within the Federal Government and is tasked  with representing the views of small businesses before Congress, the  White House, and other Federal agencies.

The office has regional advocates on the ground that provide outreach  to small businesses, local chambers of commerce, and other associations  to hear firsthand the concerns of small businesses. It works closely  with Federal agencies to elevate these concerns throughout the  rulemaking process.

Over the years, their work has saved small businesses billions in  regulatory costs while still accomplishing the important goals of the  regulations. However, their charter does not specifically state that  they have the authority to represent the views and interests of small  businesses before foreign governments and international entities.

As our economy has become increasingly more interconnected and more  small businesses are tapping into international markets, it makes sense  to give the office the authority to advocate on behalf of small  businesses overseas.

The Office of Advocacy has proven to be a strong proponent for small  businesses in the Federal Government and is well-poised to promote  their views in the international regulatory arena.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Williams, Mr. Tran, Mr. Van Drew, and Ms.  Goodlander for their bipartisan work on this bill.

Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 832, and I yield back the balance of my time.
