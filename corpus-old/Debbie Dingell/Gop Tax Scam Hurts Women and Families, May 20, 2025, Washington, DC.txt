Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to read the letter that the  Governor of Michigan and I received from Marie Adkins.

``I'm a mom to a son with special needs. I'm also a nurse in primary  care settings. My story is from the front lines. . . . If you cut  Medicaid, Americans will die. People will get sick. They'll lose jobs.  Some won't survive. It's not an exaggeration. It's reality.

``This bill doesn't cut waste. It cuts the heart out of programs that  help Americans meet their basic needs: healthcare, nutrition, essential  services. There's nothing excessive about needing insulin or a  wheelchair or therapy. This isn't luxury. It's survival. My son is on  the autism spectrum.

``And let's be real about who this hits the hardest: children, people  with disabilities, and low-income seniors. These are Americans who rely  on Medicaid to live with dignity, to have food  on the table, to get to doctor's appointments, to afford medication.

``Every day at our clinic, I hear it: `I'm scared. I feel hopeless. I  don't know how much longer I can hang on. . . .'

``This is the health crisis we're living in and this bill would make  it worse.''
