End Hunger Now Tour


Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, this week I am officially announcing a  statewide End Hunger Now tour, where I will be visiting every  congressional district in Massachusetts to hear from people struggling  to put food on the table, to see firsthand why getting nutritious food  into every community matters, and to learn from the organizations that  are making a difference in people's lives.

I am proud that Massachusetts is taking a stand to fight hunger, but  I am ashamed that in the richest country in the history of the world  nearly 48 million people, including 14 million children, don't know  where their next meal is going to come from.

I think our national hunger crisis is more than just a policy  failure. I think it is a moral outrage, one that Trump and Republicans  have made worse by ripping food assistance away from people so they can  give tax breaks to billionaires and canceling USDA's gold-standard  hunger report to bury the impact of their cruel cuts.

Madam Speaker, this tour is about fighting back, and I hope you will  follow along as I keep fighting to end hunger now.
