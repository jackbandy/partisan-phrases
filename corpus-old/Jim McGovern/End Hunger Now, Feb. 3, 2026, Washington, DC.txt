End Hunger Now


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, food costs are sky high, and millions of  people across the country are losing their SNAP benefits due to Trump's  big, ugly bill, which made the largest cut to food assistance and  healthcare in American history.

Amazing organizations, like Lorraine's Soup Kitchen & Pantry in  Chicopee, Massachusetts, are working to bridge the gap so that families  don't go hungry amid these reckless Republican cuts.

Lorraine's, named after the first executive director of the soup  kitchen, has been providing nutritious food and hope to families in  western Massachusetts for 30 years. Under the incredible leadership of  Kim Caisse, Lorraine's serves hot meals and provides nutritious pantry  staples and produce to hungry families.

As part of my statewide End Hunger Now tour, I visited the pantry  with my friend, Richie Neal, ranking member of the Ways and Means  Committee. We learned about an increase in need due to Republican cuts  and talked directly with pantry workers and people experiencing hunger.

As Congress prepares to consider the next farm bill, we must repeal  the SNAP cuts enacted as part of the big, ugly bill and fully restore  food assistance programs as we work to end hunger now.
