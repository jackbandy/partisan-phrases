End Hunger Now: Visit to Quincy Community Action Programs


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, with my friend Congressman  Steve Lynch, I visited Quincy Community Action Programs in Quincy,  Massachusetts, as part of my Statewide End Hunger Now tour.

We kicked off our visit with QCAP CEO Beth Ann Strollo and some of  the young kids in their Head Start program enjoying healthy breakfasts  of yogurt and berries. They were so enthusiastic.

Later on we heard from Ted Donnelly, who leads QCAP's food and  nutrition programs at their South West Community Center. He spoke about  the record-breaking number of people coming to the food pantry every  month, especially when USDA let SNAP benefits lapse during the  Republican shutdown.

We also heard poignant stories from a few of QCAP's clients, Nisha,  Marybeth, Tanya, and Danielle. One noted that she would love to work  more hours, but if she does, she will lose all of her food benefits.

Mr. Speaker, my visit to QCAP strengthened my resolve even more to  fight back against the Trump administration's vicious attacks against  our antihunger programs and end hunger now.
