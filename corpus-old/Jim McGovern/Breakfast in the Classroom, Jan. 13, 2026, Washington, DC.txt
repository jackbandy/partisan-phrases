Breakfast in the Classroom


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, at the end of last year, a Massachusetts- based foundation committed to ending hunger, the Eos Foundation, and  released its annual school breakfast report card.

We have all heard the old adage that breakfast is the most important  meal of the day. For kids experiencing hunger, it is especially true.

The Eos Foundation has put its money where its mouth is literally, by  providing funding and technical assistance to schools to establish  robust breakfast-in-the-classroom programs.

Springfield Public Schools is a shining example of what is possible.  With support from the Eos breakfast-in-the-classroom model, 84 percent  of students are now getting breakfast up from 44 percent a few years  ago.

Mr. Speaker, we can and we should do more to close the breakfast gap,  the difference between the number of students receiving school  breakfast versus lunches. I am committed to doing my part. I have a  bill that would increase the Federal meal reimbursement rates for  school breakfasts and lunches.

Mr. Speaker, thanks to the incredible partners at the Eos Foundation,  we are making progress one school at a time.
