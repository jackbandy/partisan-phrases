Gaza Needs Immediate Humanitarian Aid


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, there is a catastrophic humanitarian  crisis in Gaza. It is happening before our eyes.

Tons of food, medicine, water, shelter, and other urgent humanitarian  aid remains blocked from entering Gaza by Israeli Prime Minister  Netanyahu. The World Food Programme and NGOs have been forced to close  their programs or are using the last of their dwindling supplies.

For the first time, lab technicians with the American Near East  Refugee Aid organization are detecting signs of starvation in the lab  work of one-third of all blood and urine samples of their patients in  Gaza.

Israeli officers charged with monitoring conditions inside of Gaza  have told their commanders that it is on the brink of starvation.

Mr. Speaker, for too long Congress has been complacent and complicit  about the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza. We need to speak  out and demand the rapid, unimpeded, impartial, neutral, and  independent delivery of humanitarian aid today. Tomorrow may be too  late.
