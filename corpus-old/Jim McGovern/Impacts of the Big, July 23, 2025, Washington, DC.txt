Impacts of the Big, Ugly Bill on Massachusetts


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump and this Republican Congress  just enacted the largest transfer of wealth in history. They cut 15  million people off of their healthcare and decimated food assistance  for working families to give tax breaks to billionaires.

Last week, I joined my dear friend Representative Ayanna Pressley and  Project Bread in Boston to hear directly from people experiencing food  insecurity about how the big, ugly bill will make their lives more  difficult.

We heard from hungry moms, grandmothers, food pantry leaders, and  local officials. Each and every person who participated in the  roundtables spoke about how the big, ugly bill will increase hunger. If  Trump and Republicans in Congress would spend 5 minutes listening to  anyone living paycheck to paycheck, they would know how devastating  these cuts are.

In Massachusetts, we are crafting a plan to prevent families from  going hungry amid these reckless Federal cuts. Governor Maura Healey,  her administration, and local advocates are forming the Anti-Hunger  Task Force to adopt long-term solutions to support families in  Massachusetts and work to finally end hunger now.
