End Hunger Now with Innovative Ways to Feed Hungry People


Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, in 99 percent of counties in the United  States, SNAP benefits don't cover the cost of a nutritious meal.

The good news is that there are exciting partnerships happening that  show us it is possible to improve access to healthier foods.

In New York City, local nonprofits, the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention, and the online grocery platform Mercato have partnered  to help thousands of low-income New Yorkers with diet-driven chronic  diseases purchase more nutritious food. The United Way of New York City  is anchoring one produce prescription project, Connect2Food, that  provides hungry people with $80 per month to purchase fresh fruits and  vegetables.

This innovative work is teaching us that increased investments make  it a little bit easier for families in need to make healthier choices,  while also supporting local jobs and agriculture.

Let's improve SNAP benefits, support public-private partnerships to  make healthier choices possible, build a healthier and more resilient  Nation, and finally end hunger now.
