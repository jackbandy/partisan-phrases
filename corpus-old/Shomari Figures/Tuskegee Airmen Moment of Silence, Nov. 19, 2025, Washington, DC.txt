Tuskegee Airmen Moment of Silence


Mr. FIGURES. Mr. Speaker, I rise with the Alabama delegation,  including one of our U.S. Senators and many others here on the House  floor, to pay respect to the end of an era. One of the most improbable,  inspiring, and truly remarkable chapters in American history quietly  closed during our most recent break.

Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy, a veteran of Vietnam, Korea, and  World War II, passed away.

This is not a name most of us know in isolation, but we all know the  story of the Black men who were trained as pilots on airfields in the  backwoods of Macon County, Alabama, who would go on to become what the  world knows today as the Tuskegee Airmen.

Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy was the last surviving Tuskegee  Airman who flew combat missions in World War II. He was born in  Philadelphia at a time when the military was not integrated, but by the  age of 19, he was flying combat missions over the skies of Europe,  defending and liberating rights and freedoms abroad that we all know  that he did not enjoy even back at home.

Despite that, Lieutenant Colonel Hardy kept the mission first, front  and center. With the other Tuskegee Airmen, they exceeded expectations,  and they left behind a spectacular record of service and  accomplishment. Though these men took off as the unlikeliest of  American heroes, they landed as what is possibly the greatest, most  well-known, most well-decorated fighting force in this Nation's  history.

As a young man now that has the privilege to represent Tuskegee, it  is my honor, my obligation, and my duty to stand on this House floor  and acknowledge the life and the legacy of Lieutenant Colonel George  Hardy and the Tuskegee Airmen and all of those who have served this  Nation.
