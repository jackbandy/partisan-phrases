Sickle Cell Awareness Month


Mr. FIGURES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge that September  is Sickle Cell Awareness Month. It is a time to recognize the  challenges faced by those living with this debilitating genetic  disease.

This disease is one that disproportionately affects Black people who  make up 90 percent of those diagnosed with this terrible condition. One  person is a young man that I had the opportunity to meet down in  Mobile, Alabama, my hometown. He is a 5-year-old gentleman named Dakota  Williams. He a student at Council Traditional School of which I am a  proud alum myself.

The only known cure for sickle cell is a bone marrow or stem cell  transplant. It is risky, and it is often inaccessible, especially in  certain communities. That is why urgent investment in research,  treatment, and equitable care is critical.

That is why we need to pass the Sickle Cell Disease Comprehensive  Care Act, introduced by my Republican colleague out of Florida,  Representative Neal Dunn. I am a proud cosponsor, and I thank him for  his leadership on this issue.

We need this so we can better understand and improve how we track and  understand care for patients like Dakota and so we can better identify  where resources and support are most needed.

Mr. Speaker, this month and every month, we must stand with those  living with sickle cell disease and fight for a future where they have  hope and health.
