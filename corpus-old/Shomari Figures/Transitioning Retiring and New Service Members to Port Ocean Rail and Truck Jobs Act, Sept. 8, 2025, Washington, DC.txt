Transitioning Retiring and New Service Members to Port Ocean Rail and Truck Jobs Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support, too, of the Transitioning Retiring  And New Service Members to Port Ocean Rail and Truck Jobs Act, as  amended, which was introduced by my colleagues, Representatives  Barrett, Scholten, Bost.

This legislation requires the Secretary of Transportation to develop  an action plan that identifies supply chain job needs at port,  railroads, and trucking companies in consultation with the Secretaries  of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Labor.

Veterans are trained for hard and dedicated work. I understand why  supply chain employees want to hire more veterans. One of the lightest  lifts that we can do in this body is to ensure we are exhausting every  possible resource we can to ensure that those who have signed up to  risk their lives for this country can find employment when they leave  the armed services.

It will be helpful for veterans to know about additional job  opportunities at ports, railroads, and trucking companies. Many of  these jobs are solid, middle-class, family supporting, union jobs. They  require an understanding of the safety-sensitive nature of the work  that tends to be particularly well-suited to the training military  veterans have received.

Mr. Speaker, I support the TRANSPORT Act, as amended, to provide  options for veterans during preseparation counseling, and I recommend  my colleagues to do the same.
