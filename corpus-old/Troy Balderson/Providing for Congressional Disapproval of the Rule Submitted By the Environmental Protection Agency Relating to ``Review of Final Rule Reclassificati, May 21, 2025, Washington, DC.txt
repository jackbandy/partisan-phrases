Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Environmental Protection Agency Relating to ``Review of Final Rule Reclassification of Major Sources As Area Sources Under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act''


Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Weber for yielding me time.

I rise today in strong support of S.J. Res. 31. This resolution would  disapprove of the Biden-era EPA's ``once in, always in'' rule, which  was finalized in the final months of the previous administration.

Simply put, the ``once in, always in'' policy hurts America's  manufacturing and energy sectors while doing nothing to actually  improve air pollution.

In 2020, the Trump administration first reversed this policy, which  encouraged businesses to lower their emissions and reduce pollution.

My home State of Ohio ranks third in the Nation with almost 700,000  manufacturing jobs. The manufacturing sector is responsible for over 17  percent of Ohio's gross domestic product and has an annual payroll of  $48 billion in the Buckeye State alone.

It is critical that we support this resolution today and send it to  the President's desk to deliver on our promise to unleash American  manufacturing and energy.

I am proud to have introduced the House companion to this CRA with  the gentlewoman from North Dakota (Mrs. Fedorchak), my good friend, and  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this commonsense resolution.
