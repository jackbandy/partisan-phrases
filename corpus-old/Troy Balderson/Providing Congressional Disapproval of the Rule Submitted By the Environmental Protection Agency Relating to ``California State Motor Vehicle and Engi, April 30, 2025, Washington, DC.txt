Providing Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Environmental Protection Agency Relating to ``California State Motor Vehicle and Engine Pollution Control Standards; Advanced Clean Cars Ii; Waiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision''


Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J.  Res. 88.

In the final weeks of 2024, the Biden-led EPA approved a waiver  allowing California to ban the sale of gas-powered diesel and even  hybrid vehicles by 2035, effectively paving the way for the State to  set emission standards for the entire Nation.

This resolution overturns this waiver, protecting the right of every  American to choose the vehicle that works best for them. For many  consumers and entrepreneurs, they see conventional gas-powered cars as  reliable, affordable, and able to meet the needs of their families and  small businesses. Yet, the Biden administration chose to team up with  radical climate activists to support the one-size-fits-all electric  vehicle mandate that the market and the American people have clearly  rejected.

This legislation is about defending consumer choice. Let's make sure  California does not dictate what the rest of America drives.
