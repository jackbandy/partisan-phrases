Awning Safety Act of 2025


Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Bilirakis for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the Awning Safety  Act, which aims to enhance the safety of awnings commonly found in Ohio  homes and households across the Nation.

A retractable awning can serve as a valuable source of shade and a  gathering spot for families and friends. However, they can pose a  significant risk to consumers.

This legislation directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to  establish safety standards for fixed and freestanding awnings typically  installed in homes.

My Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues and I learned of the  serious risks surrounding awnings when tragedy struck the family of  Olivia Shields, a staff member of the committee at the time.

As Ranking Member Pallone said, she and her family are in the gallery  today. Her father, Michael Hnat, was carrying out a routine household  task of taking down the retractable awning from the family home in  Ohio. He was on the ladder when the spring-loaded arm of the awning  unexpectedly shot out at him, forcing his ladder to tip and causing him  to fall. Michael suffered a severe spinal cord injury, and despite  efforts to save him, he tragically passed away a few days later.

His passing affected his family profoundly and reverberated  throughout the communities he touched.

Michael was renowned for his kindness, generosity, and selflessness,  often going above and beyond to help others in need. He was a devoted  family man, cherished husband to Jill, and loving father to their  children, Annaliese, Olivia, Abbey, Seamus, Emma; his sons-in-law; and  his grandchildren.

Michael's untimely death underscores the importance of ensuring the  safety of household products like awnings, and by passing this  legislation today, we can prevent further tragedies.
