Fraud in Minnesota


Mr. FINE. Mr. Speaker, I met with a lot of angry constituents over  the last 2 weeks. They are angry about how expensive America has  become. They are angry, in large part, because they realize one simple  truth: The Somali pirates are not in the Horn of Africa anymore. They  are right here in our country, and their captain is Tim Walz.

While my constituents suffer today, 81 percent of Somali families are  on welfare. Nine billion dollars was stolen from child nutrition,  housing, and autism services in Minnesota, largely through Feeding Our  Future, a program that theoretically opened more than 250 sites and was  supposed to be feeding 91 million meals. It was not doing that.

There was a Medicaid program, the Early Intensive Developmental and  Behavioral Intervention program, where the Federal Government was  paying 64 percent and fake autism treatment firms were created.

Our constituents are suffering. Before we ask them to continue to  suffer, we owe it to them to root out everyone who was involved in this  fraud and hold everyone accountable, and that is exactly what I intend  to do.
