Recognizing Lady Lake, Florida


Mr. FINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the town of Lady  Lake, Florida, which celebrated its remarkable centennial in November.  Though the town held its first official meeting in 1925, Lady Lake's  story reaches back to the 1880s, when a new railway depot sparked  growth in a community first home to the Seminole Indians.

From its early years as a hub for citrus and watermelon growers to  the history now preserved by the Lady Lake Historical Society Museum,  the town's heritage reflects a century of resilience.

The recent weeklong celebration brought that heritage to life,  uniting residents, visitors, and community partners in a series of  events to honor 100 years of hometown pride.

I extend my sincere appreciation to the town commission, along with  Town Manager Lawrence and Police Chief Hunt, for their leadership in  making this milestone possible. My thanks also go to every department,  volunteer, and community partner who helped make that celebration  unforgettable.

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to represent the residents of Lady Lake  in Congress. Here is to another 100 years of community connection and  tradition.                      Recognizing City of Flagler Beach

Mr. FINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the city of Flagler  Beach, which celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, marking a  century since its official incorporation. Though it would not become an  official city until 1963, Flagler Beach's history stretches back even  further, when it was originally known as the town of Ocean City.

The iconic Flagler Beach Pier quickly became a gathering place for  residents and visitors alike, and the existing A-frame carrying the  city's name remains a treasured piece of that early history. My office  will continue working with FEMA and our State, county, and local  partners to assist with the pier's restoration, ensuring this landmark  endures for future generations.

Flagler Beach has always been defined by its close-knit community,  small businesses, and the enduring spirit that makes this city truly  unique. I extend my sincere thanks to the Flagler Beach City Commission  and the staff for their leadership and dedication in preserving this  community and its heritage.

Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to represent the people of Flagler  Beach in Congress. Here is to 100 more years of community, resilience,  and a bright future for this coastal gem.            Recognizing Lake County Superintendent Diane Kornegay

Mr. FINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Diane Kornegay  for her selection as Florida's 2026 Superintendent of the Year.

Ms. Kornegay is a seasoned educator with more than 35 years of  experience. Under her tutelage, Lake County Schools have made  significant strides in academic performance, achieving an A grade from  the Florida Department of Education in 2025 for the first time since  2008, which is no easy task.

Since the beginning of her tenure, Lake County Schools have also seen  notable increases in proficiency, including 15 percentage points in  algebra 1 and 7 percentage points in English language arts for grades 9  and 10.

Mr. Speaker, Ms. Kornegay is committed to serving her community and  ensuring academic excellence for her students. Lake County is fortunate  to have such an excellent servant, and I am honored to congratulate her  on receiving this award.              Honoring the Life of Julius ``Jules'' Kwiatkowski

Mr. FINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Commissioner  Julius ``Jules'' Kwiatkowski, a faithful public servant who served as  commissioner of the East Flagler County Mosquito Control District for  17 years.

We have a lot of mosquitoes in Florida. Throughout his tenure, Mr.  Kwiatkowski helped guide the district through major accomplishments,  including the expansion of mosquito control services to meet the needs  of a growing community. His service to the community was so exemplary  that he was honored with the unveiling of the ``Jules the Turtle''  statue to celebrate his enduring community spirit.

Even before his election as commissioner, Mr. Kwiatkowski was a  dedicated community servant. Upon moving to Florida, he volunteered  with Palm Coast Fire and Police and served during the 1998 Flagler  County wildfires.

Beyond his service, Jules was a dedicated husband and father. Flagler  County was incredibly fortunate to have such an excellent man serve the  community. May his memory be a blessing.

Recognizing Volusia County Superintendent Carmen Balgobin

Mr. FINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  Superintendent Carmen Balgobin of Volusia County Schools for her  selection as 2025 Superintendent of the Year by the National  Association of School Superintendents.

Superintendent Balgobin's leadership of Volusia County Schools has  been transformative. Under her watch, the district received its first A  rating in 16 years from the Florida Department of Education, achieved a  93.7 graduation rate, and eliminated all D-rated schools in the county.  Her innovative approach of focusing on college and career technical  pathways programs, which specify teaching students practical skills for  their next steps, has paid dividends for the education of all Volusia  County students.

Mr. Speaker, Superintendent Balgobin is committed to serving her  community and ensuring academic excellence for her students. Volusia  County is fortunate to have such an excellent servant, and I am honored  to congratulate her on receiving this award.
