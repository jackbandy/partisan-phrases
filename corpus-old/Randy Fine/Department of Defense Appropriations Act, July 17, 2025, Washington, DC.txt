Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. FINE. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this America last  amendment and reject the premise of the arguments that are being made.

There are 600,000 Americans who live in Israel, and one rocket has  been fired against every 23 of them, 26,000 rockets since October 7.  Forty-three Americans were killed on October 7, and 12 were taken  hostage.

More importantly, the research that this funds is the premise behind  the Golden Dome. When we support research and development for the Iron  Dome, we are creating the capability for the United States to defend  itself as well.

I have news. We have a nuclear weapon, too. That doesn't get you off  the hook with those who are out to get you.

When we oppose this amendment, when we vote it down, we are not only  standing with Israel. We are standing with the best interests of the  United States.
