Maritime Supply Chain Security Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2390, the Maritime Supply  Chain Security Act, legislation that clarifies that funding provided by  the port infrastructure development program can be used to replace or  upgrade Chinese-made cranes at ports.

In 2024, over 80 percent of ship-to-shore cranes at ports in the  United States were manufactured in China. There is currently no U.S.  domestic production of ship-to-shore cranes, leaving some of the most  valuable equipment at our ports vulnerable to cyberattacks and  dependent upon Chinese manufacturing.

This is just one example of the type of manufacturing that needs to  be brought back to the United States, not through the tariffs that pass  along costs to the consumer but rather by working with companies and  incentivizing change.

This bill serves as a prime example of the importance of the port  infrastructure development program, a bipartisan program that invests  in our ports and supply chain.

Since 90 percent of everything we wear, eat, and consume is carried  by water, ports are the bedrock of our supply chain. The bipartisan  infrastructure law provided $2.25 billion in advanced appropriations  for PIDP.

I welcome the increase to the program in the fiscal year 2026 budget  request and hope the appropriators follow suit.

H.R. 2390 continues the work of President Biden to replace Chinese  cranes and bolster the cybersecurity of U.S. ports. For that reason, I  urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. CARBAJAL. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 2390, I urge my  colleagues to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.
