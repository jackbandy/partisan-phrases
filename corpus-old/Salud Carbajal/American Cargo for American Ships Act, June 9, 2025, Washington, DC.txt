American Cargo for American Ships Act


Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of my bill, the American  Cargo for American Ships Act, and to express my thanks for the  bipartisan leadership of Chair Sam Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and  also Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee Chair Ezell,  who cosponsored this important legislation.

My bill strengthens the American merchant marine by guaranteeing that  100 percent of U.S. cargo generated by the Department of Transportation  will be transported on U.S.-flagged ships. It is that simple.

This bill is the maritime industry's version of Buy American. If the  government is shipping cargo, it should be on American vessels.

Starting with the end of World War II, the U.S. merchant marine has  shrunk to an unacceptable level. My bill is an actionable step that we  can take right now to improve the maritime industry, grow the U.S.  mariner pool, and increase the number of U.S.-flagged ships.

From a national security perspective, cargo preference remains an  effective shipping strategy in maintaining our Nation's presence and  economic viability in the international market.

As the Department of Transportation is responsible for overseeing the  majority of American maritime shipping, both domestically and globally,  there is no reason why the Department cannot and should not set an  example that is meaningful.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support passage of H.R.  2035, the American Cargo for American Ships Act, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
