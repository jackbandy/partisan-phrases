Following Through on Americans' Priorities


Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, as we begin the second session of the 119th  Congress, we should take a moment to reset our focus and remember why  we are here. A new year and a new session bring new opportunities, but  the mission remains the same. Kansans sent me to Washington, D.C., to  deliver results for the people of the Big First District, and that is  what I will continue to do.

The Big First is home to farmers and ranchers who get up before the  sun and work until the job is done. It is home to small business owners  and families who balance budgets, meet payroll, and expect the same  discipline from the Federal Government. Kansans are practical people  who believe in hard work, common sense, and accountability. We don't  want excuses. We expect results.

After President Trump's first term, the Biden administration  inherited near-record lows in inflation and an agricultural trade  surplus of $6 billion. After 4 years of failed Democratic policies, we  were left with a 21.5 percent increase in prices and an agricultural  trade deficit of $40 billion.

When a ship runs into an iceberg, it takes time to turn the ship  around, Mr. Speaker. You need to bail the water, repair the planks, and  restart the engine before you can fully correct course. Fortunately,  thanks to the leadership of President Trump and congressional  Republicans, we are back on track and moving away from the iceberg that  was President Biden's administration.

Over the course of the first session of this Congress, we made  important progress for Kansans. We pushed back against burdensome  regulations that drive up costs for Main Street. We worked to  strengthen American energy production so families can afford to heat  their homes and fuel their vehicles. We advanced policies that support  agricultural producers and rural communities and restored the rule of  law at our border. Most importantly, we cut taxes for working families,  giving the average Kansan $2,200 more per year in take-home pay  beginning this month.

That work matters, and I am proud of the progress we have made, but  after the damage done by the previous administration, there is much  more work to do. That is what this second session must be about.

For Kansans, this starts with agriculture. Farmers have been facing  higher input costs, tighter margins, and growing uncertainty since  2021. They need predictability, risk management tools, and a strong  farm safety net. Completing a farm bill that reflects the realities on  the ground is vitally important, and I will continue pushing for a  fiscally conservative, 5-year farm bill that reflects the priorities of  our producers who feed, fuel, and clothe the world.

While real wages are rising and inflation is nearing a 5-year low,  there is more to be done to lower costs for families and small  businesses. Washington regulations often hit Americans hardest in rural  communities like the ones I represent. Commonsense regulatory relief is  not about cutting corners. It is about letting people work, grow, and  innovate without unnecessary government interference.

Energy is another area where House Republicans are working hard for  the good of our Nation. Kansans support an all-of-the-above energy  strategy that prioritizes American oil, gas, biofuels, and renewables.  This approach supports good-paying jobs, strengthens our economy, and  keeps prices affordable. Green New Deal policies that pick winners and  losers or ignore rural realities do not work in places like the Big  First of Kansas, and this Congress has a responsibility to pursue  solutions grounded in reality, not ideology.

Finally, Congress needs to ensure that we continue good stewardship  of hard-earned taxpayer dollars. Families in Kansas must make tough  choices every day, and they expect their government to do the same.  Last year, we rescinded $9.4 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse found  in Federal programs, such as funding for Iraqi ``Sesame Street,''  electric buses in Rwanda, and LGBTQ programs in Uganda. Fiscal  responsibility is not optional. It is a basic obligation that House  Republicans are focused on each and every day in the 119th Congress.

Mr. Speaker, the second session of this Congress is not about  starting  over. It is about following through. Kansans sent me here to stay  focused on results, not political noise. I will continue working to  make sure this body delivers real outcomes for the Big First District  of Kansas and keeps its promises to the people whom we serve.
