Successful Entrepreneurship for Reservists and Veterans Act


Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Velazquez) for yielding.

I rise in support of the bipartisan Successful Entrepreneurship for  Reservists and Veterans Act, or the SERV Act, which I introduced  alongside Representatives Alford and Conaway. This bill honors our  veterans' service by helping them succeed as entrepreneurs and small  business owners.

My mom served in the Army for 20 years, and my grandfather served in  the Army, as well. Through them, I learned about service, leadership,  and dedication to country.

Our veterans defended our freedoms, and we owe it to them to provide  real support when they return home. Yet, veterans face distinct  barriers when starting a business, from accessing capital to overcoming  stigmas around disabilities or PTSD. These challenges have contributed  to a 35 percent decline in veteran entrepreneurship since World War II.

The SERV Act addresses these challenges head-on, ensuring veterans  have the resources that they need to thrive. At a time when harmful  Federal worker layoffs at the VA are making it harder for veterans to  access support, this legislation is more important than ever. By  strengthening SBA programs, we are investing in our veterans, creating  jobs, and boosting our local economies.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and show our  veterans that we have their backs, both in uniform and beyond.
