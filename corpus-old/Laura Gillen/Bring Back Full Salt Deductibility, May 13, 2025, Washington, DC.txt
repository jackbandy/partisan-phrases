Bring Back Full Salt Deductibility


Ms. GILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to demand that Congress restore the  full State and local tax deduction which would cut taxes for Nassau  County residents.

On Long Island, we pay some of the highest taxes in the country, and  we send far more to Washington than we get back.

For the past 8 years, this cap has hiked tax bills for hardworking  families in my district and those in other high-tax States, even as the  cost of living continues to rise. These families deserve real relief.  It is what the President promised when he came to my district and said  he would get SALT back.

Well, it is time to deliver, Mr. President.

At this very moment, the majority is advancing a reconciliation bill  that fails to meaningfully lower our taxes for Long Island when we are  already facing a cost of living crisis. Mr. Speaker, that is totally  unacceptable.

There is bipartisan agreement among my New York colleagues that the  majority's offer is a slap in the face to  New Yorkers. We need to hold the line and push for a full repeal that  will bring tax bills down and give Long Islanders much-needed tax  relief.

I came to Congress to cut taxes and make life more affordable for my  residents. I will continue to explore every possible avenue to do just  that.
