Condemning the Boulder, Colorado, Anti-Semitic Attack


Ms. GILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the despicable anti- Semitic terror attack targeted against Jews who were marching in  Boulder, Colorado, in support of the hostages being held in Gaza.

This horrific attack comes on the heels of another targeted anti- Semitic terror attack at the Capital Jewish Museum here in Washington,  D.C., where a hate-filled gunman murdered two young employees of the  Israeli Embassy, Yaron and Sarah. May their memories be a blessing.

We must send the strongest message to those who seek refuge in our  country, only to come here and commit crimes and harm innocent people.  They should know that their actions will not be tolerated, and they  will have no home here.

As a Member of Congress, I will continue to fight for policies that  confront anti-Semitism, extremism, and hate wherever it is found.
