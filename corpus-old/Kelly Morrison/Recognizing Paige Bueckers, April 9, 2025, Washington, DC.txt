Recognizing Paige Bueckers


Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Paige Bueckers  for her accomplishments in women's basketball and for leading the  University of Connecticut women's basketball team to victory in the  NCAA championship.

Paige Bueckers graduated from Hopkins High School in 2020. From an  early age, she was known across Minnesota for her stellar basketball  skills and her outstanding character.

Paige's excellence led her to the University of Connecticut where she  was a dominant force in NCAA Division I basketball. Over her career,  she amassed many prestigious awards including the ESPY's Best Female  College Athlete and was selected as a first team All-American three  times.

Winning the NCAA championship with UConn is a testament to her  talent, resilience, and leadership on and off the court. Paige's  teammates and coaches have praised her for her mentality of putting her  team first and for her dedication to their sport.

Paige serves as an inspiration and role model for athletes across the  country. Along with the entire State of Minnesota, I am incredibly  proud of her and her accomplishments. We will cheer her on as she  enters the 2025 WNBA draft, and we can't wait to see what is next for  the remarkable Paige Bueckers.
