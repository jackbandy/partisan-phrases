Veterans' Compensation Cost-Of-Living Adjustment Act of 2025


Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2392, the  Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act.

This bipartisan legislation would provide a 2.8 percent cost-of- living increase for VA disability benefits, like disability  compensation and clothing allowance, as well as survivor benefits, such  as dependency and indemnity compensation.

Veterans and their families are entitled to and owed these benefits,  and it is our responsibility in Congress to ensure that we continue to  provide the utility and financial stability they deserve.

Affordability is a top concern for all of my constituents, including  the veterans in my community. This adjustment is necessary to help  ensure that our veterans and their families can keep pace with the cost  of living.

As a cosponsor of this legislation and a member of the Disability  Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, I am pleased that we are  able to come together on a bipartisan basis to pass this bill that will  do just that.

Mr. Speaker, I want to end by thanking the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Luttrell) and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. McGarvey) for their  leadership on this important bill. I also thank the chair and ranking  member for their support, as well. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''  on this legislation.
