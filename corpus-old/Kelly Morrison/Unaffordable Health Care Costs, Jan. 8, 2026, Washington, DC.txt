Unaffordable Health Care Costs


Ms. MORRISON. Madam Speaker, thousands of Minnesotans and millions of  Americans are facing unaffordable healthcare costs. Because of their  cruelly named One Big Beautiful Bill Act and Speaker Johnson's refusal  to act, the Republican majority is creating a healthcare crisis that  will literally dismantle American public health.

Americans are being forced into crushing medical debt, are in danger  of losing their closest hospital, clinic, or emergency room.

As a doctor, I worry for the patients delaying their care and for  clinics and hospitals already struggling to meet the needs of their  community.

As a Minnesotan, I am heartbroken for my State. Minnesotans have  suffered immeasurable loss following the tragedies of recent months.

The Trump administration's reckless actions and deliberate inaction  from Republicans in Congress jeopardize the operation and availability  of facilities that are the first site of care in the most tragic  circumstances.

I have a responsibility to be abundantly clear, Madam Speaker. The  consequences of inaction and ignoring hospitals, doctors, patients, and  your own constituents will be catastrophic. The price of failing to  deliver affordable healthcare isn't losing elections. It is real human  suffering and American lives.
