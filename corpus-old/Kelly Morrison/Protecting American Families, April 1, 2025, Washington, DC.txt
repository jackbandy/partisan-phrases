Protecting American Families


Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise on behalf of all of the  families who are being hurt by this administration's reckless trade  wars.

Last week, I met with Minnesota families and childcare providers to  talk about how expensive it is to raise a family and care for young  children. I met Nana Renee. She is a mother and a grandmother from  Brooklyn Park who loves her family more than anything in the world.  She, like so many families, is struggling to make ends meet.

As a country, we should be doing everything we can to support our  young families and make raising kids more affordable. These policies  are doing the exact opposite.

With this administration's sweeping tariffs, families will be forced  to pay even more for the products they need to care for their children  such as high chairs, cribs, strollers, and car seats. Car seats are not  an optional purchase. They are required by law.

That is why today my Democratic colleagues and I are calling on the  administration to exempt essential childcare products from these  tariffs. I challenge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  stand up for families and join us in this call. Families should not  have to foot the bill for these reckless trade wars.
