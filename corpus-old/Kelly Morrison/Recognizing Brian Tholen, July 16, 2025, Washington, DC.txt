Recognizing Brian Tholen


Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Chief  Brian Tholen for his distinguished career in law enforcement and his  lifelong commitment to serving the people of Minnesota through  education, volunteerism, and public safety advocacy.

For over 25 years, Chief Tholen served with dedication and integrity  as a police officer for the city of Edina. He then continued his  service as chief of police for the South Lake Minnetonka Police  Department, leading with professionalism and courage.

A graduate of the University of St. Thomas and the FBI National  Academy, Chief Tholen exemplified Minnesotan excellence throughout his  law enforcement career. His tenure includes a decade in the patrol  division, where he served as a field training officer, a defensive  tactics instructor, and a member of the Southwest Metro SWAT Team  Consortium.

In the past 12 years, Chief Tholen has worked to train officers,  paramedics, firefighters, and civilians across the metro area in active  shooter response protocol. Through his work, he has emphasized the  importance of awareness, prevention, and survival, equipping  individuals and businesses with lifesaving tools and strategies.

On behalf of myself and the Minnesotans who have benefited from his  decades of leadership and service, I offer my sincere gratitude to  Chief Brian Tholen.
