Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act


Mr. BURLISON. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the PERMIT Act introduced by my  good friend and chairman of the Water Resources and Environment  Subcommittee, Congressman  Mike Collins.

This bold legislation delivers a long-overdue blow to the radical  environmental agenda that has weaponized the Clean Water Act, paving  the way for critical infrastructure projects to move forward and be  free from the regulatory shackles imposed by this Washington swamp.

For too long, the Federal Government and environmental activists have  waged legal warfare on our farmers, small businesses, and job-creating  projects, causing endless delays and litigation.

Mr. Trump's vision is clear: America is building again.

My Judicial Review Timeline Clarity Act, which is included in this  vital permitting reform package, establishes a strict 60-day window to  challenge section 404 permits once the Army Corps of Engineers grants  authorization.

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act exists to safeguard our waters,  not empower radical environmentalists to harass hardworking Americans  with legal hurdles years after permits are granted.

Let me be clear. The days of radical environmentalists holding our  Nation's projects hostage with their antigrowth and antijob agenda are  over.

The PERMIT Act slashes red tape, ends bureaucratic overreach, and  restores the freedom to build an America that works for its people  again.

Mr. Chair, I commend Chairman Graves and Subcommittee Chairman  Collins for their leadership in advancing this pro-growth, America  First legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
