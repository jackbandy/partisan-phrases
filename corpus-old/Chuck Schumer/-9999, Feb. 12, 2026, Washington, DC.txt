Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, Americans' views on ICE are crystal  clear: The lawlessness, the violence, the chaos must end, and the only  real way to do it is through legislation.

Today, Senate Democrats will vote no because we will not support a  bill that fails to make any progress on reining in ICE and stopping the  violence. Americans are sick of their taxpayer dollars going to masked  Federal agents, warrantless searches, and violence--violence--in their  communities.

Democrats have been clear. We need legislation to truly halt ICE's  abuses. Otherwise, what Tom Homan says today could be reversed by  Donald Trump, on a whim, tomorrow. Without legislation, Donald Trump  could choose to put a rogue force in any city he wants and have them  operate without guardrails at all.

The proposals that Senate and House Democrats presented last week and  keep pushing for are very reasonable. We want ICE simply to follow the  same standards that law enforcement agencies across the country already  follow.

I ask every Republican Senator: Go home. Ask your police officer or  ask your sheriff what rules they must abide by.

They are very similar to the rules that we are asking ICE to obey,  but right now, ICE is a rogue force. Lawlessness prevails when ICE  arrives.

If Republicans want to claim our proposals are nonstarters, they  should ask the people back home what they think of masked agents,  warrantless searches, and using kids as bait to arrest their parents.  These are not actions of real law enforcement. This is thuggery.

The American people need to see meaningful change, and our Republican  colleagues must work with us to make that change happen. No more rogue  police forces roaming through our cities. Support this legislation.
