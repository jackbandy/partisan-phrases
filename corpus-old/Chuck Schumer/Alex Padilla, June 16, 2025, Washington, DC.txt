Alex Padilla


Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, on Senator Padilla, what happened  last week to Senator Padilla was beyond the pale. I don't care who you  are or what your views are, there is never justification for Federal  agents to put their hands on a Member of the U.S. Senate, throw him  onto the ground, and cuff him for no reason other than he was doing his  job. The way agents treated Senator Padilla is what you see in  totalitarian regimes.

It is outrageous that Secretary Noem let this happen and then lied  about the incident after the fact. Neither the Senate, nor any member  of government, can tolerate a Member of this Chamber being treated in  this way. Secretary Noem has proven herself to be derelict in her  responsibilities.
