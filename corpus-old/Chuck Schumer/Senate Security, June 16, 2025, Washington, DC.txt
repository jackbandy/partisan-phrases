Senate Security


Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, as we convene, I want to start with  this: My highest priority right now is working with the Senate  leadership on both sides, the Senate Sergeant at Arms, and Capitol  Police to ensure everyone's safety. This weekend, I asked Capitol  Police and the Sergeant at Arms to increase the security for Members,  including Senator Padilla and the Minnesota Senators. Knowing that the  Sergeant at Arms, her entire operation, and the Capitol Police are  there to help us right now is comforting.

Tomorrow, the Senate will hold an all-Members' briefing, organized at  my request and that of Senator Thune, with the Sergeant at Arms, to  talk about security for Members. The Sergeant at Arms and Capitol  Police are doing an outstanding job and have bent over backwards, under  very difficult circumstances, to keep everyone safe. Tomorrow's  briefing will be a chance for them to convey what they are doing for  Members to keep them safe.
