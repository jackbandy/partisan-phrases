Nomination of Whitney D. Hermandorfer


Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on judicial confirmation, the first judge  confirmation, later today, Senate Republicans will confirm Donald  Trump's first judicial nominee of his second term, Whitney  Hermandorfer, to be a circuit judge on the Sixth Circuit.

We all know when it comes to judges Donald Trump cares only about one  thing: total unyielding fealty to Donald Trump--not experience, not  judicial independence, not knowledge or desire to pursue the law, but  brazen, uncomplicated fealty to Donald Trump. That is how he chooses  judges. That is how the people under him choose judges.

We have never seen this in America. You could have been a  conservative like Ronald Reagan, someone like George Bush or H.W. Bush  or Clinton or Obama. They all looked. You know, they wanted someone to  have some philosophical kinship with them. But they said: Will they  follow the law? Do they know this law?

Not this administration. It is so different than all the others in a  very bad way. Donald Trump doesn't care about the law or what the  Constitution says. He says that himself. He only wants his foot  soldiers in black robes defending him when he tries to do whatever he  wants.

Ms. Hermandorfer has failed to show that she can be an independent  jurist committed to upholding the law. She has less than 10 years of  legal experience. She has never served as the sole or chief counsel on  a single case. She has made a career out of going after people's  reproductive rights, transgender rights, and antidiscrimination  policies.

When nominees like Ms. Hermandorfer are the standard, our courts are  weakened; the judiciary runs amok; the American people are worse off.

I strongly--strongly--oppose her nomination.
