Minnesota Lawmakers Shootings


Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last night, law enforcement apprehended  the man suspected in the assassination of Minnesota State  Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband and the shootings of  State Senator John Hoffman and his wife.

We in the Senate thank our law enforcement for their remarkable work  in bringing the attacker into custody. As we have all seen, the  attacker planned to continue his killing spree had he not been thwarted  and had a list of over 70 public officials potentially targeted for  violence, including Members of the Senate. Naturally, a number of  Members in the Senate remain profoundly shaken. The victims were  friends of our colleagues from Minnesota. Some of them were together at  a dinner the night before the shooting. To think that one moment, you  can celebrate each other's company--laugh and joke, share a meal, a  drink--only for violence to strike the next moment makes us all sick to  our stomachs. It is haunting.

My prayers are with the families of the victims. I am heartbroken for  the loss of Representative Hortman and her husband. I can't get their  faces--those nice pictures of such nice people--out of my mind.

On the other hand, I am glad to hear Senator Hoffman and his wife are  making progress toward recovery. May God bless them all and their loved  ones.
