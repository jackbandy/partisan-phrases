Qatar


Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, now on Qatar, yesterday, reports came  out that the royal family of Qatar is set to gift Donald Trump a luxury  747 for him to use as his own Air Force One.

Without a shred of shame, Donald Trump will lecture families about  putting up with higher prices that he himself triggered and then accept  a $400 million private jet from the Qatari royal family. His shameless  self-enrichment is without equal in American history. You cannot think  of another President who has been so brazen, so selfish, and so  destructive of the norms of what America is about.

In truth, though, the news of the Qatari Air Force is just one tip of  the iceberg. For months, Qatar and other Gulf State nationals have  spent billions on deals with the Trump organizations to buy the  President.

Donald Trump is using his office to enrich himself and his family.  This isn't a question. This is a fact with incredible supporting data  to prove it. He is putting America's national security at risk to  enrich himself.

Just as concerning as the very gift are the national security  implications that surround it. The deeply chilling part of this bribe  and national security betrayal from the President is just how blatant  and erroneous he is doing it, almost daring Republicans to stand up to  him and defend our country--daring Republicans.

So where are our Republican friends with this kind of egregious,  grubby, awful enrichment? Silence and total obedience.
