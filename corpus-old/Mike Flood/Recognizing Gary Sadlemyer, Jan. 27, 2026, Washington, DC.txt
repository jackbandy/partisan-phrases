Recognizing Gary Sadlemyer


Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a pillar of  Nebraska broadcasting, Gary Sadlemyer, who, after nearly five decades  behind the microphone at KFAB News Radio, has officially retired.

Since first stepping into KFAB's studio in 1976, Gary's signature  voice has been trusted by generations of listeners.

From morning news to Nebraska football broadcasts, Gary's  professionalism, wit, and warmth made him not just a radio host, but a  friend to his audiences.

Gary's commitment to excellence earned him induction into the  Nebraska Broadcasters Association's Hall of Fame in 2011. Simply put:  Gary's impact on the people of Nebraska will endure long after his  final sign-off.

As he steps into this next chapter, Gary will enjoy more time with  his kids and grandkids.

Today, I join Nebraskans everywhere in thanking Gary Sadlemyer for  his decades of commitment to our state as a superb broadcaster and I  wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement.
