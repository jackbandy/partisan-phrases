Recognizing the 46th Anniversary of C-Span


Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 46th  anniversary of C-SPAN's coverage of the U.S. House of Representatives,  a milestone in government transparency.

For nearly five decades, since March of 1979, C-SPAN has provided the  American people with unfiltered gavel-to-gavel coverage of the debates  and the decisions that shape our Nation. It is a service that  strengthens our democracy and fosters accountability.

This incredible resource exists thanks to the commitment of  American's cable and satellite providers who voluntarily fund C-SPAN as  a nonprofit service.

Let's be clear. Millions of Americans are being denied access to this  vital coverage because major TV streaming platforms like YouTube TV and  Hulu + Live TV refuse to carry C-SPAN. At a time when trust in  government is more important than ever, no company should stand in the  way of public access to democracy and the inner workings of our  constitutional republic.

I urge YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV and all streaming providers to  do the right thing. Carry C-SPAN. Give their customers the same access  to government that cable and satellite viewers have. The American  people deserve nothing less.
