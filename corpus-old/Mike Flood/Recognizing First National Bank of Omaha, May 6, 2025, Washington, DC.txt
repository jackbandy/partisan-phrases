Recognizing First National Bank of Omaha


Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor and celebrate the  recent recognition of one of Nebraska's preeminent banks and a pillar  of the community it serves, First National Bank Omaha, better known as  FNBO.

FNBO has long led Nebraska's banking sector, especially in their  efforts to expand access to affordable housing across our State. By  engaging with local communities, listening to stakeholder feedback, and  leveraging the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka's Affordable Housing  Program, FNBO has become a driving force in promoting homeownership  across Nebraska.

Their dedication was recently recognized when FNBO was named Federal  Home Loan Bank of Topeka's overall Housing Champion of the Year. Along  with the honor, they received a $5,000 award, which is going to the  Nebraska Housing Developers Association.

All of Nebraska is proud of the work FNBO is doing in housing. I look  forward to seeing what they can do next to strengthen our communities  through more affordable housing.                    Celebrating 100 Years of Bryan Health

Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize and celebrate a  truly remarkable milestone for the city of Lincoln and the entire State  of Nebraska, the 100th Anniversary of Bryan Health.

Since first opening its doors in 1925, Bryan Health has grown from a  hospital in Lincoln into one of Nebraska's most innovative, trusted,  and patient-oriented healthcare networks.

Over the past century, Bryan Health has expanded its reach and  services to meet the needs of communities in Kearney, Crete, Grand  Island, Merrick County, and well beyond.

Bryan Health's commitment to compassionate care and medical  excellence continues to draw patients from across our State. Their  enduring mission puts patients, families, and their communities first,  and it has earned them the respect and gratitude of generations of  Nebraskans.

Once again, I congratulate all of Bryan Health's staff and medical  professionals for their 100 years of remarkable service and leadership  in healthcare.                     Rebel Robotic FTC World Championship

Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the next  generation of leaders and innovators emerging from my own hometown.  This inspiring group of young people is known as the Rebel Robotics FTC  team.

Rebel Robotics is a FIRST Tech Challenge team hailing proudly from  Norfolk, Nebraska. Founded in 2019, the team gives students the  opportunity to engage directly with cutting-edge technologies and  robotics shaping our future.

Most recently, Rebel Robotics stood out at the FIRST Championship  held this year in Houston, Texas. Competing against top teams from  across the country, they earned the prestigious Inspire Award, which  recognizes excellence in programming, robot design, engineering  portfolios, judged presentations, professionalism, as well as community  outreach.

The Inspire Award is the highest honor presented at the competition,  and it also means that Rebel Robotics secured a world championship  title in Houston.

I congratulate these exceptional high school students on their  achievements and for inspiring others to explore the world of robotics.
