Promises Made, Promises Kept


Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank our Conference chair for yielding.

Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to talk about the  work we did during our August work period, and the many opportunities I  had to meet with small businesses throughout the district to talk about  the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but I will highlight one of those  businesses.

It is in the heart of the 12th District of Georgia in Bulloch County,  home to Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, Georgia, the largest  university in my district.

Just a few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of visiting a family-owned  barbecue restaurant named Dolan's Bar-B-Q where I met the owner, Mary  Beth, and had a great conversation about her business, some of her  challenges, and how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will help address  some of those challenges.

Among the many things we discussed were specifically the no tax on  tips and no tax on overtime provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill  Act. Being that  Statesboro is a large college town, Mary Beth informed me that 95  percent of her staff are college students, young people simply looking  to earn pocket money while they pursue their degrees.

On average, Americans could receive up to $1,300 more from no taxes  on their tipped income. Imagine what this means to Mary Beth's  employees. We also discussed no tax on overtime. To quote Mary Beth:  During busy times like football season, we work a lot of overtime  because we are just so busy. We do a lot of catering during football  season so that helps give our team a lot of opportunity to get more  hours.

Again, this is additional income for her team and she is hopeful this  will help retain more permanent employees. I am so thankful to Mary  Beth and all the other small businesses for welcoming me, and I look  forward to visiting Dolan's Bar-B-Q again and enjoying a delicious  barbecue sandwich.
