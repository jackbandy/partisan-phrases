Congratulating Kai Agyemang


Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my constituent,  Kai Agyemang, upon his acceptance to the United States Air Force  Academy.

As a future cadet, he will be joining the ranks of the world's most  fearsome fighting force, the United States Air Force.

Guided by the motto ``Aim High . . . Fly-Fight-Win'' the U.S. Air  Force is the world's preeminent force in air, space, and cyberspace.

Throughout our history, American Airmen have demonstrated tremendous  courage and strength, beating back tyranny to the ends of the earth.

I was honored to sponsor Kai's nomination, and I am confident that  his talents will distinguish him among his peers both during his time  at Air Force Academy and thereafter.

I congratulate Kai. I know that he will make this Nation proud.
