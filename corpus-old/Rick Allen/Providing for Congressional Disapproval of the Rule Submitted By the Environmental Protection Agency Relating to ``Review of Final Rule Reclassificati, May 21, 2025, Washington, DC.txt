Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Environmental Protection Agency Relating to ``Review of Final Rule Reclassification of Major Sources As Area Sources Under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act''


Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from Texas for  yielding the time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 31 to overturn the  Biden administration's ``once in, always in'' rule. This is an  egregious and burdensome rule, and it was just one of many actions  taken by the previous administration on their way out the door to  further hamstring our domestic energy producers.

By permanently classifying certain industrial facilities as major  sources of hazardous air pollutants, even if they successfully reduce  emissions, the Biden administration was seemingly punishing job  creators for being good stewards of the environment.

As an original cosponsor of S.J. Res. 31, I am proud that House  Republicans are taking a stand and defending our energy producers,  manufacturers, and small businesses against unfair and costly  environmental rules.

In overturning the ``once in, always in'' rule, we are returning to  commonsense policy implemented during President Trump's first  administration. If businesses reduce their emissions below the major  source threshold, then they should reap the reward of more cost- effective and flexible requirements under the Clean Air Act, period.

Repealing this backward rule is part of House Republicans' work to  unleash American energy and ensure that government red tape does not  stand in the way of creating jobs and growing our economy here at home.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in  supporting S.J. Res. 31.
