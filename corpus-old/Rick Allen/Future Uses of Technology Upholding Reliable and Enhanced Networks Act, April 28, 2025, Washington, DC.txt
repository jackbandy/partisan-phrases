Future Uses of Technology Upholding Reliable and Enhanced Networks Act


Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Florida, Mr.  Bilirakis, for yielding.

As vice chairman of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee, I  rise today in support of the bipartisan FUTURE Networks Act, which I  proudly introduced with my colleagues, Representative Matsui and  Representative Walberg.

This commonsense legislation would direct the FCC to bring together  industry leaders, public interest groups, and government experts to  establish a 6G Task Force.

As we all know, 6G is the future of telecommunications, and we must  ensure that the United States is a global leader in this emerging  technology. Failure to do so would put our adversaries, like the  Chinese Communist Party, in the driver's seat. We cannot allow that to  happen.

I come from the world of business and just like in business we want  the best, most qualified individuals to have a seat at the table. By  establishing a 6G Task Force, we can bring together America's brightest  industry leaders, stakeholders, and innovators to collaborate on the  future deployment of 6G and strengthening our wireless networks.

This is a matter of economic and national security. I was proud to  help lead the FUTURE Networks Act this Congress. I strongly encourage  all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2449.
