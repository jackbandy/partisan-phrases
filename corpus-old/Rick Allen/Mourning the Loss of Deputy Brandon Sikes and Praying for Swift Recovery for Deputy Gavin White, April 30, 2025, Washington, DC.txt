Mourning the Loss of Deputy Brandon Sikes and Praying for Swift Recovery for Deputy Gavin White


Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart this evening. On  Saturday, April 26, Columbia County in my district experienced an  unimaginable tragedy as one of our beloved law enforcement officers,  Deputy Brandon Sikes, lost his life and Deputy Gavin White was severely  injured while serving a temporary protective order.

This heartbreaking event serves as a profound reminder of their  commitment to selfless service. As they often do, these officers choose  to prioritize the safety of others above themselves, even in a life- threatening situation.

While our community grieves this tragic loss, I am reminded of John  15:13, ``Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his  life for his friends.''

Mr. Speaker, please join me in praying for Deputy Sikes' wife, Amber,  their daughter, Lyndsey, and all of Brandon's loved ones as they  continue to mourn this fallen hero.

Please also join me in praying for a swift recovery for Deputy White,  as well as Sheriff Whittle and the entire Columbia County Sheriff's  Department.

May God's grace be with our entire community as we continue to heal  from this tragedy.
