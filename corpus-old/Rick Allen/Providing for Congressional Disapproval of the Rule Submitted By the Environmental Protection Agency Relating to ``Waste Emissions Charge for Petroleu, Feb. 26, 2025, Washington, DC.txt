Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Environmental Protection Agency Relating to ``Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems: Procedures for Facilitating Compliance, Including Netting and Exemptions''


Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Griffith for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, it is a new day in America. I remind my friends that,  just 6 years ago, we had the greatest economy in our lifetimes, and we  achieved energy independence. That is what this day is about.

The days of weakness on the world stage and dependence on foreign  adversaries for our energy needs are over.

I am proud to rise in support of H.J. Res. 35 to repeal the Biden  administration's harmful rule establishing a natural gas tax and help  the United States reclaim energy dominance.

The Biden administration had an all-out war on fossil fuel. On their  way out the door, the previous administration finalized this burdensome  rule to effectively collect taxes on methane emissions released from  oil and gas facilities and funnel that money to their radical climate  allies.

What my Democratic colleagues won't tell you is that our clean  natural gas is a major reason why the U.S. has become a world leader in  reducing carbon emissions.

In partnership with President Trump, House Republicans are  reinstating common sense in Washington. To lower costs for American  families, we must unleash our energy capabilities and utilize the  reliable natural gas right under our feet, not impose these outlandish  taxes on domestic producers.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge support of H.J. Res. 35.
