Harlem High School Baseball Field Named After Legendary Coach Jimmie Lewis


Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate legendary Coach  Jimmie Lewis, whose name will now be displayed at the Harlem High  School baseball field for years and years to come. Coach Lewis has been  the dedicated leader of the Harlem High School baseball program for  decades, securing eight state titles and over 900 impressive wins--the  3rd highest in Georgia High School Association history. This is no  small feat, and I cannot think of anyone more deserving of this honor.

However, Jimmie Lewis is far more than a coach in this community and  at Harlem High School. He is a family man, a role model, a teacher, and  a molder of men who has devoted his life to ensuring young students  learn the skills and lessons necessary to be successful not only on the  baseball field, but in life.

I am honored to help Coach Lewis celebrate this occasion and the  positive, lifelong impact he has had on so many lives. Congratulations  to Coach Lewis. Go Bulldogs.
