Congratulating Wyatt Spaulding


Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my constituent,  Wyatt Spaulding, upon his acceptance to the United States Military  Academy at West Point.

As a future cadet, he will be joining the ranks of the world's most  fearsome fighting force--the United States Army--guided by duty, honor,  and country.

The service and sacrifice of America's military personnel have  safeguarded our Nation since its inception, defending our way of life  from Lexington to Normandy.

And throughout our history, American soldiers have demonstrated  tremendous courage and strength, beating back tyranny to the ends of  the earth.

I was glad to sponsor Wyatt's nomination, and I am confident that his  talents will distinguish him among his peers both during his time at  West Point and thereafter.

I congratulate Wyatt. I know that he will make this Nation proud.
