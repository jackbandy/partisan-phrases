Removal of the Use of United States Forces for Hostilities Within or Against Venezuela


Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is absolutely right, the  Constitution is crystal clear that only Congress can start a war.  However, in their deliberations on this subject, the Founders also made  clear that they were leaving the President certain limited inherent  power to react to an attack. For example, he can order up defensive  measures or hot pursuit of an enemy or retaliatory strikes. That is the  distinction they debated when they substituted ``declare war'' instead  of ``make war'' among Congress' enumerated powers.

The supporters of this resolution are correct. Congress has to  initiate hostilities, but neither of these resolutions are applicable  to current events. H. Con. Res. 64 orders the President to remove  forces from Venezuela that are not in Venezuela. Until and unless they  are, this is at best an empty partisan exercise. Worse, it could be  construed to constrain his inherent powers in the event of an attack by  Venezuela that requires an immediate response.

H. Con. Res. 61 orders him to cease attacks on terrorist groups,  presumably the drug runners, but these are unflagged vessels carrying  contraband in international waters. An attack on them is not an  attack on a foreign power and, therefore, not an act of war. It is akin  to firing on Somali pirates menacing international shipping.

If the President launched an unprovoked attack on Venezuela or  Venezuelan-flagged vessels without congressional declaration, we should  have this debate. Until then, I think the Democrats would do well not  to cry wolf on such an important matter.
