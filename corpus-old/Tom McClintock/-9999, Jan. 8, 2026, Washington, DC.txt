Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the Romans had a saying: ``Time is  fleeting, remember death''; ``Tempus fugit, memento mori.'' It reminds  us that life is not a gift. It is just a loan, and when it comes due,  all that matters is what we have given to others.

Doug LaMalfa was the kindest and most sincere person I have  encountered in more than 40 years of public service. He passionately  defended the working men and women of the rural community where he was  born and raised and grew up, but he always did it with a good-natured  smile and a quiet, respectful manner.

Just 3 weeks ago, on December 15, I took my seat on an early  Washington-bound flight from Sacramento, about eight rows behind Doug.

When I looked up, he was standing there in the aisle with an  outstretched hand. He leaned over, and he quietly said to me: Tom, I  know this is a hard day for you, and I want you to know that my prayers  are with you and Lori.

You see, that was the fourth anniversary of my dear wife Lori's  death, and how he knew that, remembered it, and offered such warm  comfort on such a cold morning tells you what a truly caring and  wonderful man he was. And now he is gone, for time is fleeting.

Yet, death can't take the kindnesses and memories that he gave us  all, or the wisdom, common sense, and achievements that he gave our  country. Our Nation, our State, and our community have all suffered an  irreplaceable loss, and rural America has lost its most tireless and  effective advocate. Most of all, we have lost a good man, a very good  man.

To his family, I can only say that you are not alone in your grief.  Your community and your country grieve with you.
