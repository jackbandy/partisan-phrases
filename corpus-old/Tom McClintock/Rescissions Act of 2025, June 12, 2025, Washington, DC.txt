Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, this is the first of what needs to be  many rescission bills stopping the waste of public funds.

The absurd expenditures the majority leader just listed speak volumes  about the scandalous corruption and carelessness of a bloated  government. Every dollar comes from working American families  struggling to pay both their bills and their taxes.

Now, this waste is enabled by two classes of expenditures that we  should foreswear forever. One is grants, cash handouts to political  favorites with little accountability or oversight, whether directly or  through agencies like USAID. The other is subsidies that replace the  judgment of consumers with that of politicians, distorting the flow of  capital from its highest and best use.

As we express our outrage at this waste and take this first step to  claw it back, let us remember that Congress approved all of it, and it  is time that we repented before we bankrupt our country.
