Critical Mineral Dominance Act


Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, take a good look around you. Everything  you see wherever you look, everything that makes your life comfortable,  everything that makes your life possible--everything--is either mined,  or it is grown. There are no exceptions. Everything you enjoy and  depend upon is either mined or grown from the ground. The generation  that built our country understood this.

Mr. Speaker, over the chair from which you preside is emblazoned the  prayer from Daniel Webster, which reads: ``Let us develop the resources  of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote  all its great interests and see whether we also in our day and  generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.''

Yet, for 50 years, the environmental left has torn down these great  achievements and waged war against everything that is mined or grown.  They have piled tax upon tax, restriction upon restriction, and  regulation upon regulation that have made mining and agriculture  increasingly expensive and needlessly scarce.

That is the heart of the affordability crisis. The left has turned  abundance into scarcity. Finally, in our day, a new generation is  discovering that this self-destructive lunacy is not going to end well.

That brings us to this bill to reduce the regulatory burdens that the  left has imposed upon our Nation's ability to prosper and advance. It  codifies President Trump's executive orders that identify the resources  that we can develop and calls forth the powers of prosperity that those  resources promise.

It restores freedom to meet the challenge that Daniel Webster set  before us by realigning our institutions on behalf of the American  people so that we too can perform something worthy to be remembered, to  make America great again.
