American Entrepreneurs First Act of 2025


Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, today the House advances another pillar of  President Trump's America First agenda with the passage of the American  Entrepreneurs First Act of 2025.

This bill ensures that taxpayer-funded SBA loans are reserved for  American small businesses, not illegal aliens, certainly not children  or people who are dead.

Americans are grateful to finally have a President in office who is  protecting their taxpayer dollars and looking to weed out waste, fraud,  and abuse. Billions of loans have been flagged for suspected fraud and  ineligible applicants, including illegal aliens.

The Trump administration has instituted a policy requiring SBA loan  applications to include citizenship verification provisions. It is  common sense. This bill codifies these Trump-era safeguards into law so  that no future administration can turn Federal relief into a global  giveaway.

This is about ensuring we have the validation mechanisms in place to  ensure the rule of law. It is about prioritizing Americans. It is about  making sure that when a small business owner like those in Texas, or  anywhere else, fills out an application, they know the system is fair  and the resources are theirs to access.

With every bill codifying President Trump's EOs, we are moving closer  to a government that puts America first, protects American workers, and  restores American sovereignty.

Let's support this bill.
