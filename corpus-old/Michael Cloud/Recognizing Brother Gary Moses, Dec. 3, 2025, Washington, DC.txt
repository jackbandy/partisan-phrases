Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride to honor one of  the most beloved sons of the Texas 27th Congressional District, Brother  Gary Moses of Victoria, Texas.

For more than 50 years, Brother Gary has been the heartbeat of  Victoria and the entire Crossroads region. As a longtime educator at  Patti Welder Middle School, a legendary radio voice on Majic 95.9, and  Victoria's undisputed ambassador of joy, he has touched countless lives  with his infectious smile and genuine love for every person he meets.

Whether Brother Gary is emceeing the Gorgeous Grandma Pageant,  championing the Marine Toys for Tots on television commercials, firing  up the crowd at Riverside Stadium for the Victoria Generals, or leading  the Christmas parade, Brother Gary shows up with enthusiasm that lifts  the entire community.

At 73 years young, Brother Gary is always reminding us that, in  Victoria, we are all family. His nickname, Brother Gary, is not just a  radio handle. It is the truest description of how he treats everyone he  encounters. Residents make sure he is invited to every celebration  because they know an event simply isn't complete without Brother Gary's  presence.

Mr. Speaker, Brother Gary Moses embodies the very best of the Texas  spirit: faith, family, and hard work. On behalf of the people of the  27th Congressional District and the countless lives he has brightened,  I am proud to recognize him today and thank him for reminding us all of  how one person truly can make a difference and make a community feel  like a home.
