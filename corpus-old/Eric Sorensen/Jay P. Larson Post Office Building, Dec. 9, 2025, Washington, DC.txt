Jay P. Larson Post Office Building


Mr. SORENSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation,  H.R. 2466, which will redesignate the Rockford post office on Harrison  Avenue in honor of Jay Larson.

I thank the chair and ranking member for their support, and my  colleague on the other side of the aisle, Darin LaHood, for partnering  with me in this effort.

Jay Larson was born and raised in the same hometown as me. We are  proud to have been from Rockford, Illinois. In fact, Jay was also proud  to share the same high school as myself, Boylan Central Catholic High  School.

Jay served in our community as a letter carrier for 25 years, but  here is the thing: He never took a sick day because delivering the mail  was more than a job for Jay. Everyone who knew him told me of a man who  was proud to take care of his neighbors, whether it be caring smiles or  conversation, thoughtful gestures, and the occasional treat for his  furry friends along the route.

To his fellow letter carriers, Jay was well known for his willingness  to lend a hand, often helping others with their routes after he  finished his own. As one of those colleagues summed it up: ``He made  everyone feel like you were the most important person in the world at  that time.''

Jay is the definition of an exemplary public servant and a good  neighbor.

His last mail route was March 27, 2024. Jay was killed in a senseless  and violent attack while on the job.

As we approach the 2-year anniversary of this tragedy, it is my hope  that renaming the main Rockford post office in Jay's honor will offer a  testament to his service while giving our city something else to be  proud of.

Mr. Speaker, Jay Larson is worthy of this honor and worthy of our  memory. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
