Mr. SORENSEN. Mr. Speaker, looking around this room, I ask: Shouldn't  our government benefit those we represent back home?

However, what is being presented by my Republican colleagues today is  a plan that would gut healthcare for 152,483 of my neighbors at home  who depend on Medicaid, more than 66,000 kids under the age of 19. Ten  thousand seniors back home rely on Medicaid in Illinois' 17th District  for their nursing home coverage.

While you may see this as a numbers game in a budget, I see families.  I see neighbors. I see loved ones.

Let me let you in on a secret because there aren't any Republicans in  this room. There are more Republican constituents of mine that are  calling my office saying: We may have voted for Donald Trump, but we  didn't vote for him to do this.

This is cruel and unusual punishment to single out everyday  Americans, making them go without.

Also, billionaire donors and big corporations get tax breaks to make  them more wealthy.

Let's get back to doing the work for the American people who need us  to do this work the most.
