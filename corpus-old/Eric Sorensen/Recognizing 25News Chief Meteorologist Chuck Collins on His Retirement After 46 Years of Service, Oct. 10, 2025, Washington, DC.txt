Recognizing 25News Chief Meteorologist Chuck Collins on His Retirement After 46 Years of Service


Mr. SORENSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Chuck  Collins, a broadcaster who has kept our district safe from storms for  nearly a half century.

Next week, 25News Chief Meteorologist Chuck Collins, will be walking  away from the green screen. Chuck is a legend in the heart of Illinois,  offering a calm voice that is trusted in the best weather and the worst  storms.

He grew up in Central Illinois and, I may know something about doing  weather in your hometown, there's almost nothing more rewarding.  Chuck's recognition will now live in the official Congressional Record  for inspiring weather watchers, storm chasers, and other  meteorologists. We will all be watching his final broadcast on October  15, 2025.

Today, I thank Chuck Collins for his decades of commitment to Central  Illinois, and I extend my best wishes to him in retirement.
