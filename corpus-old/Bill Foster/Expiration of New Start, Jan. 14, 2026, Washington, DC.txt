Expiration of New Start


Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to open the Special Order hour  to discuss the expiration of the New START treaty, the importance of  arms control, and the urgent need to strengthen global nuclear  security.

I thank the Members who will be joining me this evening for their  leadership and their willingness to engage on issues that carry  existential consequences for our country and for the world.

As many of my colleagues know, I am the only Ph.D. physicist  currently serving in the United States Congress. Before coming to  Congress, I spent more than two decades as a high-energy particle  physicist and particle accelerator designer at Fermi National  Accelerator Laboratory, where we were smashing together protons and  antiprotons to make particles that have not been around since the big  bang, designing and building the big particle accelerators and  detectors, and analyzing the data. I was on the team that discovered  the top quark, the heaviest known form of matter.

Because of that background, I feel a special responsibility to engage  deeply on issues of nuclear weapons, arms control, and strategic  stability, not as abstract policy debates but as matters grounded in  technical reality.

Arms control is not about unilateral disarmament, wishful thinking,  fantasies of dominance, or trusting adversaries. Arms control is about  verifiable limits, predictability, and reducing the risk of  miscalculation between nuclear-armed states.

For decades, arms control agreements have helped prevent a  catastrophic nuclear exchange, not by eliminating deterrence but by  stabilizing it.

The New START treaty, which stands for Strategic Arms Reduction  Treaty, was signed in 2010 and extended in 2021. It is the last  remaining bilateral nuclear arms control agreement between the United  States and the Russian Federation.

New START places verifiable limits on deployed strategic nuclear  weapons and delivery systems and provides for data exchanges,  notifications, and onsite inspections that give us direct insight into  Russia's nuclear forces.

New START followed a long line of arms control agreements, from SALT  to START I to SORT, that helped reduce the global nuclear arsenal from  the Cold War highs of more than 70,000 weapons to fewer than 13,000  today. These agreements were supported by Democratic and Republican  administrations alike because they made the United States safer.

Under New START, the United States does not rely on guesswork, on  satellite imagery alone, or on worst-case assumptions. We rely on  legally binding limits and on verification  measures backed by some of the most sophisticated scientific and  intelligence capabilities of the world.

Today, that system is fraying. Russia has suspended its participation  in New START. Onsite inspections remain paused. The treaty itself is  set to expire in less than 1 month.

Anyone who remembers past arms control negotiations understands the  gravity of this moment. Negotiating a successor agreement will take  years, not months, and we are already past the danger zone.

If New START expires without a replacement, there will be no legally  binding limits on the world's two largest nuclear arsenals for the  first time in more than half a century. The consequences of that  outcome would be serious and immediate.

The United States would lose treaty-mandated insight into Russia's  deployed nuclear forces. Both countries would be free to increase the  number of deployed warheads on existing missiles. Strategic planning  would increasingly be driven by worst-case assumptions rather than  verified facts. At the same time, we would face a far more complex  nuclear environment than during the Cold War.

China is rapidly expanding its nuclear forces. Russia continues to  engage in irresponsible nuclear saber-rattling during its illegal war  in Ukraine, and Iran and North Korea continue to change the global  nonproliferation regime.

In this environment, allowing arms control to collapse is not a show  of strength. It is an abdication of leadership that increases the risk  of miscalculation of arms races and, ultimately, nuclear use by design  or by accident.

Verification will be at the heart of any future arms control effort,  and this is where America's scientific enterprise plays a critical  role. Our national laboratories provide the technical backbone for  verification, monitoring, and treaty compliance, and they are essential  to maintaining U.S. leadership in this area.

As co-chair of the Bipartisan National Labs Caucus, I have seen  firsthand how investments in science and scientific talent directly  translate into national security.

If you are a Member of Congress, you have the opportunity, if you  ask, to go into the room where you see our nuclear weapons taken apart.  You talk to the experts about why the design choices were made, what  the design margins are, and why they have to be built the way they are.  If you walk into that room and see those weapons and think about what  they are capable of, if that doesn't make you take your job seriously,  you are not thinking clearly.

Verification is not a diplomatic afterthought. It is a scientific  challenge that demands sustained investment and expertise.

The choice before us is not between arms control and national  security because arms control is national security. It remains one of  the most effective tools we have to reduce nuclear risk while  maintaining a credible deterrent.

The expiration of New START without a successor would mark a  dangerous turning point, signaling that restraint and verification no  longer matter.

This Special Order hour is about sounding the alarm, but it is also  about reaffirming that Congress has a responsibility to engage.  Congress has a role in oversight, a role in funding verification and  nonproliferation, and a role in insisting that arms control remains a  core pillar of the U.S. national security policy.

The next few years will be decisive, and decisions that we make or  fail to make will shape whether the world moves toward stability or  toward, once again, unconstrained nuclear arms races.

I look forward to the discussion this evening.

I am now proud to introduce my colleague,   John Garamendi of  California, a longtime advocate for arms control, with whom I have had  the honor of spending a weekend underneath the north polar ice cap in a  nuclear submarine.

Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.

Mr. Speaker, I have to say the gentleman is absolutely right about  the messaging that is surrounding the Golden Dome effort. This is a  system that has never been tested against countermeasures that we know  our adversaries have. For 40 years physicists have been patiently  explaining to Members of Congress and members of the administrations  that systems like this will never work at the reliability level that  they need. For 40 years we have been howling at the wind, I guess,  because we don't have hundreds of billions of dollars to waste on a  system that you can calculate from elementary principles that doesn't  have a chance of working and has failed the majority of times it has  been tried.

For those who have not, please take the time to see a recently  produced movie called ``A House of Dynamite.'' It is a recent one that  actually talks about what a modern nuclear war would look like from the  point of view of the participants who have to make those decisions and  the equipment and provisions they have to aid those decisions.

Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the many excellent  points he made, one of which was how foolish it would be for the United  States to resume testing of nuclear weapons.

The fact is, the United States has the best database of nuclear test  results of any country on Earth by far. If we resume nuclear testing,  we will, as will all the other nuclear-capable countries on Earth, they  will rub their hands with glee, and soon they will have a dataset of  performance of their weapons that is as good as ours. We have a  tremendous advantage, and this would be a foolish way to give it away.

I now yield to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Hoyle).

Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman is absolutely right about  the real costs of restarting the arms race.

As a physicist, I have some guilt, frankly, collective guilt for  physicists about some of the irresponsible things that were done during  the arms race when we said the only thing that was important was to  have better weapons and more weapons than our adversaries, and forget  about the damage that it can inflict on our American soldiers, our  American workers, and the populations downwind.

Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern).

Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Massachusetts is  absolutely right. Diplomacy is not a lost cause. There have been some  big wins from diplomacy.

Back when I was younger, the number of countries possessing nuclear  weapons was higher and then decreased. We convinced, through diplomacy,  South Africa to give up their nuclear weapons. At the time of the end  of the Soviet empire, Ukraine possessed the world's third-largest  nuclear weapon inventory, which they voluntarily gave up in return for  a guarantee of territorial integrity--one, unfortunately, which we are  not abiding by.

Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Takano for reminding us of  Hiroshima.

Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity for the first time in my life to  visit, and the things that stick in your mind are hard to describe.

One of them is they have the steps of--I think it was a bank. Someone  was sitting on the steps, having a meal, when the nuclear weapon went  off overhead. All that remained of that person after his or her entire  body was vaporized was a shadow of where they were sitting on those  steps.

The power of these weapons is not easy to describe. I can calculate  it. The descriptions of the survivors are worth spending a day just  listening to and trying to understand what is at risk here.

Titus).

Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I have to say Ms. Titus is absolutely right  about the fact that there is no necessity to resume nuclear testing.

We have a very extensive program. It is called the Stockpile  Stewardship Program. Every year or so, the heads of the weapons labs  and the head of NSA have to sign a document to the President that says:  If you push the button, these weapons will detonate at their designed  yields.

The reason they are confident to do that is we have a lot of test  data from the nearly 1,000 tests--many of them took place in Nevada-- and the extensive data we have and the fact that we can then put that  data back into simulation programs to get the right answer.

Mr. Speaker, that tells us that these will work and they will work  with design margin. Even if small things go wrong, the device will  work. That is what our opponents have to know. We don't need to test.  If we decide to use them, they will work.

It is an important thing to bear in mind, because our adversaries,  many of them, have weapons that they have not tested, and they don't  really know how well they will work. We do because we have some of the  most, I have to say, beautifully designed weapons that I could ever  imagine that could have existed.

Mr. Speaker, as we conclude this Special Order hour, it is important  to restate a fundamental reality that nuclear weapons remain one of the  greatest existential threats facing humanity. For more than a half of a  century, the United States has worked across administrations and across  party lines to reduce the risk that those weapons will ever be used.

Arms control agreements like New START have been central to that  effort, providing real, enforceable, and verifiable limits on the  world's most destructive arsenals. The extension of New START is set to  expire, and with it goes the last remaining treaty that limits and  monitors the world's two largest nuclear arsenals.

As New START expires without a successor, we would lose onsite  inspections, data exchanges, and mutual visibility into the Russian  nuclear forces. That loss does not make the United States safer or  stronger. It increases uncertainty. It fuels worst-case assumptions and  raises the risk of a dangerous miscalculation.

That is why I am proud to be leading H. Res. 100, which calls on both  Russia and the United States to continue abiding by the numerical  limits set under New START, even in the absence of a successor treaty.

I thank the 24 Members of the House, several of whom spoke here  tonight, who have cosponsored that resolution. Maintaining those limits  are an essential step to preserve strategic stability while we work on  future arms control.

I thank the many organizations and nonprofits who helped drive  interest in this Special Order hour and who work every day to reduce  nuclear risk. Those organizations play a vital role in public  education, policy development, and maintaining dialogue during times  when official channels are strained or closed.

Finally, I thank all of my colleagues who joined me tonight in this  Special Order hour. Preventing nuclear war has never been a partisan  goal, and history shows that bipartisan cooperation is not just  possible, but it is necessary. The choices that we make in the coming  months will shape global security for decades to come, so I urge all of  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recommit to arms control,  to verification, and to the hard work of reducing nuclear risk.
