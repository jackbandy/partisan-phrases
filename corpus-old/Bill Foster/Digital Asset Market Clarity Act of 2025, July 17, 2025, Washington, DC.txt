Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025


Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the CLARITY Act,  which claims to bring digital assets under a regulatory umbrella but  fails in two major areas.

First, it fails because it has no KYC--know your customer-- requirements for self-hosted wallets. It allows anonymous trading on  DeFi exchanges and the dark web, which means there is no way to prevent  wash trading, front running, corruption, ransomware, extortion and  kidnapping payoffs, and all the parade of horribles that unregulated  crypto has unleashed upon the world.

This legislation simply applies a patina of regulation while  codifying loopholes that leave large parts of the industry, including  the President's own meme coin schemes, completely unregulated.

Secondly, the CLARITY Act also lacks the basic investor protections  present in the securities laws. For example, firms are not required to  serve the best interests of their investors or to separate critical  market functions and many other basic protections.

Now, I am not ideologically opposed to crypto, and both of these  flaws are fixable, but in CLARITY they have not been fixed.

Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no.''
