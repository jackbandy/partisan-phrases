Recognizing Nancy Merkling for Receiving the Robert O. Covey Business of the Year Award


Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nancy Merkling for  receiving the Robert O. Covey Business of the Year Award. This award  pays tribute to the late Robert O. Covey and celebrates businesses in  the Crystal Lake area that have demonstrated outstanding success and  community involvement.

As the owner and producer of Nancy Merkling Productions, Ms. Merkling  offers professional photography and mentorship services, inspiring and  guiding others who are pursuing careers in the field. Her vision and  artistry distinguish her work in family portraits, headshots, and  commercial photography.

Ms. Merkling has long demonstrated a deep commitment to the arts. She  previously served as the Co-Executive Director of the Lakeside Legacy  Foundation, an organization dedicated to preserving The Dole, a  historic mansion in Crystal Lake, for the community to enjoy.

Since 2011, Ms. Merkling has been the driving force behind the 4th  Fridays Art Event at The Dole, which brings together photography, art,  and music to enrich the local cultural landscape. Held ten times a  year, this program fosters collaboration among a diverse range of  artists and provides a vibrant social space that celebrates creative  expression. Through her vision, Ms. Merkling has significantly  contributed to the cultural vitality of Crystal Lake, creating valuable  opportunities for artists to share their work with the community.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent Nancy Merkling, whose dedication  as both an artist and a mentor has made a lasting impact on our  community. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ms.  Merkling on receiving this well-deserved recognition.
