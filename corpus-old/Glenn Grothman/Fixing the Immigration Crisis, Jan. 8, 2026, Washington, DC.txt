Fixing the Immigration Crisis


Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I attended a hearing today in the  Judiciary Committee. There was some confusion in the committee about  what we should be doing to enforce our immigration laws and who is at  fault for the mess we have in Minneapolis.

There are some people who are apparently under the impression we  should only enforce our immigration laws if the people who came here  illegally commit another crime. If we think about it for 2 seconds,  that is completely ridiculous.

Right now, every year in this country, about 850,000 new citizens are  naturalized citizens. When I was a child, that was under 200,000. That  is without taking into account people who become citizens because of  birthright citizenship, which is not even intended under our  Constitution.

We must not fall for the idea that all a person has to do is sneak  across the border and hang around here and not commit a felony and,  therefore, they come in here.

I feel so sorry for our great President Trump. He was left with such  a mess when Joe Biden let in 10 million people, and he is now honor  bound to remove them from this country. That is why we have a mess in  Minneapolis.
