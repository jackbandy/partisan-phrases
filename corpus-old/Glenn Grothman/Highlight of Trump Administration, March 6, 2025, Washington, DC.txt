Highlight of Trump Administration


Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will discuss the biggest highlight of  the Trump administration so far, and that is what he has done at the  border. We have gone from having over 300,000 people a month trying to  get into this country to under 8,000 in February.

That shows that, with a little bit of determination, we can enforce  our immigration laws.

Mr. Speaker, there was an important hearing that was not covered  enough in this Congress this week. In the Oversight and Government  Reform Committee, we brought in four Democratic mayors who refused to  say that our immigration laws should be enforced.

It is very difficult for President Trump to protect our country when  we have elected officials, mayors and Governors from around the  country, in essence saying: We are going to stand in the way of  enforcing our immigration laws.

It is time for the American people to stand up and tell their local  officials that we want our immigration laws enforced. It is very  difficult to enforce them if local law enforcement or social services  are not on board.
