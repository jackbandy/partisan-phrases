Recognizing John Nagle


Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, there are good days and bad days in this  building. Today, we have a little bit of a happy day and sad day in the  Grothman office.

John Nagle, part of my policy shop, is leaving today. He is a great  guy. He is the pride of Poway, California. While it is our loss, it is  going to be the gain of the Pacific Legal Foundation.

I will say one more time, I thank John for all the help he has given  me. He is welcome to come back to our office again and again when he is  on the Hill.
