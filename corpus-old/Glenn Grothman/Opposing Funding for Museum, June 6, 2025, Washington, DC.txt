Opposing Funding for Museum


Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I stand today to defend President Trump in  one of his initial requests for next year's budget.

One of the goals of the Biden administration, of course, could  destroy the country by having unfettered immigration, but also to  divide America by groups. Part of that was when he passed one of his  big bills, and he put in there an American Hispanic museum. This is  consistent with the Democratic policy of trying to divide America.

Our motto put in place in 1782 was E Pluribus Unum, Out of Many, One.  The Democrats are trying to teach people they should always walk around  hanging on to where their ancestors came from.

President Trump is right not to fund a national Hispanic museum. The  wonderful accomplishments of the Hispanic Americans can be placed in  other museums, including the National Museum of American History,  without having every group having their own separate museum.
