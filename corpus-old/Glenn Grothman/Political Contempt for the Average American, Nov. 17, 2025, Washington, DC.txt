Political Contempt for the Average American


Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on that last  debate for a second. We are in danger in this country. One of the ways  we are in danger is that there are certain politicians who are becoming  more and more prominent and who have a contempt for the average  American.

Sadly, I have seen this happen more and more over time in the  Democratic Party. We have seen it in their higher offices where Kamala  Harris was handpicked by the billionaires. We saw it where everybody  else had to clear the decks for Joe Biden to become President after  these offices were determined and nominees were determined for many  years in primaries. The same thing happened in Wisconsin in a U.S.  Senate seat.

We now see it happening in Congress where a sitting U.S. Congressman  handpicks his successor. Of all successors, he picks a staffer. There  is such contempt for the average people. I am sure these are people who  have worked for years in the Democratic Party or years in various,  different local elections. They are being shoved aside so that an  insider can grab the slot.

Mr. Speaker, in any event, I thank my colleague from Washington for  bringing this forward.
