This Country Has Immigration Laws


Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, during a committee hearing I attended  yesterday, immigration was a topic that was brought up and it seemed  apparent to me that the party on the other side of the aisle didn't  understand why we have immigration laws.

First of all, it is a complete insult to the over 800,000 people who  are sworn in as new citizens in this country annually. Secondly, we  have to make sure the next generation of Americans here think like  Americans and fit in our culture, which means they are law-abiding.

Just in general, the idea of having a million people breaking the law  to come here, saying they need asylum when they don't, means they are  not going to fit in with our culture.

Finally, I will share a word from Mark Reihl, back from my State  legislative days, of the carpenters union. Again and again, he would  come into my office saying that his guys, his union carpenters, were  being undercut by people coming here illegally, and he demanded that we  crack down on that. Illegal immigration drives down wages of Americans  who are already here.

We heard that yesterday as the Democrats were claiming that if you  kicked out the illegals the cost of things will go up, as they will.
