Recognizing Gail Acampora


Mr. McGUIRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Gail Acampora from  Prospect, Virginia. I am lucky enough to call Gail a close friend of  mine. She has always been interested in politics and is an avid  supporter of President Trump.

In 2021, Gail was diagnosed with lung cancer. She has had a lobe and  lymph nodes removed and went through tough chemotherapy. Unfortunately,  she is still fighting after another cancer diagnosis.

Her strong faith in God and positive attitude will keep her on the  road to recovery.

Tracy and I are with Gail, and I know she is going to fight hard and  beat this thing. I ask that everyone include her in your prayers.
