Recognizing Rick Grizzell


Mr. McGUIRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a good and selfless  neighbor in Virginia's Fifth Congressional District, my friend, Rick  Grizzell, from Goochland County, Virginia.

After Hurricane Helene swept through the Carolinas, Tennessee, and  Virginia last year, Virginians across the Commonwealth answered the  call.

Rick formed a team of Virginians, in conjunction with the Goochland  County Tea Party, to collect donations and take them to folks in need.  They collected and delivered tents, propane tanks, sleeping bags,  winter clothes, heaters, food and water, and much more.

As recently as last week, Rick received a call on Monday and  delivered supplies on Tuesday. Rick and his team save lives with his  work, and I am extremely privileged to recognize a hero like Rick  Grizzell.
