Recognizing Gleaning for the World


Mr. McGUIRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gleaning For The  World, a Christian-based nonprofit in my district, Virginia-05, that  helps people recover from disasters.

Mr. Speaker, they have distributed over 100 million pounds of  humanitarian aid around the globe. When devastating floods hit  southwest Virginia due to Hurricane Helene and when southwest Virginia  was hit by harmful snowstorms, Gleaning For The World answered the  call.

During my first district work period this year, I visited Gleaning  For The World's headquarters in Appomattox County. I was moved by their  compassion for their fellow man and their willingness to give to  others.

Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the cheerful givers of Gleaning For  The World, and I am honored to have them as my constituents.
