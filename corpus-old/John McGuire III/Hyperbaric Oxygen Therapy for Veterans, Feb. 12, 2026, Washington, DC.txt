Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy for Veterans


Mr. McGUIRE. Mr. Speaker, Charlottesville Hyperbarics has become a  frontline in the fight for veterans suffering from the invisible wounds  of war.

They recently launched the Hyperbaric Wellness Foundation and have  partnered with the HOW Foundation to provide hyperbaric oxygen therapy  to veterans battling PTSD or other traumatic brain injury.

Additionally, generous grants from the Department of Veterans Affairs  have allowed them to successfully treat over 59 veterans so far this  year.

As a Navy SEAL veteran, I have friends who have battled wounds that  go deeper than emotion. Advanced imaging now confirms that PTSD is a  neurological brain injury. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, using pure oxygen  under pressure, heals these injuries directly and restores brain  health.

When I visited the clinic last May, I saw the healing in action. Two  of the staff members leading the veterans program are veterans who  suffer from PTSD. They went through the program themselves. HBOT  changed their lives so completely that they have now dedicated  themselves to helping others do the same.

We are still losing over 20 veterans a day to suicide, despite  exhaustive and costly efforts to stop it. That is not just a tragedy.  It is a call to action.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is saving lives and helping veterans rejoin  their families, their communities, and the workforce. With sufficient  funding and support, we can expand this model across Virginia and  across our country. Our veterans deserve a program that can help them.
