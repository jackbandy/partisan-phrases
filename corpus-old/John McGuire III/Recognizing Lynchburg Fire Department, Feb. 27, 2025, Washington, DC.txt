Recognizing Lynchburg Fire Department


Mr. McGUIRE. Mr. Speaker, southwest Virginia, in Congressman Morgan  Griffith's district, has been hit hard by storms over and over again in  the past few months, including Hurricane Helene. I visited Damascus in  October, where I cooked and served food for first responders with my  team for the victims of Hurricane Helene.

My thoughts and prayers have been with southwest Virginia since then  and certainly remain today as they deal with the consequences of  continued flooding.

I rise today to recognize and commend the nine members of the  Lynchburg Fire Department's Urban Search and Rescue Team who recently  deployed to southwest Virginia in anticipation of further flooding.

The Lynchburg search and rescue team represents what it means to be a  proud Virginian. No matter where you are in the Commonwealth, when you  are in need, a fellow Virginian gives you a hand.

Our first responders are critical to our safety, not just in  disasters but every day. To all of those on the front lines, I thank  them. May God and their training keep them safe.
