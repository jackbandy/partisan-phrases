Recognizing Benedictine College Preparatory School Football Team


Mr. McGUIRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary  achievement in high school athletics.

Benedictine College Preparatory School, located within Goochland  County, has made program history by capturing its third consecutive  VISAA Division I State Championship, defeating Trinity Episcopal 20-0.

From the first snap, the Cadets showed they came ready to compete.  Benedictine set the tone, demonstrating exceptional determination,  discipline, and heart.

JoJo Johnson led the charge with an impressive 85-yard touchdown run,  followed by key contributions from quarterback Kaiden Kohler and VMI  commit Landon Snyder, giving the Cadets a commanding 20-0 lead at  halftime.

Defensively, the Cadets were nothing short of dominant, ultimately  leading to their championship win. Benedictine forced five turnovers,  including a critical interception by Malachi Mingo that helped seal the  shutout.

I am honored today to recognize the student-athletes, coaches,  families, and the entire Benedictine community for their remarkable  accomplishment and for the pride that they have brought to Virginia's  Fifth Congressional District and the entire Commonwealth.
