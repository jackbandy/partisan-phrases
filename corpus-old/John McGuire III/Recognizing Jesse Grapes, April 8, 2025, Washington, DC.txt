Recognizing Jesse Grapes


Mr. McGUIRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a fellow veteran and  champion for students in the Goochland and Richmond community, the  president of the Benedictine Schools of Richmond, Jesse Grapes.

Mr. Grapes embodies the spirit of service.

The day after the September 11 attacks, Mr. Grapes joined the Marine  Corps as an infantry platoon commander. He deployed for three combat  tours in Iraq and earned the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.

He continued his life of service after he returned home. In 2010, he  became headmaster of Benedictine College Preparatory, and in 2020 he  was announced as president of Benedictine Schools of Richmond.

The Benedictine Schools of Richmond offer a good, Christian-based  education that prepares their students for life.

Mr. Speaker, as a fellow veteran and Navy SEAL, I know you can never  have enough marines around. I thank Mr. Grapes for his service to our  country and our community.
