Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose the Republican budget  rip-off. I hear from constituents every day about the high cost of  living. Under the Trump administration, healthcare costs are rising,  and putting food on the table is getting harder as egg prices skyrocket  and housing remains unaffordable.

Unfortunately, the Republican rip-off is a slap in the face to  working families.

Trump, Elon Musk, and House Republicans are asking us to support  axing Medicaid by $180 billion, even though food stamps reduce rural  poverty. Republicans will cut this program too by $230 billion.

Republicans are defunding the police by stripping funding from the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the CFPB is the only Federal  cop on the block to hold Wall Street banks and Big Tech payment apps  accountable when they cheat Americans.

It is shameful that while families suffer from high prices, Musk is  firing thousands of Federal workers and stealing sensitive data from  his competitors.

Although this rip-off cuts $2 trillion in vital programs, what do  Republicans plan to do with this money?

Mr. Chairman, they are going to give $4.5 trillion in tax cuts to the  billionaires in this country. That is $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. If  that math doesn't compute, it is because Republicans expect Americans  to buy the next megayacht for Jeff Bezos.

Mr. Chairman, we are not going to do that, and Democrats are voting  ``no'' on this budget. It is outrageous that Republicans have the  audacity to come here with this budget that harms so many Americans and  ask us to support billionaires and think we are going to buy it? The  majority thinks we are going to support it? My colleagues on the other  side of the aisle have another thought coming. We ain't doing it.
