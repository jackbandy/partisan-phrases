No New Burma Funds Act


Ms. WATERS.  Williams).

Mr. Speaker, given the human rights violations committed by the  Burmese leadership, we must ensure that no new funds are disbursed to  the government. In line with longstanding U.S. policy, America should  urge multilateral institutions like the World Bank to avoid rewarding  those who breach international laws and the norms that they should be  respecting.

Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
