Recognizing Angela Flores


Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Angela Emireth  Flores, a constituent of mine and an exceptional student.

Angela is a senior at Ocracoke High School and soon will become the  first student enrolled through Hyde Academy, where she will graduate  from high school with an associate degree from Beaufort County  Community College. This incredible program helps students who wish to  accelerate their academic careers get a jump start at the college  level.

As a surgeon, I am elated to hear that Angela plans on hitting the  books hard to become a nurse anesthetist. I love our nurse  anesthetists. Eastern North Carolina needs more dedicated and more  diligent individuals in medicine.

Serving patients is one of the most rewarding and meaningful career  paths one can pursue, and I am glad that Angela is pursuing medicine.  As a physician of 35 years, I derived great joy from treating patients  and helping them in times of great difficulty. I know she will also.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Angela on her remarkable achievement, and  a special thanks to her parents for nurturing her in her educational  journey. I wish her the best as she furthers her studies.
