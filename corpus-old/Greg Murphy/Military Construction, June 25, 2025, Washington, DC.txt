Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Chair, today I rise in grateful support of H.R. 3944,  the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2026.

As a proud Representative of over 76,000 veterans, as well as Camp  Lejeune and Military Corps Air Stations Cherry Point and New River, it  is my honor to advocate for Federal funding on their behalf.

I proudly support FY 2026 appropriations to increase the VA's budget  by 10  percent to ensure that our servicemembers and veterans receive the  resources that they need and, more importantly, that they deserve.

North Carolina is proud to be called home by hundreds of thousands of  Active-Duty members of our military and those retired from our Armed  Services. I am grateful the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act  was included in this package, as well as supporting language for the F- 35 sustainment center and utilities upgrade for future F-35 squadrons.  I wholeheartedly support this legislation.

We live in a dangerous world now. We had an administration before  that wanted to make things about social justice in our military.  Military is about defending the rights and freedoms of this country. I  am proud that this administration and this Congress are going to  support the military in keeping us safe and free.

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Frost), my colleague and friend.
