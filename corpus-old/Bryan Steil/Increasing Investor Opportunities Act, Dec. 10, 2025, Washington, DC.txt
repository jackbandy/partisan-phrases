Increasing Investor Opportunities Act


Mr. STEIL. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr.  Hill, for his leadership as well as the chair of the subcommittee, Mrs.  Wagner, not only for her hard work but also for the flawless Luxembourg  pronunciation of my last name as the former ambassador to Luxembourg.

Mr. Chair, I rise because we have an opportunity here to make the  world's best capital markets even better. In a period of time when  Americans are struggling with higher costs, we have an opportunity to  lower costs, and the legislation before us tonight accomplishes both of  those goals.

Outdated capital market rules are holding back innovation and  limiting investor access. By weighing down the engine of our economy,  they are raising costs and stifling growth.

The INVEST Act will help to address these challenges. It expands  access to capital for smaller companies by making targeted reforms to  crowdfunding rules and venture investment restrictions. It opens up  investment opportunities to more working Americans saving for their  retirements, opportunities that are currently reserved for the rich.

INVEST also streamlines disclosures for startups, and I like that it  includes my WKSI bill that alters the status of more companies. More  companies can sell securities to the public quicker and with less cost.  This bill helps modernize our capital markets, Mr. Chair, to lower  costs, reduce complexity, and open opportunities for more Americans.

Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.
