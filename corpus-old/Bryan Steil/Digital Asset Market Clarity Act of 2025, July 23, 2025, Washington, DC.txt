Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025


Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, the intent of Congress in enacting the  CLARITY Act is clear: to reestablish the United States as the global  leader in digital asset markets by ensuring our regulatory framework is  clear, forward-looking, and functional.

The exemptive authority granted to the SEC under Section 204(g) of  the CLARITY Act provides a mechanism to address evolving technological  and market realities.

The CLARITY Act recognizes that liquidity is an important feature of  efficient markets and price discovery, as well as encouraging U.S.  market activity. Congress intends for the SEC, through CLARITY, to have  the tools necessary to support the provision of market liquidity,  including, where appropriate, through exemptive relief that is  consistent with protecting investors, maintaining fair orderly and  efficient markets, facilitating capital formation, and fostering the  development of mature blockchain systems.

A goal of the CLARITY Act is to foster U.S.-based markets and bring  critical oversight back to our shores. If the United States is to  outcompete overseas marketplaces, liquidity and market depth will be  important components of our markets. A proactive and effective use of  the authorities in CLARITY to encourage liquidity and market health  will help to ensure adaptability to future trends and restore U.S.  leadership in global digital asset markets.
