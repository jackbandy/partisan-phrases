Medicaid Benefits All of Us


Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in your defense and in defense of all  of your fellow Medicaid beneficiaries.

Now before you say, wait a minute, Medicaid is for poor people, and I  am not poor. Here is the thing: If you cut Medicaid, community health  centers shut down, which means that instead of preventative care, folks  go to emergency rooms. If you ever need urgent medical attention, and  there is an ER bed available, you are a Medicaid beneficiary.

If you cut Medicaid, public school kids with special needs won't get  the targeted resources that they need. If you are a kid or if you are  the parent of a kid who is getting help from a teacher who is not  otherwise overwhelmed by their workload, then you are a Medicaid  beneficiary.

If you cut Medicaid, a whole lot of hospitals will close. If you have  an operating hospital within driving distance of your home,  congratulations, you are a Medicaid beneficiary.

Medicaid benefits all of us. Yet, the Republican plan that they are  debating would cut that program by $700 billion, making us all sicker,  more vulnerable, and making sure that people die. However, at least  they can tell Donald Trump that they gave him a tax cut.

I hope they are proud of themselves because no one else is.
