Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. CASTEN. Madam Chair, I want you to imagine that a friend came  over to you and said: Donald Trump taught me how to save 50 percent on  my shoe purchases. All you have to do is cut off one leg.

It is just math, as the gentleman from Arizona says. So let's get out  the saw and head to Foot Locker.

Now, Madam Chair, if you were a good friend, you would tell them: You  are crazy, and you need to stop thinking that Donald Trump likes you.

Nonetheless, here we are today talking about the idea that we are  going to save money by gutting Medicaid; slashing food assistance;  defunding white-collar law enforcement, the police; and exploding  budget deficits so that we can do what Donald Trump told you he wants:  Give a $4\1/2\-trillion tax cut to the wealthiest Americans.

So I would say to my Republican colleagues as a friend: Donald Trump  doesn't like you. He doesn't really like anybody. He just assumes that  you will  never find the courage to stand up to him so he is going to keep asking  you for more until you finally do.

If you are sick of being bullied and if you are ready to act like the  leaders you claim to be and make sure that we leave this country in a  little better shape than we found it, then grow a spine and vote hell  no on this budget resolution.
