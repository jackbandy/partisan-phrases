Isle of Eight Flags Shrimp Festival


Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, according to Bubba from ``Forrest  Gump,'' there are 21 ways to prepare shrimp, but there is only one  place you can experience all that and more: Fernandina Beach, Florida's  Isle of Eight Flags Shrimp Festival. Can you believe, Mr. Speaker, this  is the 60th year.

As Fernandina Beach's congressman and former mayor, I love to attend  this event, which started out as shrimp boat races, but has grown into  a massive festival celebrating delectable crustaceans.

From the thrill of the pirate invasion--arrgh--to the crowning of  Miss Shrimp Festival to the irresistible aroma of wild-caught shrimp  sizzling across the waterfront, every corner of this festival reminds  us of why we come together to celebrate our heritage as the birthplace  of the modern shrimping industry.

Mr. Speaker, when it comes to festival, this one is shrimply the  best. I invite my colleagues and you, Mr. Speaker, to come shell-e- brate with us. It is always the first weekend in May.
