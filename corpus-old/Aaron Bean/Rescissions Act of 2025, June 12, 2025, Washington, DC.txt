Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair McClain for the time.

Mr. Speaker, I know there are budget hawks, and I know there are  people that care about the deficit, which should be everybody in this  room. I know they are getting impatient. They are wondering when is the  House going to finally take action and make the DOGE cuts official. The  answer, Mr. Speaker, is today.

Today is the day we take the first step in restoring fiscal  discipline and getting our Nation back on track. H.R. 4, the  Rescissions Act of 2025, cuts unnecessary spending and ensures tax  dollars are not wasted on reckless foreign aid. There will be no more  tax dollars to fund DEI programs in Serbia. There will be no more taxes  to fund DEI musicals in Ireland and no more tax dollars to fund  electric vehicles in Vietnam.

Taxpayers, Mr. Speaker, have said enough is enough. I say enough is  enough. Let's pass this bill, Mr. Speaker, and let's go get them.
