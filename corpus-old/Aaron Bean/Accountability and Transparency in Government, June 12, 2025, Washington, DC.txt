Accountability and Transparency in Government


Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, $168 billion was the amount the  Federal Government improperly paid last year. We paid some bills two or  three times. We paid the wrong invoices altogether. We paid invoices we  didn't know we paid because there was no tracking mechanism.

If only, Mr. Speaker, there was a bill to require the Department of  the Treasury to ensure accuracy and eligibility in Federal spending.

Wait, there is. I just filed it, Mr. Speaker. It is the Delivering On  Government Efficiency in Spending Act, DOGE in Spending Act.

The war on waste, fraud, and abuse begins today by requiring the  Treasury Department to simply track, verify, and cross-check payments.  That is what the DOGE in Spending Act will do.

Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve accountability and  transparency. I urge all my colleagues to join me, and I am saving a  cosponsorship for each of them.

Mr. Speaker, let's deliver results. Let's go get them.
