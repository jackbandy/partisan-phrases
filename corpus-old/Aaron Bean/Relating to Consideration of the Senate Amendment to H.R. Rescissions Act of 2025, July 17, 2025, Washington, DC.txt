Relating to Consideration of the Senate Amendment to H.R. Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Foxx for yielding to  me.

Mr. Speaker, we all know what Neil Armstrong said when he first  walked on the Moon. As founder of the DOGE Caucus, I am proud to say  that, with this rescissions package, the first of its kind in 25 years,  we are taking one small step to cut wasteful spending but one giant  leap toward fiscal sanity. Yet, Houston, we have a problem. We are  still $37 trillion in debt. This year alone, we will run a $1.7  trillion deficit. With this small step today, let's commit to the giant  leap.

Here is my challenge to the White House: Let's do a rescissions  package every month because America has had enough--enough to wasteful  spending, enough to out-of-control deficits.

We do have a long journey ahead, but, thankfully, not as far as the  Moon. All systems are go. Let the countdown begin, and let's launch to  fiscal sanity by voting ``yes'' to clawing back $9 billion.

I am ready. The House is ready. America is ready. Let's go get `em.
