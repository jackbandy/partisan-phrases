Supporting Paws in Motion


Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, when danger strikes, it is not just  about boots on the ground. It is about paws in motion.

Today, I rise in defense of those who cannot speak for themselves but  serve our Nation with unmatched loyalty, discipline, and courage. I am  talking about canines and horses that serve our law enforcement  officers on the front line every single day.

From narcotics detection to crowd control, search and rescue to  border patrol, these animals are more than sidekicks. They are trusted  teammates, and just like their human handlers, they face real threats,  danger, and consequences.

That is why, today, I am introducing the Leo K9 Protection Act, a  straightforward bill to strengthen the penalties for those who assault  or injure these animals in the line of duty.

I am proud to champion the Leo K9 Protection Act alongside the  dedicated team at K9s United, whose tireless advocacy ensures that our  service animals are treated not just as tools but as heroes.

Under my legislation, the Federal penalty will be up to 15 years when  someone uses a deadly weapon to harm a Federal police animal. In  addition, this legislation will expand the Federal statute to apply to  any State, county, or local police animal assisting a Federal agency.

The effort is not just symbolic. It is timely and necessary. Last  year, 21 police canines made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of  duty, including K9 Leo of Marion County, Florida, who the bill is named  after and who is pictured right beside me.

Mr. Speaker, these animals run toward danger, not away from it. We  owe them far more than a belly rub or a scratch behind the ears. Mr.  Speaker, they fight for us. Now, it is our turn to fight for them.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical  legislation.
