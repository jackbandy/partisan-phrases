Recognizing Trinity Love Hoblit Foundation


Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, did you know that 1 in 50 Americans  is living with an unruptured brain aneurysm? It is a silent killer  hiding in plain sight. Most won't know it is there until it is too  late.

Today, I rise in recognition of Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month and to  highlight the lifesaving work of the Trinity Love Hoblit Foundation,  based in Fernandina Beach, Florida.

Founded by Olivia and Phil Hoblit in honor of their daughter,  pictured here, a vibrant 14-year-old who tragically passed away from a  ruptured aneurysm, the foundation is turning grief into action. Their  mission is research, training, and treatment for brain aneurysms and  strokes, and raising awareness about warning signs.

One of their most important initiatives is the Florida Familial Brain  Aneurysm Research Project, a program dedicated to understanding the  genetic links and safeguarding future generations.

Mr. Speaker, this month, let us all honor Trinity's legacy by raising  awareness and championing early detection because lives truly depend on  it.
