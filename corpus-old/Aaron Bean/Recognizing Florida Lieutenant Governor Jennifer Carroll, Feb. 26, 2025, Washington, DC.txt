Recognizing Florida Lieutenant Governor Jennifer Carroll


Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, we all know that when you are the  best of all time, you belong in the hall of fame, like Dan Marino, Don  Shula, and Jacksonville's own Tony Boselli.

Now there is another Floridian, Mr. Speaker, who has rightfully  earned her place in the Florida Veterans Hall of Fame. I am talking  about Lieutenant Governor Jennifer Carroll.

Lieutenant Governor Carroll's journey began in the United States Navy  as a jet mechanic, one of the very first African-American females to  serve in that capacity.

Then, after her military service, Lieutenant Governor Carroll brought  her leadership and unwavering service to the people of Florida. She was  the first Black Republican female to serve in the Florida Legislature.

Then, Mr. Speaker, in 2010, she made history again by becoming the  first Black woman ever in the Sunshine State to be elected statewide as  Lieutenant Governor.

Her efforts to improve education and to ensure veterans receive the  support they deserve has left a lasting legacy.

Her induction into the Veterans Hall of Fame recognizes her impact on  the Sunshine State and our country. We are proud of her and her  service.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating my friend Lieutenant  Governor Jennifer Carroll on being inducted in the Florida Veterans  Hall of Fame.

She is indeed one of the best of the best.
