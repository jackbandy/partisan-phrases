Venezuelan Strikes and Congressional War Powers


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm for our  Republic and our Constitution.

Every one of us here in Congress swore a solemn oath to protect and  defend our Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. We  did not give any President a blank check for war.

President Trump is over his skis. Article I of our Constitution, the  first power the Founders saw fit to forge into the foundation of our  Nation, gave Congress the power to declare war and send our troops into  battle. No one person can send our brave sons and daughters into  conflict on a whim.

Instead, what have we witnessed? We have witnessed a dangerous,  aggressive build-up of U.S. military power in the Caribbean.

Where is the money coming from to do that? What is it being taken  from? Lethal strikes against vessels off the coast of Venezuela are  increasing. Then the Secretary of Defense allegedly gave an order to  kill everybody on a boat. What is the legal authority under which those  orders were given?

These strikes both are an escalation abroad and a direct attack on  our U.S. Constitution here at home. Congress must reassert its  constitutional authority to authorize the funds to pay for war.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly supported this year's national defense bill.  We must conduct vigorous oversight to halt this executive branch  unilateral war-making. Our soldiers deserve us to do that.
