Fulton County Fair


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a treasured  northwest Ohio tradition in Ohio's Ninth District, the Fulton County  Fair.

It is the second largest fair in the State of Ohio, which has 88  counties, surpassed only by the State fair. Hallelujah, Fulton County.  I was honored to spend the day there recently with residents and  visitors from other counties.

I was able to listen to farmers and veterans at the hallowed Veterans  bean dinner and people both young and old from far and wide. The show  barns were full of animals and people, and the weather was heavenly.

I spoke with constituents from six of the eight counties I represent  and got a famous Fulton County Dairy Association milkshake, a farm- fresh cheeseburger, and got to meet hundreds from across the vast  northwestern Ohio region I represent and beyond, even Michigan.

The Fulton County Fair welcomed a record 180,000 visitors over the  opening weekend.

Last but truly not least, I spent time speaking with the dedicated  director of the Fulton County Farm Bureau, Roy Norman. I learned about  some of the great soil and conservation work being done in this mighty,  hardworking county.

Let me invite all visitors from our region and across our country to  check out the Fulton County Fair next year. Set up your campers. You  won't be disappointed. Onward, Fulton County.
