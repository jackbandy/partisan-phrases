Troubling Situation in Newark


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, many across our Nation are outraged at the  $400 million luxury airplane, the palace in the sky, that President  Trump just accepted from the Nation of Qatar. That is against the  Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. He took the bribe in plain  sight.

Meanwhile, our Nation is very short on air controllers who are  trained. Look at Newark, New Jersey. They have had radar failures and  repeated flight delays due to serious staffing shortages. This is true  across our country, but what did the Secretary of Transportation, Mr.  Duffy, say? He said: What you see in Newark is going to happen in other  places across the country. My reply: Excuses aren't an answer.

Going forward, what do we need to do? As of May 1, we are 3,000 air  controllers short in this country. The workforce is aging. They are  stretched thin and understaffed, exacerbated by DOGE buyouts and  firings. The FAA just simply doesn't have the people, and it is going  to get worse as people travel this summer.

While Newark grabs headlines, the pain is felt across America. Mr.  Speaker, let President Trump sell the plane, $400 million, and put that  money into training more air controllers for their safety and for the  safety of this Nation.
