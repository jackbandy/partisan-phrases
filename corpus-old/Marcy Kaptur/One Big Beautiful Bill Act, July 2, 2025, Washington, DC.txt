One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.

This big bonanza bill for billionaires will make life harder for the  people of northwest Ohio and America.

Unemployment is already up in Toledo, hovering around 6 percent. Mr.  Speaker, 1,000 Jeep Gladiator workers in Toledo are idled, and 2,500  jobs at Perrysburg First Solar are on the chopping block as the Trump  administration cedes, in this bill, our glass industry and America's  lead in solar energy to China.

Grocery prices are up 2 percent, yet the bill freezes SNAP, a cut for  45,000 families in my district, which is an $18 million monthly blow to  local grocers.

The bill ensures billionaires get $300,000 in tax breaks every year  while seniors and working people lose Medicaid and SNAP in the largest  cut to healthcare in American history, cutting over $1 trillion.

The bill recklessly adds $3.4 trillion to the U.S. debt, and interest  rates will climb.

Congress can create a much brighter future for America by defeating  this big, bloated bonanza bill for billionaires.
