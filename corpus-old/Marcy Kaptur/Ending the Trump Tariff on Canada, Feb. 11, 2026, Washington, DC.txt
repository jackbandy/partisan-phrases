Ending the Trump Tariff on Canada


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I was privileged to join colleagues from  both sides of the aisle this week in the House vote that was  overwhelming in bipartisan fashion to end the damaging Trump tariff  regime on Canada. The Senate had already taken the same action three  times before the House measure was even brought up.

Canada is our neighbor, our ally, and our friend. They have fought at  our side in every war for nearly two centuries.

Our Great Lakes region and its economy is the third largest in the  world. It is like no other with its industrial and agricultural bounty,  blessed for generations by the largest body of freshwater on Earth.  Ours is the longest U.S. coastline with numerous ports, energy  resources, cultural endowments, and unrivaled natural beauty.

The American and Canadian economies are totally intertwined. Robust  supply chains on both sides of our northern border make, grow, and  transport everything from autos to lumber to soil to energy to food and  even to hockey teams.

This damaging trade war with Canada has caused prices to rise, led to  more job losses, disrupted trade, and caused tourism to drop 31  percent. These are no victories.

Mr. Speaker, I just wish to say that I voted to end this upside-down  trade mess today. Let's strengthen our economy and make life affordable  again.
