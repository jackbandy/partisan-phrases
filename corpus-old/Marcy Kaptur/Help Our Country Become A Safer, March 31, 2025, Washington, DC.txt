Help Our Country Become A Safer, Healthier Place for All


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Law  Enforcement Training for Mental Health Crisis Response Act of 2025.  This bill is a bipartisan effort alongside with Congresswoman Stephanie  Bice of Oklahoma. Our goal is to ensure our officers have the tools  they need to effectively and safely respond to mental health  emergencies.

Every day, law enforcement officers across our Nation are called to  situations where individuals are experiencing mental health crises.  These moments can be unpredictable, even volatile, for all those  involved.

The reality is that 1 in 10 police calls involve a person struggling  with mental illness. Too often these encounters end in unnecessary  harm.

Our bill will provide much-needed Federal support to train officers  in crisis response techniques. It will advance their skills to  deescalate situations, and our goal is to deescalate people with the  care they need instead of the back of a squad car or a jail cell.

By investing in training, we protect our communities and ensure those  in crisis are met with highly trained law enforcement officers.

I am proud to work along with Congresswoman Bice and our colleagues  to help our country become a safer, more healthy place for all.
