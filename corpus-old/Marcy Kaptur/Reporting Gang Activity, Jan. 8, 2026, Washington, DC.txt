Reporting Gang Activity


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reintroduce the bipartisan  Gang Activity Reporting Act with the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs.  Hinson), my fellow appropriator.

This legislation has an urgent purpose: to give law enforcement the  accurate, comprehensive data they need to combat gang violence and to  keep our communities safe.

From 2021 to 2024, law enforcement agencies reported more than 69,000  incidents of gang activity nationwide. Over half involved violent  crime. Yet, today, Federal gang data remains fragmented, inconsistent,  and incomplete.

That gap puts officers at risk and leaves communities, especially in  rural America, without the tools needed to respond effectively. Our  bill would require the Attorney General to submit an annual report to  Congress on gang activity investigations and prosecutions.

While recent FBI data show violent crime trending downward, we know  progress does not mean the work is all done. This legislation  strengthens public safety, supports law enforcement, and helps protect  families from Ohio to Iowa, and coast to coast.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please support this critical  Gang Activity Reporting Act.
