Tariffs on Canada Are Foolish


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the big elephant in  the room, the Trump administration's imposition of a 25 percent tariff  on U.S.-Canada trade. It will severely impact jobs and companies in the  Great Lakes region, including what I represent, Northwestern Ohio.

My colleagues have heard it right. President Trump is going to put a  25 percent tariff on U.S.-Canadian trade. They are our best trading  partner. What is going on over there?

Unneeded tariffs will cause prices to rise more on everything. Just  wait. Cars will go up $9,000 to $12,000 a vehicle. Costs of grain will  go up. The cost of road salt, potash, oil, gasoline will skyrocket  dangerously. Let me state plainly that 25 percent tariffs on Canada are  foolish.

The people and businesses of our region and the industrial Midwest  overwhelmingly oppose the administration's unnecessary trade war with  Canada. Tariffs can be imposed in a smart and targeted approach. The  Trump tariff is nothing like that.

Mr. Speaker, I ask all citizens to contact the White House. Put it  simply: Don't hurt North American trade with Canada. It works. Don't  kill what isn't broken.
