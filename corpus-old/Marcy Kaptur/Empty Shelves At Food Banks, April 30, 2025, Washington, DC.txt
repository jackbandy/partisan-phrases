Empty Shelves At Food Banks


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening on behalf of the people  I am privileged to represent in northwest Ohio: workers, family,  farmers, and urban and rural communities where neighbors try to look  out for one another.

However, too many families are struggling to put food on the table.  They are being priced out of their own grocery store. Food prices have  shot up--meat, milk, bread, eggs--basics that every family depends on.  Households are getting buried under the weight of their grocery bill.

Now, to make matters worse, the Trump administration has unilaterally  paused Federal food assistance and canceled shipments to food banks. We  are feeling it. By withholding food and funds, the new administration  has turned its back on the American people.

They feel the rising prices, and they feel the harm. Food banks in  Ohio and across our Nation are seeing shelves go bare, school meal  programs, senior nutrition, and food pantry lifelines short. The boxes  going out to seniors don't have protein.

When Federal food dollars are cut off, it doesn't just hurt the  hungry, it hurts the producers. Congress must restore these funds to  feed our people, support the farmers, producers, and growers who make  and grow what makes and grows America.
