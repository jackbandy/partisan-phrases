Responding to Signal Chat Leak


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in disbelief at the troubling  stories in ``The Atlantic'' magazine of classified attack plans  carelessly leaked by the U.S. Department of Defense in a reckless and  dangerous fashion.

Congress must conduct a fully independent investigation with public  and private congressional hearings. The highest national security and  intelligence leaders of our Nation put American's servicemembers' lives  at high risk.

All responsible must be held fully accountable, including through  removal or resignation from their positions. Secretary of Defense Pete  Hegseth, CIA Director Radcliffe, Director of National Intelligence  Gabbard, Secretary of State Rubio, National Security Advisor Waltz,  Chief of Staff Wiles, and Vice President Vance were among those  involved in the plans Hegseth shared against DOD policy on a Signal  group chat on unsecured, nongovernment devices vulnerable to espionage.

Hegseth failed to notice that the group chat included a news editor  and reporter with no security clearance. Only Lady Luck graced our  Nation as their haphazard approach to war didn't result in the death of  American servicemembers who could have ended up at the bottom of the  Red Sea or over foreign soil. Their reckless leak risked American lives  and our security.

Mr. Speaker, as our Marine Corps uncle would say: Shape up.
