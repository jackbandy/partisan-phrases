Proclamation for National Amvets Auxiliary President Cindy Rice


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of representing Ohio's 9th  Congressional District, a region known for its patriotic spirit, strong  civic institutions, and deep respect for those who have served our  Nation in uniform. Today, I am privileged to recognize a distinguished  leader and devoted advocate from our community--Cindy Rice, National  President of the AMVETS Ladies Auxiliary.

Whereas, Cindy Rice, a lifelong resident of Ohio and a dedicated  advocate for veterans and their families, was elected National  President of the AMVETS Ladies Auxiliary in August 2024, bringing with  her decades of service, compassion, and unwavering commitment to the  AMVETS mission; and

Whereas, Cindy Rice's journey of service began in 1984 when she  joined AMVETS Ladies Auxiliary Post 22 in Vermilion, Ohio, becoming a  life member in 1999, and since then, has risen through the ranks of  leadership at the local, district, state, and national levels,  including serving as Department President of Ohio in 2015; and

Whereas, Madam President has held numerous distinguished national  positions, including National Historian, National Hospital Chair,  National Honors and Awards Chair, and Vice President at all levels, as  well as two terms as National Sergeant of Arms--roles in which she  exemplified leadership, humility, and heartfelt service; and

Whereas, her steadfast volunteerism, including at the Sandusky Ohio  Veterans Home, and her continued leadership as President of Ohio AMVETS  Charities and Secretary of her local Auxiliary, reflect her deep and  abiding dedication to the well-being of our veterans and their  families; and

Whereas, Cindy Rice has played an instrumental role in raising funds  and awareness for vital causes such as PAWS With a Cause, the John  Tracy Center, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Founding Forward, and the  AMVETS Scholarship Program, all while promoting the core values of the  Auxiliary and strengthening the AMVETS family across the country; and

Whereas, during her presidency, Cindy has chosen the ``AMVETS  Diabetes Research Center'' at Ohio University as her national project,  dedicating this year of service to veterans, Auxiliary members, and  family affected by diabetes, with the belief that Together We Can work  toward a cure for this devastating disease; and

Whereas, Cindy Rice's eligibility for AMVETS stems from her proud  lineage of service--her father, a World War II Army Veteran, and her  husband, Roger, a U.S. Navy Veteran--and is further honored by two  nephews currently serving in the U.S. Marine Corps; and

Whereas, with 48 years of experience in the field of dentistry, Cindy  continues to serve her community even in retirement, offering her time  and skills where needed and bringing the same care and diligence to her  professional life as she has to her AMVETS mission; and

Whereas, Cindy Rice has traveled extensively throughout the United  States to visit AMVETS Departments and Auxiliaries, sharing her  message, promoting her project, and uplifting all with her inspiring  theme--Together We Can;

Now, therefore, I, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, proudly recognize and  commend Cindy Rice, National President of the AMVETS Ladies Auxiliary,  for her outstanding service, leadership, and unwavering dedication to  our veterans and their families. May her legacy of compassion,  advocacy, and tireless commitment continue to inspire current and  future generations of Auxiliary members across the nation.

In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand to honor Cindy Rice  for her exceptional contributions and steadfast devotion to the AMVETS  community and to the service of our great Nation.
