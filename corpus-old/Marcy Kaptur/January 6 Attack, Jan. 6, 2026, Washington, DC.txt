January 6 Attack


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Clyburn for his  leadership.

Mr. Speaker, as one of the Members of the House that was trapped up  in that gallery for hours and hours against my will on January 6, 2021,  I rise this evening to say that the rioters who created the chaos that  day here at the Capitol were un-American. They were violent. They were  unlawful.

I rise to pay tribute to the seven officers who died, the 150 that  were injured, many of whom were hospitalized and some deal with PTSD  until today.

On March 2022, a year following that, this Congress passed a law  directing the Architect of the Capitol to place a permanent memorial to  honor every one of those officers who had violence perpetrated against  them. Mr. Speaker, 5 years after that tragic day, the plaque is here in  the Capitol but the Speaker has not allowed it to be placed.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge Speaker Johnson to not allow his worship  of one man to rewrite the history of that horrible day. Congress must  show respect for those who defended democracy, liberty, and Article I  of the Constitution of the United States right here in the House of  Representatives, defending the vote that occurred in 50 States across  this union. We owe them that memorial.
