Social Security Benefits Are Your Hard-Earned Benefits


Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, my message today is an alert for Social  Security recipients. Pay attention to what billionaire Elon Musk is  doing with your hard-earned Social Security benefits.

Musk is coming after your Social Security. The top administrator of  the Social Security administration says that Musk's DOGE boys are  trying to break the system entirely. That will stop your hard-earned  benefits from reaching seniors and eligible recipients.

Social Security benefits are your hard-earned benefits. They don't  belong to billionaire Elon Musk. Americans work hard to earn their  Social Security retirement and be secure as they  age. Social Security has been around since Franklin Roosevelt created  the program nearly 100 years ago.

Social Security accounts are yours, and it is a sacrilege to do  anything to disturb them. You might think about President Trump; he  inherited all of his money. He didn't have to work.

Mr. Speaker, we have to do everything possible to protect Social  Security for the millions and millions of Americans who deserve those  earned benefits, and no one should lie about them and say that they are  in trouble. They are 99.8 percent delivered. They are 99.8 percent  perfect. It is almost a perfect score. Don't believe what the President  said down on this floor just a few days ago. We are here to protect  Social Security benefits.
