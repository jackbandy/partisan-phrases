Disinterment of Remains of Fernando V. Cota From Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, Texas


Ms. JACOBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share a story from Lydia, an  Army wife who desperately wants IVF coverage.

Mr. Speaker, I hope Speaker Johnson is listening because he just  stole her dream to build a family by removing my bipartisan and  bicameral provision from this year's NDAA.

Here is what Lydia said: ``The very job that injured my husband and  caused his infertility, his service to his country, also denies him the  medical treatment he needs to become a parent. IVF isn't a luxury for  us. It is the only medical path we have to conceive, and TRICARE  completely ignores that reality. My husband served 11 deployments,  survived a brain injury, and has continued to serve, but we are told  the cost of growing our family is ours alone to carry.''

Lydia and her husband have tried everything to conceive. They have  already done nine rounds of IUI. Since they can't afford IVF out of  pocket, they have considered leaving the military and even divorcing to  get coverage in another State.

Speaker Johnson is forcing this reality on Lydia and many more  military families by refusing IVF coverage. It is especially  hypocritical when his own staff has access to this care. This is one of  the reasons why I will vote ``no'' on the final NDAA, but this fight  isn't over.
