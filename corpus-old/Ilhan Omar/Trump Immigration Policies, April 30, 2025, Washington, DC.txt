Trump Immigration Policies


Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I am here today as a Representative of a  community that is deeply alarmed by the actions of this administration.

Just weeks ago, the Trump administration defied a unanimous--we  didn't think this was possible--but a unanimous Supreme Court order by  refusing to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland  father wrongfully deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador.  Despite the Court's clear directive, the administration continues to  ignore the rule of law, undermining the very foundation of our  democracy.

In my own district, the situation is equally troubling. A graduate  student at the University of Minnesota was detained by ICE agents  without warning. Despite having no involvement in political activism,  he was taken from his home, held without immediate explanation, and had  his visa retroactively revoked. This action not only disturbed his  education but also instilled fear in our academic community.

These are not isolated incidents. Across the country, people are  being detained and deported without due process, often based on tenuous  and/or unverified allegations.

The administration's use of obscure laws, like the Alien Enemies Act  of 1798, to justify these actions is a blatant abuse of power. We must  ask ourselves: If the rights of noncitizens can be so easily  disregarded, whose rights will be next?

Our Constitution guarantees due process and equal protection under  the law to everyone in this country, not just citizens. If the  government can silence you, detain you, or deport you while defying  court orders, then none of our rights are safe. If we let this slide,  we are saying the Constitution is optional. It is not.

What we are seeing is authoritarianism creeping in through the  backdoor, one ignored ruling at a time.

My colleagues and I are ready to fight back with everything we have  got.
