Condemning the Attacks on Minnesota Lawmakers in Brooklyn Park and Champlin, Minnesota, and Calling for Unity and the Rejection of Political Violence in Minnesota and Across the United States


Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart in support of  H. Res. 519.

What happened in my State of Minnesota was a painful reminder of the  growing threats that public servants face simply for doing their jobs.

Speaker Melissa Hortman was a friend, mentor, and fierce advocate who  dedicated her life to public service. The assassination of Melissa and  her husband, Mark, and the harm done to Senator John Hoffman and his  wife, Yvette, is a tragedy that should shake all of us, regardless of  party.

This resolution calls on us, on both sides of the aisle, to take that  violence seriously.

Recently, we have seen acts of political violence minimized, joked  about, and used as a talking point. This has to stop. This job is never  supposed to come with a target on our backs.

Political violence has no place in our democracy. If we truly believe  in the work that we are doing here, then we have to protect the people  who serve.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
