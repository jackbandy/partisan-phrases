Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, this budget resolution isn't about fiscal  responsibility. It is about enriching the ultrawealthy and betraying  working people. It is about gutting Medicaid and SNAP so that the rich  can continue to hoard more tax breaks.

These cuts do not make our country stronger. They make it sicker,  hungrier, and more unfair.

This time, Republicans are not even pretending to pay for it. Senate  Republicans are rewriting the rules and inventing fake budget math to  claim that these tax cuts will not cost us anything.

In truth, they cost the American people $7 trillion in total. All of  this is being done to pave the way for a Trump term built on fear,  lawlessness, and vengeance.

President Trump is firing public servants, slashing critical  programs, and enacting chaotic tariffs that will raise costs. This  chaotic administration is trying to drag us into a recession. Instead  of stopping it, congressional Republicans are acting as willing  accomplices.
