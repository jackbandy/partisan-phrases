Resolution, to Remove United States Armed Forces From Hostilities with Presidentially Designated Terrorist Organizations in the Western Hemisphere


Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Meeks for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, may I answer that question for Mr. Meeks?

The answer is that this is not about drugs. This is about regime  change. We also have the White House Chief of Staff on record saying  that this is about regime change. It has nothing to do with drugs.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution. I was  proud to co-lead Ranking Member Meeks' effort, and I urge all my  colleagues to join us today in reasserting this body's constitutional  authority on matters of war and peace.

Let's be perfectly clear: Only Congress has the power to declare war.

The Trump administration's military escalation in the Caribbean is  not only reckless, it is blatantly illegal. We cannot allow this kind  of dangerous overreach to go unchecked.

Trump, a President who touts himself as a global peacemaker, has  appointed himself judge, jury, and executioner in the Western  Hemisphere.

His brutal military campaign, which has killed more than 90 people,  further threatens a region that has already been destabilized by  decades of U.S. interventionism. It risks driving us into further war  in Venezuela.

The American people across the political spectrum have been clear  that they do not want to fight and fund another war.

With this vote, every Member of Congress has the chance to show the  American people where they stand. Will they enable Trump's illegal  warmaking, or will they stand on the side of the Constitution?

Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, stand on the side of the Constitution and put  an end to this unauthorized use of military force.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to uphold the separation of  powers and pass this resolution.
