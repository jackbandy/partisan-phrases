Recognizing Amy Cooper


Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the trailblazing  accomplishments of Amy Cooper, this year's recipient of the Minnesota  History Center National Girls and Women in Sports Day Wilma Rudolph  Courage Award.

Amy's athletic career started at Washburn High School in Minneapolis  where she was a standout athlete in swimming, track, basketball, and  soccer.

Then, playing for Howard University, she went on to become the first  soccer player from a historically Black college and university to earn  all-conference honors.

Not long after, Amy was diagnosed with health conditions that  prevented her from continuing to play soccer competitively so she  turned to coaching. Yet, her commitment to expanding athletic  opportunities for women of color never wavered.

Her perseverance and commitment to expanding opportunities for girls  and women in sports makes her the perfect candidate for the Wilma  Rudolph Courage Award, and we could not be more proud of her for this  accomplishment.
