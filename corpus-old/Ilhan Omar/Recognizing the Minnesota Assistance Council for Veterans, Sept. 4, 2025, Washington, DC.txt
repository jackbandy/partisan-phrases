Recognizing the Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans


Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Minnesota  Assistance Council for Veterans (MACV) for their grand opening of the  newly renovated Robin property. Formerly the Robin Hotel, MACV has  transformed the century-old property into 14 units of safe, stable  housing for Veterans working to rebuild their lives.

I am immensely proud to have secured $750,000 in Community Project  Funding to support this endeavor. The Robin offers flexible housing  options, ranging from transitional stays to long-term accommodation.  The project is committed to providing equitable access to  transportation and is thus located along the Metro Transit line to  ensure easy and reliable access to community services.

For decades MACV has been unwavering in their commitment to end  Veteran homelessness in Minnesota. This project is only one example of  the way their work and collaboration can change lives. I want to extend  my deep appreciation to Hennepin County, the Minnesota Department of  Veterans Affairs, and the many community organizations that helped make  this project possible.

At a time when VA benefits and the workers who serve our veterans are  under attack, I am honored to work alongside MACV to support those who  have served our country. Please join me in recognizing the Minnesota  Assistance Council for Veterans for their outstanding efforts and in  expressing our deepest gratitude to all of those who contributed to  this incredible project.
