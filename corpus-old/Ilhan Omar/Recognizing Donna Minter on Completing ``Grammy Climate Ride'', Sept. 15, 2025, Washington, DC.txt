Recognizing Donna Minter on Completing ``Grammy Climate Ride''


Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Donna Minter from  Minneapolis for her extraordinary feat of completing the Grammy Climate  Ride. Inspired by her love for her grandchildren and a vision for a  healthier, more sustainable planet for future generations, Donna spent  64 days traveling 3,000 miles by bicycle to raise awareness and support  for climate justice.

From California to Florida, Donna struck up conversations with those  whom she met along the way to raise the alarm on the climate crisis.  Through this year's ride, Donna raised $25,000 for various Minnesota- based climate nonprofits.

Please join me in celebrating the extraordinary achievement and  spirit of Donna Minter and her strength and preservation that made this  possible.
