Venezuela, Ftos, and War Powers


Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to denounce the Trump  administration's reckless and illegal escalation in the Caribbean.

More than a week after the attack, we have not gotten any clarity  whatsoever on the legal authority they relied on to conduct the strike.

Let me be clear: There is no conceivable legal justification. It was  not self-defense, and it was not authorized by Congress.

That is why I am introducing a resolution to terminate hostilities  against Venezuela and against the transnational criminal organizations  that the administration has designated as terrorists this year.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues, regardless of their party  or ideology, to join me in this effort. All of us should agree that the  separation of powers is crucial to our democracy and that Congress has  to fight for its own power.
