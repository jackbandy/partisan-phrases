Recognizing Lisa Yanney Roskens


Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lisa Yanney  Roskens, a true leader whose vision, dedication, and compassion have  touched the lives of tens of thousands of military families and  veterans across our Nation.

As the chief executive officer of Burlington Capital, Lisa has  spearheaded initiatives focused on affordable housing for veterans,  contributing to programs designed to help individuals break the cycle  of poverty and lead healthy, productive lives.

Lisa embodies what it means to lead with both intellect and heart. A  proud graduate of Stanford University, where she earned her bachelor's  degree and juris doctorate, Lisa brings not only deep business acumen  but also a strong sense of service and purpose.

Lisa has guided Burlington Capital to become a national model for  purpose-driven investment. This company demonstrates that you can  achieve financial success while positively impacting communities and  transforming lives.

Under Lisa's leadership, Burlington Capital has made an extraordinary  commitment to those who serve the United States of America, both  Active-Duty servicemembers and the veterans who have sacrificed for our  freedom.

Lisa's belief has always been simple yet powerful: The people who  defend our Nation deserve quality homes, supportive communities, and a  true sense of belonging.

One of the most outstanding examples of this commitment is at Offutt  Air Force Base in Bellevue, Nebraska. There, Burlington Capital  partnered with the United States Air Force to redevelop and manage the  base's military family housing community. Through a long-term public- private partnership, Lisa and her team delivered $240 million in  redevelopment that transformed outdated housing into modern  neighborhoods where military families can thrive.

The results speak for themselves. Nearly 2,000 obsolete units were  replaced, and hundreds more were renovated. New homes were built to  meet the needs of today's airmen and their families.

The community now known as Rising View was recognized for its strong  partnership, its service to tens of thousands of families, and its  unwavering commitment to quality of life for those in uniform.

Lisa's impact doesn't end there. She saw another pressing need in our  community, the need to provide housing and stability for our Nation's  veterans, especially those who have faced homelessness.

In 2013, Lisa and Burlington Capital partnered with the U.S.  Department of Veterans Affairs to create Victory I Apartments, a  community built on part of the former St. Joseph Hospital site. It  provides 90 permanent, supportive housing units for formerly homeless  veterans. This project was more than a renovation. It was the creation  of a lifeline for men and women who once protected our Nation but  returned home to uncertainty.

Building on that success, Lisa led the charge for Victory II  Apartments, which opened in 2020. This second phase added 60 more  apartment homes dedicated to veterans and their families who earn at or  below 50 percent of this area's median income. These homes are designed  with dignity in mind, paired with access to health, wellness, and job  readiness services.

Together, Victory I and II provide 150 safe, stable homes for men and  women who once wore our Nation's uniform. The apartments offer not only  a safe place to live but also access to onsite supportive services from  the VA and local agencies, helping veterans rebuild their lives with  dignity and purpose.

Victory Apartments earned national recognition, receiving the Charles  L. Edson Tax Credit Excellence Award for outstanding affordable housing  that serves special needs populations. Just as importantly, it has  become a model for how public, private, and nonprofit sectors can come  together to change lives.

Lisa expanded that vision even further with the creation of Victory  Park in Lincoln, Nebraska. On the VA campus, Burlington Capital  developed 70 new apartments for veterans and partnered with the VA to  deliver a new community-based outpatient clinic for Lincoln's veteran  population. Victory Park combines housing, healthcare, and supportive  services in one location, a community that restores independence,  connection, and pride for those who once served our Nation.

Through efforts like these, Lisa Roskens has demonstrated what it  means to not only be a successful business leader but also somebody who  is deeply committed to making a difference in the communities where her  organization operates.
