Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Department of Energy Relating to ``Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer Gas-Fired Instantaneous Water Heaters''


Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear made-up  stories  on the other side of the aisle, the once upon a time stories, if you  will.

Nonetheless, in the eleventh hour, Joe Biden, or more accurately, his  handlers, pushed through yet another overreaching regulation that  forces the Federal Government into Americans' homes, dictating what  appliances Americans can use or cannot use.

News flash: This is America. The government has absolutely no  business making these decisions for hardworking families. Consumers,  not Washington bureaucrats, should decide what works best for their  homes and for their families.

Yet, thanks to Biden's mandate on his way out the door, I might add,  American families are now looking at a whopping $235 million in  additional costs every single year. That is real money coming out of  real pockets of real Americans, all to appease the radical Green New  Deal agenda.

Today that ends. House Republicans are taking action to stop this  Federal overreach. H.J. Res. 20, introduced by my colleague, Gary  Palmer, sends a clear message: We reject the Biden administration's  radical energy mandates.

This resolution expresses congressional disapproval of the Department  of Energy's rule that effectively bans certain natural gas water  heaters which burdens families with higher costs while stripping them  of consumer choice.

House Republicans will continue fighting to protect American families  from Washington's overregulation and ensure that those same hardworking  Americans, not government bureaucrats, decide what appliances belong in  their homes.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 20 and stand  for consumer choice, affordability, and freedom.
