Free Iran


Mr. WEBER of Texas.  Hoyle).

Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to say that tonight I rise to  speak as we continue to examine what is unfolding before us. It is  important to remember that the fight for the Iranian people is not some  distant, unfamiliar struggle. In many ways, it echoes the very  heartbeat of our very own American story.

Long before America became the beacon of liberty it is today, we were  a people under the heavy hand of those who believed power belonged to  rulers, not citizens. Our Founders knew what it meant to challenge an  authority that refused to listen. They understood what it meant to  stand up, too often alone, and declare that sovereignty belongs to the  people.

They risked their livelihoods, Mr. Speaker, their reputation, their  families. They risked everything so that future generations might  inherit a nation grounded in rights, not repression, but grounded in  freedom.

Mr. Speaker, that spirit is alive today in the streets of Tehran,  Shiraz, Isfahan, and more than 1,000 towns and villages across Iran.

We often talk about the American Revolution, but we rarely pause to  recognize what it really was: a movement of ordinary people who refused  to accept that their destiny would be decided for them by somebody  else. They believed they had a God-given right to shape their future,  and that is precisely what the people of Iran believe today.

The parallels runs deep, deeper than we sometimes see.

When America endured the Great Depression, it was a time of doubt,  fear, and uncertainty. But leaders like Franklin Roosevelt reminded the  American people that despair is never destiny. Let me repeat that.  Despair is never destiny. He told them that courage, unity, and faith  could rebuild an entire nation from the brink of ruin.

Mr. Speaker, today the Iranian people are living through their own  era of hardship--economic collapse, political oppression, and constant  fear. Yet, they continue to stand, continue to march, and continue to  hope. When the free world faced aggression in the 20th century, voices  like Winston Churchill refused to surrender to hopelessness. He spoke  truth when others stayed silent. He strengthened resolve when others  faltered. He understood that a single courageous leader speaking  plainly, boldly, and without apology could ignite the moral energy of  millions.

We are seeing that in Maryam Rajavi right now, and I will talk more  about that in just a minute.

The same need exists today for the Iranian people: leaders like her  who speak truth and nations that stand firmly with her and behind her.

Perhaps the strongest parallel of all comes from our own civil rights  movement, a time when America confronted its deepest flaws, yet emerged  stronger, more just, and more faithful to its founding ideals.

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said: ``The arc of the moral  universe is long, but it bends toward justice.''

That arc bends when brave people stand up. It bends when people  refuse to be silenced. It bends when free nations lend their voices to  those who have been denied one.

Mr. Speaker, that is what we are witnessing in Iran today: a movement  not controlled by foreign powers, not directed by political elites, but  born from the ordinary people of Iran, who simply want the dignity that  God intended for them.

Mr. Speaker, I will say this plainly: The return of sovereignty in  Iran will  come from the Iranian people themselves. They will write their own  destiny. They will determine their own future. America must stand with  them, not to orchestrate their path but to affirm it, and not to impose  our own will but to support their right to express theirs.

That is why I am behind Maryam Rajavi. We know from our own history  that when people rise for freedom, the greatest thing the free world  can do is stand beside them.

Mr. Speaker, she has a 10-point plan. I will read that 10-point plan.

One, rejection of the velayat-e faqih, absolute cleric rule:  affirmation of the people's sovereignty in a republic founded on  universal suffrage, as well as pluralism.

Two, freedom of speech, freedom of political parties, freedom of  assembly, and freedom of the press and the internet: dissolution and  disbanding of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC; the  terrorist Quds Force; plainclothes groups; the unpopular Basij; the  Ministry of Intelligence; the Supreme Council of the Cultural  Revolution; and all suppressive patrols and institutions in cities,  villages, schools, universities, offices, and factories.

Mr. Speaker, we heard the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Hoyle) speak  about women getting their rights and girls getting their rights. Madam  Rajavi is fighting for the rights of women, girls, and men, too, by the  way.

Three of the 10-point plan is a commitment to individual and social  freedoms and rights in accordance with the Universal Declaration of  Human Rights: disbanding all agencies in charge of censorship and  inquisition, and seeking justice for massacred political prisoners,  prohibition of torture, and the abolishment of the death penalty.

Four of the 10-point plan, separation of religion and state, and  freedom of religions and faiths.

Five, complete gender equality in the realms of political, social,  cultural, and economic rights, as well as equal participation of women  in political leadership, Mr. Speaker; abolishment of any form of  discrimination; the right to choose one's own clothing--figure that  out, how simple that should be, the right to choose one's own clothing  freely; the right to freely marry and divorce; the right to obtain  education and employment; and prohibition of all forms of exploitation  against women under any pretext.

Six, an independent judiciary and legal system, consistent with  international standards based on a presumption of innocence, Mr.  Speaker: the right to defense counsel, the right of appeal, the right  to be tried in a public court, full independence of judges, abolishment  of the mullahs' sharia law, and dissolution of the Islamic  Revolutionary Courts.

Seven, autonomy for and removal of double injustices against Iranian  nationalities and ethnicities consistent with the NCRI's plan for the  autonomy of Iranian Kurdistan.

Eight, justice and equal opportunities in the realms of employment  and entrepreneurship for all the people of Iran in a free-market  economy: restoration of the rights of blue-collar workers, farmers,  nurses, white-collar workers, teachers, and retirees.

Nine, protection and rehabilitation of the environment, which has  been absolutely massacred under the mullahs.

Finally, 10 of her 10-point plan, a nonnuclear Iran that is also  devoid of weapons of mass destruction: peace, coexistence, and  international and regional cooperation.

Mr. Speaker, I can't say it any better than what Maryam Rajavi has  said. This matters for even our security. It matters for regional  stability, absolutely. Most importantly, it matters because America has  always believed that human liberty is not a Western idea and not an  American idea; it is a universal truth.

A sovereign Iran built by its people, powered by its people, and  accountable to its people would be a force for stability, not chaos. It  would be a force for prosperity, not destruction. It would be a force  for hope, not despair.

The stories of the Iranian people today sound strikingly similar to  the stories of the American people throughout our history: resilient,  courageous, unwilling to surrender to tyranny, and determined to leave  a better world for their children.

Mr. Speaker, history shows us this: When people demand sovereignty,  and the free world supports them, the world changes. It happened in  1776. It happened throughout Europe in the darkest days of the 20th  century. It happened in the movements for justice and equality on our  own soil, and it can happen again for the people of Iran.

Mr. Speaker, that is our prayer. That is our thought for today. I  yield back the balance of my time.
