Proud Announcements


Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce that through  community project funding, my team and I have secured $3 million for  southeast Iowa, delivering targeted investments in public safety, water  infrastructure, and housing development.

These investments include: $500,000 for the SAFECity Initiative in  Oskaloosa, bringing advanced public safety technology to the community  to help prevent crime, improve emergency response times, and keep  Oskaloosa residents safe; $2 million for the Papoose Creek Redundant  Force Main in Muscatine to support a critical water infrastructure  upgrade. This will protect homes, improve flood control, support  growth, and strengthen environmental safety for years to come.

I also secured $750,000 for the Veterans District sewer project in  Knoxville to help build a sanitary lift station and storm and sewer  lines to serve more than 110 acres of future housing in the Veterans  District.

With these historic investments, I have now secured over $8 million  for southeast Iowa and will continue fighting to secure all the Federal  resources our communities need and deserve.                          Recognizing Haley DeGreve

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Haley  DeGreve, founder and president of The Gray Matters Collective, and  local leader Jon Zumkehr for their partnership in raising awareness  about mental health and suicide prevention among correctional officers  and law enforcement officers.

Their work became a lifeline for many after the tragic death by  suicide of correctional officer Blake Schwarz who worked at Thomson  Federal Prison but lived in Iowa, a loss that rocked our community and  exposed the silent suffering of so many who serve behind the walls.

In the aftermath, Jon Zumkehr, an 18-year veteran of the Federal  Bureau of Prisons, reached out to Haley and invited her to Thomson. She  shared her own journey of survival and hope, speaking openly about her  struggles and recovery and the realities that far too many correctional  officers face in silence, many of whom are former military veterans.

On August 28, Haley nearly became another statistic, believing  suicide was her only way out of pain. Instead, she chose to fight and  founded The Gray Matters Collective, a nonprofit with chapters for  veterans and first responders. She has listened to hundreds of stories  like her own and like Blake's, and she has made it her mission to break  the stigma and offer real support.

Jon and Haley's partnership has made a real difference. Together,  they have sent 24 officers at Thomson to ASSIST training, organized  suicide prevention walks, and led multiple staff recalls focused on  mental health and resources. They have also created a law enforcement  support group open to all staff with licensed counselors and free to  anyone who needs it.

After Blake's death, I was honored to sit down with Jon and work to  introduce Correctional Officer Blake Schwarz Suicide Prevention Act,  legislation aimed at providing the resources and recognition our  correctional officers deserve. I thank Jon and Haley for their courage,  compassion, and relentless advocacy bringing attention to this very  important issue.

Mr. Speaker, I want to wish a very happy birthday to my nephew,  Andrew Martino.

Happy birthday, Andrew.
