Myths of Medicaid Reform


Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I will respond that, once again, we  hear myth after myth when we talk about reforms to Medicaid, which its  greatest threat is $37 trillion in debt.

Yet, when we talk about reforms to a Medicaid program, it is to  preserve Medicaid, and children, the disabled, and nursing homes would  not be impacted.                     Honoring Chief Keith Kimball on His Retirement

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the retirement  of Chief Keith Kimball, who served the people of Bettendorf and the  State of Iowa with distinction for 35 years.

Chief Kimball started on third-shift patrol and worked his way  through the ranks with grit, integrity, and a heart for service. From  becoming Bettendorf's first-ever school resource officer to leading the  Investigative Services Bureau and, finally, being named chief in 2018,  he never lost sight of his mission: to serve and protect with honor.

He has been a mentor to many, a leader in his department, and a  trusted figure in the community. Chief Kimball represents the very best  of law enforcement: steadfast, compassionate, and committed to making a  difference.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chief Kimball for his dedication to the people  of Bettendorf and for setting an example that will inspire future  officers for years to come.

I congratulate Chief Kimball on his retirement. He has earned it.                   Recognizing National Small Business Week

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, this National Small Business Week, I  rise to celebrate the small businesses that power Iowa and make our  country strong.

As a former small business owner myself, I know the early mornings,  the long nights, the lack of vacations, and the risks it takes to keep  a business running. These men and women are the heart of Main Street  America, and they deserve leaders who will fight for them.

In Iowa, small businesses represent 99 percent of all businesses in  the State. In President Trump's first term, Congress passed the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act, giving small businesses the relief that they needed  to grow and hire.

I will also say that there are no Fortune 500 businesses without  first starting as a small business, or a mom and pop.

If we don't act now, those tax cuts will expire, and Iowa's small  businesses will be hit with a crushing 20 percent tax hike. We cannot  let that happen.

Let's extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, protect small business owners  and farmers, and keep the American Dream alive in Iowa and across the  country.                            In Memory of Jay Byers

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  President Jay Byers, a proud Iowan and dedicated public servant who has  led Simpson College at Indianola until his untimely passing on April  17.

Jay spent his life working to make Iowa a better place, from his  years as CEO of the Greater Des Moines Partnership, where he championed  economic growth across the metro, to his time as president of Simpson  College, where he put his students first every single day. He brought  energy, vision, and a heart to everything he did.

Jay is survived by his loving wife, Katie, and their daughters, and  my prayers are with them, the entire greater Des Moines area, and  Indianola during this difficult time. Iowa has lost a leader, Simpson  College has lost a champion, and many of us have lost a dear friend.

Mr. Speaker, may Jay rest in peace. Our prayers are with him.
