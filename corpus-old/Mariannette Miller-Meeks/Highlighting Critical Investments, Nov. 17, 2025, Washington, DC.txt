Highlighting Critical Investments


Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, speaking of taxes, the tax on the  economy and the detriment to the economy over the Democratic shutdown  over the past 6 weeks makes me delighted to be back here in Congress,  doing the work of Iowa and the American people.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a critical investment for Iowa  families, the $2.78 million in community project funding I secured for  the Newton YMCA childcare expansion.

This funding will allow the Y to open 50 new childcare slots, giving  working parents in Jasper County the reliability and support they  urgently need.

Access to childcare is not just a family issue. It is a workforce  issue. When parents can't find childcare, they can't work, which hurts  local businesses and the entire economy.

The Newton YMCA is a pillar of its community, and this expansion will  allow it to serve more families, strengthen the workforce, and keep  Newton and Jasper County growing.

I am proud to have secured this funding and will continue fighting  for projects that support families and build a stronger future for  Iowa's First District and Iowa.                    Highlighting Community Project Funding

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the $2 million in  community project funding I secured for Jones Regional Medical Center  in Iowa to build a permanent, state-of-the-art medical simulation lab.

For the past several years, JRMC has trained nurses out of two  temporary trailers. Despite those challenges, their program continues  to produce highly skilled providers who are urgently needed across  Iowa, especially nurses and EMTs.

This funding will create a 1,700-square-foot advanced simulation  center that will allow more students to graduate each year and expand  training for high-demand medical fields.

This investment strengthens Iowa's healthcare workforce, supports our  rural hospitals, and ensures communities across Jones County have  access to trained, qualified healthcare providers.

I am proud to have secured this funding and remain committed to  strengthening healthcare access and workforce training across Iowa.                     Recognizing Keokuk Area Hospital Project Funding

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  $825,000 in community project funding I secured to restore critical  healthcare access in Lee County through the Keokuk Area Hospital  project.

Since Keokuk lost its hospital in 2022, residents have faced delays  in emergency and specialty care. No community should be left without  emergency services or forced to travel over an hour for lifesaving  treatment.

This funding will help reopen emergency services and create  outpatient specialty care, closing a major gap in healthcare access and  restoring the safety net that Lee County deserves. The CEO of Insight  said that it was pivotal in establishing these services. This is about  saving lives, strengthening rural healthcare, and giving families peace  of mind.

I am proud to have secured this investment and will continue working  to ensure that rural Iowans receive the same quality care as any  American, no matter their ZIP Code.
