Recognizing Davenport Assumption Girls' Soccer Team


Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary achievement of the Davenport Assumption girls' soccer  team, who have once again made Iowa history.

With a 2-0 victory over the number one ranked Denver Cyclones, the  Knights captured their record-setting 12th Iowa State Championship.  This win marks their first title since 2021 and is a testament to the  perseverance, heart, and teamwork that defines Iowa athletes.

Led by senior Dru Dorsey and freshman Ruby Stevens, the Knights  showed skill, leadership, and grit on the field. Dorsey scored one goal  and assisted on the other, setting the tone and sealing the win. From  defense to offense, the entire squad played with unity and  determination.

This moment is more than a victory. It is a legacy, and it speaks to  what young women in sports can accomplish when they believe in each  other, never give up, and have a level playing field.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Coach Elizabeth Maus, the players, and  the entire Davenport Assumption community. They have made their sport,  their school, and their State proud.                           Recognizing Carla Eysink

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor  an exceptional Iowan, Carla Eysink, who retired after 29 years of  service as the executive director of the Marion County Development  Commission.

Carla was the very first to hold this role. For nearly three decades,  she worked tirelessly to strengthen economic growth, support local  businesses, and champion the people of Marion County. From launching  the Business Retention and Expansion Program to the Best of Red Rock  Awards and the Red Rock StartUP! pitch contest, Carla's leadership left  a lasting mark.

What stands out most is her deep love for the people she worked with,  the partners across Iowa, and the local citizens who showed up, rolled  up their sleeves, and believed in the future of their community.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Marion County, Iowa, and the U.S. House of  Representatives, I thank Carla for her extraordinary service. Her  legacy will continue to shape Marion County for years to come.                     Anti-Semitism Has No Place in America

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with urgency and  determination to address the alarming rise in anti-Semitic violence  that is sweeping across our Nation.

In recent weeks, two young Israeli Embassy staffers, Yaron Lischinsky  and Sarah Milgrim, were shot and killed outside the Capital Jewish  Museum here in Washington, D.C., by a radical Hamas supporter shouting:  ``Free Palestine.'' These two young people were soon to be engaged.  Their future was stolen in an instant.

In Colorado, a man attacked a peaceful march supporting Israeli  hostages with a makeshift flamethrower, injuring eight innocent people,  some who are in critical condition.

Across our college campuses, anti-Semitic incidents have surged by  over 80 percent, with students facing threats, vandalism, and violence  simply because of their identity or their support for Israel.

Enough is enough. That is why I am introducing the commission to  study acts of anti-Semitism in the United States Act, a bipartisan  effort to investigate these hateful acts, uncover their root causes,  and deliver concrete recommendations to Congress, local communities,  and the President on how we can prevent further violence.

This is not a partisan issue. It is, however, a moral imperative. No  American should live in fear for their faith or their safety.

We must stand united in saying that anti-Semitism has no place on our  campuses, no place in our streets, and no place in the future of this  country. I am committed to ensuring that we act, not just speak,  because the time to confront rising hate is now.                    Celebrating U.S. Army's 250th Birthday

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 250th  birthday of the United States Army.

As a 24-year Army veteran who is married to a 30-year Army veteran,  this moment hits close to home. For 2\1/2\ centuries, the Army has  answered the call--not for glory but for country.

It is not just the history books or the battlefields that define the  Army. It is the people. It is the young men and women from small towns  and big cities who raise their hands, lace up their boots, and swear an  oath to protect this Nation and its values.

I have seen what that sacrifice looks like. I have worn the uniform.  I have served beside heroes, and I know what it means to be part of  something bigger than yourself.

The Army isn't just celebrating a birthday. It is marking 250 years  of grit, honor, service, and rolling along. Here is to those who came  before us, those serving now, and those yet to wear the uniform.

Happy birthday to the United States Army.

Army Strong, always.                  Celebrating Richard Miller on His Birthday

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I wish a happy birthday to a very  special person, the eldest of eight children, my brother, Richard  Miller.

Richard Miller served in the Army, served in the coal mines in  Pennsylvania, joined the Secret Service, and guarded four Presidents  during their Presidency and Ronald Reagan post-Presidency.

After retiring from the Secret Service, he then joined the Los  Angeles Police Academy, completing rigorous police academy work and  then serving in local law enforcement.

Mr. Speaker, I wish Richard a very happy birthday. I am so proud that  he is my brother.
