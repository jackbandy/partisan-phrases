Delivering for Iowa


Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to share that over $24  million in Community Project Funding is now coming home to southeast  Iowa, funding that has been signed into law and will soon begin making  a real difference on the ground.

This didn't happen overnight. It came after months of meetings with  local leaders, carefully reviewing community priorities, submitting  formal requests, and tirelessly advocating for these projects in  Washington.

Thanks to that work, we are delivering $6 million to replace the  Cascade Bridge in Burlington, improving traffic safety and connectivity  in the region, but most importantly, replacing this historic landmark.  It is very much a community-desired project. We are paving hazardous  schoolbus routes in Jefferson County, upgrading intersections in  Coralville, and strengthening key emergency routes in Keokuk County.  These are not abstract policies. They are practical, meaningful  improvements that directly serve Iowans.

I am deeply grateful to the city and county officials who partnered  with me on these efforts. I came to Congress to deliver for Iowa, and I  will continue fighting to make sure our communities get the support  they have earned.           Washington Community Theater Celebrates 50th Anniversary

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the Washington Community Theater.

Last week, the Washington Chamber of Commerce marked this milestone  with a ribbon-cutting ceremony and Alive After 5 celebration,  recognizing five decades of arts, culture, and community collaboration.

Since opening in 1976, the theater has served as a home for community  productions and regional events, thriving because of community  initiative and generous local support. Led by President Mike Jewell,  the anniversary celebration honored the theater's boards and volunteers  for their contributions and welcomed Mark Fischer, an experienced arts  leader, as the new manager and technical director.

Showcasing local and regional Iowa talent, the Washington Community  Theater has become an important part of the community. It is a place  where Iowans come together to enjoy theater and put in the hard work  behind every production. The Washington Community Theater's strong  reputation and lasting legacy reflect the powerful impact the arts have  on our communities.                             Tax Win for Seniors

Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  historic win for Iowan and American seniors. This tax season, Iowa's  seniors are finally seeing meaningful relief that reflects a lifetime  of hard work.

Thanks to the Working Families Tax Cut Act, seniors now qualify for a  $6,000 Social Security tax deduction, giving them real financial  breathing room and long-overdue peace of mind after 4 years of high  prices under the Biden administration.

I recently enjoyed spending time in Pella with Iowa seniors and their  families, many of whom are thrilled to be saving this tax season and  were not aware of this provision. What mattered most was hearing  directly how this new deduction will make everyday life better.

For seniors living on fixed incomes, every dollar counts, and this  policy puts more of their own money back  where it belongs. Many seniors will be impacted by ending the double  taxation of Social Security. These deductions to their Social Security  taxation will benefit 88 percent of seniors.

Under the Working Families Tax Cut Act, seniors age 65 and older can  now claim a $6,000 individual deduction, while married couples filing  jointly can claim $12,000, significantly reducing and for most seniors  effectively eliminating Federal taxes on Social Security benefits.

After a lifetime of contributing to our communities and our country,  seniors deserve real peace of mind, and this deduction helps deliver  exactly that.
