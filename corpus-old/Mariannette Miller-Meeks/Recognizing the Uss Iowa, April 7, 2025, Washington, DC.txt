Recognizing the Uss Iowa


Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  commissioning of the USS Iowa, the Navy's newest Virginia-class,  nuclear-powered, fast-attack submarine.

I had the honor this weekend to attend the ceremony at Naval  Submarine Base New London, alongside Governor Kim Reynolds, veterans,  and the families of over 140 crew members.

It was a powerful moment marking the beginning of a new era. The USS  Iowa is the third naval vessel to bear that name following a battleship  that served with distinction in World War II, both in the Atlantic and  the Pacific, in the Korean war and in the Gulf. That proud legacy now  continues beneath the sea. The legacy of the Gray Ghost and the new USS  Iowa nuclear-class submarine begins its mission.

A new legend for the USS Iowa began on Saturday. It is indefatigable.  It is undeterred. It is undetected, and it is unstoppable.

To the crew, I thank them for their service and remember to be Iowa  nice to one another. To all those who may cross her path and our  adversaries, fear the Ghost.
