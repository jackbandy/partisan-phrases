Restoring Second Amendment Rights


Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of restoring our  Second Amendment rights.

Earlier this year, I worked diligently on and proudly voted for the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law by President  Trump on July Fourth. Due to my hard-fought efforts, this monumental  law delivers the most significant legislative win for our Second  Amendment freedoms in almost a century.

Throughout the negotiations, I fought to restore our Second Amendment  rights, ultimately securing a measure to zero out the $200 tax on  suppressors and short-barreled firearms under the draconian National  Firearms Act. This tax had been on the books since 1934, representing  both an unconstitutional and financial barrier to our Second Amendment  rights. Thankfully, starting January 1, 2026, American citizens will no  longer be subjected to this unnecessary and unconstitutional taxation.

However, the burdensome transfer and registration requirements linked  to the zero tax have so far remained. Yet, it was Congress' clear  intent to repeal the NFA registration by eliminating the NFA taxation.  After all, the two are inseparably linked. Without the tax, the  associated registration requirements no longer have a legal standing.  In fact, had it not been for the radical, partisan Senate  Parliamentarian, this intent would have been explicitly written in the  bill text.

Apparently, what the Senate Parliamentarian didn't understand is the  history and mechanisms of the National Firearms Act. Congress enacted  the NFA in 1934, imposing an excise tax of $200, equivalent to nearly  $5,000 today, on the manufacture and transfer of certain firearms.

Congress enacted the NFA pursuant to its taxing power under Article  I, Section 8 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court, in Sonzinsky v.  United States, 1937, upheld the constitutionality of the NFA's  registration and transfer provisions as ``supportable as in aid'' of  Congress' proper exercise of the taxing power. Furthermore, the Supreme  Court, in United States v. Constantine, 1935, held that a tax that  doesn't generate revenue cannot be justified as a tax.

Therefore, NFA registration serves as the mechanism by which ATF  accounts for the tax paid on each firearm, identified by its serial  number. The tax stamp affixed by the ATF on an NFA application reflects  both the firearm's serial number and the amount of tax paid for the  transfer.

Moreover, the NFA's criminal provisions pertain exclusively to the  failure to pay or register the payment of the tax with the ATF. The  registry is a tax registry, a registry of the tax paid on each firearm  cataloged by the serial number of each firearm.

Again, NFA registration and taxation are inseparably linked. You  cannot have a registration of the tax paid on a firearm when there is  no tax.

Last month, on Veterans Day, I led 30 of my House Republican  colleagues in sending a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi to  reaffirm congressional intent behind the zeroing out of the NFA tax  provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as well as to urge that  the DOJ adopt this position in all litigation concerning this matter.

Unfortunately, the DOJ's recent brief in a lawsuit involving NFA  registration defends the draconian NFA firearm registration and ignores  congressional intent.

First and foremost, the legal argument to defend and keep the NFA  registration simply isn't there, plain and simple. When the One Big  Beautiful Bill Act eliminated the tax on a broad class of firearms  regulated under the NFA, the constitutional foundation for applying the  NFA's transfer and registration requirements to those zero-tax firearms  no longer exists. These requirements now improperly operate without any  corresponding exercise of Congress' taxing power.

As the Supreme Court upheld the NFA's provisions only as ``in aid''  of that taxing power, and since the relevant excise taxes have been  repealed, the transfer and registration requirements must likewise be  understood as repealed with respect to the firearms now subject to the  zero tax.

The Department's recent filing ignores this reality and instead  offers a theory that would convert the NFA from a tax statute into a  freestanding gun registry, an outcome Congress has never authorized and  has repeatedly rejected. Even the 1986 Firearm Owners' Protection Act  prohibited a Federal registration scheme: `` . . . nor that any system  of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions  or dispositions be established.''

In addition, when Congress reduced the ObamaCare penalty to zero  during President Trump's first term, the Department of Justice refused  to defend the underlying flawed law. Clearly, the DOJ is fully  empowered to decline to defend statutory provisions that no longer rest  on a valid constitutional basis. It has exercised that authority before  and must do so again here, this time in defense of Americans' Second  Amendment rights.

When I came to Congress, I promised my constituents that one of my  top priorities would be to not only fight to protect our Second  Amendment rights but to restore what we have lost. The National  Firearms Act of 1934 is an unconstitutional relic that has infringed on  these liberties for far too long. We must take this historic  opportunity to ensure both taxation and registration on suppressors and  short barrels are gone for good.
