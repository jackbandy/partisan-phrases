Financial Services and General Government and National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Chairman, in January, just days into the President's  first term, Judge Deborah Boardman issued  a nationwide injunction using deeply flawed legal grounds against the  administration's birthright citizenship order.

Months later, Judge James Boasberg attempted to halt the lawful  deportation of violent Tren de Aragua gang members, even ordering a  removal flight to turn around in midair. These are not isolated  incidences. The D.C. Federal courts have become ground zero for  lawfare.

This amendment sends a clear message: Unelected judges are not  policymakers, and taxpayers should not be forced to fund judicial  activism.

Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment.
