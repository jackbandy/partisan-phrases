Congratulating Wisconsin's Seventh District Paralympic Athletes


Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Paralympic  athletes from Wisconsin's Seventh District on earning the prestigious  honor of competing as part of Team USA in the upcoming Olympics and  Paralympic Winter Games starting this Friday, February 6.

Liam Cunningham of River Falls is competing in sled hockey. Dan Rose  of Tomah and Matt Thums of Ogema are both competing in wheelchair  curling. They overcame tremendous obstacles and hardships to earn their  position with Team USA. They are role models to young athletes  everywhere, proving that with resilience and determination, Mr.  Speaker, you can achieve any goal you set your mind to.

Keep up the hard work and good luck. Make Wisconsin proud.
