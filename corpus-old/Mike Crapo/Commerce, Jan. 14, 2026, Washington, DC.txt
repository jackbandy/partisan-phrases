Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act, 2026


My colleague's proposal offers nothing new. The Senate has already  rejected a so-called clean 3-year extension of the enhanced COVID  credits in December. None of the reasons we rejected this measure then  have changed. Perpetuating a fraudulent, failed system without reforms  is not a solution. Declining to offer consumers more choice and control  over their healthcare is not a solution. Handing insurers an additional  $80 billion of taxpayer money is not a solution.

Both sides agree that the costs of healthcare are too high. We knew  that years ago when these credits were created and again when they were  extended, but rather than fix that problem, the credits only  exacerbated the underlying issues that are driving up the costs. We  cannot continue to rely on the same broken policies to fix those  systemic problems.

In December, Senator Cassidy and I proposed to begin the process of  true healthcare reform. Directing funds to HSAs controlled by patients  instead of insurers would spur competition, prevent fraud, and reduce  costs. Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  rejected this proposal. Each side knows what the other side cannot  accept. A real solution must respect those boundaries and chart a new  path forward.
