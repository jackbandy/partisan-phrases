Women's History Month


Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Scholten for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor former Ambassador Jeanette Hyde,  who, sadly, passed away last month.

A North Carolina native, Ambassador Hyde was a trailblazer who paved  the path for generations of women in our State. Her contributions to  our community span industries, from her time as a social worker and  teacher to serving as the first woman on the North Carolina Board of  Transportation.

Ambassador Hyde was an active philanthropist, never forgetting her  roots and always giving back to North Carolina causes and  organizations.

It is especially meaningful to celebrate her legacy during Women's  History Month.

As a leader and influential advocate, she pushed for ratification of  the equal rights amendment and women's full participation in the  political process. She never gave up on her vision of an America where  every woman has a chance to make her voice heard.

At a time when women are facing unprecedented attacks from the Trump  administration, we should all seek to emulate Ambassador Hyde's grit  and grace over the next 4 years. Like Jeanette, we cannot back down in  the face of threats to women's healthcare, accessible childcare, equal  pay, and more.
