Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act


Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the SAVE Act,  which is a transparent attempt to disenfranchise millions of voters.

The SAVE Act would change voter registration guidelines to require  proof of U.S. citizenship in very narrow ways. However, those  documents, as we have heard, a birth certificate or a passport, are not  always easy to come by for certain Americans.

This backward legislation would immediately disenfranchise the 69  million women who have changed their names after marriage or divorce  and do not have a matching birth certificate. There is no cure in this  bill.

Millions of Americans would be forced to navigate the complicated  process to change their birth certificate or be forced to pay more than  $130 for a passport.

Who would be prevented from voting? Working people who don't have the  time to do it and low-income people who cannot afford to do it would be  prevented from voting.

House Democrats will not be silenced while Donald Trump and  Republicans try to disenfranchise millions of people.
