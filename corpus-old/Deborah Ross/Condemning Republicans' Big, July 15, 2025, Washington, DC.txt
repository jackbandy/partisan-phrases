Condemning Republicans' Big, Ugly Law


Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn Republicans' big, ugly  law, which decimates food assistance for 42 million Americans,  including millions of children, seniors, veterans, and people with  disabilities.

Erica from Wilson, North Carolina, had this to say about SNAP: ``As a  grandmother who is having to raise my granddaughter, this program helps  me. I survived three heart attacks, yet [I am] still able to make sure  my granddaughter is taken care of.''

At a time when so many families are struggling to put food on the  table, why would we take away a lifeline that millions of Americans  rely on?

This past weekend, I visited Christ the King Lutheran Church in Cary,  North Carolina, where I saw firsthand indispensable work to combat food  insecurity in our own community.

Republicans have abandoned vulnerable, hungry people to pay for tax  cuts for billionaires. It is shameful and un-American.
