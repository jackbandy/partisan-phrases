Expressing Concern Regarding Job Cuts


Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned about the Trump  administration's act to fire more than 1,000 EPA scientific researchers  who have  dedicated their careers to protecting the American people.

I represent part of the Research Triangle Park, home to the largest  EPA facility in the Nation, where researchers and scientists are  solving some of our most complex environmental problems.

In North Carolina, these committed public servants are working to  combat PFAS and address our air quality issues. They were on the front  lines of helping our citizens during Hurricane Helene.

The Trump administration is attacking Federal research offices  because they expose disastrous policies and hold polluters accountable.  Eliminating the Office of Research and Development not only violates  the law, it puts our people, public health, and the environment in  danger.

I will fight this dangerous plan to fire Federal workers and silence  scientists with everything I have.
