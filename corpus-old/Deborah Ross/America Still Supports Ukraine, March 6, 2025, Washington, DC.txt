America Still Supports Ukraine


Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, for 3 years, Ukraine has fought for its  survival  against Russia's brutal assault. For 3 years, America has supported the  Ukrainian people in their brave fight for freedom.

Mr. Speaker, Trump is halting military aid, blocking intelligence  sharing, and betraying a democratic ally. This risks our national  security and emboldens dictators around the globe.

History will judge us for abandoning a democracy under attack and for  leaving innocent people to defend themselves against an aggressive  authoritarian regime.

Mr. Speaker, there is still time for my Republican friends to speak  up.

There is still time for Republicans to reaffirm to the world that  America does not bow to our foreign adversaries.

There is still time for Republicans to join with Democrats and remind  Donald Trump that America does not abandon our friends.

For our future and theirs, we cannot--we must not--betray the  courageous people of Ukraine.
