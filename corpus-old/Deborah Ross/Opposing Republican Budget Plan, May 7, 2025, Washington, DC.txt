Opposing Republican Budget Plan


Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the  Republican's budget plan that would gut funding for Medicaid. In 2023,  my home State of North Carolina achieved a historic victory by finally  implementing Medicaid expansion after a decade of political gridlock.

Medicaid expansion has helped new moms and their babies during a  critical phase of life. It has supported older Americans living in  nursing homes. It has ensured that individuals with disabilities get  the care that they need.

Republicans want to roll back this progress to pay for tax cuts for  billionaires. Their current budget would immediately terminate Medicaid  expansion, ripping away healthcare from more than 600,000 North  Carolinians and shuttering rural hospitals that may never be able to  open their doors again.

Mr. Speaker, don't be fooled. The Republican budget is cruel, and it  will cost the lives of North Carolinians.
