Women's Health


Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 53rd anniversary of Roe v.  Wade when the Supreme Court finally granted women the right to control  their own reproductive healthcare. Tragically, in 2022, one-half  century of reproductive freedom was stripped away when the conservative  majority on the Court overturned Roe.

Since then, we have seen extreme abortion bans enacted across the  country, including in North Carolina. Today, Republicans at all levels  of government are waging an all-out war on Americans' access to care,  pushing healthcare even further out of reach for millions of women.

First they took away our right to choose, and then they took away our  healthcare coverage. They came for our freedom, and then they came for  our doctors and hospitals.

Women deserve better. Republicans deserve the blame.
