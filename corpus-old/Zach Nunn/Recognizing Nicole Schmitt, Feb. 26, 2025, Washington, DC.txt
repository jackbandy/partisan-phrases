Recognizing Nicole Schmitt


Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the  extraordinary work delivered by Nicole Schmitt, our Director of  Operations and Scheduler. Throughout her tenure in our office, she  helped direct a dynamic and highly effective professional team,  including recruiting and supervising staff assistants and Congressional  interns.

During her tenure, Nicole executed many top-tier engagements,  including meetings for foreign heads of state, national travel, and  managing the 2025 Presidential Inauguration events for approximately  five hundred Iowans who came to visit the Nation's capital.

Further, Nicole proved pivotal in helping the team work with  stakeholders across the state and the aisle to earn our team the Top-10  most bipartisan member of Congress, by focusing on delivering results.

Equally, Nicole helped organize a series of ``after-hours'' Capitol  tours and joined me in leading constituents on a unique historical look  of the hallowed halls of Congress--just ask her about the Senate  chandelier.

Leveraging her naturally spirited personality and proven expertise as  a Parliamentary Intern in the Houses of the Oireachtas, Ireland, and  clerk in the Iowa House of Representatives, Nicole remains successful  in bringing people together to accomplish great things.

Most importantly, Nicole is a friend to us all, not least of all my  kids, who will always remember her scavenger hunts during their Junior  Congresswoman visits in Washington, D.C. We are grateful for her  service with our team and wish her success as she returns to the Great  State of Iowa, and all the victories Iowa State football can provide  her.

The distinctive accomplishments of Nicole's service reflect well upon  herself, the people of Iowa, and the United States.
