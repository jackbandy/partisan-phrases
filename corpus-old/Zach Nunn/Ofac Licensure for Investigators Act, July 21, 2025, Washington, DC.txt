Ofac Licensure for Investigators Act


Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  bipartisan OFAC Licensure for Investigators Act, which I am proud to  co-lead with my friend on the other side of the aisle, the  Representative from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).

Terrorist networks like Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the  Russian Mafia, and North Korean cybercriminals are no longer relying  solely on traditional cash couriers or shell companies. They now  exploit financial platforms, adopting increasingly sophisticated  approaches to fund acts of terrorism.

These organizations adapt quickly, using every loophole in the global  financial system to mask the origin and the destination of their funds.

Fortunately, the United States is home to some of the world's most  advanced financial technology firms and data analytics companies.

Just this spring, the FBI, working hand in hand with blockchain  forensics firms, seized $1.5 billion in stolen digital assets from the  North Korea-affiliated Lazarus Group. That is why I am so proud to be  able to work together on legislation which establishes a pilot program  within the Department of the Treasury to enable private-sector firms to  collaborate with Treasury to enhance our investigative leads. These  teams, working together, fusing the best information, help provide a  vital tool in combating the evolving threats posed by terrorism.

I thank Representative Beatty and the House Financial Services  Committee for their leadership.
