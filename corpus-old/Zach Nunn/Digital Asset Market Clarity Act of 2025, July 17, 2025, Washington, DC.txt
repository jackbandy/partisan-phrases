Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025


Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thompson, as well as  Ranking Member Craig for leading a truly bipartisan opportunity to help  America deliver as a crypto capital for the entire planet.

As a member of both the Agriculture Committee and the Financial  Services Committee, I have been able to see this issue on both sides:  commodities versus securities, CFTC versus the SEC.

In my home State of rural Iowa, we know commodities: corn, soybeans,  hogs. The CFTC does this very well. In downtown Des Moines and on the  Main Streets of hometowns across Iowa, our banks handle stocks and  bonds, securities, those handled by the SEC.

That level of clarity works, but when it comes to digital assets, the  lines become blurred, confused, and overly burdensome. That regulatory  uncertainty doesn't just cost dollars. It costs jobs, innovation, and  America's global leadership.

The CLARITY Act is exactly what America needs now to drive toward the  future to ensure the next generation of financial internet technology  and blockchain success is built in America, that our innovators come  from the U.S., and that we have a future going forward. Mr. Speaker, I  endorse the CLARITY Act.
