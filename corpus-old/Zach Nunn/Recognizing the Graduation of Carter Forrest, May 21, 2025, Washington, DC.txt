Recognizing the Graduation of Carter Forrest


Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Carter  Forrest of Cumming, Iowa, for her achievement in graduating from Drake  University Law School. This is a milestone she should be incredibly  proud of, as years of determination and intellectual rigor have led to  this proud moment for Carter and the entire Forrest family.

Carter is a proud Iowan whose journey has exemplified both academic  excellence and a spirit of civic responsibility. In addition to her  legal education, she has already engaged in a range of professional  roles, including legal research, legislative policy, and campaign work  in both the private and public sectors. Through these experiences,  Carter has distinguished herself as a thoughtful, capable, and  principled leader.

It has been a privilege to witness Carter's growth and academic  development, and I am incredibly proud of what she has already  achieved. She has approached each challenge with humility, purpose, and  a strong work ethic that exemplifies the very best of Iowa's values. I  am certain Carter has a bright future in the legal profession, wherever  her journey might take her next.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Carter  Forrest on her graduation from Drake Law School and in wishing for her  continued success in the years to come.
