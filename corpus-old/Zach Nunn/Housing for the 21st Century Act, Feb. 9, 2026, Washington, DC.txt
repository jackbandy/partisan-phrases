Housing for the 21st Century Act


Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hill and the team  here for a bipartisan bill that helps rural America have a successful  pathway to housing in the 21st century.

My legislation includes the Rural Housing Service Reform Act, the  most meaningful update to rural housing in decades.

Whether you are in Des Moines or Ottumwa, the number one expense  Iowans are facing is housing. The American Dream of homeownership is  starting to slip away.

In Iowa, renters spend 40 percent of their income just making sure  they have a roof over their head, and the average home buyer is now in  their mid-forties.

It doesn't have to be like this. This bipartisan legislation, led  with my colleague Representative Cleaver, a Democrat from Missouri,  makes commonsense changes to fix the housing programs that have been  broken for far too long.

My bill means a young couple in Creston, Iowa, can buy their first  home, and seniors in Osceola, Iowa, can stay in their communities.

This bill will help hundreds of thousands of Iowans and millions of  Americans into homeownership and continued homeownership.

Let's restore the dream of homeownership for all of our country. This  is a win for everyone. It is affordable. It is achievable. Let's get it  done.
