Recognizing Emily Tuttle-Millard


Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Emily  Tuttle-Millard, our deputy chief of staff.

Over the course of Emily's tenure, she has served in numerous roles,  consistently demonstrating her professionalism and extraordinary work  ethic, with a steadfast dedication to excellence.

Emily was not only a vital member of our team, but she was also an  integral force behind our success for folks back home in Iowa.

As deputy chief of staff, Emily tackled strategic goals, including  our passage of legislation to address veteran suicide with the Daniel  J. Harvey, Jr. and Adam Lambert Improving Servicemember Transition to  Reduce Veteran Suicide Act, helping support couples to start a family  with the HOPE with Fertility Services Act, and delivering on U.S.  national security priorities enshrined in the National Defense  Authorization Act. As a fighter for folks in the heart of the  heartland, she helped lead more amendments to the prestigious farm bill  than nearly any other Member in Congress.

Further, Emily worked across the State and across the aisle to earn  bipartisan support and helped our team be in the top 10 most bipartisan  Members of Congress.

Throughout her tenure, Emily has been a true plankholder from day  one. Whether she was operating in a role as communications director,  scheduler, or, ultimately, deputy chief, she has continued to be a true  mentor.

I thank Emily for all she has done for our team, especially her  ability to foster collaboration and growth and to create a more united  effort. Despite her University of Illinois pedigree, she will always be  an Iowan and a Hawkeye at heart, from the corn dogs at the State fair  to winning friends under the golden dome in Des Moines to right here at  the marble steps of the U.S. Capitol.

Our country, our State, and our family are grateful for her service,  and we wish her great success in her next adventure.
