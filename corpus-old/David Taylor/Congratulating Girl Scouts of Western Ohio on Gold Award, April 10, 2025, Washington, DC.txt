Congratulating Girl Scouts of Western Ohio on Gold Award


Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Girl Scouts of  Western Ohio. These hardworking and dedicated Scouts are agents for  positive change in their communities and work every day to create a  better world.

In 2024, 44 Senior and Ambassador Girl Scouts from the Girl Scouts of  Western Ohio earned the prestigious Gold Award.

In pursuit of this distinction, each Scout identified a specific  issue close to their hearts and utilized teamwork and collaboration to  effect positive change in their community, leaving a lasting impact.

Carolyn Koch, a graduate of Blanchester High School, created a Build  Community Through Theater program to engage youth and help them develop  confidence. Promoting drama education in her community, Carolyn  invested her time and energy in creating a middle school drama camp,  free of charge, for fifth to eighth grade students in the Blanchester  Local School District.

The Girl Scouts Promise reads: ``On my honor, I will try to serve God  and my country, to help people at all times, and to live by the Girl  Scout Law.'' Carolyn and each of the other recipients of the Girl Scout  Gold Award are the embodiment of this promise.

I also recognize the parents and Scout leaders who supported each  Girl Scout on their path to this milestone. Their support made all the  difference.

I congratulate the Girl Scouts, especially Carolyn. Her investment in  our community is appreciated, and Ohio can't wait to see what is in  store for her next.
