Va Hospital Inventory Management System Authorization Act


Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  my bill, the VA Hospital Inventory Management System Authorization Act.

As a Navy veteran, a nurse practitioner, and the proud Representative  of a district that is home to more than 78,000 veterans, I know how  essential it is to ensure our veteran health system works efficiently  and effectively.

Unfortunately, outdated systems and fragmented logistics have created  real obstacles within the VA. These failures aren't just technical.  They are personal. They affect real people and real families.

Over the past several years, millions of dollars in medical equipment  have gone missing from VA facilities across the country. These are not  isolated incidents. They are symptoms of a broader issue, one where a  lack of modern infrastructure has led to waste, delay, and avoidable  gaps in care.

That is why I introduced this bipartisan and commonsense approach to  improving how the VA manages medical supplies. This bill authorizes the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop or acquire a cloud-based  inventory management system to help ensure VA clinicians always have  the right tools at the right time to provide high-quality care.

This system will offer better tracking, better forecasting, and  better accountability. We are not reinventing the wheel. We are simply  asking the VA to adopt the same kinds of tools  and best practices that are already being used in the private sector  and to do so in a way that is transparent, results-driven, and veteran- focused.

The benefits are clear. A modern inventory management system will  reduce waste, prevent delays in care, and ensure that taxpayer dollars  are spent efficiently. Most importantly, it will help restore trust in  a system that too often leaves veterans feeling frustrated and  forgotten.

Madam Speaker, I respectfully urge my colleagues to support this bill  and join me in making a practical, bipartisan improvement to the care  our veterans receive.
