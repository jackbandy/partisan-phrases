Advocating for Military Families


Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  bill, the Care for Military Kids Act, that was included in the  appropriations package for 2026 that just passed the House.

As a proud Representative of Virginia's Second Congressional  District, home to one of the largest Active-Duty military populations  in the United States, advocating for those who serve our country and  their families is one of my top priorities.

Unlike civilian families, military families often need to move every  2 to 3 years, not by choice but by obligation.

When relocated to another State, servicemembers uproot their whole  lives to answer the call to serve and their families often sacrifice a  great deal.

For servicemembers who have dependents with disabilities, the  sacrifice can greatly impact their livelihood. Unfortunately, with  every move, dependent children must re-enter entirely new State health  systems with new Medicaid rules, new waiver programs, new provider  networks, and long wait lists.

The Care for Military Kids Act would ensure that any dependent of an  Active-Duty servicemember - currently receiving long-term care services  through a State administered Medicaid plan, will remain eligible should  their family be stationed outside the State, ensuring our  servicemembers do not have to choose between serving their country and  getting their children the critical care they need.

Mr. Speaker, I was grateful that this important piece of legislation  was included in the appropriations package for 2026.
