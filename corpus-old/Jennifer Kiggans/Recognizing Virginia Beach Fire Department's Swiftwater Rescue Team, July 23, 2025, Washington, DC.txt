Recognizing Virginia Beach Fire Department's Swiftwater Rescue Team


Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  brave members of the Virginia Beach Fire Department's Swiftwater Rescue  Team, who were recently deployed to Texas Hill Country to support the  flood rescue efforts there.

The specialized team is uniquely qualified to respond to natural  disasters, having recently assisted in the rescue efforts from the  October floods that occurred in western Virginia.

On July 4, the team drove 1,700 miles through the night from Virginia  Beach to Texas to aid in the flood rescue efforts. In the face of  tragedies like the floods in Texas, we are incredibly fortunate to have  brave first responders who choose to run toward danger instead of away  from it.

I will continue to pray for the safety of our first responders, as  well as the victims and families affected by this horrific disaster. I  am grateful that this team was able to put their expertise to use and  assist in saving lives.

I am happy to hear the news that they are coming home.
