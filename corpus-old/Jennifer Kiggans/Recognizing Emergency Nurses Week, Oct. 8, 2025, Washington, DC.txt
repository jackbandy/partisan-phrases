Recognizing Emergency Nurses Week


Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only as a  Member of Congress, but as a geriatric nurse practitioner and an  advocate for our nurses across the Nation, to recognize the unyielding  composure of our emergency nurses during Emergency Nurses Week.

In the United States, it is federal law that an emergency room never  closes and that every person who comes to an ER receives care. Day or  night, emergency nurses answer the call of duty--providing quality care  to patients in critical condition while operating in demanding, high- stakes environments where every second counts. Emergency nurses work  around the clock, caring for patients of all ages and across every  specialty--from cardiology and oncology to pediatrics and geriatrics.

Emergency nurses are heroes, often the first point of contact for  patients within the ER, and they provide comfort and attentive care  during an uncertain or stressful time for patients and their families.  Their critical thinking skills and their compassion for their patients  make their role essential for preserving our Nation's healthcare  system.

It is important that we give our emergency nurses the praise and  attention they deserve during Emergency Nurses Week to show our  appreciation for the dedication they have to our Nation's health and  for the millions of lives they touch on a daily basis. We're forever  grateful for their sacrifice.
