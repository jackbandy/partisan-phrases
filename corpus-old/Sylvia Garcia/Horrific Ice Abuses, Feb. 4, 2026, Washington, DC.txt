Horrific Ice Abuses


Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am a lawyer. I have served as a  judge. I know what the rule of law demands. What this administration is  doing with ICE is not enforcement. It is lawlessness. It is cruelty.  They have turned ICE into a force of masked thugs. In my community in  the Houston area, people are paying the price.

Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres died in ICE custody near Houston. DHS  claims it was heart failure, but this administration has shown such  contempt for the truth that we can't believe a darn thing they say. His  family is demanding answers, and so are we. I have requested the death  report, but, Mr. Speaker, ICE has yet to respond.

Under Trump, as noted earlier, 43 people have died in DHS custody or  at the hands of DHS agents or their contractors. This is not a  coincidence. This is cruelty masquerading as policy.

In Minneapolis, two Americans--Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti-- were murdered by Federal immigration agents. We have all seen the  videos. We know both deaths were completely unjustified. We know that  this was not domestic terrorism. The American people know it, too, no  matter how much this President tells us not to believe our very own  eyes.

Instead of accountability, the felon in the White House rushed to  smear and lie about the victims. It is a disgrace. It is shameful. It  is immoral.

This administration is terrorizing our communities, threatening our  cities, trampling on the Constitution, and tearing our country apart.  It must stop, and it must stop now. Congress must act. Stop ICE now.
