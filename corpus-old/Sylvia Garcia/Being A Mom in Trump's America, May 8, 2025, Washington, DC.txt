Being A Mom in Trump's America


Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Mother's Day this  weekend, I am reminded of a visit that Donald Trump had with Howard  Stern. They were talking about marriage and having children, and Howard  Stern said something like: Why do you need the headache?

He said: ``Oh, I won't do anything to take care of them. I will  supply funds, and she'll take care of the kids.''

That is what he thinks of motherhood. That explains why he is  offering a one-time $5,000 bonus check to encourage women to have  babies. Yet,  what good is that when he is cutting maternal healthcare; trashing  Medicaid, which pays for 4 in 10 births in our country; and letting  childcare costs force moms out of work?

Let me be clear. Women want to be moms but don't want to go broke  having to raise this child, risk their life with a pregnancy, or lose  their child to gun violence.

If we are serious about celebrating Mother's Day, let's cut it with  the bonus check and bring back the full tax credit and work to expand  opportunities and protections for all mothers, not just this Sunday but  every day.

Happy Mother's Day to all mothers.
