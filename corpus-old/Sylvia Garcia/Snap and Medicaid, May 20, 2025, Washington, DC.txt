Snap and Medicaid


Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Scripture calls us to help one  another.

In the Gospel of Matthew it says: I was hungry, and you gave me  something to eat. . . . I was a stranger, and you invited me in.

However, Republicans never come here to talk about poverty or hunger  or the sick. It is always about tax cuts, the rich, and the  billionaires.

Tonight I rise for one of the Houston families they are attempting to  hurt.

Luisa and Roberto are seniors in my district. They have worked their  whole lives, and now they are afraid. They are afraid of what happens  when Republicans slash the programs they paid into and now rely on to  stay healthy.

It is not just them. We hear from moms with cancer, families with  disabled children, or families with loved ones in nursing homes, and on  and on. They are terrified of losing Medicaid and SNAP.

What Republicans are doing is un-American, un-Christian, and  unacceptable.

Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker. The American people know the difference  between leadership and cruelty, and they won't forget who chose  cruelty.
