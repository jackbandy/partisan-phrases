Redrawing Congressional Maps An Attack on Democracy


Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to a  robbery being planned by a felon.

In the first 6 months of this administration, Republicans have lost  the battle of ideas. Now set on making sure that they don't lose power,  they lie and cheat in order to steal the midterm elections.

Governor Abbott bent a knee to the felon in the White House, calling  an emergency session to redraw congressional maps in Texas. These are  maps that he himself approved in 2021.

While Texas Hill Country is still reeling in grief and trying to  recover from devastating floods, Republicans prove that it is always  the right time to do the wrong thing.

Texans are struggling and deserve so much better than what Abbott has  cooked up for them. This is an attack on democracy and nothing more  than a power grab.

We must fight them with everything we have because, in this country,  the voters choose who they elect and not the other way around.
