Disapproving the Rule Submitted By the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Relating to ``Overdraft Lending: Very Large Financial Institutions''


Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I mentioned earlier that Democrats  created a watchdog, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to stop  scams and protect everyday people. One of the most important things  they have done  recently: They capped bank overdraft fees at $5. If your account goes a  few dollars negative and your check bounces, the bank cannot charge you  more than $5. Most banks charge between $25 and $35. Again, the cap is  $5.

Well, for some reason, the Republicans want to get rid of this. I  don't know why. Maybe it is because their bank buddies like JPMorgan  Chase made about $58 billion in profit last year, and $1 billion of  that came from junk fees, just like the overdraft fee Republicans are  now trying to allow banks to raise.

However, Republicans aren't worried about that. They don't worry  about bounced checks because Republicans live in a different world, a  world where banks win and families lose.

I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' Vote for people, not for banks.
