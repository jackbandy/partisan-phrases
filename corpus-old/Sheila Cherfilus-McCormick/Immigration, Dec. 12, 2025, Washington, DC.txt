Immigration


Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today out of deep  concern for the direction of our Nation. Immigration policies  restricting green card holders, banning asylum seekers from 19 Third  World countries, cutting their worker visas, and terminating TPS will  have dire economic consequences.

Immigrants have sustained America's economy for generations, and in  my home State of Florida, they make up over 30 percent of our workforce  and contribute more than $170 billion in spending power.

Many industries, such as construction, agriculture, hospital, and  healthcare, are already suffering severe worker shortages.

Ending TPS for nearly one-half million Haitians and Venezuelans will  devastate these sectors, and the blanket ban on 19 countries will block  the students, nurses, entrepreneurs, and scientists and drive American  innovation to a stagnation. It blocks the next Einstein and the next  Carnegie.

We need strategic policies that are workforce-driven, create merit- based pathways, and expanded skills training for Americans to meet this  moment.

Mr. Speaker, I urge this Chamber to support an immigration system  that strengthens American families, businesses, and economy.
