Ice Raids in California


Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, the images emerging from  California--ICE raids escalating into chaos, immigrant families fleeing  their homes, and the National Guard troops confronting peaceful  protesters--are a chilling reminder of how far we have strayed from my  democratic values that we claim to uphold.

This is not the America I know. This is not the America we aspire to  be. We are a nation built on justice, compassion, and the unwavering  belief that every person deserves dignity and respect. What is  happening in Los Angeles betrays our core beliefs.

The Federal response to deploy more than 4,000 National Guard troops  and 700 marines without a local request is a troubling overreach. It  risks escalating tensions and chilling the right to protest, which is  protected by the Constitution.

We need leaders that listen and not the ones that answer concerns  with intimidation and threats. In south Florida, immigration isn't an  abstract political issue for us. It is personal. Our region is home to  vibrant Jamaican, Haitian, Venezuelan, Cuban, and Central-American  communities. They are nurses, doctors, pastors, teachers, small  business owners, and caregivers.

The reason our economies thrive is because of our immigrant  communities. The attacks on immigrants and Americans exercising their  right to protest must end now.
