Make Refugee Policy Same for All


Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, this week, a group of  Afrikaners arrived in the United States. They were greeted with open  arms and American flags. Every single one of them skipped to the front  of the line thanks to the expedited pathway that the administration  handed them.

Although they are not facing any imminent threat, nor any  persecution, according to this administration, these farmers were  victims who were being brutally killed as a part of a genocide. These  claims are absolutely false.

We must ask ourselves: Why wasn't any grace extended to those fleeing  the Democratic Republic of the Congo, home to the deadliest conflict in  the world? There is no temporary protected status for them.

Why wasn't any grace extended to Afghans, who helped our soldiers at  war and risked their lives for the American people? This administration  ended their deportation protections on the same day they welcomed  Afrikaners.

For those Haitians who fled instability and gang violence, why were  TPS and humanitarian parole ripped away from them?

Around the world, we have victims of war, famine, and bloodshed, but  they have been left out to dry, where these Afrikaners were welcomed  with open arms and, once again, without any persecution or risk of  harm.

We can't simply open our doors to the vulnerable when they serve  political purposes. Refugee policies should never align with an agenda.  It should serve those who are in need, those families overseas who will  be murdered if America abandons them, not to people who serve a  political purpose and for political gain.

They should be awarded the same pathway that Afrikaners were given.
