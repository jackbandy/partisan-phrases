Immigrants Are Being Treated Without Basic Dignity and Being Denied Medical Care


Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, this administration's  deportation process has been sloppy and reckless since day one. No due  process and no transparency, just families being illegally ripped apart  and left to fend for themselves.

In severe instances, innocent people have actually died, like Marie  Blaise. She was a 44-year-old Haitian woman who was in ICE custody in  Pompano Beach. Marie had been complaining about chest pain for hours.  They gave her some pills and told her to go lie down. Unfortunately,  Marie never woke up.

Her loved ones deserve answers. They deserve accountability, like so  many immigrant families who have their loved ones missing and who are  hurt. These conditions at the ICE facilities are inhumane and  unsanitary.

Immigrants are being treated without basic dignity and being denied  medical care. I am calling for a full and transparent investigation  into Marie's death, and I will be visiting the Broward Transitional  Center very shortly. It is this neglect and cruelty that is really  hurting our American families who are being deported even at this  moment.

Mr. Speaker, we must have transparency. We must have justice.
