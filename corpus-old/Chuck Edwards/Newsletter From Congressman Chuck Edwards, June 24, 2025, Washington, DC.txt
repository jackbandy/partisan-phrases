Newsletter From Congressman Chuck Edwards


Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  newsletter to give an update to my constituents on the reconciliation  bill and restoring law and order.

Dear Friend,

As a member of the House Budget Committee, I've helped       craft the most fiscally responsible reconciliation bill in       U.S. history with $1.7 trillion in savings, which garnered       the support of the full House Republican conference.

The Senate is currently reviewing the bill, and I'm urging       Senate leadership to make sure that any changes to the bill:       Do not increase the deficit relative to current law.

Provide real savings--no gimmicks or tricks. Any additional       tax cuts must be matched dollar-for-dollar by enforceable       spending reductions.

Balance tax relief and spending restraint for sustainable       growth.

Our unified government cannot squander this unique       opportunity to change the trajectory of our nation by       restoring fiscal discipline.

From my seats on the House Budget and Appropriations       Committees, I will continue to push for policies that will       reverse our national debt, make sure tax dollars work for the       American people, and root out waste, fraud, and abuse.                           Restoring law and order

In an extreme example of spinning reality, some have       alleged that the Los Angeles protests we've seen coverage of       online and on TV have been ``peaceful.''

Let's set the record straight: Protestors were engaging in       violence and vandalism--burning cars, attacking police       officers, and burglarizing businesses. The previous       administration's open-border policies and disregard for the       law led us to the chaos and lawlessness we are seeing today,       and it is President Trump's responsibility to restore law and       order. That is why I fully support his decision to send       Marines and National Guard troops to LA.

Unfortunately, we will continue to pay for the consequences       of open borders for decades to come; but to address these       issues, I'm co-sponsoring the following bills:              Stop Anarchists from Endangering (SAFE) Cities Act

Codifies President Trump's executive order restricting       federal funding for jurisdictions deemed to be ``anarchist       jurisdictions'' by cutting federal funding for any state or       local jurisdictions the Department of Justice identifies to       be permitting ``anarchy, violence, or destruction.''                  Returning Illegals Over Turmoil (RIOT) Act

Makes any illegal immigrant, DACA recipient, or lawful       permanent resident who is arrested and convicted of       assaulting a police officer or member of the military and/or       vandalism or destruction of public property during a declared       emergency deportable and permanently inadmissible.                   Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act

Revokes federal funding from state and local jurisdictions       that fail to honor ICE detainers or ignore communications       from ICE.

We must put Americans first by ensuring the safety of our       citizens and the security of our Nation. In Congress, I will       continue to push for legislation to do so.
