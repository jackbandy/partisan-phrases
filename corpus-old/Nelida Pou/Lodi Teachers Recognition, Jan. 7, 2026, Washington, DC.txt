Lodi Teachers Recognition


Ms. POU. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Christine Orosz and Melanie  Panarese, two exceptional educators in Lodi, New Jersey, whose  dedication to their students and community exemplifies the very best of  public education.

A graduate of Lodi public schools, Christine returned home to serve  the district that shaped her. Since joining Lodi in 2012, she has grown  from school counselor to supervisor of school counseling, overseeing  guidance and mental health support for students across her district.

Working with first-generation college aspirants, English language  learners, and students from working-class families, Christine has  demystified college applications and financial aid. She has opened  doors that once seemed out of reach.

Her leadership has helped raise Lodi's high school graduation rate  from roughly three-in-four students to nearly 90 percent.

Melanie Panarese, an English teacher at Lodi High School, brings the  same commitment to her classroom every single day. With two decades in  the profession and 7 years serving Lodi students, Melanie's lessons  encourage critical thinking and creativity.

She also pioneered an academic yearbook course allowing students to  design, write, and produce the school's yearbook, building  collaboration and pride in their work. Colleagues praise her  exceptional ability to make every student feel seen and valued.

Both Christine and Melanie were named New Jersey Exemplary Educators  in 2025, an honor reserved for educators who demonstrate true  leadership and positive influence on students and colleagues.

At a time when school districts face growing challenges and  diminishing resources, educators like Christine and Melanie continue to  step up, providing stability, opportunity, and hope for young men and  women.

Together, their work reminds us that investment in public education  is ultimately an investment in our communities and our future.

Christine and Melanie represent the very best of public education,  and I am proud to honor them today.                           Paterson Schools Funding

Ms. POU. Mr. Speaker, while we are talking about education in  America, I want to talk about something more serious: the Department of  Education's continued war on our schools.

Last month, without warning, the Department informed eight schools in  our district that it was rescinding $8 million in critical funding.

I urgently appealed to Secretary McMahon. My office met with the  Department, and our school districts repeatedly sought engagement. We  were ignored.

Over the holidays, the Department informed us that the cuts were  final and will begin immediately.

Over the next 3 years alone, schools in our district will lose  millions of dollars promised and planned for. The program has already  shown positive educational outcomes, and the negative consequences for  our kids will be felt for years to come.

Our school districts have been willing to work with the Trump  administration to remedy any issue to find a fair path forward, but  that willingness has not been matched.

Across the U.S., the Department of Education is dismantling public  schools. New Jersey is the latest victim.

I will continue working with our district school officials to use  every single tool available to restore this funding and to fight to  support public education. I will not give up on our children.
