Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025


Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, as I hear my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle, what I hear is the same racist, misogynistic trash,  different decade.

Republicans are invoking historical policies intended, let's be  clear, to disenfranchise Americans, especially working people, women,  students, indigenous people, and anyone who can't afford the burden of  a new bill.

The SAVE America Act is yet another Republican attempt to intimidate  and suppress the votes of anyone who threatens their extremist, white  supremacist agenda.

Don't take my word for it. Just look for the threats that surround  the polls, the gun-wielding masked men. It will become clear to you  that Trump and Republicans want to control who votes so they can remain  in power.

That is not democracy. That is destroying free, fair elections. It is  just another page from the authoritarian playbook, and we must have the  moral clarity in this place to stand against it, just like our  ancestors did.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill and to  vote with moral clarity.
