Condemning the Attacks on Minnesota Lawmakers in Brooklyn Park and Champlin, Minnesota, and Calling for Unity and the Rejection of Political Violence in Minnesota and Across the United States


Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 519  introduced by Congresswoman Kelly Morrison and the Minnesota  delegation.

I join my colleagues in condemning the attack that took the lives of  Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounded  Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette.

Let me say this loud and clear as so many have said today. There is  no place in our democracy for political violence. It violates our  shared humanity. The violence we saw in Minnesota is a consequence of  those in power irresponsibly stoking division and fermenting hate  against political opponents.

I also rise today to amplify the resolution's call that we all  reaffirm our commitment to a democracy where violent rhetoric and acts  like this are not tolerated.

Their call is echoed in my resolution to honor the life of Wadee  Alfayoumi, a 6-year-old boy from Illinois whose life was taken in the  act of anti-Palestinian violence. It is the duty of elected officials  and the media to tell the truth without dehumanizing rhetoric when  informing the public of factual information.

We know that dehumanizing rhetoric can fuel sentiments of hate that  result in violence, and each tragedy adds to a litany of evidence that  our safety and our security are interconnected. Dehumanizing rhetoric  makes us all less safe. Whether it be Truth Social polls, on Twitter or  anywhere else, we all have a responsibility to denounce political  violence in all its forms.

It is our duty to denounce, and we will continue to reject, all forms  of hate-fueled violence from Plainfield, Illinois to Gaza to Israel to  D.C. to Boulder to Minneapolis and everywhere in between. It is our  responsibility, and I thank the sponsors for bringing this resolution.
