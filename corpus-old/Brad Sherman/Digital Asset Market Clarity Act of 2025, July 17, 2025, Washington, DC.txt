Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025


Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I submitted many amendments to Rules, as  did other Democrats. They made only one in order. I will not be  offering it because in the absence of the other amendments, it is  really not useful.

This bill is an attack on working families, which is why the AFL-CIO  says no, and they are scoring it.

This bill prohibits Congress Members from sponsoring cryptocurrencies  because of the obvious corruption and conflict of interest, but it  allows the President to create electronic Monopoly money.

Who is buying? Abu Dhabi is buying $2 billion of Trump stablecoin  while the Chinese interests behind TikTok are buying $300 million worth  of Trump coin, and that is just what we know about. There is a lot we  don't know about because cryptocurrency literally means hidden money.

It allows for bailouts under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve  Act. Jay Powell won't do it, but the next guy will.

Congress won't stop him because crypto spends more in super-PAC than  any other industry by far, five times more than the combination of Big  Oil and Big Pharma.

It allows for the purchase of bitcoin and Trump coin, and Trump has  announced that he is going to do just that with our tax dollars going  into his crypto.

Mr. SHERMAN. Finally, this creates the perfect financial tool for  drug dealers and for tax evaders because every time a billionaire  cheats on his taxes, a member of the Freedom Caucus earns his wings.
