One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, if you are a Republican with misgivings about the  massive debt that this bill creates or if you are worried about  stripping 17 million Americans of healthcare access, I tell you that  now is your moment.

``A coward dies a thousand times before his death, but the valiant  taste of death but once.'' That is a quote from Shakespeare.

Vote your constituents. Vote your conscience. This is how you will be  remembered.

Better to vote your conscience today and face an angry tweet than  have your legacy be one of equivocation and cowardice.

``By their deeds you will know them.''

I urge all of my colleagues to oppose debt, death, and hunger. Oppose  this cruel legislation.
