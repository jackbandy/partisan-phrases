Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Chair, Republicans pretend to care  about the Nation's debt and annual deficits, but they have instructed  Ways and Means to add $4.5 trillion to the debt to provide tax cuts to  the wealthiest.

What we have heard from our Republican opponents here today is that  if we don't pass this resolution, everybody's taxes are going to be  raised.

I will tell you what, there will be crumbs from the master's table  for the average American earning under $200,000 a year versus tax cuts  for the wealthiest corporations and individuals.

That is the math. I know how fond you are of math. That is the  arithmetic.

Let me tell you, the handouts to the wealthiest will come on the  backs of the least of us, from affordable healthcare through the ACA  and Medicaid, veterans healthcare, nursing home coverage, food  assistance, student loan repayment options, energy tax credits,  national security, and cancer research.

You all contend that 78 million people voted for this. No, they did  not.

Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Chair, no, 78 million people did not  vote for this. Who do you think you are fooling?

They are not fooled by your notion that somehow these tax cuts are  going to pay for themselves, that they are backed up by all kinds of  economists, the CBO, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
