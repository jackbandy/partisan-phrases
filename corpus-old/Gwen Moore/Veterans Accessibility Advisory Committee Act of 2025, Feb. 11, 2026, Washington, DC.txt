Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025


Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, here we go again. Donald Trump  lost the 2020 election. He is aggrieved about that, and so now he is  peddling claims of fraud as a pretext to take over our elections and  disenfranchise millions.

He tried to extort Minnesota into handing over their voter files.  Fulton County was raided. He has sued Wisconsin and other States for  their voter data. This bill would provide Kristi Noem access to all the  voter files in every State and upend the authority and the independence  of States and counties.

Why? It is so they can rig the elections and save Republicans. We  have to reject the so-called SAVE America Act and save our free and  fair elections and save our democracy.
