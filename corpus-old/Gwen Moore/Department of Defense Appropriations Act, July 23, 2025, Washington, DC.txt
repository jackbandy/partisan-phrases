Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2026


Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment  No. 233 to the FY 2026 Defense Appropriations bill. I thank Chairman  Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for including it in the Amendments  En Bloc No. 3.

Our world is facing numerous water challenges. Climate change is  making those challenges worse.

Our military is not exempt. The Defense Department has previously  identified water services failures as a growing risk, as they impact a  military facility's ability to execute missions and maintain warfighter  readiness. That is where my amendment comes in.

My amendment would increase funding for ongoing research and work  being done by the Army, with the help of some leading institutions of  higher education like the one in my district, Marquette University.

These partnerships with the Department of Defense (DoD), Marquette,  and other institutions of higher education are being used to study  technology and other solutions to water challenges facing our military  and our service members that can also benefit our communities like  improved sensing/monitoring of water pollution, and advanced water/ wastewater treatment technologies to facilitate reuse of pollution- impacted water resources.

Thus, collaboration between DoD and civilian researchers on water  contamination and resilience issues has the potential for many  benefits, including positive public health impacts.

With these additional funds, we can help unleash researchers to  explore water sustainment and resiliency technologies that increase  readiness and safety of military personnel in contingency bases and at  military installations, that can address and improve water efficiency,  and improve the conservation of water resources, and the resiliency of  water infrastructure.

I urge support for my amendment.
