Recognizing the Public Service and Community Leadership of C. Stewart Cleaf


Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the  public service and community leadership of C. Stewart McCleaf, who was  sworn in on January 5th to begin his fourth term as a Washington  Township Supervisor in Franklin County, Pennsylvania.

Over the years, Stewart has served in leadership positions with the  Township Board of Supervisors, Rouzerville Business Association,  Pennsylvania State Association of Township Supervisors, and Washington  Township Municipal Authority.

Since his retirement from a career in law enforcement in 1984,  Stewart has devoted his time and talents to support numerous civic and  non-profit organizations.

Stewart's enduring commitment to various forms of service sets an  inspiring example for all Americans who strive to make a positive  impact on their community.

On behalf of everyone in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District,  I express gratitude to Stewart for his distinguished legacy of service  and offer best wishes for continued success.
