Congratulating Dr. Steven Ashby on His Retirement


Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Dr. Steven  Ashby on his retirement as Director of the Pacific Northwest National  Laboratory in Richland, Washington.

Since 2015, Dr. Ashby's leadership at PNNL has driven scientific  excellence and innovation, advancing the lab as a world leader in  science, national security, and energy research and development.

Dr. Ashby believes our biggest challenges cannot be solved alone, and  his tenure reflected that belief. Having spent over a decade working to  expand the lab's reach with new partnerships and opportunities, he  transformed PNNL from a research lab to a world-class institution held  in the highest regards throughout the scientific community.

I also commemorate Dr. Ashby for his work on modernizing PNNL and  equipping the lab for the future. Under his leadership, the campus  became a hub for new and emerging technologies, including the Energy  Sciences Center and the Grid Storage Launchpad, that will contribute to  research and innovation for decades to come.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Ashby for his willingness to work with  myself and members of the Washington Congressional Delegation. We built  a strong relationship over the years and worked diligently to ensure  PNNL had the resources needed to not only be successful but excel in  their mission.

I wish Dr. Ashby the very best in his retirement and thank him for  his years of service.
