Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025


Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of the Whole Milk for  Healthy Kids Act of 2025.

For over 10 years, children in schools across our country have been  deprived of the many benefits of whole milk, and the Dietary Guidelines  for Americans has reported that nearly 90 percent of Americans do not  meet their daily dairy intake recommendations.

This overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation brings common sense back  to how we help the next generation stay healthy, putting vitamin D and  calcium-rich whole milk in front of millions of children nationwide.

However, Mr. Speaker, children are not the only ones who stand to  benefit from this legislation.

American dairy farmers produce and process some of the highest  quality products in the world. With school milk accounting for more  than 8 percent of fluid milk demand, this legislation allows our dairy  farmers to have their products go right back into the communities from  where they were produced.

I thank my colleagues in both Chambers on both sides of the aisle for  helping put this nutritious, high quality whole milk back into our  schools and also for bringing back common sense into how we keep  Americans healthy.
