Welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople


Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Ecumenical  Patriarch of Constantinople, His All-Holiness Bartholomew I, who is the  spiritual leader and the Primus inter Pares (First among Equals) of  Orthodox Christianity worldwide, a Church of 300 million people. This  September, His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew visited  our Nation's capital, continuing his longstanding practice of meeting  with the President and engaging with Members of Congress from both  political sides.

His All-Holiness is the spiritual leader of more than 300 million  Orthodox Christians worldwide, representing faith's ability to bring  people together across borders and generations. His leadership has  fostered dialogue among faith communities and highlighted the positive  role moral guidance can play in promoting cooperation and  understanding.

His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople,  has been called the Bridge Builder and the Patriarch of Peace by  Christians and non-Christians alike. I am proud to welcome a peacemaker  of his caliber to the Capitol.
