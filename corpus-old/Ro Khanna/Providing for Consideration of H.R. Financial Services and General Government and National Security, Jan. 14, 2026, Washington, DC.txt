Providing for Consideration of H.R. Financial Services and General Government and National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, no one in America is safe from ICE today.  Joe Rogan said that ICE agents are acting as ``villains,'' stripping  away freedoms from Americans. This agency has gone rogue. It is  lawless, and it needs to be reined in.

The ICE agents who pepper sprayed an elderly couple in Minnesota need  to be arrested and prosecuted. The ICE agents who dragged out a  disabled woman from her car who was going to a doctor's appointment  need to be arrested and prosecuted. The ICE agent who shot and killed  Renee Good needs to be arrested and prosecuted.

When you have people in the MAGA base, when you have people like Joe  Rogan talking about the lawlessness of a private police force--ICE  acting as the President's private police force--then we know we have a  crisis of freedom in this country. It is time to rein in this lawless  agency.
