Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I never want to hear the Republicans lecture  about fiscal responsibility again. The last President to actually  balance this budget was Bill Clinton. Today, Bob Rubin and Larry  Summers wrote an op-ed in The New York Times that every American should  read.

Their budget will take the deficit up to 8 percent of GDP. It is  historically unprecedented in the history of our country during  peacetime. We never had a more reckless, deficit-exploding bill than  what they are proposing.

The Democrats have a proposal to bring the deficits back down under 4  percent. Bob Rubin and Larry Summers were the last ones who have done  it. Hakeem Jeffries is leading with a sensible proposal to lower  deficits.

If you care about debt in this country, if you care about our  grandkids  being burdened with debt, if you care about a bond market devastation,  then you need to recognize that this bill hurts America, and you need  to support the Democratic plan for deficit reduction.
