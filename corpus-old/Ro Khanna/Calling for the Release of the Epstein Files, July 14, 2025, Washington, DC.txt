Calling for the Release of the Epstein Files


Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I introduced today an amendment demanding  the full release of the Epstein files. The Speaker's Rules Committee  should demand a vote tomorrow of every Member of Congress. Yes, we  should release it or, no, we should not.

This is a question of: Whose side are we on? Are we on the side of  protecting the rich and the powerful who have put their thumb on the  scales of government to suck out millions of dollars, while working- class Americans suffer, or are we on the side of the people?

The Attorney General said on her desk was the Epstein file. Now she  is saying: No, no, nothing to see. Don't release it.

This is a question of trust. We need to release the Epstein files so  we can restore government of the people, by the people, and for the  people. Every Member of Congress tomorrow should be forced to vote on  this amendment.
