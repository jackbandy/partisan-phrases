Recognizing Black Maternal Health Week in Santa Clara County, California


Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Black Maternal  Health Week from April 11 to April 17 in Santa Clara County. This  annual observance highlights the urgent need to address disparities in  maternal health outcomes for Black women, ensuring that all mothers  receive equitable, respectful, and high-quality healthcare.

The United States continues to face a maternal health crisis, with  Black women experiencing significantly higher rates of pregnancy- related complications and maternal mortality compared to their white  counterparts. These tragic and preventable outcomes stem from systemic  inequities, implicit bias in healthcare, and social determinants that  disproportionately impact Black mothers.

Santa Clara County has taken meaningful steps to acknowledge and  address these disparities and commit to initiatives that improve  maternal health access, education, and outcomes. Community-based  organizations, healthcare advocates, and local leaders are working  tirelessly to ensure that Black mothers receive the culturally  competent care and support they deserve.

I commend the leadership in Santa Clara County for prioritizing this  critical issue and uplifting Black maternal health as a matter of  public health and racial justice. However, we must do more at the  federal level to address these inequities. I call upon my colleagues in  Congress to support legislation such as the Black Maternal Health  Momnibus Act, which aims to expand access to healthcare, invest in  community-driven solutions, and promote policies that will save lives.

Black Maternal Health Week is not just a time for awareness but a  call to action. We must listen to the voices of Black mothers, amplify  their experiences, and enact meaningful change to ensure that maternal  health equity becomes a reality.
