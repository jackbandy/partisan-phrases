Americans of All Parties Do Not Want More War


Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose war in Iran or any  wars of choice in the Middle East.

We need to be investing in good-paying jobs at home, healthcare at  home, and childcare at home, not billions of dollars in missiles  targeted at the Middle East that we can't afford. That is why  Representative Massie and I introduced a resolution to prevent more  wars of choice.

What did we achieve? The intelligence tells us that we just pushed  Iran back 3 to 4 months in building a bomb. Vice President Vance says  they still have enough nuclear fuel to have 10 nuclear missiles.

We need tough diplomacy to deny Iran a bomb, not more wars at the  expense of the American people. Americans of all parties do not want  more war.
