Disinterment of Remains of Fernando V. Cota From Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, Texas


Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Smith for yielding  time.

Mr. Speaker, as our country wastes trillions of dollars in wars  overseas, the American people are frustrated and saying: Why is it that  we are doing that, while China, with its Belt and Road Initiative, is  building its industrial base? They do not want us investing in wars  overseas. They want us investing in manufacturing here at home, in  healthcare here at home, and in childcare here at home.

As we debate this bill, President Trump is announcing that he has  seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. People voted for  President Trump because he was going to end the endless wars. This  Congress must stand up against another war in Venezuela like we had in  Iraq, Afghanistan, or Libya. The American people do not want a regime  change war in Venezuela.

Mr. Speaker, while I have such tremendous respect for the chairman of  the committee and the ranking member, it is not enough for Pete Hegseth  to come and just testify behind closed doors. I trust their judgment,  but we need an accountability and a full hearing where Pete Hegseth  answers to the American people for what happened off the coast of  Venezuela.

It is not the American way of doing business of killing people who  are unarmed. That may be how Putin acts. That may be how Xi Jinping  acts. That is not how America acts. I know there are Republicans on  this committee who are concerned about how Hegseth has acted. We need  Hegseth before the Armed Services Committee, answering to the American  people.

Shame on him for throwing an admiral under the bus. The admiral has  far more honor than Pete Hegseth has. We need him to give answers to  the American people.

Mr. Speaker, I urge this committee and Congress to listen to the  American people and stop getting us into endless wars.
