Might Does Not Make Right


Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump's threats to invade Greenland  have destroyed the world order. Prime Minister Carney, quoting  Thucydides, has said that America is acting as if might makes right. He  is invoking Vaclav Havel's call for resistance not against  authoritarian communism but against the arrogance of America.

Mr. Speaker, I am ashamed for my country. I want Prime Minister  Carney to know that there is a new generation of America that believes  in a multiracial democracy that raises the sovereignty and self- determination of all nations. I want him to know that there is a new  generation that believes in statesmanship, not subjugation. I want him  to know that there is a new generation that believes in Kant's vision  of perpetual peace with free nations bounded by international law.

Prime Minister Carney and leaders of the world, I ask for your  patience and faith that this new generation prevails in the United  States of America.
