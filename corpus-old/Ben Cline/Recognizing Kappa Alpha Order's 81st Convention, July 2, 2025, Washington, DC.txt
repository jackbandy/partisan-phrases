Recognizing Kappa Alpha Order's 81st Convention


Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 81st Convention  of the Kappa Alpha Order, which will be held in Roanoke, the heart of  Virginia's Sixth District. It is a distinct honor to welcome this  historic brotherhood back to its roots. Kappa Alpha Order was founded  on December 21, 1865, in a small room at Washington College, now  Washington and Lee University, in Lexington, Virginia.

What began as a bond of friendship has grown into a nationwide  organization that continues to promote leadership, service, and  moral integrity. The Order's motto, ``Dieu et les Dames,'' meaning God  and the Ladies, reflects its core values. For over 150 years, its  members have committed themselves to cultivating character and serving  their communities with distinction.

Today, KA's across the country continue to make a meaningful impact  through ongoing charitable work, campus leadership, and a lifelong  commitment to honor and duty. The Order's presence in our local  community is a point of pride, and I applaud their continued  contributions to the betterment of our society.
