Recognizing Southern Virginia University's Ncaa Division III Men's Volleyball National Championship Victory


Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a momentous  achievement by the men's volleyball team at Southern Virginia  University in Buena Vista, Virginia, which has brought home the  school's first-ever NCAA Division III National Championship victory.

On Monday night in Salem, Virginia, the Knights defeated powerhouse  Springfield College in a thrilling straight-set sweep of 25-20, 25-23,  and 27-25, capping an extraordinary 35-1 season. This victory wasn't  just a win on the court but the culmination of years of hard work,  perseverance, and belief.

Led by veteran Coach Tom Peterson, who has now guided three different  programs to NCAA titles, the Knights embodied excellence in every  sense. Senior outside hitter, Christian Sheaffer, named the  tournament's most outstanding player, led the charge with 13 kills,  while his teammates, including Kristo Bianchin, Kyler Evans, Justin  Madsen, and sophomore setter Gehrig Tolman, delivered in every critical  moment.

From a heartbreaking quarterfinal loss last season to the national  championship podium this year, this team exemplifies resilience and  heart.

I congratulate the Knights, Coach Peterson, and the entire SVU  community. This championship belongs to all of them.      Honoring 75th Anniversary of Norfolk and Western Class J No. 611                                 Locomotive

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 75th  anniversary of a true icon of American railroad history, the Norfolk  and Western class J No. 611 steam locomotive.

Built right in Roanoke, Virginia, in May of 1950, this bullet-nosed,  coal-fired marvel remains a shining example of American innovation and  craftsmanship. Spanning 110 feet and weighing 872,000 pounds, the 611  generated a staggering 5,400 horsepower and reached speeds of up to 100  miles an hour. For nearly a decade, it connected communities from  Virginia to Ohio, proudly pulling passengers across the heartland.

In 1952, it famously hauled President Dwight D. Eisenhower's campaign  train from Columbus, Ohio, to Kenova, West Virginia.

Thanks to the vision and tireless efforts of local advocates like Bev  Fitzpatrick and the dedicated team at the Virginia Museum of  Transportation, the 611 has undergone two major restorations, in 1982  and again in 2014, and it continues to operate as a living monument to  our railroading past.

Named a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1984,  designated Virginia's Official State Steam Locomotive in 2017, and  added to both the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register  of Historic Places in 2023 and 2024, the 611's legacy endures.

Mr. Speaker, as we mark this milestone, let us salute 611 and all of  those in Roanoke and beyond who have kept its whistle echoing through  the Blue Ridge and across the Nation.                   House Republicans Are Delivering on Their Promise

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, House Republicans delivered on our promise  last month to the American people by passing the One Big Beautiful Bill  Act. This landmark legislation makes the Trump tax cuts permanent,  slashes taxes for working families and seniors, and eliminates taxes on  tips and overtime. If you earned it, you should keep it.

It secures our border by finishing the wall, funding mass  deportations, and giving our agents the resources they need to stop the  fentanyl crisis and protect our communities.

It restores fiscal sanity by identifying $1.6 trillion in wasteful  spending for savings, ends taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries, and  implements real work requirements for able-bodied adults who are  benefiting from Medicaid or food stamp programs.

It unleashes American energy by reversing Biden's anti-energy  mandates and brings back American jobs. It strengthens our national  defense by modernizing our military, our shipyards, and our missile  defense systems to keep America safe.

This bill reflects what Americans want: security, prosperity, and  leadership. The Senate needs to act. Let's get this to President  Trump's desk and deliver real results for the American people.
