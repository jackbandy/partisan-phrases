Congratulating Glenvar High School Boys' Swim Team


Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary  achievement of the 2025 Glenvar High School boys' swim team, the VHSL  Class 1 and 2 combined State champions. The Glenvar Highlanders  traveled to Richmond on February 27 and captured their second  consecutive State title, an incredible accomplishment that reflects  their hard work, talent, and dedication.

With a squad of just 11 boys, Glenvar scored an impressive 280  points, outpacing second-place Radford High by 75 points. Of the 11  swimming events contested, the Highlanders won 5 and were runners-up in  2 others.

Congratulations to team members: seniors Avery McClanahan, Alec  McIlwain, Kees VanGerven, Connor Wilkes, and Zach Adams; juniors Landon  Cairns, Darren Delby, Grayson Shearer, and Avery Thompson; sophomore  Cooper Ermel; and freshman Aspen Thompson.

Special recognition goes to individual champions Connor Wilkes,  Landon Cairns, and Aspen Thompson, as well as the championship relay  teams. Connor Wilkes closes his Glenvar career as one of the most  decorated swimmers in school history and will continue his athletic and  academic journey at Carson-Newman University.

The Glenvar Highlanders have made their school and community proud. I  ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating these outstanding young  athletes.

Honoring the Life of Justice Lawrence Larkins Koontz, Jr.

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life  and legacy of Justice Lawrence Larkins Koontz, Jr., of Salem, Virginia,  who passed away at the age of 85.

Justice Koontz was one of the most consequential judges in the  Commonwealth's history. Over a judicial career spanning 42 years, he  served at every level of Virginia's court system, culminating in his  roles as the founding chief judge of the Virginia Court of Appeals and  as a justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia.

A Roanoke native and graduate of Virginia Tech and the University of  Richmond School of Law--go Spiders--Justice Koontz was known for his  clarity of writing, profound sense of fairness, and deep commitment to  justice. Justice Koontz mentored generations of legal professionals and  leaves a legacy of wisdom, service, and an unwavering dedication to the  rule of law.

We extend our deepest condolences to his beloved wife, Elizabeth, his  children, grandchildren, and all who were touched by his wisdom and  kindness. May his memory be a blessing, and may we all strive to live  with the same dedication to service that Justice Koontz so fully  embodied.              Restoring Accountability in the Federal Workforce

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I joined Senator Mike Lee of Utah  in introducing the No Union Time on the  Taxpayer's Dime Act, a critical step toward restoring accountability in  the Federal workforce. This bill will end the abuse of official time  which allows Federal employees to engage in union activities while  being paid by the taxpayers.

For years, Federal employees have spent millions of taxpayer dollars  on union-related work instead of performing their official  responsibilities. Federal employees spent 3.6 million hours performing  union-related activities in 2016 alone, costing taxpayers $177.2  million.

Even after reforms under the Trump administration brought that number  down to 2.6 million hours and $135 million in 2019, the lack of unified  reporting means the full scope of the problem remains unknown today.  This is money that should have gone to serve the American people, not  to subsidize private union interests.

Ending ``official time'' is a commonsense step to ensure taxpayer  dollars are used responsibly and to increase accountability across the  Federal workforce. Public funds should serve the American people, not  private union interests.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important  bill.
