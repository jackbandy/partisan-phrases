Recognizing the 75th Anniversary of James Wood High School


Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor James Wood High School  in Frederick County, Virginia, as it celebrates its 75th anniversary, a  proud milestone for an institution dedicated to cultivating excellence  through student engagement.

James Wood High School, established in 1950 and led by Principal Paul  Beable, became the sole high school serving Frederick County. Prior to  its opening, the county supported five smaller high schools located in  the rural communities of Stephens City, Middletown, Stonewall, Gore,  and Gainesboro. Each school was named for the community it served and  played a key role in educating local students. While those schools no  longer exist, the communities they represent continue to grow and stand  as a lasting reminder of the county's history and progress.

Named for James Wood, founder of Winchester, colonel of the Virginia  Continental Militia, and friend of George Washington, the school stands  on a foundation of history, leadership, and service.

Today, James Wood High School is led by Principal R. Shelly Andrews  and thrives by promoting the Four Colonel C's: critical thinking,  communication, collaboration, and creativity.

Mr. Speaker, as James Woods celebrates 75 years of service to our  community, we reflect with pride on its past and look forward to its  continued role in shaping future generations. Congratulations to James  Wood High School and all who have contributed to its remarkable  journey.       Celebrating Lord Botetourt High School's 2025 VHSL Title Victory

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exceptional  achievements of Lord Botetourt High School Lady Cavaliers basketball  team, who were recently crowned the 2025 Class 3A State champions.

The Lady Cavaliers capped an extraordinary 26-3 season by toppling  previously undefeated James Monroe, earning the program's fifth State  title since 1995. Under the remarkable leadership of Head Coach Renee  Favaro, now a two-time State champion with an impressive 117-29 record  over six seasons, this team has continued to raise the bar.

The Lady Cavaliers also captured the Region 3D championship and saw  standout players Madilyn Winterton and Maddie Caron named to the VHSL  Class 3A All-State First Team.

This State championship adds to a storied program legacy, including  back-to-back titles in 1995 and 1996 under Coach David Wheat, a 2018  title with Coach Chuck Pound, and a shared championship in 2020.

I would like to commend each of the dedicated student-athletes:  Addison Naff, Reagan Meade, Abby Kingery, Jaiden Dann, Madilyn  Winterton, Alicia Holmes, Madelyn Caron, Maggie Hoover, and Kayla  Windsor, and extended heartfelt congratulations to  Coach Renee Favaro and the entire Botetourt community. They have made  their school and Virginia's Sixth Congressional District  extraordinarily proud.

Go Lady Cavs.       Celebrating First Baptist Church of Roanoke's 150th Anniversary

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 150th anniversary  of First Baptist Church of Roanoke, a beacon of faith, service, and  resilience, since its founding as Big Lick Baptist Church on May 16,  1875.

From just 20 charter members in a small village, this church has  grown alongside the city it calls home. As Roanoke emerged as a  railroad hub and flourished, so too did First Baptist, driven by a  people focused on God, devoted to discipleship, missions, and the  community.

From their first sanctuary in 1878 to today's impressive 300,000- square-foot campus spread over 11 acres, First Baptist Church of  Roanoke has faithfully expanded its reach, and they have held onto  their heritage, including the original pulpit from their 1891  sanctuary, a powerful symbol of enduring faith.

For 150 years, they have been a light in the valley, feeding the  hungry, sending missionaries, broadcasting the Gospel, and transforming  lives.

May God continue to bless First Baptist Church of Roanoke for  generations to come.                                 Memorial Day

Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, on this Memorial Day, we do more than  remember. We honor the men and women who gave everything for this  Nation. We remember the fallen, those still missing in action, those  lost at sea, and the thousands who now rest beneath our flag, having  paid the ultimate price for our freedom.

These heroes answered the call to defend liberty, knowing it could  cost them their lives. Because of them, we live in a country where  freedom still rings and the American Dream endures.

Their sacrifice is not just a chapter in our history; it is the  foundation of our Republic. We are duty-bound to remember them, to  honor them, and to ensure that their service is never forgotten.

May God bless the memory of our fallen warriors, and may He continue  to bless the United States of America and all who wear the uniform in  its defense.
