Raising A Question of the Privileges of the House


Mr. MILLS. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.

Mr. MILLS. Mr. Speaker, I think that it is very clear that the actual  committee of jurisdiction is, in fact, the Ethics Committee, and  cooperating with them is my top priority.

I believe that all the accusations and false things that are being  said will be proven to be absolutely false in many ways. I have the  evidence and receipts, and I look forward to working with them.

I rise in support of my motion to refer this resolution to the  Committee on Ethics and encourage a ``yea'' vote on this motion.

The previous question was ordered.
