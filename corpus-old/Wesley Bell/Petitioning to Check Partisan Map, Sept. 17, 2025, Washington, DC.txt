Petitioning to Check Partisan Map


Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, the State legislature may have forced through  their partisan map, but in Missouri, the final word belongs to the  people. Our constitution gives Missourians the right to check the  politicians through the petition process.

No one asked for this map. Communities didn't demand it. Voters  didn't vote for it. It was written to serve the administration, not  Missouri. When politicians get it wrong, citizens have the chance to  make it right.

That is why the petition process is so important. It is a chance for  Missourians across the State--urban, rural, north, south, Black, White,  Hispanic, Asian--to come together and say our voices matter, our votes  matter, and we will decide what representation looks like.

This is bigger than party politics. It is about who holds the power  in our democracy. I believe the power is in the people of Missouri-- more specifically, in the pen and signatures of the people of Missouri  as we petition to save our democracy.
