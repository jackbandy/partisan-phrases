No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025


Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not just as a Member of Congress  but as the son of a police officer and as someone who spent nearly two  decades working in the justice system as a public defender, defense  attorney, judge, and as a prosecutor. I know what it means to uphold  the law, and I know what it looks like when the rule of law is under  attack.

This bill is not about judicial efficiency or fairness; it is about  power, raw, political power. The people who once cheered nationwide  injunctions when they served their agenda now want to eliminate them  because judges had the audacity to hold this administration  accountable.

It is a direct assault on judicial independence and many of my  Republican colleagues know it, but too many won't say it out loud for  fear of political retribution or a primary financed by Elon Musk. This  is not conservative, it is not constitutional, and history will  remember.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
