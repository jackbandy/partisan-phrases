Moment of Silence for Congressman William Clay


Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, today our country lost a true trailblazer.  Congressman William Clay passed away after a lifetime of service that  reshaped St. Louis and our Nation.

Already a civil rights icon before he was elected, he didn't come to  Washington to play politics. He came to fight for working people, Black  families, union members, and those too often left out and unheard. He  carried their voices into this Chamber and made sure they echoed.

Bill Clay was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. I  and so many others would not be here without the doors he opened and  the example he set.

Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, I hold his son, my friend and predecessor,  Lacy Clay; the entire Clay family; and the St. Louis community in my  prayers.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of myself, the entire CBC, which he helped  found, and the Missouri delegation, I ask for a moment of silence in  memory of the Honorable William Lacy Clay, Sr.
