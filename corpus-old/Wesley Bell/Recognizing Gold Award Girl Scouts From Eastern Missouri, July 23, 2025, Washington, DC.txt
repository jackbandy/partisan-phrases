Recognizing Gold Award Girl Scouts From Eastern Missouri


Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me  in congratulating several remarkable Girl Scouts from Girl Scouts of  Eastern Missouri for demonstrating extraordinary leadership, refreshing  creativity, and a commitment to making a lasting impact by earning the  most prestigious award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award.

Gold Award Girl Scouts are trailblazers who address the most pressing  issues facing their communities and the world with measurable,  sustainable, and far-reaching results. To earn the Girl Scout Gold  Award, high school-age Girl Scouts identify and investigate an issue  they care about, devise a plan, and then lead a team of experts and  community members to implement a project that produces lasting change.  Over the course of 1 to 2 years, Gold Award Girl Scouts demonstrate  significant initiative, commitment, and leadership, distinguishing them  from their peers. Through their resourcefulness and perseverance, they  embody the Girl Scout Law to truly make the world a better place.

I congratulate and include in the Record the following outstanding  young women:

Elizabeth Babcock, Troop 3230

Haley Brieler, Troop 3281

Gracyn Burke, Troop 3778
