Recognizing Gene Fisher and His Dedicated Service to the County of Ventura


Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Gene Fisher,  whose exceptional leadership and tireless advocacy as Co-Chair and  Executive Director of the Regional Defense Partnership have  strengthened Ventura County's defense community, bolstered our regional  economy, and ensured that our military installations remain resilient  and mission-ready. Under Gene's leadership, the Regional Defense  Partnership has served as Ventura County's community-based organization  supporting our military installations and commands as essential assets  to our national security and key contributors to our local economy.

During periods of uncertainty and significant challenges, including  threats of base realignment, downsizing, and evolving defense  priorities, Gene was a steady and trusted leader who helped ensure that  Naval Base Ventura County continued to thrive as the county's largest  employer, generating an estimated $4.6 billion annually and supporting  more than 24,000 military, civilian, and contractor jobs.

Throughout his tenure, Gene represented the interests of Naval Base  Ventura County with distinction, communicating its needs and priorities  to local government leaders, educational institutions, and business  partners, while building enduring partnerships among military commands,  public agencies, and the private sector. His deep commitment to both  the base and our community is evident in his work to ensure that  Ventura County's infrastructure, workforce, and expertise continue to  meet the evolving demands of 21st century national defense.

Among his many accomplishments, Gene led the Regional Defense  Partnership's efforts to expand Naval Base Ventura County from  approximately 70 to 110 commands, helped secure funding and legislative  support to enhance critical capabilities such as the Center for  Maritime Directed Energy Testing, and worked to ensure that Ventura  County remains at the forefront of advanced defense innovation and  collaboration.

Of particular importance to me is Gene's genuine passion for  fostering cooperation and partnership. In addition to his many other  community-focused initiatives, he convened monthly joint military-- community meetings, creating an essential forum for dialogue,  coordination, and mutual support among base leadership, local  stakeholders, and elected officials.

As he steps down from this role, I am proud to join our community in  recognizing Gene's 27 years of dedicated public service and his  extraordinary contributions to preserving the defense, economic, and  technological vitality of the County of Ventura.

Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration and respect that I recognize  Gene Fisher for his steadfast leadership and for the lasting impact he  has had on our community.
