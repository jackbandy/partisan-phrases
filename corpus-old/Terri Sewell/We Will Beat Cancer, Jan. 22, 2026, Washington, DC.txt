We Will Beat Cancer


Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 842, the Nancy  Gardner Sewell Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage  Act,  which was included in the funding package being considered by the House  today.

Named in honor of my mother who lost her battle to pancreatic cancer  in 2021, this legislation would expand access to cutting-edge cancer  screenings for America's seniors, ensuring Medicare coverage for these  emerging tools once they become FDA approved.

I am immensely grateful that this bill was led by Republican sponsor,  Congressman Jodey Arrington, and the many organizations and patient  advocacy groups who helped us push this bill across the finish line. I  am giving a big shout-out to the American Cancer Society Cancer Action  Network, PanCAN, the Prevent Cancer Foundation, the National Minority  Quality Forum, and so many others.

Thanks to their tireless advocacy, H.R. 842 is the most cosponsored  bill in the 119th Congress with 339 cosponsors in the House and 68  cosponsors in the Senate.

I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation. Rest in  power, my sweet mother. We will beat cancer.
