One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, this so-called big, beautiful bill is  nothing but a big, ugly betrayal of Alabama families and a big handout  to billionaires.

There is nothing beautiful about stripping healthcare from working  families. There is nothing beautiful about taking food off the table of  the most vulnerable neighbors, and there is nothing beautiful about  putting rural hospitals on life support in communities that can least  afford it.

Mr. Speaker, the cuts in this bill are not just numbers on a page.  They are empty cupboards and shuttered clinics. They are hospital wings  closed in small towns already struggling to keep their doors open. They  are parents lying awake at night wondering how they will afford  medicine for a sick child or how they will keep food on the table if  they lose their hours.

Here are the facts: 170,000 Alabamians will lose their healthcare;  700,000 Alabamians will lose or have reduced their nutrition  assistance; five Alabama hospitals will close, and it adds $5 trillion  to the national debt.

On behalf of the 750,000 Alabamians that I represent in Alabama's  Seventh Congressional District and the 5 million hardworking  Alabamians, I say  vote ``hell no'' on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
