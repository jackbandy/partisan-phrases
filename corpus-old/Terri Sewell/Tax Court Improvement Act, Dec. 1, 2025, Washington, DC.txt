Tax Court Improvement Act


Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for bringing this bill to the  floor.

I rise in support of H.R. 5349, the Tax Court Improvement Act, which  passed the Committee on Ways and Means with overwhelming bipartisan  support.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my cosponsor and colleague, Mr. Moran of Texas,  for his leadership and for working with me on this important  legislation. I also thank the gentleman from Texas for the smoked  turkey he sent to several members of our committee.

The Tax Court has a very important impact on everyday Americans. It  provides individuals and businesses with an opportunity to be heard in  court to challenge the Internal Revenue Service before paying a  disputed tax. Our committee is always looking for ways to make the Tax  Court more efficient and fairer for the taxpayer, and that is why we  are here today.

The Tax Court Improvement Act will strengthen Tax Court procedures  and practices by making four commonsense reforms. The act will  accelerate the collection of documents, expand the types of cases  assigned to special trial judges, hold Tax Court judges to the same  recusal standards as other Federal judges, and allow the deadline for  petitions to be extended in certain circumstances.

These improvements to the Tax Court will have a tangible impact on  thousands of taxpayers, and it will raise $6 million over the next 10  years.

Given the importance of the Tax Court, I urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support this important legislation.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, in support of H.R. 5349, the Tax Court  Improvement Act, is the fact that we want more commonsense, bipartisan  efforts to modernize our Tax Court system.

At its heart, this bill strengthens taxpayer rights and removes  unnecessary procedural roadblocks. Specifically, it authorizes the Tax  Court to issue subpoenas before hearings. That means third parties can  be compelled to produce relevant documents, electronic records, and  other evidence early, facilitating settlement, reducing the need for  protracted litigation, and helping to resolve disputes sooner rather  than later.

This bill also expands the role of special trial court judges,  allowing them to hear additional cases and act when there are issues  such as contempt, thereby helping to clear backlogs and improving the  court's overall input.

It holds Tax Court judges and special trial judges to the same  ethical and disqualification standards as other Federal judges,  ensuring transparency and integrity in every case.

This bill also clarifies that the Tax Court has the jurisdiction to  grant equitable tolling in deficiency cases. In other words, the court  can expand and extend deadlines when timely filings were impossible and  impractical to make.

These reforms are not radical. They are commonsense improvements  designed to deliver timely justice, lower court costs, and greater  access for everyday Americans, small businesses, and those who  currently face intimidating and burdensome procedures.

In a system where there are high stakes for individuals, families,  and entrepreneurs, there is nothing uncommon or unreasonable about  expecting a fair shot, swift resolution, and procedures that reflect  modern realities. That is exactly what H.R. 5349 delivers.

Passing this legislation is a statement that we believe in a tax  system where accountability, transparency, and due process matter, not  just for the wealthy or well-connected, but for all Americans.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support H.R. 5349 and deliver on commonsense Tax Court reform.
