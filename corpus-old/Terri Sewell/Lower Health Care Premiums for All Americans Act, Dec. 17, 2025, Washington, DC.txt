Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  bill.

In a matter of days, roughly 130,000 people in my home State of  Alabama will lose their healthcare coverage because Republicans in this  body refuse to extend the ACA tax credits. Millions of Americans will  find themselves one diagnosis away from bankruptcy.

Rather than addressing the crisis that they created, Republicans are  pushing legislation that will make matters worse. Not only does this  bill fail to extend the tax credits, but it promotes junk insurance  plans that will rip off consumers and make healthcare even more  unaffordable.

House Republicans are incapable of dealing with our Nation's  affordability crisis. They should stop their political games and put  the bipartisan Jeffries bills on the floor today.

Mr. Speaker, we deserve better. My constituents deserve better. Every  American deserves better.
