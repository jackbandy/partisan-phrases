Electronic Filing and Payment Fairness Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1152, the Electronic Filing  and Payment Fairness Act.

Taxpayers should have one clear deadline to file documents and make  required payments. Under current law, payments or certain documents  that are mailed to the IRS are considered timely filed as long as they  are postmarked by midnight on the due date. This is called the mailbox  rule. However, if a taxpayer submits certain payments or documents to  the IRS electronically on a given due date but they are not processed  until the next day, they would be considered late.

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow the mailbox rule  to extend to electronic tax payments and documents.

The IRS should not treat taxpayers who choose to file electronically  differently than those who file by mail. This bill would ensure the  same standard for all Americans regardless of how they file.

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time so I am prepared to close.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1152 is a narrowly targeted bill that can provide  meaningful help and assurance to taxpayers.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
