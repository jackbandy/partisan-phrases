Internal Revenue Service Math and Taxpayer Help Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 998, the Internal Revenue  Service Math and Taxpayer Help Act. This bill will help taxpayers  better understand why they have received a math error notice from the  Internal Revenue Service.

Currently, math error notices can be vague and confusing. The law  does not specify how the IRS must describe the math error or require  the IRS to inform taxpayers that they have 60 days to request that the  math error assessment be reversed.

This bill will fix these issues by requiring the Internal Revenue  Service to provide a clear and straightforward explanation of any  alleged math or clerical error in the notice. It also requires the IRS  to update procedures on how to request abatement and, upon the  determination of an abatement, to issue a notice of abatement to the  taxpayer.

Furthermore, this bill requires implementation of a pilot program to  explore the use of alternative mail delivery methods for issuance of  math error notices.

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 998 is a commonsense,  bipartisan bill. I encourage my colleagues to support it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
