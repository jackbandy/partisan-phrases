Expressing Condolences and Congratulations


Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise to express condolences  to Illinois Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton and her family on the  passing of her father, Dr. Henry Wiggins, a renowned physician,  military veteran, and health activist.

I also express and convey condolences to the family of my good friend  Reverend Charles Bowers, who recently passed away last week at the age  of 95.

On a happier note, I extend congratulations to my dear cousin and  high school classmate, Cora Henderson, and her husband Floyd, on the  occasion of their 65th wedding anniversary. Sixty-five years is a long  time.
