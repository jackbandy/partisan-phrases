National Police Week


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am here in the Senate honoring  our Nation's law enforcement officers during our 64th annual National  Police Week.

National Police Week presents an opportunity to show appreciation  toward the men and women in blue for their sacrifice and selfless  service and honor, at the same time, the fallen officers.

Every day, men and women selflessly and courageously dedicate their  lives to keeping America safe and sound. They uphold our public safety  and devote themselves to the pursuit of justice. Their devotion merits  our admiration, and we are deeply indebted to them.

We especially honor the fallen heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice  in the line of duty. This year, we are honoring 234 law enforcement  officers who were killed in the line of duty.

The list of fallen includes two of my fellow Iowans, Trooper Jeffrey  Brown and Senior Police Officer Phoukham Tran.

I want to make it crystal clear: I back the blue not just during  Police Week, but year round.

I like to say to them when I see them: Thank you for your service,  and I am not for defunding the police.

To our law enforcement officers nationwide: Thank you for your  sacrifice, your service, and your dedication.
