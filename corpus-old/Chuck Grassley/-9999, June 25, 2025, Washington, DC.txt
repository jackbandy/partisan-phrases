Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I want to bring attention to all  of the selfless veterans that have served our country, especially those  from my home State of Iowa.

Each and every veteran has put a piece of themselves towards the  mission of protecting our Nation that we are blessed to live in, so it  is tremendously important to commemorate and thank these veterans.

I want to give you one example of how that is done: the Honor Flights  that take place at the World War II Memorial. The veterans that travel  from across the country to here in Washington, DC, represent big  cities, small towns, and rural areas. But what they all embody is deep  courage, sacrifice, and humility. Honor Flights are just one small  reflection of the gratitude that we have for these brave souls.

I hope that for visitors to our Nation's Capital who have the  privilege to witness an Honor Flight, it may inspire deeper gratitude  to all the veterans. This is what I found when, occasionally, I get an  opportunity to go to the World War II Memorial to meet the veterans  that have flown in from Iowa.

And many times, I had the occasion to see--when he was still alive-- former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, even in his weak condition being in  a wheelchair, there to meet those same veterans from all over the  country, not just from Iowa.

It is a priority for me to share their legacy with every new  generation of Americans to foster a deeper appreciation for our  Republic.
