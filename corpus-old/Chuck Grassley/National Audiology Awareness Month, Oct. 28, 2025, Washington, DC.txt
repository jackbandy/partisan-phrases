National Audiology Awareness Month


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, October is National Audiology Awareness  Month. It also happens to be the 3-year anniversary of the bipartisan  Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act regulations going into effect. You see  this on television now--advertisements for the Over-the-Counter Hearing  Aid Act. Before this legislation was passed, there was a whole bunch of  redtape you had to go through to buy very expensive hearing aids. Now  they are more affordable.

While it took too many years for the Food and Drug Administration to  issue these regulations following my bipartisan 2017 law, I am glad  Americans now have access to safe, effective, and affordable hearing  aids over the counter.

While we have known for years that hearing loss is a major factor in  a person getting dementia, it wasn't until recently that we found out  that accessing hearing aids can decrease the risk of cognitive decline  by nearly half.

For many, purchasing hearing aids presents many questions. That is  why accessing audiology services can be helpful.

To access audiology services, like a diagnostic test, under Medicare,  a physician's order is required. That requires more time and a great  number of hoops to jump through. I want people to know that I support  cutting this unnecessary redtape. That is why I partnered with my  colleagues to introduce legislation called the Medicare Audiology  Access Improvement Act. Our bill will let seniors access a full range  of hearing health services provided by licensed audiologists without  the redtape.

During Audiology Awareness Month, Americans should be aware that they  can access hearing aids over the counter, and Congress is working hard  to improve access to those audiology services.
