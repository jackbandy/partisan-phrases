Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for my colleagues who are  protectionists, I think that when it comes to the issue of trade, we  need less of Peter Navarro and more of Adam Smith. I think the  certainty that comes with trade policy will benefit our economy the  most.

Hopefully, we don't have a government shutdown this week. I want my  colleagues to remember that it costs money to shut down the government.  It costs money to open the government up. There is even some money  being wasted this week as bureaucrats plan for a possible shutdown.

The government is supposed to be a service to the American people,  and you can't serve the American people if government is not  functioning.
