Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, one of the issues that Congress must  deal with--and do it very shortly--is the cost of health insurance.

President Obama famously said that ObamaCare would let Americans keep  their health insurance if they liked it and that it would also lower  their premiums. We know, more than a decade later, that those promises  were never true.

We need to lower healthcare costs. It starts with expanding access  and competition to high-quality, affordable health insurance through  health savings accounts, association health plans, and other consumer- driven health plans. It also requires action to reduce prescription  drug prices through pharmacy benefit manager reform. That reform should  not be a tough thing to do because we have three separate approaches in  the U.S. Senate, with a total of about 60 to 65 Members, in a  bipartisan way, supporting the passage of PBM reform.

The evidence for fixing ObamaCare can be found in America's  pocketbook today. I recently received a letter from an Iowan,  documenting the increases this person has seen in his monthly health  insurance premiums, just since ObamaCare became law. Before ObamaCare  was signed into law, this Iowan saw zero-percent increases in his  health insurance premiums and even saw premium reductions. In the 8  years prior to ObamaCare, this Iowan had a cumulative premium increase  of 4 percent. In the 8 years since ObamaCare, this Iowan saw a  cumulative premium increase of 87 percent.

Health insurance has gotten more costly under ObamaCare--case in  point with this Iowan's story. His monthly health insurance premium,  which was once around $800 before ObamaCare, is now over $2,000 a  month.

Extending temporary COVID bonuses for wealthy households, where the  money is shoved to insurance companies, is not the answer. We need to  enact commonsense solutions to bring down healthcare costs.
