Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today marks the 100th day of President  Trump's return to the White House.

Trump 2.0 has hit Washington like a hurricane. By that, I mean  President Trump is working hard to keep his promises, unleash America's  golden age, and launch a revolution of common sense.

Let's take a look at some of these achievements.

First and foremost, President Trump secured the border. He did that  by words he used at the joint session of Congress. All it took was a  new President.

Today also marks Fentanyl Awareness Day. Fake pills laced with  fentanyl are killing young people in the prime of their lives.  President Trump is fighting tooth and nail to stop the flow of deadly  fentanyl from China that is trafficked by dangerous drug cartels into  our communities.

Here in the Senate, I led the passage of a bill that is entitled the  HALT Fentanyl Act, but there is more work to do. Big Tech must be held  accountable to protect young people from being targeted by drug  traffickers on social media.

President Trump also promised to cut wasteful spending, unleash  America's energy, bring back manufacturing jobs, and get our trading  partners to the negotiating table. And on that latter point, he is  being very successful. The President is swinging for the fences, and he  is running the bases.

Whichever political side of the fence you are on, one thing is for  sure: President Trump ran on a platform, and he is serving on that  platform. Promises made; promises kept. That is a refreshing change in  this town. Seventy-seven million Americans voted for this President to  get America roaring back to peace and prosperity. In these first 100  days, that is exactly what President Trump is doing, and we are just  getting started.

Mr. President, I have time for other remarks that I would like to  make at this point.
