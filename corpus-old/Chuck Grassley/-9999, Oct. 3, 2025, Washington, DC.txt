Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for the third day, we heard an opening  prayer of the Chaplain praying that the government will open up and we  in Congress would find a solution to keep the government open. That  will help the 750,000 executive branch employees who are on furlough  without pay; that will help the congressional staff who are working  without pay, help the economy--something we should be doing.

You have heard me say several times how ridiculous it is to shut the  government down because it costs money to shut the government down. It  costs money to open the government up. The government is supposed to be  a service to the American people, and you can't serve the American  people if the government is not functioning properly.
