Executive Calendar


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 38 years ago on June 12, 1987, President  Ronald Reagan stood at the Brandenburg Gate and called for the General  Secretary of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall.

That wall was originally built to prevent people from fleeing  communist East Germany into democratic West Berlin. The legendary line  that President Reagan spoke:

Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.

Now, those lines were nearly left out of the speech after the  advisers from the State Department and the National Security Council  claimed that the statement was, in their words, ``too provocative.''

But President Reagan stood his ground. He wanted to speak directly to  the hearts of the divided world and take a moral stance against  tyranny. President Reagan's words resonated with millions of East  Germans. These East Germans dreamed of freedom. Two years later, the  wall came down. It turned out that Reagan's words were prophetic--not  provocative. Russia only understands strength. We still know that  today.

I have reminded my colleagues of this fact in the context of the  Russian invasion of Ukraine. Weakness is what provokes a KGB man like  Putin. President Biden was too timid in his approach, trying to manage  escalation. Had the West instead given the Ukrainians what they needed  earlier, they might have pushed Russia out of their country by now.

President Trump ought to not make the same mistake that President  Biden made. I think Putin thinks that he can play President Trump.  Putin's lackey, former ``puppet'' President Medvedev, admitted recently  what Russia wants is not peace but in his words ``swift victory'' and,  again, in his words a ``complete destruction'' of the Ukrainian  Government.

Putin will only respond to strength, and this Congress ought to give  President Trump the tools to stand up to Putin with strong sanctions  that plug the loopholes in the current Biden sanctions.
