Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, we are approaching the end of  this year's National Police Week, so I come to the floor to talk about  what Congress can do to support the brave men and women who protect us.

In a few moments, I will go to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where  I am chair, to take up eight bills that I have worked out with Ranking  Member Durbin and members of the committee--in other words, bipartisan  bills.

Each of these bills support law enforcement and gives law enforcement  critical tools to protect us Americans. For example, one of these bills  protects first responders from accidental exposure to fentanyl. Another  bill reauthorizes the task force and helps keep our children safe  online. A third bill bolsters the PSOB Program to protect first  responders' loved ones, should they bravely sacrifice themselves in the  line of duty. That is just a sampling of the list of bipartisan bills  that we will be considering today.

I take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for taking this National Police Week seriously, very seriously. I  have always backed the blue, and that is why I have set these eight  bills on the committee's agenda.

Once these bills are reported out of committee, I am committed to  moving them through the Senate expeditiously, and I assume, through  their bipartisan sponsorship, that we will have bipartisan support on  the floor of the U.S. Senate.

I call on my colleagues, then, to join me in supporting our law  enforcement community by passing my Police Week bills as quickly as  possible.
