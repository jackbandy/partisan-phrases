Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, September 19 is National Stillbirth  Prevention and Awareness Day. This day is set aside to recognize the  tens of thousands of families in the United States who have endured a  stillbirth.

More than 21,000 pregnancies in the United States end in stillbirth  each year. Sadly, this exceeds the top five leading causes of death  among children under 15 years of age. It is critical that we raise  awareness and take action to improve this grave statistic.

I am proud to have been a cosponsor of the Maternal and Child Health  Stillbirth Prevention Act that was signed into law last year. The law  clarifies that resources like Count the Kicks can be deployed for  stillbirth prevention. Count the Kicks is a simple and free tool that  helps pregnant moms count their babies' movements during the third  trimester. The results speak for themselves. In the first 10 years of  the Count the Kicks campaign in Iowa, the State's stillbirth rate went  down 32 percent while rates in the rest of the country remained static.

My work to improve maternal and child health doesn't stop there. I  have introduced the bipartisan Healthy Moms and Babies Act. This bill  is a comprehensive approach to addressing our maternal mortality  crisis. Through community-based efforts, improved support for rural  labor and delivery units, and increasing the use of technology like  telehealth, we can prevent maternal and child mortality regardless of  the ZIP Code.
