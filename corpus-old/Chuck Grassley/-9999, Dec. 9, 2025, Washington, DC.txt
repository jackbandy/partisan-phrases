Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since 2023, Sudan has been engulfed in a  civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces under the government of  that country and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, it is called.  It is termed in the paper and reports regularly--Rapid Support Forces-- as ``RSF.''

After an 18-month siege of El Fasher in the Darfur region, RSF forces  took control, and the Sudanese Armed Forces retreated.

Now, the RSF controls roughly half of the country of Sudan. Following  the violent takeover of El Fasher, there have been reports of mass  killings, reports of executions, and reports of sexual violence.

According to the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale University,  satellite imagery found evidence of mass killings and executions. The  Humanitarian Research Lab also alleges war crimes, including the  targeting of health facilities, targeting of workers, patients, and  even humanitarian aid workers.

Through the curse of this conflict, millions have been displaced and  tens of thousands have been killed. The United Nations has determined  that the conflict in Sudan is one of the worst humanitarian crises in  the world.

Our own country, the United States, has condemned reports of mass  atrocities committed by the RSF in El Fasher. The United States has  gone as far as in January 2025 to declare that the RSF and its allied  militias are committing genocide in Sudan.

The atrocities in Sudan are not just a foreign tragedy. I have been  hearing from Sudanese Iowans who have families in Sudan.

I wish the Trump administration well as it attempts to bring the  violence to a halt. I have heard President Trump, in his many news  conferences, sometimes bring the Sudan atrocities to our attention,  indicating he wants to take some action to bring peace to that country.  I thank him for doing that. The Sudanese people have been through  enough over the years and deserve a chance at a peaceful and prosperous  life.
