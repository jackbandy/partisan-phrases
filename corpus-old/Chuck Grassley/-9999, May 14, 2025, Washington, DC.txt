Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week for the first time ever,  Wrigley Field welcomed a high school team, and it was a high school  team from my home State of Iowa.

The Oskaloosa High School Indians baseball team--in partnership with  Musco Lighting, also from Oskaloosa--were invited to play in an  exhibition game at the home field of the Chicago Cubs.

After the Cubs played the San Francisco Giants, Musco Lighting  company lit up the stadium, and the Indians took to the historic  diamond. I imagine it was a dream come true for many, especially those  who are Cubs fans.

To share in that once-in-a-lifetime experience, the Oskaloosa High  School Chamber Choir performed the Star Spangled Banner prior to the  Indians' scrimmage game season. What a way to start the season. We can  say: Go Indians.
