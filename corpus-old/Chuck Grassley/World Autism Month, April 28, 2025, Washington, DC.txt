World Autism Month


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, April is World Autism Month. This month  is a time to recognize the millions of Americans living with autism.

Over the years, we have made progress in increasing awareness and  enhancing resources for individuals living with autism. I have worked  to pass the Kevin and Avonte's Law, which helps families locate missing  loved ones living with autism, Alzheimer's, dementia, and other  conditions that may cause them to wander.

The law is named in honor of two young boys with autism, Kevin Curtis  Wills from my State of Iowa and Avonte Oquendo from New York, who  tragically lost their lives after wandering from safety.

This law provides resources to train first responders and law  enforcement, helping each to respond more effectively to these  situations. It also provides State and local grants to support  communication tools that assist families to quickly locating missing  loved ones.

The purpose of this month is to increase the understanding of people  living with autism. I am proud that Kevin and Avonte's Law is helping  to do just that by enhancing the protection and safety of individuals  living with autism.
