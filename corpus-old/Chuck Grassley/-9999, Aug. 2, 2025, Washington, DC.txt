Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, soon, we will vote on the U.S. attorney  for the Southern District of Florida.

Until recent years, it has been unheard of to use floor time to  confirm U.S. attorneys. Typically, they are confirmed by voice vote. I  regret that we have become a body where every nominee has been  obstructed. U.S. attorneys keep our communities safe and ensure law and  order is enforced. There are 93 U.S. attorneys in the United States. It  would take more than 230 hours to confirm all of them. That is totally  unrealistic, and that is not hyperbole.

The Democrats' obstruction of nominees is hindering law and order  across our Nation. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I will  continue to work across the aisle to restore a commonsense confirmation  process for U.S. attorneys.
