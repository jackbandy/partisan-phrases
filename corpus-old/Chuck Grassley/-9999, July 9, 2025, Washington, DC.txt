Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this year, I have been working hard to  help the renewable fuels industry, which provides about 40,000 to  50,000 jobs in the State of Iowa and is a very big help for the family  farmers of Iowa. These family farmers rely on the renewable fuels  market as a source for the use of the bountiful crops that we raise  each year.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed last week, signed by the  President on July 4, supports family farmers and advances energy  production--renewable energy production and, also, fossil fuel  production.

During the consideration of this legislation, I pushed hard for a  provision to provide transition relief to small biodiesel producers by  temporarily extending the small agri-biodiesel tax credit. The previous  administration, the last 4 years, failed to release functional guidance  implementing the clean fuel production tax credit. Their refusal to do  that contributed to many small producers shutting down their operations  and leaving hundreds of people unemployed. The extension of this credit  will provide relief to these plants while they await further  implementation guidance from the Department of the Treasury under the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

I am proud to deliver this certainty to Iowa's small biodiesel  producers, to the consumers, and to the benefit of the 86,000 family  farmers of Iowa.
