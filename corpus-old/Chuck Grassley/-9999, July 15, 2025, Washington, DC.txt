Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, July 4 is supposed to be a day of  celebration and patriotism, but earlier this month, leftwing domestic  extremists tried to turn that day into a day of tragedy and a day of  terrorism.

On the evening of Independence Day, a group of antifa terrorists  carried out an ambush attack on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement  facility in Alvarado, TX.

They drew immigration agents outside by shooting fireworks at the  building and vandalizing cars in the parking lot. Unarmed ICE officials  came outside. They came outside thinking they were just dealing with  hooligans and not realizing that there were snipers hiding in the  trees.

The gunmen opened fire, but, thankfully, these leftwing terrorists  weren't your typical Texas straight shooters. Though they fired 20 to  30 rounds, they failed to kill or critically injure any law enforcement  officers.

When a shooter's gun jammed, he didn't know how to clear it so he  dropped his weapon and fled the scene. The terrorists tried to hide in  a nearby trailer park, endangering residents who were celebrating our  Nation's founding.

Thankfully, the local police were able to detain these violent  radicals without harm to any bystanders.

This assault on the ICE facility is a direct result of inflammatory  rhetoric aimed at our immigration enforcement officers. As you see  every day on TV, leftwing street mobs constantly chant that ICE  employees and ICE, generally, is a modern-day KKK.

A Democrat Congressman recently compared ICE agents to Nazis. I call  on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to condemn these outrageous  attacks and to condemn the left's hateful rhetoric toward the men and  women who enforce our immigration laws.
