Nomination of Linda McMahon


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote to confirm  Linda McMahon to be Secretary of Education.

I know that some people feel that the Secretary of Education should  have extensive experience in a school system; however, it is important  to remember that education is still mostly a State and local  responsibility. There is no such thing as a Federal superintendent of  schools. The U.S. Department of Education doesn't run any schools. Our  many public school systems in this country do not report to Washington,  DC, and Washington also has no authority over what is taught in our  schools around the country.

The job description of a Secretary of Education is to manage a  bureaucracy that runs a number of funding programs. By all accounts,  Linda McMahon did a great job running the Small Business Administration  in the last Trump administration. I have no reason to believe that she  cannot run the Department of Education. I think she understands the  difference between the State and Federal role in education.

I also expect that she understands the difference between the  executive and legislative branches when it comes to the serious  policymaking of education. Congress passes the laws and holds the power  of the purse. We have also the responsibility to make sure that laws  are faithfully executed by the executive branch of government. I expect  Linda McMahon to respond to all the congressional inquiries in a timely  and responsive manner.
