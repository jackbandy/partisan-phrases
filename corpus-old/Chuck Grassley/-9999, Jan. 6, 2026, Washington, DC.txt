Mr. GRASSLEY. On December 29, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services announced that my State of Iowa will receive over $209 million  this year from the Rural Health Transformation Fund. This Federal  funding will boost Iowa hospitals, Iowa clinics, Iowa nursing homes,  Iowa legal centers, and other rural providers.

I was proud to help craft the Working Families Tax Cut law that the  President signed on July 4 last year. That law provides for the largest  Federal investment in rural healthcare in history.

Under Iowa's Governor Kim Reynolds' leadership, Iowa is positioned  very well to use this historic investment to build a high-quality,  sustainable system of care for Iowans across the State. My State of  Iowa, under Governor Reynolds' leadership, plans to use this Federal  investment toward telehealth, workforce, preventing and treating  cancer, improving coordination of care, streamlining data sharing, and  expanding emergency medical care. These investments will improve  health, well-being, and quality of life not only in Iowa but in all of  rural America.

I am pleased that Iowa is maximizing this Federal investment in rural  communities, not investing in bureaucracy. And to show how this  investment is going to pay off without wasting money on administrative  costs, Iowa's administrative costs for this Federal funding are  projected to be less than 1 percent. Too often, you see Federal grants  with administrative cost rates of 8 percent, 15 percent, and I have  even seen, on more than one occasion, things as high as 60 percent. So  I am glad Iowa is wisely using this Federal investment. And I look  forward to seeing the result in rural Iowa.
