Civic Education


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, nonpartisan civic education and civic  participation are critical for our constitutional and representative  form of government.

Increasingly, however, civic knowledge is on the decline.

A recent survey by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that 70 percent  fail a basic civic literacy test.

Another survey found that nearly 17 percent of Americans could not  name any branch of government.

This should be concerning for all of us.

I would like to commend efforts in my home State of Iowa to promote  civic education and participation in our colleges and universities.  These include Cyclone Civics at Iowa State University, Hawk the Vote at  the University of Iowa, and the Center for Civic Education at the  University of Northern Iowa.

These programs are crucial in ensuring that the next generation of  leaders understands our constitutional system of government and are  ready to lead our Republic forward.
