Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week, Secretary Noem ended a  program that is called the Quiet Skies Program. It is a program that  was well-intended when it was set up, but the Biden administration  weaponized it to target its opposition, including the now-Director of  National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

Quiet Skies was supposed to track American airline travelers who had  prior contact with known or suspected terrorists.

You can have no argument with that intent to make sure that air  travel is safe, but instead it has been revealed that the Biden  administration's Transportation Security Administration allegedly  tracked U.S. citizens based upon nine nonsecurity-related  considerations.

As just one example, whistleblowers told my office, some who were  merely present at a rally on January 6, 2021, with President Trump were  added to the Quiet Skies' list of targeting.

In another allegation, a woman was accused of invading the Capitol on  January 6 and later added to the Quiet Skies. The woman was disabled  and couldn't physically engage in those actions.

Now, fortunately, Secretary Noem shut down Quiet Skies to end this  weaponization, and that should be music to everybody's ears.

In August 2024, I wrote to Biden's Transportation Security  Administration questioning their abuse of this authority under this  Quiet Skies Program. I did not get sufficient answers from the previous  administration.

I will continue my oversight to learn the full truth about the Quiet  Skies Program, and I appreciate Secretary Noem and Director Gabbard's  leadership as my office works with them on the oversight request.
