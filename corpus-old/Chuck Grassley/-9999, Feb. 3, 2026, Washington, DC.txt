Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in March of last year, I spoke here to  demand Hamas release all remaining Israeli hostages. In October last  year, I spoke about President Trump's Israel-Hamas cease-fire deal. At  that time, all of the living hostages had been returned to their  families in Israel.

However, the bodies of those who had been murdered under the brutal  terror of Hamas were still being held hostage. This was not merely a  delay in returning the remains; it was a very deliberate, very  psychological warfare tactic, weaponizing human suffering for the  political gain of Hamas. This cruelty also prevented families from  carrying out proper religious burial rights--a fundamental act of  dignity and respect for the dead in Jewish tradition.

Now nearly 3\1/2\ months after reaching the cease-fire deal by  President Trump, I am here to share that on January 26 this year, the  final body of hostages has returned home to Israel. Families who have  lived in unbearable uncertainty can now begin the sacred work of  mourning, remembrance, and healing.

This moment is a reminder of both the resilience of the Israeli  people and the enduring bond between the United States and Israel.  America stood firm in demanding the release of every hostage, the  living and the fallen, and we must continue to stand firm against those  who use terror, brutality, and human suffering as bargaining chips.

I commend President Trump and all those who worked tirelessly to  secure this outcome and remain hopeful that a lasting peace can be  reached.
