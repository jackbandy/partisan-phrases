Cameras in the Courtroom


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to compliment Erika Kirk, wife of  the assassinated conservative leader Charlie Kirk. She has made the  emotional appeal to have cameras in the courtroom at the trial of her  husband's murderer. I commend her for this brave plea because it fits  in with a stand I have been taking for the last couple of decades.

Courts at both the State and Federal level have a massive impact on  our daily lives and the lives of generations to come. Yet few Americans  get the chance to see the Nation's courts in action. That is almost  totally true of Federal courts. I believe most States do allow cameras  in the courtrooms, although not necessarily required under State  procedure in State courtrooms.

I have long held that cameras should be present in the Federal  courts, including the Supreme Court, because what I said about State  courts is not yet a requirement in Federal courts. Cameras would boost  transparency and help Americans grow in confidence and understanding of  the Federal Judiciary if we had cameras in the Federal courtrooms.

It has been maybe a joke that a couple of the Supreme Court Justices  said that having cameras at the Supreme Court would be over their dead  body. I don't wish anybody at the Federal court, whether they are  liberals or conservatives on that court, to pass because of cameras in  the courtrooms, but I happen to believe that cameras in the Federal  courts, like State courts, would boost transparency and help Americans  grow in confidence and understanding of the Judiciary.

When pivotal moments in history happen, we shouldn't be timid in  calling for greater transparency that history demands in the Federal  courts.
