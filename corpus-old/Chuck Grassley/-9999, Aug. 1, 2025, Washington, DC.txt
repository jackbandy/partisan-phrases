Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have often said that our veterans have  sacrificed so much for our Nation, so it is our responsibility to take  care of them when they come home. We owe a debt of gratitude to these  brave Americans.

I have been proud to work alongside my colleagues in the Senate to  strengthen mental health resources, increase access to healthcare, and  ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs is managing Federal  resources effectively to serve our veterans well.

While I work in Congress on behalf of our Nation of veterans, many  organizations work daily to support this selfless group of people.  There is one Iowa organization that I would like to highlight. It is  called the Veteran Flagpole Initiative. The Veteran Flagpole Initiative  started with a group of passionate Iowans who would install flagpoles  for veterans at no cost to the veteran.

The group started their work to provide veterans with a permanent,  visual reminder of their appreciation--our constituents' appreciation  for the veterans' service and sacrifice. The goal is to ensure at least  one veteran in all of Iowa's 99 counties has a flagpole by 2028, and I  am sure that their goal is to go well beyond that.

Their work continues at a time when the flag and what it stands for  is continually under attack, both here and abroad. It serves then as a  reminder that change begins at home, and one individual in America can  make a difference--some of them making big differences, maybe some  making smaller differences.

And we don't know the end result of the Veteran Flagpole Initiative,  but they are trying to make a big difference. Looking after those  around us provides a valuable lesson because you never know what  someone else may be facing, and the very small acts--as well as big  acts--of service may turn out to have monumental impact. So thank you  to the Veteran Flagpole Initiative and the many other organizations and  individuals that support our veterans daily.
