Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, yesterday, I stood here opening the  Senate and kicking off the 64th annual National Police Week. That is a  week dedicated to brave men and women who protect us and keep us safe.

Tonight, as part of this week's celebration, marks the 37th annual  candlelight. Each year, hundreds of officers killed in the line of duty  are recognized and memorialized at this vigil. The name of each man and  woman who gave their life will be read aloud.

I encourage everyone to join me in recognizing their sacrifices.  Honoring those who have made the ultimate sacrifice helps ensure that  their contributions and legacies are preserved for generations to come.

I encourage folks to visit the national law enforcement memorial. The  memorial contains what is called ``pathways of remembrance,'' where the  names of these courageous officers are engraved on the walls.

While walking the pathways, visitors will notice the sculpture of a  lion with an inscription below that reads:

It is not how these officers died that made them heroes; it       is how they lived.

These words are so very true, especially today, as the new officers'  names are engraved on those walls.
