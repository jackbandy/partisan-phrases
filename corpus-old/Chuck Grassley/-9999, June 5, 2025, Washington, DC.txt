Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate to congratulate the  University of Iowa's Department of Ophthalmology. It is the 100th  anniversary of this famed department.

For a century, this department has improved the lives of Iowans and  made a significant national impact. This department and its members  have consistently ranked among the top 10 of the U.S. News & World  Report and Ophthalmology Times. Beyond its ranking, the department has  been a world leader in treating serious inherited eye diseases and  other vision problems.

In the 1990s, the department established the first center for macular  degeneration in the United States, providing patient care and  conducting research into more effective treatments.

The department has a rich history of innovative research and clinical  trials to advance eye care. Today, its research includes making  groundbreaking discoveries into genes responsible for common and rare  retinal diseases. Researchers are also integrating artificial  intelligence to diagnose and treat eye diseases.

Thanks to this dedication, the department has trained generations of  doctors and specialists who now serve in hospitals and clinics across  the country, expanding its impact far beyond Iowa City, IA.

I commend everyone who has contributed to this remarkable legacy--the  present faculty, staff, students, and patients. And, of course, we need  to always remember the pioneers in this area who have now passed on.

May the next century be just as impactful as the first century for  the University of Iowa's Department of Ophthalmology.
