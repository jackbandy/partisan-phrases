Support for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025


Mr. DUNN of Florida. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 2483,  the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act.

This bill is a critical piece of legislation that will help bolster  prevention, treatment, and recovery for millions of Americans suffering  from substance abuse disorders.

Thanks to the investments from the original SUPPORT for Patients and  Communities Act in 2018 and the efforts of the Trump administration, we  are finally starting to see a decrease in the overdose death rate.

Florida is a shining example of this progress. In Florida, pilot  programs have taken innovative steps, such as using long-acting  injectables to help fight opioid addiction. I am encouraged by the  number, and I also thoroughly believe that Congress needs to continue  the program to make this response possible.

One SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025  program I am especially excited for is the first responder training  program, which helps ensure that first responders are prepared and  trained to administer Narcan.

I also strongly believe in the residential treatment program for  pregnant and postpartum women. This program is vital to help new moms  obtain treatment for substance abuse disorders.

Programs in this bill can change the lives of those who are suffering  from substance abuse disorders when they have nowhere else to turn.

For these reasons, I stand in strong support of H.R. 2483. I look  forward to voting in favor of this bill, and I encourage my colleagues  to do the same.
