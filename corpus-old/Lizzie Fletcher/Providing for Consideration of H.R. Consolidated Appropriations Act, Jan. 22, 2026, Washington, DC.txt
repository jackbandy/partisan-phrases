Providing for Consideration of H.R. Consolidated Appropriations Act, and Providing for Consideration of H.R. Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, and for Other Purposes


Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker, as the House considers this rule and the  legislation it advances, I rise to remind all who are present in the  Chamber, all Members of this body, and every person in this country  that the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution states:  ``The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,  papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall  not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,  supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place  to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.''

Yet, all across America, from Maine to Minnesota to California and  everywhere in between, hardworking, law-abiding people in the United  States, American citizens, are living in fear of exactly this. They are  afraid to go to work, afraid to go to church, afraid to go to school,  afraid to go to the hardware store because unidentified, masked agents,  often in plain clothes and unmarked cars, are breaking down doors to  their homes, are pulling people from their cars, are stopping people on  the street, and asking them to show their papers and prove they belong  here.

This is not only unconstitutional. It is un-American, and this  Congress must do something to stop it. Brave Americans are standing up  and saying no all across this country. We have to do that here, we have  to do it now, and it starts by voting ``no'' on this rule.
