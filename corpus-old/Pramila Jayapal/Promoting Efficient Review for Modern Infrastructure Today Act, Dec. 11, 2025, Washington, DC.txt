Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act


Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the PERMIT  Act, Republicans' latest attempt to help corporate polluters dodge  responsibility.

This alarming bill would weaken the Army Corps' permitting process  and EPA's Clean Water Act authorities, threatening my district, where  the Clean Water Act protects our waters, our salmon, and our people.

Moreover, this bill would impose an unworkably short 60-day review of  dredge-and-fill permits. Two months is simply not enough time for  underresourced communities to understand the effects that a project  could have, let alone to mount any meaningful opposition to protect  themselves.

Access to judicial review ensures that communities, Tribes, and local  governments can challenge decisions and raise potential harms that have  not yet been considered. Without it, agency actions just go completely  unchecked.

This legislation prioritizes polluters over people's clean water and  public health, and it especially puts all the harms disproportionately  on our low-income and rural constituents and our communities of color.  They deserve so much better. They deserve our support, rather than  throwing them under the bus.

Our permitting systems do need to be improved, and we have found a  way in our State to do that. This is a false solution that attacks  essential clean water safeguards and undermines access to our courts.

I oppose it, and I hope, as the ranking member said, that we can come  back and do real permitting reform that doesn't throw communities under  the bus and protects our waters.
