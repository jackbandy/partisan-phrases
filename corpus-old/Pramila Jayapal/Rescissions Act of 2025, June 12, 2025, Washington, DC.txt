Rescissions Act of 2025


Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, this rescissions package is all about going  back on the agreements that Republicans just made in March. It is about  the fact that Congress had approved this funding before Elon Musk took  a literal chain saw, an illegal chain saw, to foreign aid and public  broadcasting and a whole bunch of other things that Americans care  about. Then guess what? The courts said no.

Now, Trump has ordered his minions here in this House to go back on  their own agreements and undermine their own authority to appropriate  money, all so that they can legitimize his sometimes shadow president,  Elon Musk.

This is yet another betrayal bill. It slashes U.S. USAID funding even  more, and the cuts have already killed 300,000 people across the world.  It will kill even more. It destroys our global leadership, and it is  yet another attack on free speech in our country by slashing money for  public TV and broadcasting that are many Americans' only source of  news, weather, and children's programming.

Vote ``no'' on this bill. It is another betrayal.
