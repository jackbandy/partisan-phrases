Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this bill that allows  health insurance premiums for 22 million American families to skyrocket  and raises healthcare costs for everyone. Trump and his Republican cult  of followers in Congress have unleashed a shameful crisis of cruelty  and corruption on the American people.

First, they slash Medicaid by a trillion dollars, kicked 15 million  Americans off of healthcare, set up the playboard for rural hospitals  to shutter, all so that they could give $7 trillion in permanent tax  breaks to their billionaire buddies.

Then they refused to negotiate with Democrats to extend the  Affordable Care Act tax credits so that 22 million wouldn't have to  choose between healthcare and rent. When we refused to go along with  that, they caused this 45-day Republican shutdown, illegally refused to  pay SNAP benefits for the hungry, and illegally canceled flights,  throwing the country into chaos.

Trump and Republicans want to make Americans poorer and sicker, while  Trump builds his gilded ballrooms, protects pedophiles, pardons those  who buy his memecoins, and lets Americans starve. Shame on them. I am a  ``hell-no'' on this bill.
