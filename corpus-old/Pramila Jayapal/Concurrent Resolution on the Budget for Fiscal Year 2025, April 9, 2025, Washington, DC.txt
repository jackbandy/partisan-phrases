Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority leader said: You  can be what you want in America.

That is what he said, but you can't be what you want in Republicans'  America. Factually, the top 1 percent of billionaires and millionaires  in America are worth more than 291 million Americans, 90 percent of the  country, because we are rigging the economy against them. That is what  Republicans are doing.

There are 801 U.S. billionaires who have $6 trillion of wealth, and  Republicans now want to give a $4.5 trillion tax cut to the wealthiest  billionaires.

That is what Donald Trump said: ``You're rich as hell.'' ``We're  going to give you tax cuts.'' This is on the backs of working Americans  because voting ``yes'' for this resolution is voting for a minimum of  $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid.

That is healthcare taken away from 72 million Americans. That is  nursing homes taken away for five out of eight seniors, and that is  healthcare taken away for 38 million kids. Vote ``no'' on this  disastrous Republican resolution.
