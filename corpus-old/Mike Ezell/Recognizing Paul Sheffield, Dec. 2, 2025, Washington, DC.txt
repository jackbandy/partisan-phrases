Recognizing Paul Sheffield


Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize an extraordinary  public servant from Jones County, Mr. Paul Sheffield, whose career  reflects a lifetime of dedication to the safety and well-being of  Mississippi families.

Paul began his public service in 1998 with the city of Laurel's  traffic maintenance division. By 2001, he was serving as a police  officer in the town of Sandersville and soon joined the Jones County  Sheriff's Emergency Operation Center, working as a dispatcher,  operations officer, reserve deputy, and canine deputy.

In 2005, Paul continued his calling at MEMA as an area coordinator,  serving for 11 years in that role. During that time, he and his wife,  Traci, whom he married in 1999, welcomed their son, Caleb, through  adoption in 2010 and celebrated the birth of their daughter in 2013.  His commitment to service grew right alongside his family.

After leaving MEMA in 2016, Paul served with the Emergency Management  District of Forrest County. In 2018, he became the executive director  of the Jones County Emergency Operations Center. He holds the  distinction of Mississippi Certified Emergency Manager and has served  as both vice president and president of the Mississippi Civil Defense  Emergency Management Agency. Nationally, he is recognized as a  certified emergency and disaster professional.

Mr. Sheffield's service also extends into the 911 Coordinators  Association and 6 years with the Jones County Coroner's Office, where  he continues to serve as deputy medical examiner.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Sheffield's decades of leadership and dedication  have strengthened emergency preparedness across our State. Today, I am  proud to honor him and his lifetime of service.
