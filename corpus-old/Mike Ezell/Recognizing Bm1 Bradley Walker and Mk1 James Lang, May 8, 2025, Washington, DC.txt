Recognizing Bm1 Bradley Walker and Mk1 James Lang


Mr. EZELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize two exceptional  members of the United States Coast Guard from Port Security Unit 308 in  Gulfport, Mississippi.

Boatswain's Mate First Class Bradley Walker has been awarded the  Commander Ray Evans Outstanding Coxswain Trophy, one of the highest  honors given to a Coast Guard boat operator. His leadership, skill, and  commitment to mission excellence represent the very best in service.

Alongside him, Machinery Technician First Class James Lang has earned  the Fireman First Class Paul Clark Outstanding Engineer Award, a  national recognition of his outstanding technical expertise and  dedication to keeping his unit mission-ready.

These two Mississippians embody the core values of the Coast Guard:  honor, respect, and devotion to duty. I am incredibly proud to  represent them and PSU 308 in Congress. Their service makes our Nation  stronger and our Gulf Coast proud.

Madam Speaker, I congratulate and thank BM1 Walker and MK1 Lang for  their service.
