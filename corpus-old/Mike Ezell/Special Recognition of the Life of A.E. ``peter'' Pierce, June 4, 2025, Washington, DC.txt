Special Recognition of the Life of A.E. ``peter'' Pierce


Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  a great Mississippian, A.E. ``Peter'' Pierce of Helena, who went home  to be with the Lord in the early morning hours of May 24th.

Peter was the very best of us--a devoted husband to his beloved Grace  for nearly 69 years, a U.S. Army veteran, a hardworking father,  grandfather, and public servant, and a man whose quiet faith was lived  out in every act of service.

From the shipyards of Pascagoula to the halls of the Jackson County  Board of Supervisors, from coaching little league to mowing the church  lawn even after his diagnosis--Peter gave his time, his energy, and his  heart to others.

He was a faithful member of Escatawpa Assembly of God, a friend to  the forgotten, and the kind of man who cooked Christmas breakfast for a  house full of grandkids, always reminding them: he was the most blessed  man on earth.

We grieve his loss, but we celebrate a life well-lived, and we thank  God for the example he gave us.
