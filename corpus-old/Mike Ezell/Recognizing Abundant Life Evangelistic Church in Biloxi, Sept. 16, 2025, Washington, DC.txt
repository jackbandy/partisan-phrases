Recognizing Abundant Life Evangelistic Church in Biloxi, Mississippi


Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable  milestone for a cornerstone of faith and service in south Mississippi.

This year marks the 35th anniversary of Abundant Life Evangelistic  Church in Biloxi, Mississippi. For more than three decades, this church  has been more than a house of worship. It has been a place of hope,  healing, and community for thousands of families on the Mississippi  Gulf Coast.

Under the steadfast leadership of Bishop Jason Johnson and his wife,  First Lady Kim Johnson, Abundant Life has grown into a vibrant  congregation committed to spreading the Gospel of Christ and uplifting  those in need.

From youth outreach to disaster relief and from mentoring programs to  feeding the hungry, the church has never wavered in its mission to live  out the love of Christ.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the entire church family for their 35 years of  faithful service, and I pray for many more years of impact and growth.

God bless Abundant Life Evangelistic Church, and God bless the great  State of Mississippi.
