Recognizing James Min


Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my chief of staff,  James Min. He will be departing Capitol Hill.

James and I met as congressional interns. Over the years, he has  become a close friend, mentor, and trusted adviser. On the Hill since  1999, James has held the title ``chief of staff'' for over 20 years,  serving as chief of staff to House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman  Bill Thomas; to Speaker Kevin McCarthy as the majority whip, majority  leader, Republican leader, and Speaker; and became my chief of staff  when I was elected last year.

James has not only dedicated his career to advising some of our top  lawmakers but also devoted countless hours to mentoring the next  generation of congressional staffers and public servants.

Mr. Speaker, I thank James for his constant support and loyalty.  James helped develop and implement policies that made our country  stronger. Words cannot describe the positive impact he has had on so  many of us, and I am blessed to call him my friend.
