Recognizing Smith's Bakeries


Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a cherished institution  in my district, Smith's Bakeries, located in Bakersfield, California.

Since 1945, Smith's has been more than just a bakery. It has been a  pillar of joy in our community. Founded by Howard Smith and Roy  Balmain, the goal was simple: to provide the best baked goods possible.

As we celebrate Small Business Week, Smith's Bakeries exemplifies how  local businesses can thrive while staying deeply connected to their  customers. A key part of their success is Jim Balmain, son of cofounder  Roy, who, along with his wife, Jacque, took over in 1985, ensuring the  bakery's continued legacy.

Celebrating 80 years of business, Smith's has been a symbol of  excellence and community spirit, known for their iconic treats, like  the famous happy face cookie.

As Jim Balmain once said: ``If you care and you try to do things  right, people will appreciate it,'' and that is exactly what Smith's  has done for decades.

Here is to many more years of sweet memories and continued success  for one of the most popular small businesses in California's 20th  District.
