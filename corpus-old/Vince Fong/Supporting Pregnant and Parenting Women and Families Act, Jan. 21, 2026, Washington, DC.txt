Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act


Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6945,  the Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act.

Across our Nation, more than 2,700 pregnancy centers serve nearly 2  million women and families each year. I have seen firsthand my local  pregnancy centers in California and the services they provide offering  diapers, baby clothes, prenatal education, ultrasounds, housing  referrals, and additional real, compassionate support during life's  most vulnerable moments.

These services are valued at over $450 million annually and help  families choose stability, self-sufficiency, and hope.

The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program was created to  strengthen families, reduce dependency, and ensure children can be  cared for in their own homes.

Pregnancy resource centers, especially in rural communities, clearly  advance those goals. However, under the Biden administration, a  proposed rule was issued that singled out pregnancy centers and  preemptively suggested State spending on these organizations would no  longer be allowable.

The Biden rule was never finalized, but there is a need to make sure  future administrations do not pursue similar actions. H.R. 6945 ensures  fairness. It clarifies that States may continue partnering with  pregnancy centers without political interference now and in the future.

Mr. Speaker, this bill stands for mothers, children, and families,  and I urge my colleagues to support it.
