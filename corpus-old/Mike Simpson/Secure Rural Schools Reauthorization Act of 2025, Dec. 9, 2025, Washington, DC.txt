Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Act of 2025


Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 356,  the Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Act of 2025.

This bill would reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Self- Determination Program (SRS) through Fiscal Year 2026 and provide lapsed  payments for 2024 and 2025.

Administered by the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Bureau of Land  Management, SRS funding goes to counties to help maintain schools,  infrastructure, and other essential community services for many rural  counties that contain federal lands exempt from federal property taxes.  The SRS program is certainly a critical program for my home state of  Idaho. Nearly two-thirds of Idaho is public land, which means a vast  majority of rural counties throughout the state depend on this funding.  In fact, Idaho ranks third nationally in SRS funding, behind only  Oregon and California.

I want to thank my colleagues, especially Representative LaMalfa from  California and Representative Fulcher from Idaho, for working  diligently to get this bill across the finish line. I am also grateful  to Speaker Johnson, House Leadership, and my colleagues for supporting  this bill.

As a long-time supporter of the SRS program, and a cosponsor of the  House bill, I look forward to seeing this lifeline benefit local  communities throughout Idaho.
