Republicans Win Record-Setting Game


Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Satchel Paige, a great Hall of  Fame baseball player, in 1948 won two games of a doubleheader. When he  was in the locker room talking to the press, the press said: Satchel,  you won both games today. What was your best pitch, your fast ball or  your curve ball?

He says: Neither. It was my be-ball.

They said: Your be-ball, what is that?

He said: My be-ball, when I throw it, it goes where I want it to be.

I can't think of anyplace that I would rather be than here right now  representing the Congressional Baseball Game and our team.

The Congressional Baseball Game was played on June 11, and I am proud  to say that we raised $2.7 million for charity right here, a record. We  sold almost 40,000 tickets and had 34,000 in attendance, another  record.

The Republican team, the USA team, Team USA is on a 5-year winning  streak. We won 13-2 this year, and I am proud to coach these guys. They  really do a great job, and I am proud to be able to coach this team.

The Democrats have a good team. They have good coaching, and we  welcome playing them again next year in next year's game and setting  records.

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend across  the aisle, she is not going to find it.
