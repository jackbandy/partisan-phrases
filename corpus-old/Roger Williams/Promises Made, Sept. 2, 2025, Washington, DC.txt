Promises Made, Promises Kept


Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her  leadership.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the many ways that Texans,  hardworking families, and small business owners across America are  benefiting from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

This is one of the most profamily, prosmall business, proworker  legislation ever signed into law. As a small business owner myself and  chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, I understand  firsthand how policies coming out of Washington, D.C., can directly  impact the day-to-day lives of Americans, particularly small business  owners.

Over the August work period, I met with constituents, small  businesses, elected officials, and local leaders to hear how this  historic legislation has impacted their daily lives.

When I traveled across my district and the country, meeting with  hardworking families and entrepreneurs, they are not concerned with  Washington politics. They are focused on keeping the lights on and  putting food on the table.

President Trump and House Republicans are fulfilling the mandate  given by the American people to restore economic prosperity, support  small businesses, secure our border, unleash American energy, invest in  rural America, and the list goes on.

This legislation cuts taxes on hardworking Americans, lowers energy  costs, brings jobs home, cuts wasteful spending, and puts Main Street  first.

These are not just talking points. These are real results for the  American people. When you give money back to the people, it is a return  on investment. I will always fight to provide certainty for the future  and to put more money back into your pockets as we step into the golden  age in America. In God we trust.
