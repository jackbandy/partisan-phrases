Artificial Intelligence Wisdom for Innovative Small Enterprises Act


Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5784) to amend the Small Business Act to help small  business concerns critically evaluate artificial intelligence tools,  and for other purposes.

SEC. 3. COMPLIANCE WITH CUTGO.

No additional amounts are authorized to carry out this Act       or the amendments made by this Act.

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5784, the Artificial  Intelligence Wisdom for Innovative Small Enterprises Act, the AI-WISE  Act. This bipartisan bill is led by Representatives Scholten and  Downing.

Artificial intelligence is changing how businesses operate in real  time. While large corporations can afford expensive consultants and  trial-and-error experimentation, many small businesses do not have the  luxury to do that. For a small business owner like myself, every dollar  matters. The AI-WISE Act helps bridge that gap.

This bill directs the SBA to provide clear, accessible, and practical  guidance that helps small business owners understand artificial  intelligence in straightforward terms. It focuses on helping  entrepreneurs evaluate whether an artificial intelligence tool is  useful for their specific business, where it may fall short, and  whether it is truly worth the cost before they spend their money to get  that.

Importantly, this bill does all of this without authorizing any new  spending. It builds on existing programs, avoids picking winners and  losers, and keeps the Federal Government focused on providing  information, not mandates.

I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan  legislation and to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5784.

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Downing).

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, we cannot leave Main Street  behind in the adoption of AI. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
