Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 5100. This bill  extends two programs critical for American innovation, the Small  Business Innovation Research, SBIR, and the Small Business Technology  Transfer, STTR, programs, for 1 year.

I thank my colleagues, Ranking Member Velazquez and Chairman Babin  and Ranking Member Lofgren of the Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology for cosponsoring this bipartisan legislation.

Since the 1980s, the SBIR and the STTR programs have fueled American  innovation by providing early-stage funding to small businesses. These  investments have led to groundbreaking technologies that grow our  economy and strengthen our national defense.

SBIR and STTR programs have been regularly reauthorized by Congress  to include many reforms to drive small business. However, the programs  will expire at the end of this month, on September 30, just 15 days  away.

As my colleagues and I continue to work toward the goal of a long- term reauthorization, one thing has become clear: Time is working  against us. We cannot allow these critical programs to expire. Failing  to extend these programs would be a disservice to small businesses  across the country. Put simply, American innovators cannot operate in  uncertainty, and national security cannot afford an innovation gap.

As chairman of the Small Business Committee, I am committed to  ensuring these programs remain strong and uninterrupted. H.R. 5100 will  allow Congress the additional time to work toward a meaningful long- term and bipartisan reauthorization while also ensuring that small  businesses can continue to do what they do best, and that is innovate.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues in the House again for joining me  in reintroducing this legislation. Their partnership shows the SBIR and  the STTR programs' strong bipartisan support and our shared commitment  to keeping America at the forefront of discovery.

I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense extension, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Velazquez, and I urge  my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation to continue  uplifting small business innovation across America.
