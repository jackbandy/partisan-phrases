Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4549, the Office of Rural  Affairs Enhancement Act.

This bill was introduced by Representative Goodlander from the great  State of New Hampshire, Representative Wied from the great State of  Wisconsin, and Representative Golden from the great State of Maine.

Mr. Speaker, 46 million Americans live in rural communities. The  small businesses of rural America face distinct and persistent  challenges, such as a shortage of business assistance resources and  limited access to capital. These challenges often hinder their growth  and sustainability.

The SBA Office of Rural Affairs was created to serve our rural  entrepreneurs. However, it is often underutilized and thus ineffective.  This bill addresses these challenges by clarifying the critical  responsibilities of the Office of Rural Affairs and qualifications for  leadership to prioritize the rural communities.

This bill ensures that the office will be utilized to reach rural  entrepreneurs anywhere they are in Main Street America. These efforts  will strengthen local networks and equip entrepreneurs with the  knowledge and support necessary for long-term growth.

H.R. 4549 is about investing in the future of rural America, creating  jobs, and ensuring resources reach all businesses across America. I  thank Representatives Goodlander, Wied, and Golden for introducing this  bipartisan legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4549, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this commonsense legislation to support rural small businesses, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
