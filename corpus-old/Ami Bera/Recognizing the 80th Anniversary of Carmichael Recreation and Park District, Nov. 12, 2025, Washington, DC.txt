Recognizing the 80th Anniversary of Carmichael Recreation and Park District


Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Carmichael  Recreation and Park District on their 80th Anniversary. Through their  mission, they have provided valuable community resources that have  enriched the lives of its residents.

Starting in 1945, Carmichael Park and Recreation District acquired  its first land parcel that went on to become their flagship park,  Carmichael Park. After further land acquisitions between 1971 and 1990,  the district now includes 12 additional park sites.

Parks in the district are major community hubs that include  playgrounds, dog parks, ball fields, tennis and pickleball courts, as  well as community gathering spaces. With their wide variety of outdoor  spaces, the parks attract thousands of visitors every year.

Over their 80 years of service, the Carmichael Recreation and Park  District has successfully maintained its parks and facilities through  many challenges. They continue to provide exceptional recreation  experiences and will continue to do so for many years to come.

I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing this day as the  Carmichael Recreation and Park District's 80th Anniversary and thank  them for their dedication to their community and its residents.
