Space Dominance


Mr. BEGICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight an issue of  national importance: Our commitment to space exploration and Alaska's  vital role in securing America's presence in space.

Space exploration drives innovation, strengthens our economy, and  enhances national security. The investments we make today will shape  our future strength and prosperity as a Nation.

Alaska, the Last Frontier, is well positioned to play a key role in  our Nation's space operations. Alaska's unique geographic position  gives it a crucial edge in space surveillance, missile defense,  satellite communications, and launch capabilities.

With a high-latitude polar launch capability and vast, remote  terrain, my State offers unparalleled advantages for both government  and commercial space initiatives. The Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska,  or PSCA, on Kodiak Island is at the forefront of these efforts as a  premier launch site that plays a critical role in America's space  strategy.

Alaska's geostrategic location in the Arctic makes it an  indispensable asset in America's national defense and global power  projection. As the closest U.S. State to both Russia and China, Alaska  provides unparalleled access to the Arctic, a region rapidly growing in  economic and military significance.

With shifting ice patterns opening new maritime routes, control over  Arctic air and sea lanes is critical to maintaining U.S. strategic  interests. Alaska's military installations, missile defense systems,  and space infrastructure collectively form a cornerstone of national  security, ensuring America's readiness in this increasingly contested  region.

The Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska is one of four of the country's  few fully operational, federally licensed spaceports capable of  delivering payloads to orbit. Managed by the Alaska Aerospace  Corporation, its remote location provides a strategic advantage,  reducing risks to populated areas and offering access to vital polar  and Sun-synchronous orbits. This capability is essential for Earth  observation, climate monitoring, missile defense, and reconnaissance  missions.

Unlike other launch sites in the lower 48, Alaska's spaceport  benefits from minimal air traffic congestion and robust launch windows,  enabling greater efficiency and mission success.

This spaceport is designed to be highly adaptable and can accommodate  a wide range of launch vehicles, from small satellites to larger  payloads. Its infrastructure includes multiple launch pads, a state-of- the-art range control center, and cutting-edge telemetry capabilities.  Furthermore, the PSCA is a key contributor to economic development in  Alaska, creating jobs, fostering technological advancements, and  attracting investment from domestic and international space companies.

The Alaska Aerospace Corporation was established in 1991 by the  Alaska Legislature and has been instrumental in advancing the State's  role in space operations. As the operator of the PSCA, Alaska Aerospace  provides critical infrastructure and space launch capabilities that  support both government and commercial launches, reinforcing our  Nation's ability to remain at the forefront of space innovation.

Additionally, Clear Space Force Station near Fairbanks is pivotal in  space situational awareness and missile defense. This facility is  crucial for tracking objects in orbit, ensuring that America maintains  a vigilant eye on potential threats and space debris that could  endanger critical infrastructure. These efforts are vital to protecting  our Nation's interests and maintaining a leading presence in space.

The potential benefits of Alaska's growing space sector align with  our Nation's security and technological advancement initiatives. The  Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska holds an incredible opportunity for  dominance in space. The industry in my State has created many high- paying jobs in engineering, aerospace technology, and infrastructure.

These positions offer competitive salaries and career stability,  attracting top talent and fostering a skilled workforce in Alaska.  Moreover, the increased investment in space operations has generated  economic ripple effects, benefiting local businesses, housing markets,  and service industries.

Alaska's role in space operations is poised for even more significant  expansion. The State's infrastructure is uniquely positioned to support  the next wave of advancements in space travel, including reusable  launch vehicles, hypersonic testing, and deep-space exploration.

As commercial companies like SpaceX continue to push the boundaries  of what is possible, Alaska stands ready to provide essential launch  services that will further our Nation's ambitions beyond Earth's orbit.

Reducing dependence on foreign space infrastructure is a matter of  national security and economic sovereignty. For too long, the United  States has relied on foreign launch  services and satellite capabilities, leaving critical assets vulnerable  to geopolitical uncertainty. Increasing the use of Alaska's space  infrastructure will ensure that our national security interests,  commercial enterprises, and scientific missions remain independent and  protected from foreign influence.

Mr. Speaker, we cannot discuss the future of space without  acknowledging the transformative impact of private industry. Companies  like SpaceX and other commercial aerospace pioneers have revolutionized  space travel by making launches more affordable and frequent. With its  strategic location and state-of-the-art infrastructure, Alaska offers  an ideal partner for these enterprises. The Pacific Spaceport Complex- Alaska provides the logistical support, safety advantages, and launch  capabilities to advance commercial expansion and national security  objectives.

As global competition in space intensifies, our ability to support  our Nation's space-based assets has never been more crucial. We must  continue to invest in these capabilities, expand our launch  infrastructure, and ensure that our space assets in Alaska remain at  the cutting edge of technology. Whether it is weather forecasting,  global communications, or national defense, our reliance on space  assets grows every day. The work done in Alaska ensures that America  remains a leader in this critical domain.

Mr. Speaker, space is the next great frontier, and America cannot  afford to fall behind. We must continue to invest in our space  infrastructure, foster private-sector innovation, and recognize  Alaska's strategic significance in maintaining international  leadership.

Let us, in this 119th Congress, reaffirm our commitment to space  exploration, national security, and economic prosperity, ensuring that  Alaska and the United States remain the undisputed leaders in this  critical domain.
