Land Conveyances for Alaska Native Vietnam Veterans


Mr. BEGICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 410, the  Alaska Native Vietnam Era Veterans Land Allotment Extension Act of  2025.

This bill extends the application period for the Alaska Native  Vietnam era veterans land allotment program by 5 years, ensuring that  eligible veterans can claim the land that they were promised.

For decades, thousands of Alaska Native veterans who served in  Vietnam were unfairly denied the ability to apply for land allotments  due to their service overseas. While Congress took steps to correct  this injustice, the executive branch, until recently, has been slow  processing applications and conveyances, leaving many veterans in  limbo.

As of January 2025, out of more than 2,000 eligible veterans, only 41  applications have been certified, and only 18 veterans have received  their conveyances.

Fortunately, executive orders issued by the current administration  have reinstated Federal land withdrawals that were previously revoked.  This bill will give these veterans time to participate in the program,  with ample land for viable selections.

These veterans served our country honorably, and we need to make sure  that they are not denied what they were promised.

I thank the Speaker for consideration of H.R. 410, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.
