Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Bureau of Land Management Relating to ``Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program Record of Decision''


Mr. BEGICH. Mr. Speaker, as the sole Representative of Alaska in the  United States House, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 131, a  resolution to overturn the Biden administration's 2024 Record of  Decision, an action that severely restricted energy development on the  coastal plain of Alaska's North Slope.

For Alaskans, this issue is foundational--economically,  strategically, and culturally.

The 10-02 area of ANWR, the coastal plain, is the most studied piece  of land in Alaska and one of the most resource-rich energy basins in  North America. Congress set this area aside specifically because of its  oil and gas potential, and Congress has twice mandated that it be  leased for energy development.

Yet in December 2024, in the final days of the outgoing  administration, the Department of the Interior issued a new Record of  Decision that made only 400,000 acres available, a mere 25 percent of  the legally designated coastal plain, effectively shutting down 1.16  million acres that Congress expressly told the Department to lease.

That Record of Decision ignored Congress. It ignored the statutory  mandate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and it ignored the voices of the  people who actually live on Alaska's North Slope.

Thanks to a request from Alaska's delegation, the Government  Accountability Office issued a legal opinion on August 25 confirming  that this 2024 Record of Decision is a rule under the Congressional  Review Act. That opinion, printed in the Congressional Record in  September, triggered the CRA window that allows Congress to act today.

Congress must act because Alaskans have spoken clearly, and they have  spoken loudly.

The North Slope Inupiat leadership, including the Arctic Slope  Regional Corporation, the North Slope Borough, and the Inupiat  Community of the Arctic Slope, have consistently supported responsible  development in the 10-02 area of our North Slope. For decades, they  have supported balanced development because they know how vital it is  to sustain their communities, maintain their way of life, and fund  essential public services.

Oil and gas development on the North Slope provides 95 percent of  local tax revenue, which pays for schools, clinics, utilities, public  safety, and infrastructure in some of the most remote and high-cost  communities in America. Without development, those services disappear.

Mr. Speaker, the law is clear. The science is clear, and the economic  reality is undeniable. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the coastal  plain contains 10.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil, a resource that  can strengthen America's energy security at a time when geopolitical  instability is rising and global energy demand is surging.

President Trump recognized this on day one, issuing executive order  14153, Unleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential, directing  the Secretary of the Interior to restore the lawful 2020 framework.

The Bureau of Land Management is already implementing that directive,  working to reinstate the 2020 Record of Decision and moving forward  with the four statutorily required lease sales mandated by the American  working families tax cut.

However, unless we disapprove of the 2024 ROD today, regulatory  whiplash will continue, investment will remain frozen, and local  communities will shoulder the burden of Federal indecision.

H.J. Res. 131 ends that uncertainty. It restores the legally  compliant 2020 Record of Decision. It restores the full acreage  Congress authorized for leasing, and it restores, importantly, the  voice of the North Slope residents in Alaska.

Mr. Speaker, Alaska has the energy the world needs. America has the  workforce to develop that energy responsibly, and Alaska's communities,  from Utqiagvik to Kaktovik, have been asking for consistency,  partnership, and respect from their Federal Government.

Today we can answer that call, and I urge my colleague to vote  ``yes,'' and support Alaska, support American energy security.
