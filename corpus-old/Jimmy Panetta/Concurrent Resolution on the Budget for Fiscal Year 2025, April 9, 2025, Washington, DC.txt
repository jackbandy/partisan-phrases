Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this disastrous,  debt-inflating budget resolution. Despite what the majority is saying  today, it is a resolution that inflates our debt and deficit. It will  hide the cost of tax cuts for billionaires, and it threatens our  economy.

Mr. Speaker, it is a resolution that gives the majority a green light  to selectively choose the score of a Republican tax cuts bill. It is a  resolution that pretends that tax costs nothing. It is a resolution  that would do damage to our Nation's finances and add $4.6 trillion to  our Nation's debt.

Experts across this political spectrum have called this dishonest,  fabricated scorekeeping, and it undermines the point of budget rules.

That is why I introduced an amendment to this resolution so that the  Senate uses real estimates to determine its cost.

Instead, they are going to write themselves a blank check to be paid  by the American people and to be paid by our children. That is why I  oppose this and I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution, as well.
