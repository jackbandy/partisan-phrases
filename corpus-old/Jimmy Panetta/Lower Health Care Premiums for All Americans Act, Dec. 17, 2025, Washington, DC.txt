Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, if we don't extend the tax credits for the  Affordable Care Act, costs for healthcare will go up for 20 million  people and millions more will lose their health insurance.

Three-quarters of those who rely on those tax credits live in  Republican-won States. Yet Speaker Johnson and President Trump, who are  in charge and had all year to do anything, to do something, on  healthcare, did nothing.

Rather than fulfill the President's promise to reduce prices, they  gave tax breaks to billionaires, they gutted Medicaid, and they added  trillions to our debt.

I get that division and dysfunction define the Republican Party, but  we can't keep letting it define Congress. Put the Democratic discharge  petition on the floor, extend the tax credits, so that together we can  actually do something to fix healthcare. By doing that, we do our job,  not just in Congress but for all Americans.
