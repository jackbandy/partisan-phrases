Dobbs V. Jackson Anniversary


Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, as we recognize the anniversary of the Dobbs  decision, I want to point out, from the outset, that there is no  species, no animal, that kills its own.

My family has been in the horse business for a good while. We raise  pleasure horses. There is no mare that we have that kills its born, the  new horse. We are in the cattle business. There is no cow that I have  ever seen that has killed what it births. Yet, we as humans, for some  reason, take that as a right that we can have.

The Dobbs decision was one of the most important decisions of our  lifetime. For nearly 50 years, Roe v. Wade took power away from the  people and handed it to unelected judges, but Dobbs finally made it  right.

The Court didn't outlaw abortion, as my friends on the left tried to  claim. What it did was restore the fundamental truth that States and  the citizens who live in them have a right to decide how we protect  life.

In South Carolina, we have chosen to stand for the unborn, and I  stand before you today in unwavering support of our State's rights to  do just that.

In 2018, Governor McMaster took a bold step. He blocked abortion  clinics, like Planned Parenthood, from receiving Medicaid funding  because these dollars should go toward real healthcare helping women,  children, and families, not to organizations that end innocent lives.

Despite what my good friends from the left claim, killing a child is  not a birth control measure.

When Planned Parenthood sued to undo the decision, it wasn't just  about funding. It was about undermining the rights of our States, our  government, and our people.

That is why I led a bicameral amicus brief urging the Supreme Court  to take up Medina v. Planned Parenthood. This case is about far more  than Medicaid. It is about whether the States, like South Carolina, can  align their healthcare policies with their values and whether the  courts will respect these values.

Dobbs and Medina both point to the same truth. Washington, D.C.,  clearly doesn't get to decide everything. The Constitution makes it  clear those decisions rest squarely with the American people.

I will continue to fight for States' rights and for the rights of  South Carolinians to govern ourselves without Federal interference.
