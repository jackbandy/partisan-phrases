Christening of the Usns Billy Frank Jr.


Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  christening of the USNS Billy Frank Jr.

Billy Frank Jr. was a proud member of the Nisqually Tribe and a  dedicated leader on tribal treaty rights and environmental stewardship.  He served as chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission for  over 30 years, paved the way for the Boldt decision and was honored  with numerous prestigious awards. In 2015, he was awarded the  Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor.

I am grateful to have worked with Billy on habitat restoration for  salmon and steelhead. Washington state's tribes and environment are  stronger because of Billy's decades of advocacy and leadership.

Billy was also a veteran of the Marine Corps and served during the  Korean War. It is fitting that a Navy ship will now bear his name. The  USNS Billy Frank Jr. will offer salvage, rescue, ocean-going towing and  other support capabilities for U.S. Navy fleet operations, while also  supporting missions such as oil spill response, humanitarian  assistance, wide-area search and surveillance.

On this momentous occasion I send my congratulations to the Frank  family and the Nisqually Tribe. I look forward to once again honoring  Billy later this year when his statue will be unveiled to represent the  state of Washington in the U.S. Capitol's National Statuary Hall.
