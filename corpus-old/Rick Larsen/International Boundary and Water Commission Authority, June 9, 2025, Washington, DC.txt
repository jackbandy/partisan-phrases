International Boundary and Water Commission Authority


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1948, as amended, bipartisan  legislation to assist the U.S. section of the International Boundary  and Water Commission, or IBWC, in carrying out its critical water- related missions.

This bill allows IBWC to accept contributed funds from other Federal  and State agencies, giving the Commission the authority other Federal  infrastructure agencies already have.

This authority will allow the IBWC to partner with other Federal  agencies and non-Federal interests to carry out critical water-related  projects, including projects for wastewater treatment, water  conservation, and flood control. I support H.R. 1948, as amended, and  urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, the IBWC plays a crucial role  in addressing water needs across the U.S.-Mexico border. I support H.R.  1948, as amended, to ensure the IBWC has the authority necessary to  carry out its critical work and urge my colleagues to support this  bill, as well.
