Baby Changing on Board Act


Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support the Baby Changing on Board Act.  This bill requires Amtrak to install baby changing stations in  accessible bathrooms on new passenger rail cars and include clear  signage indicating the availability of changing stations. This will  ensure that parents with young children on Amtrak trains can use  accessible, safe, and comfortable changing facilities.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this legislation to create a  safer, cleaner, and more accessible experience for parents and  caregivers traveling with young children. I urge my colleagues to  support the Baby Changing on Board Act, and I reserve the balance of my  time.

Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 5 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood), the prime sponsor of  the bill.

Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support the  Baby Changing on Board Act, and I encourage my colleagues to do the  same. I yield back the balance of my time.
