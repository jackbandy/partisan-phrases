U.S. Government Accountability Office Legal Opinion


Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land           Management--Applicability of the Congressional Review Act           to Miles City Field Office Record of Decision and           Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment      File: B-337163      Date: June 25, 2025                                    DIGEST

The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land       Management (BLM) issued the Miles City Field Office: Record       of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment       (Miles City RMPA). The Miles City RMPA guides the management       of BLM-administered lands in the Miles City Field Office and       designates which areas are available for coal leasing       consideration.

The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires that before a       rule can take effect, an agency must submit the rule to both       the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as the       Comptroller General. CRA adopts the definition of ``rule''       under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) but excludes       certain categories of rules from coverage. We conclude that       the Miles City RMPA meets the APA definition of a rule, and       no CRA exception applies. Therefore, the Miles City RMPA is a       rule subject to CRA's submission requirements.                                   DECISION

On November 20, 2024, the U.S. Department of the Interior       (Interior), Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a record       of decision and resource management plan amendment titled,       Miles City Field Office: Record of Decision and Approved       Resource Management Plan Amendment (Miles City RMPA).\1\ We       received a request for a decision as to whether the Miles       City RMPA is a rule for purposes of the Congressional Review       Act (CRA).\2\ As discussed below, we conclude that the Miles       City RMPA is a rule for purposes of CRA.

Our practice when issuing decisions is to obtain the legal       views of the relevant agency on the subject of the       request.\3\ Accordingly, we reached out to Interior to obtain       the agency's legal views.\4\ We received Interior's response       on May 2, 2025.\5\                                  BACKGROUND       BLM Public Land Management

Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976,       as amended (FLPMA), BLM is responsible for developing,       maintaining, and, when appropriate, revising ``land use plans       which provide by tracts or areas for the use of the public       lands.'' \6\ BLM land use plans, referred to as ``resource       management plans'' (RMPs), establish goals and objectives to       guide future land and resource management actions implemented       by BLM.\7\ Pursuant to FLPMA, BLM established procedures for       the development, revision, and amendment of RMPs.\8\

The objective of resource management planning is to       maximize resource values for the public through a rational,       consistently applied set of regulations and procedures which       promote the concept of multiple use management.\9\ An RMP       generally establishes land use designations; allowable       resource uses; resource conditions, goals, and objectives;       program constraints and general management practices; areas       to be covered by more specific plans; and other related       information.\10\

BLM may amend an RMP to account for, among other things,       new data, new or revised policy, or a change in       circumstances.\11\ Amendments are to be made through an       environmental assessment of the proposed change or an       environmental impact statement, if needed, and must involve       public involvement and interagency coordination.\12\      Miles City Resource Management Plan

In 2015, BLM revised and combined two previously issued       RMPs into a new RMP for the Miles City Field Office.\13\ The       2015 Miles City RMP provided direction for approximately 2.75       million surface acres and 10.6 million acres of mineral       estate managed by BLM across 17 eastern Montana counties.\14\       It established goals, objectives, land use allocations, and       management direction for the BLM-administered surface and       mineral estate.\15\

Following its issuance, the 2015 Miles City RMP was       challenged in the United States District Court for the       District of Montana on the basis that BLM improperly approved       the plan in violation of the National Environmental Policy       Act (NEPA).\16\ The court found that BLM violated NEPA in its       final environmental impact statement and ordered BLM to       complete a new coal screening and remedial NEPA analysis.\17\

In response, BLM proposed an RMP amendment for the Miles       City Field Office in 2019.\18\ The 2019 Miles City RMP was       also challenged in court. Once again, the court found that       BLM violated NEPA. In its order, the court directed BLM to       consider no coal leasing and limited coal leasing       alternatives and to disclose the public health impacts, both       climate and non-climate, of burning fossil fuels from the       planning areas.\19\

On November 20, 2024, BLM approved the Miles City RMPA and       subsequently published a notice of its availability in the       Federal Register.\20\ The Miles City RMPA consists of the       Record of Decision and the RMP amendment, which is based on       Alternative D in the final environmental impact statement.       The Miles City RMPA provides specific coal screen       designations for the 11.7 million acres of subsurface federal       mineral coal estate for which BLM has authority to determine       its availability. It also addresses the NEPA deficiencies       identified by the court order.\21\

Additionally, the Miles City RMPA allocates 1,745,040 acres       as unavailable for further consideration for leasing in order       to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\22\ As such, BLM will not       accept new coal lease applications. However, existing coal       leases may be developed in accordance with lease terms and       conditions.\23\ The Miles City RMPA does not modify other       resource allocation management decisions that were previously       made in the 2015 Miles City RMP.\24\      Congressional Review Act

CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires federal agencies to submit a       report on each new rule to both houses of Congress and to the       Comptroller General for review before a rule can take       effect.\25\ The report must contain a copy of the rule, ``a       concise general statement relating to the rule,'' and the       rule's proposed effective date.\26\ CRA allows Congress to       review and disapprove rules issued by federal agencies for a       period of 60 days using special procedures.\27\ If a       resolution of disapproval is enacted, then the new rule has       no force or effect.\28\

CRA adopts the definition of a rule under the       Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which states that a rule       is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or       particular applicability and future effect designed to       implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or       describing the organization, procedure, or practice       requirements of an agency.'' \29\ However, CRA excludes three       categories of rules from coverage: (1) rules of particular       applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or       personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or       obligations of non-agency parties.\30\

Interior did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the       Comptroller General on the Miles City RMPA.\31\ In its       response to us, Interior provided additional information       about the Miles City RMPA but did not state a position as to       whether it is a rule under CRA.\32\                                  Discussion

To determine whether the Miles City RMPA is a rule subject       to review under CRA, we first address whether it meets the       APA definition of a rule. As explained below, we conclude       that it does. We then consider whether the Miles City RMPA       falls within any CRA exceptions. We conclude that it does       not. As such, the Miles City RMPA is subject to review under       CRA.      The Miles City RMPA is a Rule Under APA

Applying APA's definition of rule, the Miles City RMPA       meets all of the required elements. First, the Miles City       RMPA is an agency statement as it was issued by BLM, a       federal agency.\33\

Second, the Miles City RMPA is of future effect as it is to       be used prospectively to guide the management of the BLM       mineral coal estate administered by the Miles City Field       Office.\34\ Decisions made in the Miles City RMPA became       effective November 20, 2024, when the Record of Decision was       signed.\35\ As of that date, the Miles City RMPA replaces       decisions for coal resource leasing availability by making       certain acres of BLM-administered land unavailable for       leasing going forward. Therefore, the Miles City RMPA has       future effect.

Finally, the Miles City RMPA implements, interprets, or       prescribes law or policy, because it designates which areas       of BLM-administered land are available for coal leasing       consideration in accordance with BLM's responsibilities for       land use management under FLPMA. The Miles City RMPA also       sets policy by providing specific coal screen designations       for the 11.7 million acres of subsurface federal mineral coal       estate for which BLM has authority to determine its       availability.

Our conclusion here is consistent with our previous       decisions finding similar land use and RMPs implement,       interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\36\ For instance, in       B-238859, Oct. 23, 2017, we found that an amendment to the       Forest Service's Tongass Land and Resource Management Plan       (Tongass Amendment) implemented law by establishing new       criteria for the sale of timber to non-agency parties. We       explained that with the Tongass Amendment, the Forest Service       set forth its policy for timber sales and thus implemented       its statutory responsibility under the National Forest       Management Act.\37\

Similarly in B-329065, Nov. 15, 2017, we concluded that       four RMPs issued by BLM prescribed policy by establishing       available uses for the areas that each RMP covered. We noted       that each RMP implemented provisions of FLPMA and other       applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.\38\ The same       can be said of the Miles City RMPA at issue here. The Miles       City RMPA implements FLPMA and prescribes policy by       designating which areas of BLM-administered land are       available for coal leasing consideration. As such, the Miles       City RMPA meets the third       element of the APA definition of rule. Having satisfied all       the required elements, the Miles City RMPA meets the APA       definition of rule.      CRA Exceptions

We must next determine whether any of CRA's three       exceptions apply. CRA provides for three types of rules that       are not subject to its requirements: (1) rules of particular       applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or       personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or       obligations of non-agency parties.\39\      (1) Rule of Particular Applicability

Consistent with our previous decisions, the Miles City RMPA       is a rule of general applicability, rather than particular       applicability. In B-238859, Oct. 23, 2017, the Forest Service       proffered that its Tongass Amendment was a rule of particular       applicability because it applied to a single national forest.       We disagreed, noting that the Tongass Amendment governed all       natural resource management activities, all projects approved       to take place, and all persons or entities using the forest.       As such, it was a rule of general applicability.\40\       Likewise, the Miles City RMPA establishes land use       designations that govern any coal activities by any person or       entity within the Miles City Field Office, making it a rule       of general applicability.      (2) Rule of Agency Management or Personnel

The Miles City RMPA is not a rule of agency management or       personnel. We have previously held that rules that fall into       this category relate to purely internal agency matters.\41\       Because the Miles City RMPA is concerned with public use of       the areas it governs rather than management of BLM itself or       its personnel, it does not meet CRA's second exception.      (3) Rule of Agency Organization, Procedure, or Practice That           Does Not Substantially Affect Non-Agency Parties

Lastly, the Miles City RMPA is not a rule of agency       organization, procedure, or practice that does not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties.\42\

We have previously explained that this exception was       modeled on the APA exception to notice-and-comment rulemaking       requirements for ``rules of agency organization, procedure,       or practice[.]'' \43\ The purpose of the APA exception is to       ensure ``that agencies retain latitude in organizing their       internal operations,'' so long as such rules do not have a       substantial impact on non-agency parties.\44\

Following this interpretation in the CRA context, we have       only applied CRA's third exception to rules that primarily       focus on the internal operations of an agency.\45\ For       instance, in B-329926, Sept. 10, 2018, we found that updates       to a Social Security Administration (SSA) hearings manual       governing SSA adjudicators' use of information from the       internet qualified as a rule of agency organization,       procedure, or practice. There, the manual outlined procedures       for SSA employees to follow in processing and adjudicating       benefits claims. Because the manual was directed to and       binding only on SSA officials without imposing new burdens on       claimants, we concluded that the manual met CRA's third       exception.\46\

In contrast, rules that are directed at and primarily       concerned with the behavior of non-agency parties do not fall       within this category.\47\ Thus, in B-274505, Sept. 16, 1996,       we declined to apply CRA's third exception to a Forest       Service memorandum on the Emergency Salvage Timber Sale       Program, because it was not limited to the Forest Service's       methods of operations. Instead, the memorandum established       the standards by which program determinations would be made,       thus directly affecting the area for and number of timber       sales that would result in contracts. In essence the       memorandum went beyond how the Forest Service organized its       internal operations.\48\ Similarly, in B-238859, Oct. 23,       2017, we declined to apply CRA's third exception to the       Tongass Amendment, because it was directed at land and       resource use by non-agency parties.\49\

Here, the Miles City RMPA does entail some changes to       agency procedure in that BLM will no longer consider coal       leasing applications for the acres designated as unavailable       for further consideration. However, like the Forest Service       memorandum in B-274505 and the Tongass Amendment in B-238859,       the Miles City RMPA is not limited to changes in internal       agency operations. Instead, the Miles City RMPA is directed       at, and concerns itself primarily with, the behavior of non-      agency parties. Therefore, the Miles City RMPA does not       qualify as a rule of agency organization, procedure or       practice.

We must also consider whether the Miles City RMPA       substantially affects the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties. When analyzing this aspect of CRA's third exception,       ``the critical question is whether the agency action alters       the rights or interests of the regulated entities.'' \50\       Along similar lines, courts have determined that ``[a]n       agency rule that modifies substantive rights and obligations       can only be nominally procedural, and the exemption for such       rules of agency procedure cannot apply.'' \51\

In previous decisions, we have consistently concluded that       where an RMP designates use by non-agency parties in the       areas it governs, it has a substantial effect.\52\ For       instance, in B-275178, July 3, 1997, we reached this       conclusion by noting that the Forest Service's RMP provided a       ``management prescription'' giving general direction on what       may occur within an area allocated to a particular land use       designation. Similarly, in B-329065, Nov. 15, 2017, we       concluded that four BLM RMPs had a substantial effect on non-      agency parties where the plans limited the use of public land       and prohibited mining and operation of off-highway vehicles       in the areas they governed.

Consistent with our caselaw on other RMPs, the Miles City       RMPA has a substantial effect on non-agency parties. Its       purpose is to ``provide additional analysis for land use       planning, specifically for analyzing coal'' in the Miles City       Field Office.\53\ The Miles City RMPA makes unavailable       1,745,040 acres of BLM-administered coal from further       consideration for leasing. As a result, BLM has foreclosed       non-agency parties from new federal coal leasing in those       designated areas, thereby altering their substantive rights       and obligations. Accordingly, the Miles City RMPA fails to       meet CRA's third exception                                  conclusion

The Miles City RMPA is a rule for purposes of CRA because       it meets the definition of a rule under APA and no CRA       exception applies. Therefore, the Miles City RMPA is subject       to CRA's requirement that it be submitted to Congress and the       Comptroller General before it can take effect.
