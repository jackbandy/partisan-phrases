Requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to Extend the Time Period During Which Licensees Are Required to Commence Construction of Certain Hydropower Projects


Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, hydropower produces affordable, reliable,  and clean baseload power in Montana and across the United States. For  years, I have worked with my colleagues to grow our hydropower  portfolio in creating new jobs, lowering prices, and strengthening our  grid.

I want to thank Senator Fetterman for joining me as my colead to push  this bill across the finish line.

Our bipartisan bill, S. 1020, simply allows the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission to extend licenses for the construction of new  hydropower projects that have been affected by supply chain shortages  back to 2020.

This bill passed the Senate last year by unanimous consent, and we  can do that again here today. There are a number of projects whose  licenses will expire if we don't pass my bill--projects in Montana,  Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Oregon, and Alaska--pumped  storage projects that will help balance the grid and small projects  that will also power rural communities. It is bipartisan and  noncontroversial. It is one that we must pass today. The good news is,  we do not have objections so it is going to pass today.

1020 and that  the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.
