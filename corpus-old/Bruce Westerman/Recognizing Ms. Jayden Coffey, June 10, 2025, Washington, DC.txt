Recognizing Ms. Jayden Coffey


Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional  young leader from my district, Jayden Coffey, a student at Cass Job  Corps in Franklin County, Arkansas, and the latest recipient of the  Westerman Award--a quarterly honor given to students who demonstrate  outstanding character, leadership, and service.

Jayden is a shining example of what hard work, humility, and  dedication to others can achieve. At Cass, she serves as the shop  foreman in the paint trade department, where she leads by example and  fosters excellence among her peers. Beyond her trade, Jayden is an  active member of campus leadership. She serves as Secretary of the  Student Government Association and as Vice President of her dormitory.  roles in which she consistently promotes a culture of respect,  accountability, and teamwork.

What truly sets Jayden apart is her servant leadership--an approach  rooted in humility and a deep commitment to others. Her excellent  people-skills and ability to inspire and motivate those around her make  her a trusted leader among students and staff alike.

Jayden's commitment to her community is evident both on and off  campus. She has volunteered her time at the local food pantry and  played a key role in a student-led campaign to collect non-perishable  items for blessing boxes in the community of Ozark, Arkansas, ensuring  those in need have access to essential resources.

Jayden is also blazing trails in traditionally male-dominated fields.  She is currently the only female member of the Fire Crew at Cass, where  she recently passed the Pack Test and earned her Red Card for wildland  firefighting. She participates in daily physical training to prepare  for her upcoming Fire detail and is a dedicated member of the Camp  Crew. Her passion for public service and emergency response will  continue after graduation, as she plans to pursue advanced training in  Fire and Rescue.

Jayden Coffey represents the very best of Arkansas' youth--resilient,  service-driven, and ready to lead. It is my honor to recognize her  today before this body and to commend her as a model citizen and  recipient of the Westerman Award.
