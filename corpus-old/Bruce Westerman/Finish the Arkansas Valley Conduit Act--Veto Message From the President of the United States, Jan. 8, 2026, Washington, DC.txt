Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act--Veto Message From the President of the United States


Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Huffman), the ranking member of the House Committee on Natural  Resources, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.                                General Leave

Mr. WESTERMAN.  131.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 131, the Finish the Arkansas Valley  Conduit Act, facilitates the construction of the Arkansas Valley  Conduit, or AVC, by easing the repayment requirements for project  beneficiaries.

The AVC is designed to provide potable water from Pueblo Reservoir to  39 communities in southeastern Colorado, many of which are dependent on  groundwater supplies that contain unacceptable levels of naturally- occurring heavy metals and radionuclides. According to the Southeastern  Colorado Water Conservancy District, 18 of those communities are  currently failing to meet Federal drinking water standards due to these  contaminants.

H.R. 131 passed the House Committee on Natural Resources and then the  House of Representatives in July 2025. However, President Trump has  returned H.R. 131 to the House without his approval. I respect the  administration's views on this legislation and its commitment to fiscal  responsibility. President Trump's record demonstrates a commitment to  prioritizing unleashing abundant water supplies across the West.

Mr. WESTERMAN.  Boebert), the lead sponsor of this legislation.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I respect the administration's views on  this legislation, and I respect my colleagues from Colorado's passion  for their districts and for their State.

I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous  question.
