Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Senate  amendment. The American people gave Congress a clear mandate to lower  costs, reduce burdensome regulations, and unlock American resources.

Passing the resolution before us will allow committees to  thoughtfully craft and debate legislation to extend the 2017 Trump tax  cuts, averting a $4 trillion to $5 trillion tax increase on the  American people, and to use our resources to generate more revenue and  to cut wasteful spending.

The resolution in itself is not the solution, but it unleashes  committees to put pen to paper and craft reconciliation legislation  that fully delivers on the promises the President and House Republicans  have made the American people.

Mr. Speaker, if we look in this beautiful Chamber, I have only  located one quote from our past that is displayed here, and it is up  above you up close to the ceiling. We are getting close to celebrating  the 200-year anniversary of those words that Daniel Webster spoke in  1825 when he said: ``Let us develop the resources of our land, call  forth our powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great  interests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not  perform something worthy to be remembered.''

Mr. Speaker, the House Committee on Natural Resources looks forward  to taking action to develop our Nation's resources and to do that  responsibly. Our resources are among our Nation's greatest assets and  revenue generators.

This resolution starts the process to do something worthy to be  remembered in our day and generation, a process to keep taxes low for  working Americans, to unlock the full potential of our natural  resources, and to deliver on Speaker Johnson's directive to have the  resolution on the President's desk by Memorial Day.

Mr. Speaker, I support it, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
