Recognizing American Postal Workers Chicago Local 0001


Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the recent  250th anniversary of the U.S. Postal Service, USPS, and the 120th  anniversary of the American Postal Workers Union, APWU, Chicago Local  0001.

Our Nation's Postal Service, first established by the Second  Continental Congress on July 26, 1775, and later modernized by Congress  to become the U.S. Postal Service on July 1, 1971, was created to  connect individuals and communities across the country.

Today, USPS continues to serve communities and is relied on for its  ability to conduct last-mile deliveries that have rapidly increased in  the era of e-commerce. As USPS passes this incredible milestone, we  must ensure that USPS continues to grow by improving its on-time  performance, seeking new business to grow mail volumes, and investing  in the Postal Service's most valuable asset, its dedicated workforce.

In my home State of Illinois, APWU Chicago Local 0001 and other  unions began organizing to strengthen worker rights and protections  over 100 years ago, when labor protections barely existed. The  leadership, dedication, and great sacrifices made by APWU Chicago Local  0001 empowered postal workers to negotiate fairer wages, establish  safer workplaces, and secure far better health benefits. Simply put,  APWU Chicago Local 0001 has been instrumental in advancing postal  workers' rights, safety and dignity.

I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in commemorating the  USPS's 250th Anniversary and commending and thanking the dedicated  postal workers--past and present--of APWU Chicago Local 0001, who have  served their fellow APWU sisters and brothers over the past 120 years,  and helped connect communities throughout Illinois and across our great  Nation.
