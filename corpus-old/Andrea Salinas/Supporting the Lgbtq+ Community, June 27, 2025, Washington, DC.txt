Supporting the Lgbtq+ Community


Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the LGBTQ community to  celebrate Pride Month, and to call out President Trump's reckless  decision to shut down the 988 specialized LGBTQ youth hotline. This is  a devastating decision that will affect people in every corner of our  country.

I will put this into perspective: In 2024, 12 percent of LGBTQ youth  attempted suicide, while nearly 40 percent seriously considered it. In  comparison, the national average for students contemplating suicide is  20 percent, which is still far too large.

Additionally, many of these young people are left without critical  support from caring adults, leaving them nowhere to turn when a crisis  happens. We cannot deny the fact that this hotline is a vital service.

Mental health is not a partisan issue, and our children should not be  used as pawns in the President's purely political game. As the co-chair  of the bipartisan Mental Health Caucus, I am committed to expanding  access to specialty mental health care by training qualified  professionals to provide culturally relevant care and ensuring that  high-quality, affordable services are available to all who need them.

Mr. Speaker, I will not remain silent in the face of President  Trump's targeted attacks, and I will continue to fight for the LGBTQ  communities.
