Protect Children's Innocence Act


Ms. SALINAS. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this disgusting  bill that does nothing to protect children's innocence.

It endangers parents, healthcare providers, and children. It allows  healthcare providers and parents to be fined and possibly jailed if  they help a minor access lifesaving care. It permits Federal law  enforcement to act as the national gender police, allowing them to  invade children's private medical records.

This bill puts even more children in harm's way and exacerbates the  mental health crises that our young people are facing because it stops  them from actually receiving the care that they need right now.

Madam Speaker, why is our focus on this when what I am hearing from  constituents is that Republicans are falling short in addressing the  cost of groceries, healthcare, and housing?

To my Republican colleagues, why not focus on the issues that will  impact millions of families who are just one paycheck away from  homelessness or losing their healthcare instead of waging a war on  children's genitals? What is this unhealthy obsession? Let's end it  today by voting ``no'' on H.R. 3492.
