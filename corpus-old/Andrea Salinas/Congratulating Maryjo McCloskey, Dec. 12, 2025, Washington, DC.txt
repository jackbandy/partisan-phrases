Congratulating Maryjo McCloskey


Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize George Fox University  Women's Golf Head Coach MaryJo McCloskey.

In 2006, Coach MJ helped found the women's golf program at George  Fox, and since then, she has coached hundreds of talented student- athletes.

During her time coaching, she has put together an inspiring track  record. She is an 8-time NCAA Division III West Region Coach of the  Year, a 10-time Northwest Conference Coach of the Year, and has an NCAA  National Championship under her belt.

In addition to coaching her award winning team, she recently  published a book titled ``When Girls Win,'' which delves into the  personal challenges Coach MJ has faced as a woman in a male-dominated  field while illustrating how people like you and me can build a winning  mindset.

MaryJo has been a fixture at George Fox University, and her hard work  and determination led her to be one of two inductees to the Women's  Golf Coaches Association's Hall of Fame.

Oregon's Sixth Congressional District is extremely proud of what  Coach MJ has achieved. Her tremendous honor is not only a testament to  the investment she has made in herself, but also to her family, her  community, and, most importantly, to her team.

I congratulate Coach MJ.
