Ice Operations


Ms. SALINAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call out President Trump for  abusing his power, acting in secrecy, and threatening our safety, all  while failing to address the rising costs in America.

Trump is deploying ICE to our neighborhoods to terrorize our  immigrant communities. His operations rely on brutal tactics, avoiding  deescalation and due process against U.S. citizens. Although the  administration claims it is only targeting undocumented criminals who  pose a threat, we know that is an outright lie.

At every turn, the administration erodes any trust it has ever had  with the public. That became even clearer when Secretary Noem signed an  order barring Members of Congress from conducting oversight of ICE  facilities without 7 days' notice.

I visited an ICE facility in Tacoma, Washington. I did provide that 7  days' notice, even though I was not legally required to do so, and yet  I was still denied access to meet with my constituents due to so-called  scheduling issues.

This is not transparency. This is an attempt to control access,  suppress oversight, and manipulate the narrative.

Instead of terrorizing our communities, Trump needs to get back to  the real work of solving the affordability crisis.
