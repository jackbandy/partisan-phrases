Saluting the Life of John Fitzgerald Kennedy


Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, this Saturday, November 22,  will mark 62 years since we lost a President of the United States, a  person who gave so much to his Nation, an individual who was taken from  us in the summer of his years.

His daughter, Caroline, back in 2017 gave us these buttons, pins,  that I proudly wear. It is an image of President John Fitzgerald  Kennedy.

President Kennedy epitomized placing service above self. He was a  national hero and a leader who had the grace, the dignity, the wit, the  intelligence, and the love of his Nation and mankind.

That past year we also lost someone by the name of Connie Francis who  sang a song at the time called ``In the Summer of His Years.''

In that song, she wrote:       A young man rode with his head held high      Under the Texas sun      And no one guessed that a man so blessed      Would perish by the gun      Lord, would perish by the gun      A shot rang out like a sudden shout      And Heaven held its breath      For the dreams of a multitude of men      Rode with him to his death      Lord, rode with him to his death      Yes, the heart of the world weighs heavy      With the helplessness of tears      For the man cut down in a Texas town      In the summer of his years      The summer of his years.

It is we who carry on from this very person who served in this  Chamber and the United States Senate and went on to become the  President of the United States and, as important, a leader not only for  this Nation but the world.

I note, especially in these times, Madam Speaker, that it is service  above self that matters. It is service to your Nation, service to your  family, service to your community, and service to your State that  matters most.

I rise to salute the life of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
