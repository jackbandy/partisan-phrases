Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Neal for the  time.

Mr. Speaker, a constituent in my district in Middletown is going to  be paying more for health insurance than he does for his mortgage.

Let's cut right to the chase. This is about a vote for the American  people. This great democracy that we live in, this Chamber that could  once actually discuss and debate issues, Speaker Johnson should be  bringing this bill to the floor today.

Do Republicans have the courage to vote, or are they going to run and  hide? Four Republicans have stood up and said: You know what, in a  democracy, this deserves a vote.

Listen carefully, American people, how they decry this bill, yet they  won't even have a vote.
