Shame on Republicans for Cutting Funds to Pbs


Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise to associate myself  with the gentlewoman from Wisconsin. I wasn't going to speak, but I  came to the floor, and I heard Mr. Gill talk about how proud he was of  the President doing away with PBS.

What a shame. Is this Brandenburg?

Are we going to be burning books next?

What do we stand for in this great country?

In the United States of America we have free speech, and everybody  gets to express their opinion whether you agree with them or not.

PBS does an exceptional job. Thank God for them. God bless them and  America.

If you want to help out, all you citizens out there, donate to PBS,  and don't put up with any of this nonsense.
