Breaking the Gridlock Act


Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader of the  Ways and Means Committee and rise in strong support of this  legislation.

We have heard an awful lot of talk about subsidies over there. Let's  cut right to the chase. It is about subsidies. You care about subsidies  for billionaires, and you are willing to do it on the backs of the  American people.

You would rather see them--thank God for the people who are standing  up on your side. They deserve the Profile  in Courage award because they are able to stand up to a President who  would rather see 15 million people lose insurance and another 20  million see their prices double. Thank the Republicans on that side for  profiles in courage.

Vote your conscience. Vote your constituents. This is not about  politics. It is about people.
