Central Texas Floods


Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I begin, I just want to say that I  join Americans around the country in praying for the victims of the  torrential flooding in Texas this weekend. More than 100 have been  reported dead--among them, at least 28 children. It is a moment of  unfathomable pain for so many, and my prayers are with the grieving  parents and the grieving families.

I am grateful for the efforts of the rescue workers, military  members, and volunteers who put themselves in harm's way to rescue  flood victims. And it would be wrong to acknowledge rescuers without  also mentioning the everyday Americans who died in the floods trying to  save others, like the camp director who died trying to get his campers  to safety.

The Scriptures say:

A greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down       his life for his friends.

These are the people we would all hope to be at the moment of our  testing.

Again, my thoughts and prayers are with all the victims of these  deadly floods and with those who continue to work to rescue them.
