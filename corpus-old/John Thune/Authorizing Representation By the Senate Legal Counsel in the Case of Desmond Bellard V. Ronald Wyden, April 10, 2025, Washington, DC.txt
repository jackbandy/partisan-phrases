Authorizing Representation By the Senate Legal Counsel in the Case of Desmond Bellard V. Ronald Wyden, U.S. Senator


Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a lawsuit filed in  the Oregon Supreme Court against Senator Wyden. That suit was brought  by an individual, Desmond Bellard, who is representing himself without  the assistance of an attorney and is attempting to use a civil action  known as quo warranto to remove Senator Wyden from office for alleged  State campaign finance violations in the 2022 election. This suit  challenges the Senator's right to be seated in the Senate, an issue  which the U.S. Constitution commits exclusively to the Senate.

This resolution would authorize the Senate legal counsel to represent  Senator Wyden named as a respondent in this suit in order to remove the  case to Federal court and seek its dismissal on the basis of the  constitutional commitment to the Senate of the power to seat and remove  its Members, the Speech or Debate Clause, and the lack of jurisdiction  under Oregon's quo warranto statute.

Mr. THUNE.  74 and 75, the mandatory quorum calls be waived  and they ripen at 1 a.m., Friday, April 11; further if cloture is  invoked on Calendar No. 74, all post-cloture time be expired and the  Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination; further, if cloture is  invoked on Calendar No. 75, all postcloture time be expired and the  Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination; finally, if confirmed,  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
