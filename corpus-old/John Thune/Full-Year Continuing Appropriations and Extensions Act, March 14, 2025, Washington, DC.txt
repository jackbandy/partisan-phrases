Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025


Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, for information of all Senators, there will  be up to nine rollcall votes. I will ask unanimous consent that all  votes following the first vote be 10 minutes in length, and that if  Senators will stay in their seats, we should be able to get them done  even more quickly than that. Everybody be here after this first vote.  These are going to be 10-minute votes.

Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we have already locked in 10-minute votes  for the balance of the number of votes, but if people stay here in  their seats, we can execute that a lot more quickly.
