Youth Poisoning Protection Act


Mr. CAREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill that will  prevent deadly chemicals from falling into the hands of children, our  Youth Poisoning Protection Act.

It's a parent's worst nightmare: a nameless, faceless stranger over  the internet teaching your child how to take their own life, and your  child, in a moment of vulnerability, listening to them.

That's exactly what happened to Kristine Jonsson, a vibrant sixteen- year-old from Hilliard, Ohio whose life was cut tragically short in  September 2020.

Kristine was open with her parents about her mental health struggles,  but it was behind closed doors on an internet forum that she learned  about sodium nitrite.

With the coaching of sinister strangers online, Kristine was able to  purchase sodium nitrite on Amazon and get it nondescriptly shipped to  her front door, all under her parents' noses.

Sodium nitrite is a chemical used in the preservation of meat and  fish, which in high concentrations is deadly if ingested.

In fact, one spoonful of the chemical is one hundred times more  lethal than other poisons. High concentrations of some chemicals can be  harmful if used improperly, which is why they are usually highly  regulated or banned for sale to consumers.

Thanks to online forums like the one Kristine saw, the number of  suicide deaths using sodium nitrite is rising. In recent years, the  share of sodium nitrite usage as a method of self-poisoning has grown  nine times over.

By passing this bill, we can save lives.

The Youth Poisoning Protection Act would prevent the commercial sale  of highly-concentrated sodium nitrite, so it can never fall into the  hands of a vulnerable young person.

With the support of my colleagues and friends across the aisle, we  are one step closer to preventing these senseless tragedies in our  communities.
