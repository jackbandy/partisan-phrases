Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. CAREY. Mr. Speaker, today's vote really marks an essential step  toward fulfilling the promise to the American people to extend the 2017  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to enshrine border security into law, and to  move forward toward American energy independence.

After enduring years of high inflation, American families and small  businesses urgently need tax relief in order to thrive. We must pass  our budget resolution today to start the budget reconciliation process  and advance the policies that our American families expect from us.

It includes much-needed deficit reduction, as was mentioned earlier,  which will secure a healthy financial future for our children and  grandchildren. It will allow us to extend the successful tax cuts from  2017 that produced the unprecedented job growth and higher wages for  American workers. I urge everyone to support the resolution.
