Law-Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act


Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, for the past year, Republicans have done  nothing to address rising grocery prices, rising energy prices, and  rising healthcare prices. What is the one thing they are willing to do?  Making tasers more accessible to dangerous people. It is unbelievable.

On January 21, 2023, my hometown of Monterey Park, California,  suffered a mass shooting that killed 11 of our neighbors. It remains  the deadliest mass shooting in Los Angeles County's history.

Monterey Park, and every community across this country, deserves to  be safe from violence, whether from guns, tasers, or anything else, but  Republicans are working to make our communities less safe by handing  over access of weapons to individuals we know should not have them and  making them far harder for law enforcement to track.

We should be focused on keeping our communities safe, not voting to  flood our streets with even more weapons.
