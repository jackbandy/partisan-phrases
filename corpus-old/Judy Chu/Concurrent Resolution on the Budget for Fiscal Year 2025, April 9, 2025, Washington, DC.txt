Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I once again rise in opposition to the  Republican rip-off.

Let's be crystal clear about what Senate Republicans did to this  budget resolution. They made a terrible bill that rips off middle-class  Americans even worse.

They are telling you that two plus two equals zero in this budget  resolution to obfuscate the truth. It will explode our national debt.  It will make the Trump tax scam permanent. It will make devastating and  inhumane cuts to lifesaving services for working Americans to fund tax  giveaways to the ultrarich.

Instead of standing up for their constituents, Republicans bend the  knee to their wannabe emperor and his court of jesters and lackeys in  the White House.

This budget resolution tells us exactly who the Republicans are  working for and who they want to help, and it is not the American  people.

Mr. Speaker, it is a betrayal, and I won't stand for it.
