Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, in 2 weeks, 22 million Americans will see their  health insurance premiums skyrocket, not by accident, but because  Republicans refuse to extend ACA tax credits that keep care affordable.

After 15 years, this is the Republican healthcare plan: higher costs,  weaker coverage, and recycled ACA sabotage. Millions will pay hundreds  or thousands of dollars more, and millions could lose coverage  altogether.

Democrats have a solution right now and have the 218 bipartisan  signatures for a clean bill to extend these tax credits. Speaker  Johnson must put this bill on the floor now. The consequences are real.  The American people are watching.
