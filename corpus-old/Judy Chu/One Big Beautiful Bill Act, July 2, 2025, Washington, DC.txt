One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to Republicans' big, ugly  bill because of my constituents like Lisa whose son was diagnosed with  a life-altering disease that left him unable to work by mid-age.  Medicaid enables Lisa to be his full-time caregiver and ensures that he  has the care he needs.

Unfortunately, for Lisa and her son, Republicans don't care. They  made it very clear over the past 6 months who they are fighting for. It  is not for the most vulnerable like Lisa and her son, who may be 2 of  the 17 million Americans kicked off their healthcare thanks to this  bill. Instead, Republicans are fighting for billionaires like Donald  Trump and the top 0.1 percent who will get an average tax cut of  $309,000 per year, while those earning less than $50,000 get 68 cents a  day.

To my Republican colleagues, there is still time to join Democrats in  preventing this despicable bill from becoming law.
