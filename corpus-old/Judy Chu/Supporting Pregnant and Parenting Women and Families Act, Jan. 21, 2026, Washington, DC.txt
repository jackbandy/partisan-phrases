Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act


Mr. Speaker, as families across the country are being crushed by  rising costs and stripped of their healthcare, it is shameful that  Republicans have chosen to bring a bill to the floor that does nothing  to address these crises for pregnant women and families.

Instead, the bill before us today would allow Temporary Assistance  for Needy Families, or TANF, dollars to be used to fund so-called  crisis pregnancy centers that have a proven track record of  intentionally lying to, misleading, and endangering women.

It is no coincidence that this bill is being rushed to the floor this  week as Republicans once again prioritize appeasing a national anti- abortion group in town for its annual rally instead of addressing the  real crises facing American families.

I want to paint a picture as to what happens to a young woman who  suspects that she may be pregnant. She has a mix of emotions. She may  have overwhelming fear and anxiety, especially if she has few  resources. She goes to what she thinks is a medical center or clinic,  and it is called a pregnancy center of some sort.

When she gets there, she is greeted so warmly with open arms. There  are people in white coats, who she assumes are medical professionals.  They tell her she can get so many things for free: pregnancy tests,  ultrasounds, pregnancy counseling, and, after the birth, even free  diapers and formula. It all sounds so wonderful to this woman that she  says sign me up.

They don't tell this woman that, in order to get these free services,  she has to first sit through an ideological or religious indoctrination  session in which all the reasons not to have an abortion are given.

They don't tell her that the person administering the ultrasound has  no medical credentials, that, in fact, this is not an official  ultrasound, and that she could be misdiagnosed.

They don't tell her that half of the personnel in the so-called  clinic have no medical credentials at all and, therefore, are not  equipped to advise on any medical complications, such as an ectopic  pregnancy.

They don't tell her that this is not a medical clinic at all. In  fact, because it is not, this woman's privacy is not protected, and her  information could be shared with the public.

The real world of the crisis pregnancy centers is exemplified by an  OB/GYN in Iowa, who has seen patients who visited these centers and  were told that using contraceptives was the same as having an abortion.  She has seen patients who suffered miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies  because they were misdiagnosed by these anti-abortion centers.

These women were told that their pregnancies were in the early stages  or that they were experiencing normal amounts of pain because the staff  members they saw were not actual, qualified medical professionals.

As a result, these women ended up in the hospital, needing emergency  care and surgery to save their lives.

In Illinois, a woman seeking an abortion was deliberately misled by a  fake clinic. She was subjected to graphic videos and told that having  an abortion would make her infertile and, ultimately, mentally ill.

Ultimately, she was coerced into carrying a pregnancy to term. After  giving birth, she lost her job and health coverage, and the so-called  clinic never offered real medical care or follow-up support.

This is why the American Medical Association and the American College  of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have raised serious ethical and  medical concerns about these clinics.

Now, Republicans want to guarantee that taxpayer dollars through  these TANF funds will fund these centers and that there will be no  accountability for these dollars.

Let's first be clear about what TANF is actually supposed to be for.  TANF exists to help families experiencing poverty meet their most basic  needs and stabilize their lives so parents can work and children can  thrive. TANF was never intended to subsidize anti-abortion propaganda  or unregulated sham clinics that endanger women's health. Yet, that is  exactly what this bill does.

Not only that, it goes beyond the regular TANF program, which  requires reporting and accountability. Actually, this bill says that  nothing shall be construed to restrict TANF funding for these centers,  meaning that funding could not be taken away from them even if the  center engages in deceptive practices or even causes a woman's death.

When the Ways and Means Committee marked up this bill last week,  Democrats offered commonsense amendments that should have been  uncontroversial to anyone who cares about women and families. We simply  proposed that TANF funds not go to pregnancy centers that have engaged  in deceptive or misleading practices that provide medically inaccurate  information or that have endangered the health of a woman seeking care.

We also offered amendments to address the real crisis affecting the  TANF program, which is the Trump administration's decision to seek  revenge against five Democratic Governors by preventing them from  accessing $10 billion in already appropriated funds for TANF and  childcare.

Republicans rejected every one of these amendments.

Clearly, this bill is not about supporting pregnant women and  families. It is about shielding deceptive actors, supporting Trump's  revenge tactics, and using public funds to advance an extreme anti- abortion agenda.

If Republicans truly cared about pregnant women and families, we  would be debating how to undo their $1 trillion cut to Medicaid, which  rips healthcare away from millions of pregnant women, new mothers, and  children, and how to help the millions of women seeing their health  insurance premiums skyrocket due to months of Republican inaction.

Instead, this bill is merely an attempt to distract from these  devastating realities with the ultimate goal of appeasing the anti- abortion advocates parading around Washington this week as countless  women suffer and die under extreme Republican abortion bans. Their  priorities are clear and profoundly misguided.

I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.

Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that the previous  speaker said that these clinics have trained staff, but many of these  centers pose as clinics, offer incorrect medical advice, and even go so  far as to wear scrubs and white coats to appear as though they are  trained. Actually, fewer than half of crisis pregnancy centers have a  licensed medical professional on staff. Mr. Speaker, 95 percent do not  provide prenatal care, and only 1 out of 607 provides contraception,  and the facilities are unregulated.

Mr. Speaker, I wish the previous speaker could have met this  Massachusetts woman who sought care at a crisis pregnancy center after  a Google advertisement led her to believe it was a legitimate medical  facility where she could confirm her pregnancy. At Clear Way, a nurse  administered an ultrasound and told the plaintiff that she had a viable  intrauterine pregnancy. The nurse was not licensed to diagnose viable  pregnancies and did not undertake appropriate medical measures to rule  out an ectopic pregnancy.

Rather than referring the patient for immediate medical evaluation,  Clear Way staff focused on encouraging her to continue the pregnancy.  As a result of the misdiagnosis, this woman's ectopic pregnancy  ruptured, causing massive internal bleeding and requiring emergency  surgery. She lost a fallopian tube and narrowly avoided death.

Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I wish we could think of the woman in  Pennsylvania who was pregnant who sought care at what she thought was a  medically certified clinic, but during her appointment, the staff told  her she had already miscarried and was sent home.

As time went on, though, she continued experiencing pregnancy  symptoms, so she later went to a licensed doctor who told her she was  still pregnant and that the crisis pregnancy center had given her the  wrong information. This misdiagnosis greatly increased her risk of  having pregnancy complications.

Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk about Kentucky, where a  postpartum nurse with 20 years of experience was motivated to volunteer  at a crisis pregnancy center. During her training, she learned that the  clinic was using expired disinfectants to sanitize ultrasound  equipment. Not only that, the kind of disinfectant that the clinic was  using was ineffective in targeting human papillomavirus, which causes  90 percent of cervical cancer cases.

The volunteer nurse quit. She filed whistleblower complaints with the  State, but nothing was ever done, highlighting the lack of  accountability at the centers.

Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, let me say, there is a comprehensive study by  the Alliance for Women's Rights and Gender Equality that studied 607  crisis pregnancy centers across nine States, and they documented a  consistent pattern of deception, misinformation, and patient harm.

Nearly two-thirds of the centers promoted patently false or biased  medical claims about pregnancy, abortions, contraception, or  reproductive health providers, and fewer than half reported having a  licensed medical professional on staff.

These are not isolated incidents. These are standard practices for  these centers.

Morrison).

Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, well, it is not hogwash to this woman in  Georgia. She sought care from an unregulated clinic that offered free  ultrasounds and medical advice. She thought that was so great. The  ultrasound technician incorrectly informed her that her baby's kidneys  were filled with water and that she needed to see a primary care  doctor.

The diagnosis was incorrect, but the stress of that misdiagnosis  severely impacted the mother. She said: The irony in all this is that  they could have caused me to lose a perfectly healthy pregnancy.

Moore).

Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify that this bill actually allows  these funds to be free of any accountability. It actually changes the  way in which these TANF funds are being used.

Right now, there has to be accountability if States use TANF funds  for the crisis pregnancy centers. What this bill does is, by amending  section 404 of the Social Security Act to state that nothing in this  part may be construed to restrict TANF funding for pregnancy centers,  this bill actually overrides TANF's statutory purposes, reporting  requirements, penalty authority, and HHS enforcement provisions.

As a result, any future Federal effort to limit condition or review  TANF funding for these crisis pregnancy centers could be challenged as  prohibited by this statute.

Even if that center engages in deceptive advertising and does actions  that even result in the death of a woman, there would be nothing that  could be done about that crisis pregnancy center.

Moore).

Mr. Speaker, the truth is abundantly clear. Both the American Medical  Association and The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  have raised serious ethical and medical concerns about so-called crisis  pregnancy centers.

These facilities are unregulated. They have no obligation to provide  accurate medical information. They are not subject to HIPAA. They are  not required to protect patient confidentiality. Yet, Republicans are  determined to send them Federal taxpayer dollars anyway.

I talked about this very comprehensive report by the Alliance for  Women's Rights and Gender Equality, which studied 607 crisis pregnancy  centers across 9 States. They documented patients' experiences at the  centers.

In one case, a patient seeking abortion care was misled into  believing she was too early in pregnancy to receive medical care and  was encouraged to delay seeing a licensed provider, despite  experiencing symptoms consistent with a pregnancy complication.

In another documented case, a patient was falsely told that abortion  would cause infertility and severe mental illness, information that  directly contradicted established medical evidence.

Several patients reported being reassured that severe pain or  bleeding was normal, only to later require emergency medical  intervention when complications were left untreated.

If Republicans truly cared about TANF oversight, they would have  spoken out when millions of TANF dollars were stolen from struggling  families in Mississippi to build a volleyball stadium and when the  Trump administration stepped in to shield the perpetrators from  accountability. Instead, they were silent.

The bottom line is simple. Anti-abortion centers that spread  misinformation and put women at risk should not receive taxpayer  dollars. Certainly, they should not receive taxpayer dollars that are  completely unregulated.

If we want to support parents and pregnant women, let's continue  helping them.
