Trump Immigration Policies


Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, this administration has thrown out the  Constitution and asserted that the President has king-like power to  arrest anybody in this country and deport them, even to a foreign  prison for life, with no due process.

Days ago, we learned they deported a 4-year-old child with stage IV  cancer and a 2-year-old American citizen.

We know that they are now going after Southeast Asian refugees from  Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. They came here due to the U.S. depending  on them as allies during the Vietnam war.

This was the case with Chanthon Bun, who fled to the U.S. with his  family to escape the Cambodian genocide. Like many refugees, Bun found  himself in an impoverished community and struggled to acclimate. He  later fell in with the wrong crowd and made a mistake as a teenager.  Bun has since served his time, and once granted parole, he has become a  leader in his community.

In Trump's eyes, Bun's rehabilitation doesn't matter. Trump is now  detaining and deporting Southeast Asian refugees who have had pauses on  their deportation orders for decades and are deeply tied to their  communities. Mr. Speaker, 15,000 of these refugees have deportation  orders and are now being deported as they do the right thing and report  for their ICE check-ins.

We will not stand for it. I will soon be reintroducing the Southeast  Asian Deportation Relief Act, which would prevent the administration  from deporting these refugees to countries where they have often never  lived and ensure that those who have already been deported can return  home to the U.S.

If the Trump administration can disappear immigrants to other  countries without due process or deport refugees to places they have no  memories of, we are all in danger.
