Assisting Small Businesses Not Fraudsters Act


Mr. OLSZEWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.  I also thank the chairman for bringing this legislation forward along  with my colleague from California (Ms. Simon).

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Assisting Small  Businesses Not Fraudsters Act, legislation that will help ensure that  small businesses who need and deserve support get it, while cutting out  fraudsters seeking to exploit vital relief programs.

Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. They create jobs,  they foster innovation, and they drive our local communities forward.  They should be who we lift up and support, and they rightly are the  beneficiaries of many Small Business Administration programs.

However, far too often, we have scammers taking advantage of these  worthy programs. We saw this, for example, during the COVID-19  pandemic, when the Paycheck Protection Program, Economic Injury  Disaster Loan Program, and other relief funds were a lifeline for so  many, but were also exploited by bad actors to the tune of an estimated  $36 billion.

This bill ensures that will no longer happen again. It protects  taxpayer dollars, ensuring that they go where Congress intended: only  to the legitimate small businesses of our country.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.  Government efficiency is a good thing, but there is a right way to go  about it and a legal way to go about it. This bill is a great example  of a bipartisan way to go forward.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
