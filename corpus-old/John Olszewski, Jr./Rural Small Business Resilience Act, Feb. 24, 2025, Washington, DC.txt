Rural Small Business Resilience Act


Mr. OLSZEWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me  time. I also thank Chairman Williams and my colleagues who are leading  on this important legislation.

I rise in support of the bipartisan Rural Small Business Resilience  Act.

My home in Maryland's Second Congressional District is home to nearly  640,000 small businesses, many of which are in rural communities, all  with unique needs and challenges.

I support this bill because it will help ensure small businesses in  rural communities receive the resources they need and the support they  need to recover during times of crisis by requiring targeted outreach  and marketing materials and requiring a deadline to get it done.

Small businesses are the heart of our economy. That is especially  true in our rural communities. However, we know that small businesses  in rural America often face unique challenges that are often  overlooked, especially when it comes to disaster relief programs.

It is simple. We need to make sure that small rural businesses aren't  left behind when disasters from pandemics to hurricanes and everything  in between strike.

As a county executive, I witnessed firsthand the severe financial  pressures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which devastated many small  businesses.

I saw how rural communities in particular often struggle with limited  resources, reduced access to broadband and cellular services, and  longer response times when disaster relief is needed.

This bill will help break down those barriers and ensure that rural  businessowners are aware of and can effectively access available  resources.

I urge my colleagues on both sides to vote ``yes'' and show rural  America and our Nation's employers that we are committed to their  success.
