Epstein Files Transparency Act


Mr. GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, it is wonderful to hear  Republicans, and certainly the chairman of our committee, finally want  transparency on this issue. It is time to end this White House coverup  now.

We know that Donald Trump has tried everything to kill our Jeffrey  Epstein investigation. He has failed, and now he is panicking. He is  about to lose this Epstein vote to force the Department of Justice to  release the files.

Let's be crystal clear. Trump has the power to release the files  today. He does not even need a vote. He continues to defy the subpoena  of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to release all the  files. What is Donald Trump hiding? What is Pam Bondi, the Attorney  General, hiding? Why won't they release the Epstein files right now?

He must explain to the public why he moved sex trafficker and monster  Ghislaine Maxwell to a cushy, low-security prison after her interview  with Trump's personal lawyer. He should declare, and every Republican  should say, that she does not deserve a pardon or commutation.

Mr. GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, we don't care how much money  you have, what party you are in, or how powerful you are. We should get  justice for the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein.

Our work on the committee is not over. Next steps are the bank and  financial records to follow and expose Epstein's network.

Today, there should be a unanimous vote on releasing the files, and  we will get justice.
