Rhode Island State Police Centenary


Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, with admiration and appreciation, I wish to  recognize the 100th anniversary of the Rhode Island State Police. For a  century, these tireless men and women in uniform have traveled the  highways and byways of our state to ensure the safety of our  communities. They have lived up to their creed of honor, integrity,  fairness, excellence, courage, honesty, and devotion to duty.

On April 2, 1925 the Rhode Island General Assembly created the  ``Rhode Island Department of State Police.'' It was the first such  organization in our state dedicated to ensuring safety, order, and  security for Rhode Islanders. What began with just 21 officers  patrolling on Indian-brand motorcycles has grown into a modern,  technologically advanced law enforcement agency committed to the  highest standards of public service.

From the earliest days of policing rural roads to the current use of  cutting-edge technology, the agency has continually evolved to meet the  challenges of each era while striving to maintain the trust and respect  of the public it serves.

Even their uniforms made an impression--most notably in 1986, when  their distinctive attire earned national recognition and was featured  on the David Letterman Show.

Over the course of the agency's esteemed 100 year history, the  dedicated men and women of the Rhode Island State Police have worked  tirelessly to ensure Rhode Islanders' safety. And I know that for the  next one hundred years they will continue to serve justice, help  stranded motorists, and keep our communities safe. As they mark their  centenary during national law enforcement week, I join every Rhode  Islander in thanking the Troopers of the Rhode Island State Police for  their 100 years of public service.
