Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, Republicans refuse to listen. They refused in  February when they spiked my amendments to support Medicaid and SNAP,  and they refused again today. This is despite the pleas of Americans  protesting Donald Trump and Republicans' plan to steal their healthcare  and let kids go hungry and despite the overwhelming majority crying out  for everyday Americans over the whims of billionaires.

Clearly, Republicans don't care about the facts or figures. Maybe  they will listen to my constituent Al. Al is a 74-year-old resident of  an assisted living facility in East Providence. He is petrified of  Republican cuts that will force him onto the street. Al needs Medicare  and Medicaid to make ends meet. Even with assistance, he lives on $120  a month. That is $30 a week.

It is not fear-mongering to say that Republicans' plans would hurt Al  to prop up billionaires.

I will be voting ``no'' for the middle class, for families, for  seniors, and for folks like Al.
