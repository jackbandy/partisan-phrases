I Stand with the Disability Community


Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my constituent  Pranoy, a remarkable young adult and lifelong learner from Barrington,  Rhode Island.

Pranoy is driven by his dream of attending college, but that dream is  at great risk. It can only be realized if he receives support. Pranoy  lives with Down syndrome and uses an adaptive communication device with  specialized software to communicate, paid for by Medicaid.

Yet, Republicans are trying to ram through their disastrous budget  poised to gut Medicaid and threaten healthcare for one in four Rhode  Islanders.

I recently met with Pranoy. He said simply: ``I am only getting  started.'' That sentence sums it up. It is what keeps his family and  myself up at night. These Republican Medicaid cuts would hinder  Pranoy's potential.

I am standing here today because I stand with Pranoy. I stand with  the  disability community, and I will stand against any attempt to rip away  Medicaid from children who deserve the same opportunity to flourish as  any other American, to live out their potential and flourish.
