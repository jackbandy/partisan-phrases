Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share a story from  Charlene, a grandmother in Michigan, who wrote me with a real, honest  fear about Medicaid cuts.

Her granddaughter is just 11 years old, and she lives with type 1  diabetes.  Her life depends on insulin and a constant stream of medical supplies  to keep her alive.

Her mother is a single mom and a nurse. She takes care of others for  a living. Even though she has her own insurance, it doesn't come close  to covering all of her daughter's needs.

That is where Medicaid comes in. She is doing everything right and  this family is still holding their breath. If Medicaid disappears,  Charlene's granddaughter faces the possibility of going without the  medicine that keeps her alive.

Who are we as a nation? Why are we talking about this right now, and  all for what? It is so that Republicans can continue massive tax cuts  for billionaires and corporations. We can afford the healthcare that we  need and deserve in this country if we are willing to stand up to the  ultrawealthy.

I will never stop fighting for Charlene's granddaughter and every  family like hers in west Michigan and across the country.
