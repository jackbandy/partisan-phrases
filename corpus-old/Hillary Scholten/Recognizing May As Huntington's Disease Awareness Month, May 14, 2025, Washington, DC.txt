Recognizing May As Huntington's Disease Awareness Month


Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize May as  Huntington's Disease Awareness Month. I want to take a moment to honor  the courage and strength of families across the Nation who face  lifelong hardships due to this disease--including one of my own  constituents, Rachel Reising, and her family. It is so important for  families like Rachel's for us to encourage dialogue and acknowledgement  of Huntington's Disease so we can work to improve prevention and care  of affected folks at the federal level.

Huntington's disease is a rare genetic disorder that slowly damages  the brain over time. It leads to a progressive loss of control over  movements, thoughts, and emotions. There is currently no cure. However,  there is hope. Because of ongoing advancements in medical research and  continued investments in biomedical science, we are closer than ever to  the possibility of breakthrough treatments and perhaps even a cure in  the decade ahead through gene therapy.

Rachel, my constituent, recently reached out to me to bravely share  her story. As she grieves the loss of her father, whom she tragically  lost to Huntington's, it has become her life's mission to advocate for  proper care of those with Huntington's and for a cure. I am so moved by  her strength and resilience.

In honor of Rachel's family and the tens of thousands of others who  face Huntington's Disease, I am proud to lend my voice to this cause.  May this month serve not only as a time of remembrance and education,  but also a call to action. I ask my colleagues to do everything we can  to help those living with rare diseases such as Huntington's Disease,  and to fight for more research, better support, and even greater care.
