Recognizing the Kent District Library's Talking Book Braille Center


Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and recognize  the Kent District Library (KDL) on an extraordinary achievement. KDL's  Talking Book & Braille Center has been honored as the 2025 Library of  the Year by the National Library Service for the Blind and Print  Disabled, a division of the Library of Congress.

The Library of the Year award recognizes libraries that excel in  providing accessible reading materials and services to those with  visual, physical, or print disabilities. Libraries receiving this award  have a strong effectiveness in reaching these individuals through a  wide range of accessible formats, including braille and audio. KDL has  incorporated numerous accessible resources, including video magnifiers,  adaptive gaming controllers, and wearable artificial-vision devices.  Additionally, they have introduced LEGO Braille Brick kits in both  English and Spanish.

KDL is a pillar of our community, Year after year, their commitment  to academic excellence and innovative programming has helped  generations of children and adults to reach their full potential. Their  Talking Book & Braille Center has long been a vital resource for West  Michiganders who are often underserved in traditional library systems.  I am incredibly proud that our very own Kent District Library has set  the gold standard.

On behalf of Michigan's 3rd Congressional District, congratulations  to those at the Kent District Library's Talking Book & Braille Center  who continue to maintain a strong dedication to serving readers with  disabilities. This Center has touched the lives of over 750 children  and adults across our state. Today and every day, we thank this  institution for its lasting impact on our West Michigan community.
