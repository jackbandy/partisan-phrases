Recognizing the Career of Erica ``rikki'' Miller and Her Work on Behalf of Michigan's 3rd Congressional District


Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the remarkable  contributions of a woman who needs no introduction, Ms. Erica ``Rikki''  Miller, to our country and to the House of Representatives. For nearly  the last decade, Rikki has served with integrity, compassion, and a  deep sense of duty. Whether it was driving a Member as a humble staff  assistant, enhancing the caucus communications, directing  communications on energy policy for a senior Member of Energy and  Commerce or helping a brand new freshman establish her office as chief  of staff, Rikki approached every task with the same commitment--to make  life better for the people we serve.

Rikki's decade of congressional service began as an intern for  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, where she was soon hired full time as  constituent relations and press assistant. After two years with  Congresswoman Dingell, Rikki joined now Leader Jeffries inaugural  leadership team. As their press assistant, Rikki helped plan the Caucus  issues conference and lead the Caucus's communication  efforts during the Mueller trials and historic first impeachment. She  then spent four years with Congresswoman Kathy Castor as her  communications director, where she led the team during the COVID-19  pandemic and its aftermath.

After four years with Congresswoman Castor, Rikki was called back  home to Michigan to be chief of staff for my district office. As chief,  Rikki helped build the office from the ground up, leading the team  through my first term. There, Rikki established herself as a mentor to  those in the office, and to other chiefs as well.

Public service isn't always glamorous. It demands patience,  perseverance, and quiet strength. There are early mornings, late  nights, and countless moments when the work you do goes unnoticed by  the world outside. But it's people like Rikki who keep everything  running--the unseen hands and steady hearts behind the work we all  depend on, whether we realize it or not.

Rikki has been so much more than a House employee, she's been a  mentor to new young staff, a colleague, and a friend to all. Rikki  lights up any room she walks in. She knows everyone's name and treats  everyone the same. She has shared her knowledge generously, guided  others through challenges, and shown us what public service truly looks  like. Many of us here have learned from her--not just how to do our  jobs, but how to do them with purpose.

We will miss Rikki and her steady presence, her joyful spirit, and  her years of experience. But we take comfort in knowing that the values  she has instilled will continue to guide this workplace in the dozens  of new staffers she has trained and inspired. She has left it stronger,  kinder, and more resilient than when she arrived.

On behalf of a grateful country, and especially the people of  Michigan's 3rd Congressional District, we thank her.
