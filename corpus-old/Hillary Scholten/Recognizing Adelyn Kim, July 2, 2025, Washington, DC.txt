Recognizing Adelyn Kim


Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join  me in congratulating Adelyn Kim. Adelyn is a member of Girl Scouts of  Michigan Shore to Shore, Troop 4255. She has exemplified extraordinary  leadership, innovative problem-solving, and a demonstrated commitment  to making a lasting, positive impact by earning the most prestigious  award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award.

Gold Award Girl Scouts are recognized as trailblazers who are willing  to tackle the most pressing challenges facing their communities and the  world with measurable, sustainable, and far-reaching results. To earn  the Girl Scout Gold Award, high school-age Girl Scouts must identify  and investigate an issue they care about, devise a plan, and then lead  a team of experts and community members to implement a project that  produces lasting change. Over the course of 1 to 2 years, Gold Award  Girl Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and  leadership, distinguishing them from their peers. Through their  resourcefulness and perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to  truly make the world a better place.

Adelyn's project, ``The Pink Journal'', in partnership with Community  Food Club Grand Rapids, addressed the various stereotypes and  misinformation surrounding periods in our community. Adelyn took action  by designing and producing digital and printed bilingual period  information resources. These resources are being shared throughout West  Michigan, which will have a positive impact on our community for years  to come.

On behalf of Michigan's 3rd Congressional District, I congratulate  Adelyn Kim for achieving the highest distinction in Girl Scouts, the  Gold Award. I thank Adelyn for her leadership and for making such a  positive, enduring change in our community.
