Recognizing Denver Summit Fc


Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and recognize a  thrilling new chapter in Colorado's proud sporting history. It is with  immense pride that I welcome Denver Summit FC, the newest franchise in  the National Women's Soccer League, to our great state and to the city  of Denver.

The arrival of Denver Summit FC is more than just the addition of a  new professional sports team; it is a testament to the growth of  women's sports and a beacon of inspiration for young athletes,  especially young women, throughout our community. This team represents  a pinnacle of athletic achievement and will provide an invaluable  platform to showcase the incredible talent, dedication, and  sportsmanship of professional female athletes.

The establishment of an NWSL team in Denver will undoubtedly have a  profound and positive impact on our community. It will bring families  and fans together, create new economic opportunities, and further  solidify Colorado's reputation as a premier destination for  professional sports. I also want to specifically commend the  organization's investment in a state-of-the-art performance center in  Centennial, purpose-built for the unique needs of professional women  athletes. This facility is a landmark achievement and a powerful  statement about the value and importance of women's sports. Most  importantly, the players of Denver Summit FC will serve as powerful  role models for our children, demonstrating the limitless possibilities  that can be achieved through hard work, perseverance, and a commitment  to excellence.

I want to extend my sincerest congratulations and a warm welcome to  the players, coaches, staff, and ownership of Denver Summit FC. We  eagerly await the inaugural season and the excitement of cheering on  our new home team. The entire state of Colorado stands with them, and  we look forward to celebrating their success for many years to come.
