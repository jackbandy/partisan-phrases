Disapproving the Action of the District of Columbia Council in Approving the D.C. Income and Franchise Tax Conformity and Revision Temporary Amendment Act of 2025


Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J.  Res. 142, legislation to reverse a District of Columbia law that bars  the citizens of our Nation's Capital from seeing the benefits of the  working families tax cuts enacted by Republicans and signed into law by  President Trump on July 4.

Instead of seizing the opportunity to provide relief to the working  families and small businesses in their communities, the elected leaders  in D.C. are going out of their way to deny their own citizens tax  relief. That includes policies like no tax on tips, no tax on overtime,  and an increased standard deduction which 91 percent of Americans use  to file their taxes.

They say that they are the party of the working class. They are the  party of the taxing class because they do not want the people who are  waiting tables in Washington, D.C., to have no tax on tips because they  believe that they can spend their hard-earned dollars better than they  can. That is the difference between the Republican Party and the  Democratic Party.

We are the party of the working class: no tax on tips, no tax on  overtime, and tax relief for seniors. Under the working families tax  cut, a family of four who makes less than $73,000 will pay zero dollars  in Federal taxes, and every single Democrat in the House and the Senate  voted against that provision.

We also increased the child tax credit to $2,200 and made it  permanent, and every single Democrat voted against it.

We created Trump investment accounts for every new child born in  America, $1,000 in seed money to transform their lives, and every  single Democrat voted against it.

They are the taxing party. They are not the party about  affordability. They are not the party about working families.
