Recognizing Oscar Leroy Wade


Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and service of Oscar Leroy Wade of Farmington, Missouri. He died  January 2, 2026, at the age of 97, and was among the last of the  veterans from Farmington who served in World War II.

Mr. Wade's military service in the U.S. Navy became a cornerstone of  his life. He enlisted at the age of 17 on August 6, 1946, and received  an honorable discharge on April 29, 1948. He served in the South  Pacific on the USS Whiteside. He earned the China Service Medal, the  World War II Victory Medal and the Navy Occupation Service Medal. Leroy  served in the South Pacific on the USS Whiteside. He took great pride  in collecting Navy memorabilia and telling stories of his time at sea.

Leroy was a member of Farmington VFW Post 5896 and when he was able,  frequently attended veterans' events. In his later years, he would rise  from his seat, hold onto his walker to stand at attention and salute  when the colors were presented or when Taps was played. In 2015, he  joined a group of local veterans on an Honor Flight to Washington, D.C.  to visit veterans' memorials. His room at Maplebrook Assisted Living  was decorated in tribute to his naval service.

Leroy was born August 2, 1928, in Farmington and is survived by his  sister, Barbara Cornellson, and his children, Cathy Mana, Mary  LeTourneau, Nancy Rariden, Greg Wade, Diane Byrd and stepdaughter  Kellie Grief. He is also survived by 12 grandchildren and 20 great- grandchildren.

It is my great privilege to acknowledge Mr. Wade's patriotic pride  and celebrate his military service today before the United States House  of Representatives.
