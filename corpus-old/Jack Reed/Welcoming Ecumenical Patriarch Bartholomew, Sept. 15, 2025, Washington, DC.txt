Welcoming Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to welcome His All-Holiness  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, DC. Since 1991,  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has served as the 270th spiritual  leader of Orthodox Christianity, the world's second largest Christian  denomination with 300 million Orthodox Christians living across the  globe, including many in Rhode Island. He is an accomplished scholar, a  devoted environmentalist, advocate for peace, and a leader who commands  great respect around the world.

Over the past three decades, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has  used his position to establish himself as a leading voice on many  important issues and is recognized as a powerful force for good within  the Orthodox Christian faith and beyond. As part of his efforts to  advance cooperation and understanding between Christians, Muslims, and  Jews, he has cosponsored international peace conferences and advocated  for peace-building efforts in order to promote mutual respect and  religious tolerance on a global scale. Sometimes known as the ``Green  Patriarch,'' he has also championed environmental protection efforts,  including by organizing international, interfaith summits to address  climate change and call attention to pressing environmental concerns.

Once again, I join with Rhode Island's vibrant and important Greek  community to welcome His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew  to our Nation's Capital. As the longest serving Ecumenical Patriarch he  has cemented himself as an influential leader who is highly respected  within Orthodox Christian communities and beyond.
