Congratulating Hawaii Teach for America Teachers


Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say aloha and congratulations  to the newest cohort of Teach For America (TFA) Hawaii.

TFA, a critical national nonprofit partner since 1989 in our effort  to eliminate educational inequality, continues its mission to ``enlist,  develop, and mobilize as many as possible of our Nation's most  promising future leaders to grow and strengthen the movement for  educational excellence.'' By recruiting and training college graduates  to teach in high-need schools for at least two years, it aims to expand  educational opportunities for all.

This school year, TFA Hawaii marks its 20th year of service to the  State of Hawaii by welcoming 103 corps members to classrooms across our  islands. In total, the TFA network in Hawaii now has 631 corps members  and alumni, collectively improving the lives of over 18,000 students.

I especially commend the program's focus on locally-rooted  leadership. TFA Hawaii has recruited 259 corps members and alumni who  are kama`aina, born and raised in our islands, including 89 Kanaka  Maoli. They embody the sense of kuleana and community responsibility  necessary to provide critical education support for our keiki.

The impacts of our TFA Hawaii kumu--or teachers--have lasted far  beyond their initial commitment, with over 500 alumni remaining in  education across Hawaii, 15 of them now serving as school leaders.

Their mission reminds us of the `olelo no`eau ``hahai no ka ua i ka  ulula'au.'': the rain follows the forest. By intentionally investing in  this forest of local talent, we ensure a bright future for all our  students.

I offer my mahalo to the new corps members and alumni for their  continued service.
