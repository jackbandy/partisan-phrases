South Pacific Tuna Treaty Act of 2025


Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  Congresswoman Radewagen's South Pacific Tuna Treaty Act. I am an  original cosponsor of this bill because we urgently need this update to  U.S. law that will strengthen our national tuna fleet, restore  regulatory clarity and reinforce America's presence and partnerships  across the Pacific.

The South Pacific Tuna Treaty, first signed in 1987, has long been  the cornerstone of U.S. access to the tuna-rich waters of sixteen  Pacific Island nations. This access supports the operations of American  purse-seine vessels, ensuring that our fleet can remain competitive in  a region that is both economically and strategically vital.

The amendments enacted in 2016 provided much-needed updates,  including clearer access terms and more flexible mechanisms for  engagement with Pacific Island countries. But nearly a decade later,  these improvements are still not reflected in U.S. law.

This legal disconnect has left the American fleet, including vessels  operating out of Hawaii, in a state of regulatory limbo. Operators are  forced to navigate conflicting rules between what the treaty allows and  what our domestic regulations enforce. It's a situation that adds  unnecessary risk, uncertainty and cost to an industry that is already  facing tight margins and fierce international competition.

This uncertainty has serious consequences, particularly for Hawaii.  My home state is not just a waypoint for the U.S. South Pacific fleet,  it is a central base of operations, home to many of the crews,  companies and services that keep the industry running. The fishing  industry supports good-paying jobs across the Hawaiian Islands and  ensures our communities have access to healthy, locally sourced  seafood.

The impact is equally critical in American Samoa, where the tuna  industry forms the backbone of the territory's private sector and plays  an essential role in supporting families and sustaining the local  econony.

Passing the South Pacific Tuna Treaty Act today will eliminate this  long-standing regulatory conflict, bring our domestic laws into  alignment with the amended treaty and restore stability to a sector  that is vital to the economic wellbeing of Hawaii and American Samoa.  It provides the clarity our fleet needs to operate effectively and the  consistency our Pacific partners expect from the United States.

The significance of this legislation extends well beyond economic  benefits. The treaty itself embodies a broader commitment, one rooted  in decades of cooperation, mutual respect and shared responsibility for  the stewardship of ocean resources. By fully implementing the amended  treaty, we not only support our fishermen and industry partners but  also reaffirm the United States as a trusted ally to Pacific Island  nations, help strengthen regional stability and reinforce our  leadership in a part of the world where long-term relationships are  built on trust, continuity and cultural understanding.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation--for  the future of American fisheries, for the strength of our partnerships  across the Pacific and for the communities in Hawaii and American Samoa  that depend on this industry.

Mahalo.
