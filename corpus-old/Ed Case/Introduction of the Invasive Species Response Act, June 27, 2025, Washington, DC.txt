Introduction of the Invasive Species Response Act


Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to a critical  and escalating threat to our environment and economy, invasive species,  and to ask for support of my proposed Invasive Species Response Act.

Invasive species jeopardize the delicate balance of our ecosystems,  as they can outcompete, prey on or introduce diseases to our native  flora and fauna. The consequences of these disruptions are severe,  leading to declines in biodiversity, diminishing the resilience of our  ecosystems in the face of environmental change.

Beyond ecological damage, invasive species impose billions in  economic costs each year. They harm agriculture, forestry, fisheries  and tourism by reducing crop yields, damaging forests, disrupting  marine ecosystems and degrading natural landscapes that communities and  industries rely on.

In Hawaii, this threat is especially urgent. Hawaii's isolation has  led to the evolution of many endemic species that are found nowhere  else on Earth. Unfortunately, these native species often lack the  defenses to compete with or resist the pressures of invasive plants and  animals, which can rapidly alter ecosystems and displace local species.  In Hawaii, invasive species have caused significant ecological damage,  threatening the survival of native birds and plants. Protecting  Hawaii's unique biodiversity is not just an environmental necessity; it  is a cultural imperative that reflects the identity and heritage of the  Hawaiian people.

Invasive species are also not just a localized problem; they pose a  significant threat to the integrity of our natural world. Addressing  this crisis requires a coordinated and comprehensive approach, focusing  on prevention, early detection and effective management strategies to  safeguard our vulnerable ecosystems.

In response to this urgent need, I am jointly introducing the  Invasive Species Response Act with my colleague, Congressman Jim Moylan  of Guam. This legislation will codify the existing Invasive Species  Strike Teams program currently operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service (FWS). These specialized teams play an essential role in  managing emerging invasive species, employing strategies tailored to  local conditions across the National Wildlife Refuge System. With 21  teams strategically positioned in various FWS regions, they are on the  front lines, addressing the unique challenges posed by invasive  species.

The Invasive Species Response Act signifies a transformative shift  within the FWS, moving us from a reactive, species-by-species approach  to a more strategic, system-wide framework for managing emerging  invasive species. Key provisions of the bill include formally  establishing the Invasive Species Strike Teams program, which will  create a stable and legally supported framework to ensure consistent  funding and enhance our management efforts. The act also mandates  enhanced coordination and reporting through integrated systems and  standardized procedures, ensuring transparency and enabling us to track  progress with annual reports to Congress and the public. Furthermore,  it authorizes $15 million annually from Fiscal Year 2025 through 2029,  aligning with current FWS investment levels to support ongoing  initiatives.

This legislation is a crucial step forward in protecting our natural  resources and enhancing our capacity to respond swiftly to the threats  posed by invasive species.

I urge my colleagues to lend their support to our Invasive Species  Response Act. Together, we can ensure the preservation of our  ecosystems and promote a resilient future for our environment.
