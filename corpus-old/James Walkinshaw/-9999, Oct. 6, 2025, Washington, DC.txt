Mr. WALKINSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Community  Residences Inc. on the occasion of their 50th anniversary.

For half a century, this remarkable organization has stood at the  forefront of the movement to expand opportunity, ensure dignity, and  promote independence for individuals with intellectual and  developmental disabilities in Northern Virginia.

What began in 1975 as a grassroots response to the lack of community- based housing for people with disabilities has grown into one of the  region's most respected providers of inclusive services. In its  earliest days, CRi, then Arlington Community Residences, challenged  outdated models of institutionalization by creating homes where  individuals could thrive as valued members of their neighborhoods. Over  the decades, the organization evolved, broadening its programs and  reaffirming its mission in a new name Community Residences Inc, with  the tagline, choice, respect, and independence; that reflects the core  principles guiding their work.

As the organization celebrates 50 years of service, it also looks  forward to the launch of its Champions Campaign: a bold initiative to  secure the resources needed to expand housing, enrich community  programs, and prepare the next generation of advocates. The campaign is  not only an investment in facilities and services, but in the vision  that every individual deserves the right to self-determination,  belonging, and a life of purpose.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing CRi for 50  years of leadership, compassion, and impact. Their history is a  testament to the power of community action, and their future promises  to carry forward the values of choice, respect, and independence for  generations to come.
