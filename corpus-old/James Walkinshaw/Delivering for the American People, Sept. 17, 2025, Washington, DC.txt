Delivering for the American People


Mr. WALKINSHAW. Mr. Speaker, across America, hardworking people are  struggling to pay their bills. This includes housing, groceries,  healthcare, and more. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been cut due  to the DOGE policies. Our economy is sputtering, and the tariffs are  jacking up prices.

The so-called big, beautiful bill will decimate Medicaid, taking  healthcare from seniors, children, and working families, while driving  up premiums.

The President has told the majority not to negotiate with our side to  keep the government open. The budget that has been introduced will  drive up everyday costs, including healthcare premiums.

Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to come together and deliver what the  American people need, which is access to affordable healthcare and a  government that is funded and functional.
