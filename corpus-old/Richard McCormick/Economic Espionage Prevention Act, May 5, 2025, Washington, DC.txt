Economic Espionage Prevention Act


Mr. McCORMICK. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Mast and the minority  party for supporting this bill.

Since illegally invading Ukraine, the Russian Federation has become  reliant on the People's Republic of China for its supply of  semiconductors and other critical dual-use technologies. The State  Department notified Congress last year that the PRC exports of  semiconductors significantly increased in 2023 compared to pre-invasion  levels.

These semiconductors are critical key aspects to the Russian war  effort, including economic and electronic warfare, command and control,  and targeting. These components allow Russia to terrorize Ukrainian  civilians with ballistic missile strikes, as well.

The prevalence of U.S. manufacturing equipment in global  semiconductor production means nearly all are subject to U.S. export  controls if destined for Russia or Belarus.

My bill seeks to reduce Russia's access to these semiconductors by  authorizing sanctions on any foreign adversaries that materially  support Russia's military and intelligence services, violate U.S.  export laws, and steal U.S. intellectual property.

It further requires a report on whether China is providing  significant support to Russia's military and updates existing law to  provide greater flexibility to pursue sanctions against China and other  foreign adversaries if they violate these export controls.

The PRC may publicly claim that they do not provide material support  to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but their continued supply of dual- use technology clearly shows otherwise.

Cutting off the supply of semiconductors will seriously hamper the  Russian war effort and show the world that we will not allow our  adversaries to work together to destroy sovereign nations and undermine  the international system.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1486.
