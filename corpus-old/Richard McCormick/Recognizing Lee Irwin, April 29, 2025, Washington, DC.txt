Recognizing Lee Irwin


Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to recognize Lee  Irwin on the week of her 90th birthday.

She has lived an extraordinary life. Mr. Speaker, she has spent 90  years of serving the community, making tens of thousands of dresses and  britches for those young people over in Africa that don't have very  much, serving her community and the Methodist Church that she served as  both a secretary and now a volunteer teaching accordion, and raising  three lovely children, also known as my cousins.

Welcome to just a great woman here in the House to recognize a life  well lived. Happy birthday. I love you, and God bless you.
