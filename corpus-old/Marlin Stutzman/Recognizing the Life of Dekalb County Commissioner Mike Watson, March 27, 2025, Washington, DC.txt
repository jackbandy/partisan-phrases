Recognizing the Life of Dekalb County Commissioner Mike Watson


Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  life and public service record of DeKalb County Commissioner Mike  Watson.

Mike dedicated his life to serving northeast Indiana in roles ranging  from president of the Auburn Economic Development Commission, president  of the DeKalb Central Foundation, and serving as an Auburn Common  Councilman.

In December, before his passing, Mike received the distinguished  County Commissioner of the Year award from the Indiana County  Commissioners Association.

Mike was the architect of many projects that bettered our region such  as having the Auburn Waterloo Trail become part of the Poka-Bache  Connector trail between Angola and Bluffton, Indiana, and the creation  of the Auburn Main Street which collaborates with the Auburn community  to  be an economic driver through promoting and advancing the town's  vibrant historic downtown that is welcoming for all folks.

Mike will be remembered as an incredibly hard worker, an intense  advocate for his Auburn community, and an unapologetic family man. He  always put his heart and soul into his work, and our community will  miss him and his mentorship sorely.
