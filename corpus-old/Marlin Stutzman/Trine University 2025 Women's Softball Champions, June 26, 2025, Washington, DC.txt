Trine University 2025 Women's Softball Champions


Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Angola,  Indiana's, Trine University women's softball team on winning the 2025  NCAA Division III softball championship. Under the leadership of head  coach Donnie Danklefsen, the Thunder gave the championship game their  all.

This game was a nail-biter, as the team was down by one run  throughout most of the game. On top of that, the team's star pitcher,  Alexis Michon, pitched the entire game despite an injury early on.

Even with this adversity, the team rallied together and kept their  determination to win. Everything turned around for the Thunder in the  sixth inning when Emma Lee crushed a three-  run homer and this team sailed to a 3-1 victory.

Trine University women's softball has continued to make Indiana's  Third District proud, as this is their second national title in 3  years. Their perfect post-season is a testament to the hard work and  talent of this team.

These women have set an example for all of us as to the achievements  that are possible with unwavering dedication and strong leadership.

To the 2025 Trine University softball team, congratulations on this  monumental accomplishment. I know each of you will continue to pursue  excellence and set an example for others.
