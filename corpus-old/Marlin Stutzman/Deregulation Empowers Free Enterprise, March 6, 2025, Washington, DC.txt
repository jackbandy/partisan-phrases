Deregulation Empowers Free Enterprise


Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, the greatest strength of our Nation's  economy has been its ability to continue to innovate and compete both  with ourselves and with our counterparts.

However, over the last 4 years, the American economy has been  suffocated under the enormity of regulatory burdens implemented under  the Biden administration. To be clear, the Biden administration cost  the taxpayers $1.8 trillion through unilateral rulemaking and executive  orders.

This brazen abuse of executive power stymied commerce and our free  markets and directly affected our ability to innovate and remain  competitive in the international economy.

The effects of this aggressive regulatory regime was clear: Gas  prices rose to the highest levels in history, and inflation reached the  highest levels in decades.

Due to this, nearly a third of Americans were forced to choose  between paying their energy bills or for their groceries.

Mr. Speaker, America is and will continue to be a beacon for free  enterprise, innovation, and competition. I applaud President Trump for  his pledge to roll back 10 regulations for any 1 implemented, and I  look forward to seeing America enter a golden era of prosperity.
