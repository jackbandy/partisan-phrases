Happy 50th Anniversary Albert and Sarah Stutzman


Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my parents, Albert  and Sarah Stutzman.

They are celebrating their 50th anniversary this Saturday, one day  after Valentine's Day. I just want to acknowledge them in all that they  have done for me and for my siblings.

They have really been an example of what hard work and what faith can  do in a great country like America.

My dad dropped out of high school. They were married when they were  very young, and they worked tremendously hard. They went through a lot  of challenges in their own lives as they worked to build a better  future for not only themselves but for my siblings and myself and  others.

They were foster parents. They went on mission trips. They helped  people in the community. They would take people into our home whenever  they needed help. They were always willing to help those who were in  need. They were always active in church. They were active in our  schools.

I just can't say enough about how proud I am of my parents, Albert  and Sarah. I just want to wish them a happy anniversary this weekend.

I love you, and I am looking forward to years ahead together.
