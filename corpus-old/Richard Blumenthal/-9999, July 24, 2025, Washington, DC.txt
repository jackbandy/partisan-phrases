Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise, sadly and reluctantly, to  oppose Richard Topping as the next VA Financial Officer, and I say  ``sadly and reluctantly'' because the VA really needs leadership now at  a time of mass firings, freezes on hiring, cuts, and the kinds of chaos  that we are seeing at this great institution that serves our Nation's  heroes. We need a really experienced, steady, principled financial  leader. And, unfortunately, Richard Topping is not that person.

He is not the kind of accountable and transparent leader that the  American people and veterans across the country expect at the VA.

When I questioned him at his nomination hearing--just to give you one  example--about a government audit that found extreme errors in his  judgment while he was CEO of a company called Cardinal, he blamed the  Democrats; he blamed others for his own shortfalls. That is not  leadership. That is not what our veterans identify as leadership.

He has never been the chief financial officer of any company. He has  never been CEO of a public company--that is to say, an institution  responsible to shareholders or to the public--and he lacks essential  qualifications in his educational background as well as in his  experience.

The VA's 2025 budget request is for $370 billion. It is second only  to the Department of Defense. It needs someone who not only is loyal to  President Trump--in fact, more than loyalty to President Trump--it  needs someone with the objective qualifications and experience. His  main qualification is, in fact, his fealty to Donald Trump.

That is not the qualification that should count here. What we need is  someone who will do the job with the excellence and integrity that  veterans have a right and need to expect. I urge my colleagues to vote  against this nomination.
