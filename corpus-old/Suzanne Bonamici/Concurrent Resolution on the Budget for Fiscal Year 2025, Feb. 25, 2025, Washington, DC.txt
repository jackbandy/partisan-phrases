Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Chair, last week, I had five townhall meetings  across northwest Oregon in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Not one  person, not one of the thousands who attended, asked me to support a  budget that cuts Medicaid, gives tax breaks to the wealthiest, raises  the cost of living, or undermines safety and security, but that is what  we are voting on today.

The Republicans are stealing the hard-earned tax dollars of  Oregonians and Americans to line the pockets of people like Elon Musk.

This ruthless Republican budget will rip away healthcare from low- income and working families and children and take us back to the days  when if you got sick, you either went without treatment or went  bankrupt.

It could rip away resources from local schools and prevent children,  especially students with disabilities, from getting a good education.

Republicans say they are eliminating waste. Do you want to talk about  waste? Waste is giving the wealthiest big tax cuts while regular  Americans are struggling to put food on the table.

The cost of groceries is increasing, wages continue to remain  stagnant, and too many families can't afford housing or childcare. The  Republican majority's answer is to rip you off and give tax breaks to  the wealthiest and then hope, unrealistically, that it is going to  trickle down.

We must oppose this Republican billionaire budget. We must focus  instead on the American people so everyone, not just those at the top,  have the opportunity for a better future.
