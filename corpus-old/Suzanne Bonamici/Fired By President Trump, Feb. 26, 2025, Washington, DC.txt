Fired By President Trump


Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the story of a Federal  scientist in Oregon who was recently fired by Donald Trump and Elon  Musk.

In Oregon, we experience seasons with drought and wildfires, and  lives depend on accurate research of water sources. Mr. Speaker, 60 to  70 percent of usable water in both Oregon and Washington comes from  mountain snowmelt, which is a critical water source in the West. It is  vital to farmers, forests, and every community I represent.

The scientist was with the Department of Agriculture's Oregon Snow  Survey.

Here is what he said:

My job was to collect tangible data from the snowpack which       could be used to determine a community's yearly water budget.       I am completely heartbroken to have lost my position with the       USDA.

Mr. Speaker, these reckless firings are not just devastating to  dedicated scientists who have chosen to work in public service, they  also endanger Oregonians and people across the country.
