Providing for Consideration of H.R. Breaking the Gridlock Act


Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this critical  bill that will lower the cost of healthcare for thousands of Oregonians  and millions of Americans by extending the Affordable Care Act premium  tax credits.

Right now, too many people are struggling. At the end of 2025,  Republicans let healthcare costs skyrocket, adding to the stress  Americans are already experiencing, because Republicans have done  nothing to address the high costs of housing, groceries, childcare,  utilities, and more.

David from Tillamook, Oregon, said premiums for him and his wife  increased from $415 a month to $2,384 a month, a 474 percent increase.

For Stacy in St. Helens and her husband, their premiums went from  $539 a month to $2,396, a 344 percent increase.

It is unconscionable, it is unacceptable, and it is unnecessary. This  is the United States of America, and everyone should feel secure, not  fearful when they get sick or injured. Our constituents want affordable  healthcare. They deserve better, and we can make things better,  starting with this vote to extend the tax credits.
