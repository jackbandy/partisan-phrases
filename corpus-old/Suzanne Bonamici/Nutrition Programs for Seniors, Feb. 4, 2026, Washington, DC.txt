Nutrition Programs for Seniors


Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the importance  of the Older Americans Act nutrition programs.

Providing nutrition assistance to seniors is one of the most fiscally  responsible actions Congress can take, and it is also the right thing  to do. An entire year of meals costs about the same as a single day in  the hospital.

Unfortunately, one in four Meals on Wheels programs around the  country have wait lists. Many older Americans wait months or even years  to access program benefits. It is not just about the food. Nutrition  programs also promote socialization, wellness, and safety checks. Food  delivery or community meals might be the only social contact older  Americans have during the day.

I have joined Meals on Wheels for deliveries in Oregon, and it is  very meaningful. I have introduced a bipartisan House resolution  recognizing the value of these Older Americans Act programs in  addressing hunger, malnutrition, and isolation among seniors.

I invite my colleagues to show their support for the Older Americans  Act nutrition programs by visiting their delivery and community meal  programs and by signing on to our House resolution.
