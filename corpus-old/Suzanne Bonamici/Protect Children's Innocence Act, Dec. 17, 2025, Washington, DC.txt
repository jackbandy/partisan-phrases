Protect Children's Innocence Act


Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I join many of our colleagues in  opposing this hateful and harmful legislation. This is a devastating  moment for transgender youth, their parents, and their healthcare  providers across the country.

The so-called Protect Children's Innocence Act is a blatant attack on  the rights of parents. It allows the government to interfere with very  personal healthcare decisions.

My Republican colleagues have spent years touting parental rights,  yet now they want to put moms and dads and doctors in prison for  deciding how to best support their own children. It is dangerous, and  it is wrong. These decisions belong to parents, their children, and  their healthcare providers, not politicians.

Every parent wants what is best for their children. As a parent, I  cannot imagine how I would feel if a doctor told me that Republicans in  Congress banned lifesaving, evidence-based care that would help my  child.

Medical care for transgender youth is safe, effective, and supported  by major medical associations. Access to transgender-related healthcare  is critical, medically necessary, and often lifesaving.

The President and my Republican colleagues have spent the year  scapegoating a very small group of very vulnerable children because  they have no solution to strengthen the economy, reduce healthcare  costs, or make our communities safer. This legislation is just the  latest attack.

Ms. BONAMICI. As I close, Madam Speaker, I find it disturbing that  my-- The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again  expired.

Ms. BONAMICI. I find it disturbing and disappointing that my  colleagues seem to be more obsessed with what genitals are in people's  pants than whether they can afford their healthcare or housing bills.
