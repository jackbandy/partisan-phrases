Fighting Fire with Fire


Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, it is wildfire season in Oregon, and the  Trump administration is making it harder for fire crews to do their  jobs. I met with them, some of whom voted for the President. They told  me that the funding cuts are a problem, and they don't have the  resources they need.

Now this administration is pulling people off the front lines of  wildfires to conduct immigration enforcement? Give me a break.

Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago, the Labor Day fires killed nine people and  destroyed thousands of homes in Oregon. Central Oregon is currently  fighting the Flat fire. Thanks to the hard work of our fire crews, it  is now at 52 percent containment.

Mr. Speaker, now is not the time to make life harder on our  firefighters. This administration needs to stop the foolishness. I  don't mess around with the safety of my constituents and neither should  the President.
