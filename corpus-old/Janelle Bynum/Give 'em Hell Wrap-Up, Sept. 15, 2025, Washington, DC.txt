Give 'em Hell Wrap-Up


Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I just wrapped up the Give 'Em Hell Tour, 10  townhalls over the last 3 months from every corner of my district. We  welcomed all Oregonians, and we were thankful to have community leaders  participating and local law enforcement keeping us safe.

From Bend to Portland, Silverton to Albany, over 42,000 people joined  and made their voices heard. Mr. Speaker, the message was clear: Quit  messing with our healthcare and start making life more affordable.

Mr. Speaker, hear me when I say this: We will not back down--not on  healthcare, not on costs, and not on making our voices heard.

My message to my fellow Oregonians is: I hear you, and I got you.  Even though the Give 'Em Hell Tour is over, there is always an open  line of communication between you and me.
