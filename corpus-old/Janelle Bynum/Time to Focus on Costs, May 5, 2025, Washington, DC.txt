Time to Focus on Costs


Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, today is the 122nd day of the 119th Congress.  It has been 122 days since I began the fight in Congress for lower  costs, more jobs, and a better quality of life for Oregonians.

Unfortunately, I have yet to have the opportunity to vote on a single  meaningful bill that would help achieve those goals. Grocery prices are  still increasing, housing isn't getting more affordable, and it is  getting harder for families to make ends meet.

Yet, we are voting this week on the Gulf of America Act, a bill that  does nothing to lower costs. It has been the same story week after  week. That is why I led my freshman colleagues in telling Speaker  Johnson that we are fed up and that it is time to work on costs.

I will keep sounding the alarm until we start helping the American  people.

Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to get serious.
