Protecting the Middle Class


Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, this administration is taking money out of  people's pockets and robbing the middle class of their earnings, and I  am fighting back.

I am fighting for the food bank in Redmond that can't offer meat in  its meals because of funding cuts. I am fighting for the seniors across  my district that are watching their life savings evaporate in the stock  market. I am fighting for retirees taking required distributions from  the their IRAs at a loss because Trump's tariff policies that are  tanking the market.

I am fighting for the parents who can't afford clothes for their  kids, for the families who can't afford groceries, and for the young  people who can't afford to buy a car or a home.

This foolishness can't continue, Mr. Speaker. Costs are skyrocketing.  The stock market is in free fall. We are headed toward a recession.

I call on Congress to pass my Protecting Families From Inflation Act  and to vote to put an end to this ill-advised trade war. The American  people can't wait.
