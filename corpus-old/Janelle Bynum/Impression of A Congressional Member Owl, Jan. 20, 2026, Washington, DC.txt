Impression of A Congressional Member Owl


Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I will offer my impression of a congressional  Member owl who will not stand up to the unconstitutional acts of this  administration.

Who? Who me? Everything is okay. I see the beatings on TV. I see ICE  showing up at people's doors. I see what is happening, but I am not  getting in the way. I am going to keep my head down.
