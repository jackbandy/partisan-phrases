Epstein Files Transparency Act


Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support to release  the Epstein files. First, this issue is beyond party. It is a question  of justice. Survivors have waited too long. Stop the delay. This is not  a hoax. Release the files.

Second, we must face a hard truth. Silence that shields the powerful  is a betrayal of those they hurt. Congress must reject any attempt,  including a Presidential pardon or any form of clemency for Ghislaine  Maxwell. This cannot be done. This would be a coverup. We cannot allow  clemency of any kind for Maxwell, not now, not ever.

Survivors deserve justice. I urge a strong ``yes'' vote.
