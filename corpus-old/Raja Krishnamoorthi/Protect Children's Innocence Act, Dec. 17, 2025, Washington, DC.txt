Protect Children's Innocence Act


Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  H.R. 3492.

This measure would allow politicians, not doctors, not families, to  decide medically necessary care for family members. It criminalizes  medically necessary, evidence-based lifesaving care, and it threatens  parents and physicians with prison time for providing care for their  kids.

As millions of Americans face losing their health insurance,  Republicans are not working to protect coverage or lower costs.  Instead, they are focused on throwing the parents and doctors of trans  youth into jail.

We should be strengthening care, not dismantling it. We should trust  doctors and families, not replace medicine with ideology. No parent  should have to fear prosecution for trying to get their child the care  they need, and that is exactly what this measure would do.

Madam Speaker, I urge a strong ``no'' vote.
