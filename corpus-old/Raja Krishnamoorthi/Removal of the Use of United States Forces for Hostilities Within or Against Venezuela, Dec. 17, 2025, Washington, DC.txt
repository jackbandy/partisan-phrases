Removal of the Use of United States Forces for Hostilities Within or Against Venezuela


Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the War Powers Act  was to prevent secret wars from happening after Vietnam. The reason why  we have this is so that the administration is accountable to the  people. No war should be declared and no war should be prosecuted in  the name of the American people without their consent.

If the President wishes to go to war, he must come to the people,  explain his rationale, and get their consent. He is not doing that now.  When he doesn't do that, bad things happen. Bad things are happening  today.
