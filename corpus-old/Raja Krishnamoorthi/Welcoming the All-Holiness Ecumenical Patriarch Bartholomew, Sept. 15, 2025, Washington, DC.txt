Welcoming the All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome the All- Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the Ecumenical Patriarch of  Constantinople and the spiritual leader of Orthodox Christianity  worldwide.

At 85 years old, All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew  remains at the forefront of the global struggle for religious freedom.  Known as the ``Bridge Builder'' and the ``Patriarch of Peace,'' he has  worked tirelessly to foster dialogue, reconciliation, and cooperation  across nations and faith. He has stood firmly against racism,  extremism, and fundamentalism, championing peace-building measures to  help defuse conflicts in some of the world's most volatile regions.

In addition to his leadership on matters of faith and peace, All- Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has been a pioneering  advocate for environmental stewardship. Often called the ``Green  Patriarch,'' he has elevated ecological awareness to the forefront of  his ministry, inspiring both individuals and institutions to act with  moral urgency in protecting our planet.

This month, he is visiting the United States to receive the Templeton  Prize--the most prestigious award at the intersection of religion and  science. He joins a distinguished group of past recipients, including  Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

As the longest-serving Archbishop of Constantinople in over two  millennia, All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew embodies the  values of faith, service, and moral leadership. His life's work is a  testament to the power of courage, compassion, and conviction, and I am  honored to welcome him to our country.
