Recognizing Milford, Delaware


Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the momentum and  pride on full display in Milford, Delaware, a small town with a big  story to tell.

Delaware is the small town State, and Milford reminds us why that is  something to be proud of. I had the pleasure of touring downtown  Milford with local leaders recently. Despite a torrential downpour, we  met with small business owners, local artists, and community members  who are working every day to turn vision into progress.

What I saw in Milford is what is possible when communities believe in  themselves. Whether it is the thriving downtown storefronts, the  Riverwalk's beauty, or the vibrant art scene, including Gallery 37,  Milford is a town that is honoring its history while investing boldly  in its future. Make no mistake, that future is being built by and for  Milford's residents.

We talked about infrastructure needs, economic development, and the  importance of expanding access to housing and opportunity. Over the  past decade, Milford has become a model for what small town  revitalization should look like, driven by public-private collaboration  and a clear focus on inclusive growth.

Milford's motto: Art Town, River Town, Home Town, is more than a  slogan. It is a reflection of a community that is rooted in creativity  and care for one another.

I am proud to represent Milford in Congress, and I will keep fighting  for the investments, partnerships, and policies that empower towns like  Milford to thrive. When small towns succeed, our whole State grows  stronger.

Celebrating the Anniversary of the Liberation of Delaware

Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the anniversary  of the liberation of Delaware from the tyrannical yolk of Pennsylvania  and the British Crown.

In June of 1776, Delawareans laid the groundwork for the single  longest running tradition in our State's history: the Separation Day.  Separation Day serves as a reminder of the fierce commitment at the  heart of the greatest State in the Union. It marks the moment when  Delaware said: ``We can govern ourselves. We can shape our own  future.''

That commitment to dignity, democracy, to self-determination is the  essence of who we are as Delawareans.

Each June, my neighbors gather in Old New Castle, one of the most  historic towns in America, to honor our legacy with joy and pride.

Separation Day isn't just about the past. It is a reminder that  democracy isn't something we inherit. It is something we practice,  because that bold act in 1776 wasn't made by kings or generals. It was  made by ordinary people who believed that a better future was worth the  risk. They understood something we should all remember to this day:  There are no kings in a democracy.

This year, as we celebrate our independence from one empire and one  governor across the State line, let us also reject any attempt to crown  a new monarch, whether with a golden crown or a gilded office, because  in this country no one is above the law.

Mr. Speaker, I wish a happy Separation Day to Delaware.                       Recognizing Gabriella Bourantas

Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize two extraordinary young  leaders from Delaware, Gabriella Bourantas of Wilmington Christian  School and Emily Geldreich of Kendall Academy, who have earned the  Congressional Award Gold Medal.

Through over 400 hours of public service, personal development,  exploration, and physical rigor, Gabriella and Emily have set and  achieved ambitious goals through perseverance and commitment.

Gabriella served the Blackfeet Nation in Montana, honed her field  hockey and Greek dance skills, and helped her family explore our  national parks.

Meanwhile, Emily taught American Sign Language, distributed food, and  became a stronger swimmer and martial artist, all while deepening her  understanding of deaf culture and global history.

Their achievements remind us that the Congressional Award isn't just  about logging hours. It is about building character. In their  dedication and drive, Emily and Gabriella reflect the heart of  Delaware, where young people lead with purpose and pride.

Mr. Speaker, Delaware is proud of Gabriella and Emily and their hard  work. They represent the best of the  State of Delaware and the future of this Nation.
