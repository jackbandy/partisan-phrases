Wilmington Police Athletic League


Ms. McBRIDE. Mr. Speaker, last week I had the privilege of visiting  the Wilmington Police Athletic League, a place where community and  opportunity are shaping the next generation of Delawareans.

For 23 years, the Wilmington PAL has served as a safe haven for young  people in Wilmington and New Castle County, supporting more than 42,000  youth with after-school programming, summer enrichment, and early  childhood education.

Their mission, ``building brighter futures, engaging with public  safety and empowering families'' is more than a slogan. It is a daily  practice. Through their work, the Wilmington PAL supports children from  infancy through high school, ensuring every child they serve has the  tools to grow, thrive, and contribute to our State of neighbors.  Recently, they expanded their work to support seniors in Delaware.

Organizations like the Wilmington PAL remind us that public safety  and public opportunity go hand in hand. I am proud to stand with them,  and I will keep working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to expand the resources that make their mission possible.
