Recognizing Emily Green


Ms. McBRIDE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary work of Ms. Emily Green, a  teacher in the POLYTECH School District in Woodside, Delaware.

Through her participation in National History Day, Ms. Green has  worked with her students to preserve the stories of Delaware's silent  heroes, everyday individuals who answered the call to serve our Nation.

This past school year, Ms. Green and her students chose to research  two Korean war veterans. They researched the lives that these veterans  led before their service, the communities they returned to, and the  legacies they left behind not only as servicemembers but as local  leaders.

Ms. Green and her students visited cemeteries across Delaware where  they honored these veterans by writing and delivering eulogies,  ensuring that their stories, sacrifices, and names are remembered.

This project reflects the very best of Delaware. I am grateful to Ms.  Green for teaching her students our Nation's history and respect for  our silent heroes.
