Recognizing Parvin Ahmadi


Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate  the outstanding contributions of Parvin Ahmadi, a lifelong educator  whose 36 years of service in public education have profoundly shaped  the lives of students, families, and educators across California.

Parvin Ahmadi began her career as a classroom teacher in San Jose  before taking on administrative roles in Fremont and ultimately serving  as Superintendent of the Castro Valley Unified School District for the  past decade. Her unwavering belief that ``nothing you do for children  is ever wasted'' has guided her leadership and inspired a generation of  educators to pursue equity, access, and excellence in every classroom.

Over the course of her distinguished career, Superintendent Ahmadi  has served as a teacher, principal, director, assistant superintendent,  and superintendent--holding the latter position for 15 years.  Throughout her journey, she has built inclusive learning environments  by collaborating with school boards and communities to ensure that  every student has the opportunity to thrive.

Superintendent Ahmadi holds a bachelor's degree from San Jose State  University, a master's in teaching from Chicago, and a master's in  educational leadership from Saint Mary's College of California. She  also earned a School Management Certificate from UCLA.

In addition to her district leadership, Parvin Ahmadi has made a  lasting impact at the state level. As President of the Association of  California School Administrators (ACSA), she represented more than  18,000 administrators serving six million students. She continues her  advocacy as Past President, mentoring new superintendents through  ACSA's professional development academies. In 2019, she was named  Senate District 10 Woman of the Year by Senator Bob Wieckowski and also  contributed her expertise as a member of Assemblymember Anthony  Rendon's State Blue Ribbon Commission on Early Childhood.

It is my honor to recognize Parvin Ahmadi for her decades of service,  leadership, and enduring impact on public education. Her legacy is one  of integrity, dedication, and a deep commitment to the belief that  every child deserves a champion. We thank her for her remarkable career  and wish her continued success in all her future endeavors.
