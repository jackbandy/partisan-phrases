Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Enhancement Act


Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Bottles  and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Enhancement Act.

Air travel with children is a nightmare, and I am just talking for  the nonparents who have to deal with them at an airport. For parents,  it is hell. It is like an Olympic sport. It is like going through a  gauntlet dragging little kids who just want to be attached to tablets  or anything but the directions that you are giving to them to hopefully  get them from the entrance of the airport to the plane.

Oftentimes with little kids, you have, in transit with them, a mother  who is breastfeeding. Many of us have experienced going through airport  security where our TSA agents, who are good natured and just doing  their jobs, can really slow down, jam up, clog, and delay this  experience.

For practicality's sake, the last thing you want for your kids to  experience when you are trying to move them from the gate to the plane,  is any interruption or delay. For traveling moms, it is humiliating to  have your breast milk sorted through by TSA agents. It doesn't feel  very safe to have agents open up the breast milk. Too many moms have  shared with me that working moms are often traveling on their own  without their kids, but they are still pumping, pumping and dumping as  they would call it, and are asked by TSA agents, what are you doing  with breast milk if you don't have kids with you, which is another  level of shame that is brought upon the mothers because they already  feel guilty that they are not with their kids.

It doesn't have to be this way.

My friend from New York (Mr. Garbarino), who has helped me shepherd  this bill through the Homeland Security Committee, has given me a good  snicker and a smirk over there because he probably sees me as the least  likely person to bring this bill forward and he is the least likely  ally that I have on the other side, but the two of us are smart enough  to listen to women and families.

Madam Speaker, I will share the origin of this bill because it is a  success story for anybody who believes that they can write to their  legislator and see a change in the laws that govern us. I thank  scientist Emily Calandrelli, a Californian whose advocacy and personal  testimony brought national attention to this issue. She wrote about the  exact experience I described, traveling as a working mother without her  kids and being asked why she had breast milk but no children. Her  experience made it clear to many parents who have faced similar  challenges.

I thank Senator Duckworth for leading the charge in the Senate and  sending us this bill so quickly as well as Representatives Salazar,  Pettersen, and Luna for their unwavering advocacy for traveling  mothers.

I also thank my former colleague, Katie Porter of Orange County, who  introduced this bill in prior Congresses. It is a commonsense bill, and  it is rightfully a bipartisan effort.

Compounding the chaos with the anxiety that mothers face are TSA  screeners who have inadequate or confusing guidelines as to what they  are supposed to do with breast milk. The Bottles and Breastfeeding  Equipment Screening Enhancement Act strengthens and streamlines TSA's  screening procedures so parents can travel with dignity, confidence,  and peace of mind.

It requires TSA to work with maternal health experts to create clear,  science-based guidelines for screening breast milk, formula, and  pumping equipment. It ensures TSA officers receive proper training so  that every parent can travel with confidence that they will not be  forced to discard essential nutritional products.

Again, this is not a partisan issue. It is a parenting issue.  Unsanitary handling of breast milk and formula puts kids at risk.  Mothers who can't pump because TSA held up their equipment can suffer  painful, preventable medical complications. Every parent who has  traveled with young children knows the stress, as I mentioned, that  this creates.

This bill is also about accountability. It directs an independent  body to audit TSA's compliance with its own policies, ensuring that  violations like those experienced by Ms. Calandrelli and by countless  moms who shared their stories do not continue.

Madam Speaker, families deserve better than unnecessary stress at the  airport. They deserve clarity, dignity, and a safe travel system that  works for them, not against them.

Passing this bill now will send it to the President's desk. I can't  promise that passing this bill will make your plane get there on time  or give you the upgrade you are so desperately hoping  goes through or make sure that your kids behave, but it does finally  make our airports a more welcoming place for parents.

I welcome my colleagues' support and encourage them to support this  legislation by voting ``yes'' on S. 260.
