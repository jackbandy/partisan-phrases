Introduction of the Foreign Service Voluntary Early Retirement Authority Act of 2025


Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Foreign Service  Voluntary Early Retirement Authority Act of 2025. This bill would allow  members of the Foreign Service to use Voluntary Early Retirement  Authority (VERA) when an agency is undergoing a reduction in force  (RIF) or other restructuring. While most other federal employees are  eligible for VERA if their agencies are undergoing a RIF or other  restructuring, the members of the Foreign Service are not.

I strongly oppose the Trump administration's efforts to fire federal  employees and to dismantle the federal government, and I will continue  to fight those efforts using every tool at my disposal. However, it is  important to mitigate the harm where we can, which this bill would do.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
