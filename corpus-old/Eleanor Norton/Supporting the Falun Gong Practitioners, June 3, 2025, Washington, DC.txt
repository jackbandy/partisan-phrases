Supporting the Falun Gong Practitioners


Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Falun Gong  practitioners and supporters in the District of Columbia and around the  world who are working to end the persecution of Falun Gong  practitioners.

As a former assistant legal director for the American Civil Liberties  Union, constitutional lawyer and a lifelong human and civil rights  advocate, I take this moment not only to speak out against the  persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, but also to remember those who  have died for their beliefs.

Falun Gong is a peaceful religion that teaches self-improvement  through meditation based on slow movements and regimented breathing.  For over two decades, Falun Gong practitioners have suffered from  detention, torture and organ harvesting at the hands of the Chinese  government.

We must fight to raise awareness of those persecuted in China who  cannot raise awareness themselves. On May 5, 2025, the House of  Representatives passed H.R. 1540, the Falun Gong Protection Act, which  I strongly supported. I will continue to work with colleagues in the  House and Senate to pass this bill.

I ask the House of Representatives to join me in solidarity with the  many Falun Gong practitioners who fight for the freedom to speak and to  practice the religion of their choice.
