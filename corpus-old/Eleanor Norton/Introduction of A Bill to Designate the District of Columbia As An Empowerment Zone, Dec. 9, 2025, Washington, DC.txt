Introduction of A Bill to Designate the District of Columbia As An Empowerment Zone


Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill that would  designate certain areas of the District of Columbia as an empowerment  zone. This bill effectively would reauthorize many of the unique  federal tax incentives for business investment in D.C. that expired in  2011. With the Trump administration's mass firings of federal  employees, budget cuts and proposed relocation of federal agencies, as  well as the continued prevalence of remote and hybrid work, this bill  is especially important.

In 1993, Congress created the national empowerment zone program to  encourage investment in low-income communities and delegated to federal  agencies the authority to designate communities as empowerment zones.  D.C. was not so designated. However, in 1997, working primarily with  Republicans in Congress, I created federal tax incentives for  investment in D.C. by businesses and individuals. The business tax  incentives were similar to, but more generous than, those available  under the national empowerment zone program. I got the D.C. tax  incentives continuously reauthorized until 2011, when Congress refused  to extend these tax incentives. At the same time, Congress extended the  national empowerment zone program, and the program was last extended  through 2025. Under this bill, low-income neighborhoods in D.C. would  be treated as an empowerment zone as long as the national empowerment  zone program remains in effect.

Congress has long recognized that the benefits of tax incentives for  investment in low-income communities outweigh the costs, as it has  continuously extended the national empowerment zone program.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
