Introduction of the District of Columbia Courts Home Rule Act


Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the District of Columbia  Courts Home Rule Act. This bill would give the Council of the District  of Columbia authority over the jurisdiction and organization of the  local D.C. courts. The D.C. Home Rule Act (HRA) prohibits the Council  from enacting any law with respect to title 11 of the D.C. Code, which  relates to the jurisdiction and organization of the local D.C. courts.

More than 50 years after passage of the HRA and notwithstanding the  importance of the local D.C. courts to D.C., the Council, which is the  legislative body accountable to D.C. residents, is left on the  sidelines while Congress, which could not care less about the local  D.C. courts, remains the only legislative body that can amend title 11  of the D.C. Code.

Under the HRA, the Council has no authority to ``enact any act,  resolution, or rule with respect to any provision of title 11 of the  District of Columbia Code (relating to organization and jurisdiction of  the District of Columbia courts).'' Title 11 of the D.C. Code primarily  relates to the rules of criminal and civil procedure, court  administration, the branches of the courts, jury service and admission  to the bar.

D.C. has never had authority over its local courts, even when it was  responsible for paying for them. Under the National Capital  Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997, the federal  government assumed from D.C. the costs for several state-level  functions, including the courts. This bill would not change the federal  government's responsibility for funding the local D.C. courts or the  authority of the President to nominate, and the Senate to confirm,  local D.C. judges.

This bill is an important step to increase self-government for D.C. I  urge my colleagues to support it.
