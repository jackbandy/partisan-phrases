Introduction of the District of Columbia Government Title Equality Act


Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia  Government Title Equality Act. This bill would amend the District of  Columbia Home Rule Act to redesignate the Mayor as the Governor, the  Council as the Legislative Assembly, the Councilmembers as  Representatives and the Chair of the Council as the Speaker. The new  titles are the ones used in the State of Washington, Douglass  Commonwealth constitution, which D.C. adopted in 2016 in anticipation  of enactment of the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, which would make  D.C. the 51st state.

I introduce this bill to highlight to the American people and Members  of Congress that the transition to statehood would be seamless, because  D.C. already operates as the functional equivalent of a state,  providing state-, county- and city-level services, despite being denied  voting representation in Congress and full local self-government. This  bill would not change any legal authorities.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
