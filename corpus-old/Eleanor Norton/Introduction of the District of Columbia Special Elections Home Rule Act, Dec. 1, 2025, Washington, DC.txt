Introduction of the District of Columbia Special Elections Home Rule Act


Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia  Special Elections Home Rule Act. This bill would give the District of  Columbia complete authority to set the date of special elections for  local offices, like other jurisdictions. This bill would remove a  limitation on D.C. that is not only inconsistent with the purpose of  the D.C. Home Rule Act, which is to grant D.C. self-government, but is  also harmful.

In 2012, I got legislation enacted that gave the D.C. Board of  Elections (Board) more flexibility to set the date of special elections  for local offices. Although I sought complete authority for D.C. to set  the date of special elections, the 2012 law did not include this home- rule principle.

The Home Rule Act originally required the Board to hold special  elections on the first Tuesday occurring more than 114 days after a  vacancy and allowed the Board to schedule special elections on the same  day as the next general election if that election occurred within 60  days from when a special election would otherwise have been held. This  inflexibility led to special elections being held on religious holidays  and forced D.C. to hold a special election separate from an upcoming  general election, costing D.C. hundreds of thousands of dollars. The  2012 law requires the Board to hold a special election on a Tuesday  occurring between 70 and 174 days after a vacancy. I urge my colleagues  to support this bill.
