Introduction of the District of Columbia Board of Zoning Adjustment Home Rule Act


Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia  Board of Zoning Adjustment Home Rule Act. This bill would give the  District of Columbia the authority to appoint the members of the D.C.  Board of Zoning Adjustment (Board), except when the Board is performing  functions regarding an application by a foreign mission with respect to  a chancery. The Board issues special exceptions, or variances, to the  regulations issued by the D.C. Zoning Commission (Commission). The  Board has no authority over federal property. This bill would not alter  the authority of the Board.

Under current law, in general, the Board consists of a representative  each from the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), which is a  federal agency, and the Commission, each of whom may be a federal  official, and three appointees of the D.C. Mayor, subject to D.C.  Council approval.

Under current law, when the Board is performing functions regarding  an application by a foreign mission with respect to the location,  expansion or replacement of a chancery, the Board consists of the  Executive Director of NCPC, the Director of the National Park Service  (or, if the President so designates, the Secretary of Defense, the  Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of General Services) and  the three mayoral appointees. This bill would not change this  composition.

D.C., like every other jurisdiction in the United States, should be  free to set its own local land-use policies. This bill is an important  step to increase home rule for D.C. I urge my colleagues to support it.
