Introduction of the Commission of Fine Arts District of Columbia Home Rule Act


Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the Commission of Fine  Arts District of Columbia Home Rule Act. This bill would remove the  authority of the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) over non-federal real  property in the District of Columbia.

Under presidential executive orders (EOs) and federal law, the CFA  has review authority for D.C.-owned parks and buildings, as well as for  certain private land in D.C. Under EOs, the CFA has review authority  for the design of D.C.-owned parks and buildings. Under the Shipstead- Luce Act, the CFA has review authority for the design of private  buildings in D.C. ``adjacent to public buildings and grounds of major  importance,'' such as Rock Creek Park and the Potomac riverfront. Under  the Old Georgetown Act, the CFA has review authority for the design of  private buildings in the part of Georgetown referred to as ``Old  Georgetown'' in the act.

The federal government, including the CFA, whose members are  appointed by the President, should not have any authority over D.C.  land-use policies and decisions unrelated to the federal presence. Not  only is the federal government's authority over D.C. buildings and  private property a violation of home rule, it also delays and increases  the cost of public and private development in D.C.

This bill is an important step to increase home rule for D.C. I urge  my colleagues to support it.
