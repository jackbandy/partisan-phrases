Services Committee


Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Phil  MacNaughton for his many years of dedicated service to the House Armed  Services Committee.

After 17 years, this is Phil's last week on the committee. Phil  joined the committee staff in 2009 and has been the Democratic lead for  the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee since 2011. He has made  indispensable contributions to the committee's work and the security of  our Nation, spearheading reforms to improve safety, readiness, and  effectiveness of naval forces; laying the legislative foundations for  the landmark AUKUS agreement; collaborating with the defense industrial  base to strengthen our submarine and shipbuilding capacity and  workforce; working tirelessly to ensure our Sailors and Marines had the  necessary authorities, weapon systems, and capabilities; and leading  efforts to secure the most significant acquisition reforms in a  generation. Phil exemplifies the qualities of the best professional  staff members--bipartisan, collaborative, deeply knowledgeable,  politically astute on legislative and executive branch politics; and  committed to working diligently with Members on both sides of the aisle  to achieve the best outcome. He has modeled the virtues of service,  leadership, and dedication.

Phil's outstanding work on the House Armed Services Committee is but  one chapter in a lifetime of remarkable service to our Nation. Phil  graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2000, serving on active duty  until 2009 and continuing to serve in the U.S. Navy Reserves until  2021, retiring at the rank of Commander.

It has been a privilege working with Phil, and I thank him for his  service to the House Armed Services Committee. His departure will be  deeply felt, and I wish Phil and his family the best as they embark on  this new chapter.
