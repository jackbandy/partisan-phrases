Recognizing William ``bill'' Leonard Chin, Former Cathay Post No. 186 Commander and World War II Veteran


Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize William  ``Bill'' Leonard Chin for his many years of dedication to our country,  both through his military service and active involvement within the  Seattle Chinese-American and Veterans communities.

Bill valiantly served during World War II in the U.S. Army with the  93rd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron in the Central European Campaign  and the Battle of Rhineland, and his dedication to service continued  long after his active military duty. Upon graduating from Seattle  University, Bill pursued a career as an accountant at Boeing and then  as a life and health insurance broker, where he spent over 50 years  serving numerous clients in the Seattle Chinese community. He displayed  exemplary work ethic and was widely known for his willingness to help  others.

Outside of his career, Bill carried this same unceasing devotion to  serving those around him. He played an instrumental role in creating  the Oriental Restaurant Association in 1970, which provided a  healthcare plan for Chinese restaurant workers. He was also a committed  member of Cathay Post No. 186, where he served as Commander and  contributed to fundraising efforts for the Kin On Nursing Home and  youth scholarships. Additionally, Bill served as the English secretary  for the Gee How Oak Tin Family Association and the Bing Kung  Association, and as an officer of the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce. He  left a resounding impact on all those around him and was a true leader  of the various communities he was part of.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Bill Chin for a lifetime of service to the  United States of America and to his community. I am deeply grateful for  his important efforts towards protecting our country, advancing  healthcare access, and fostering connection. His legacy will not be  forgotten.
