Recognizing the Pew Charitable Trusts


Mr. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor The Pew  Charitable Trusts, an incredible organization that is focused on  improving and invigorating civic life. Founded in 1948, The Pew  Charitable Trusts has been advancing solutions to societal challenges  for 77 years, and I know that the Philadelphia community has benefited  immensely from this important work.

Founder Joseph Newton Pew and his wife, Mary Anderson Pew initially  focused their philanthropic work on anonymously providing grants to  priorities such as cancer research, the Red Cross, and a pioneering  project to assist historically Black colleges. Over the years, this  institution has evolved into a much more expansive enterprise, allowing  flexibility to engage in a variety of community issues and inform the  public on responsible governance.

A tireless champion for social good, The Pew Charitable Trust has  remained committed to the civic life of Philadelphia and the importance  of an informed democracy. This endeavor, inspired by Joseph Newton  Pew's vision, stands as a testament to this organization's enduring  impact on our city.

Mr. Speaker, in recognition of their unwavering commitment to serving  others, we honor The Pew Charitable Trust.
