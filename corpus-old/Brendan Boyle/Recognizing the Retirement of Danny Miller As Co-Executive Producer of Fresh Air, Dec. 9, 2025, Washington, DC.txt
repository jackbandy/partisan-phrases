Recognizing the Retirement of Danny Miller As Co-Executive Producer of Fresh Air


Mr. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Danny Miller on his retirement as Co-Executive Producer for WHYY's  Fresh Air with Terry Gross & Tonya Mosely, one of the most successful  national public radio shows in the Nation.

Miller, who joined the Fresh Air team in 1978 as an intern, has been  an integral part of the show's tremendous growth, now reaching over 6  million weekly listeners across 138 different countries. Miller's  leadership and judgement is apparent in the more than 20,000 segments  he helped produce. This expertise was especially critical as he led the  program through unprecedented periods of technological transition.

Thanks in large part to Miller, Fresh Air has become a tremendous  success, with two Peabody Awards under its belt and recognition as one  of TIME Magazine's top 100 podcasts ever. Miller's indispensable  relationship with Terry Gross, the show's host, has laid the foundation  for Fresh Air 's characteristic sound and production style, enabling  the program to reach its current levels of recognition.

Under Miller's creative watch, Fresh Air has accumulated an extremely  impressive list of guests across all industries, including Johnny Cash,  Maya Angelou, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Robin Williams. Without Miller's  intellectual curiosity, detailed nature, and vigorous collaboration,  none of this would be possible.

Mr. Speaker, it is altogether fitting that the House recognizes Danny  Miller for his exceptional career and congratulates him on his well- deserved retirement.
