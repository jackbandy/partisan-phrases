Welcoming the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, D.C.


Mr. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome His  All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to our Nation's Capital  and to recognize him for his acceptance of the distinguished Templeton  Prize.

Born Demetrios Arhondonis in 1940, His All-Holiness Bartholomew  completed his undergraduate studies at the historic Theological School  of Halki. He would also pursue graduate degrees in Italy, Switzerland,  Germany, and Greece. Before being ordained to the Diaconate in 1961 and  to the Priesthood in 1969, he was a founding member of the Society of  Canon Law of the Oriental Churches.

The Ecumenical Patriarch served as Assistant Dean at the Theological  School of Halki from 1968 to 1972 before his appointment as Personal  Secretary to the late Ecumenical Patriarch Demetrios. In 1973, he was  elected as Metropolitan of Philadelphia and, in 1990, Metropolitan of  Chalcedon. Finally, he was elected in October of 1991 as the 270th  Archbishop of the 2000-year-old Church founded by the Apostle Andrew.

As the spiritual leader to 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide,  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is known as a transnational  figure who has focused on organizing international and interfaith peace  conferences, challenging racism and religious fundamentalism, and  promoting religious freedom and human rights. He is also seen as a  global leader in championing environmental stewardship and has  organized several international summits to address ecological issues.  His accolades include a Congressional Gold Medal in 1997, recognition  from The Guardian as one of the world's leaders in raising  environmental awareness, and recognition from Time Magazine as one of  the world's most influential people.

Mr. Speaker, it's my privilege to welcome the Ecumenical Patriarch to  Washington, D.C. and to congratulate him on his receiving such an  esteemed award in the Templeton Prize.
