Recognizing Lagrange College Panthers and the Point University Skyhawks


Mr. JACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the dawn of a new  college football rivalry in the great State of Georgia: the clash of  Highway 29 between the LaGrange College Panthers and the Point  University Skyhawks.

On Saturday, September 6, these two incredible institutions will meet  on the gridiron for the very first time. Both schools call Troup County  home, right in the heart of Georgia's Third Congressional District and  less than 1 hour away from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International  Airport.

Founded in 1831, LaGrange College is the oldest private college in  Georgia, and its vision is to be an innovative institution,  holistically educating students to connect with and contribute to an  ever-changing world.

Competing in NCAA Division III, its athletic program has won national  and conference championships in baseball, basketball, golf, soccer, and  softball, instilling excellence and pride across generations of  Panthers.

Point University was originally founded as Atlanta Christian College  in 1937, and its mission is to educate and equip students for Christ- centered service and leadership throughout the world.

For three consecutive years, Point has been recognized as an NAIA  Champion of Character Five-Star Institution, a designation that honors  their commitment to integrity, respect, and servant leadership.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize the newest college football  rivalry in the great State of Georgia, and I encourage you and all of  my colleagues to tune in on Saturday night and watch the clash of  Highway 29 between the LaGrange College Panthers and the Point  University Skyhawks.
