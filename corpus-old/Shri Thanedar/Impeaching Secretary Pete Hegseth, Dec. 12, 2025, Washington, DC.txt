Impeaching Secretary Pete Hegseth


Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, this week, I introduced articles to  impeach Secretary Pete Hegseth for murder and conspiracy to murder and  reckless and unlawful mishandling of classified information.

From issuing orders to kill everybody onboard a small boat with no  evidence of any wrongdoing to launching a follow-up strike to finish  off survivors barely clinging onto life, his actions are not just  reprehensible but illegal as well.

He also put the lives of our own troops in danger by leaking  classified war plans in an unauthorized Signal chat. Former military  attorneys have come out and asserted that his actions have risen to the  level of war crimes.

Mr. Hegseth must resign from his position or be impeached by this  House.
