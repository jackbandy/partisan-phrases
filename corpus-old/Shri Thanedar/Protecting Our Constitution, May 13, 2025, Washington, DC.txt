Protecting Our Constitution


Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, when I was sworn into office, I took an  oath to protect the Constitution of this great Nation.

I am an immigrant who came to this country with just $20 in my  pocket. The United States has given me so much. I love America, and I  will do anything to protect our Constitution and our democratic values.

Donald J. Trump has been committing crimes since day one: bribery,  corruption, taking power from Congress, creating an unlawful office in  DOGE, violating First Amendment rights, ignoring due process, and  finally refusing to abide by a unanimous Supreme Court ruling.

Just as I stand here in the House of Representatives, Mr. Trump is  traveling to the Middle East to accept a gift worth $400 million from a  foreign government.

I have spoken with Americans all over the country.
