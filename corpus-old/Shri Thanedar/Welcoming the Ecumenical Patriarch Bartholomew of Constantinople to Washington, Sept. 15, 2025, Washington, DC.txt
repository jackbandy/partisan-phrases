Welcoming the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople to Washington, D.C.


Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Ecumenical  Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, the leader for Orthodox  Christianity worldwide, who is here in Washington, D.C. after accepting  the distinguished Templeton Prize earlier this year.

The Templeton Prize is awarded to those who demonstrate exemplary  philanthropic contributions. His relentless leadership has been  recognized by a variety of organizations such as the United Nations,  UNESCO, and the World Economic Forum. He has also dedicated his time  serving on the Executive and Central Committees and Faith and Order  Commission of the World Council of Churches.

Patriarch Bartholomew has a focus on creating advocacy for  environmental issues and in his time launched a series of initiatives  to help start conversations worldwide. Among these initiatives were a  variety of trips with political leaders and accredited scientists  discussing issues such as water pollution in the Black Sea, for which  he went on to receive Norway's Sophie prize in 2002.

Michigan's 13th Congressional District has a beautiful community of  Greek Orthodox constituents at St. George Greek Orthodox Church and  Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral. They continuously work to create  welcoming spaces in our community by hosting celebrations such as  festivals, luncheons, and more. I am honored to keep my constituents in  mind as we welcome Patriarch Bartholomew in Washington, D.C.
