Strengthening America's Turning Point Act


Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1550 redesignates Saratoga  National Historical Park as the Saratoga National Battlefield Park.

The site in Stillwater, New York, marks the location of a critical  pair of battles known as the turning point of the American  Revolutionary War.

American forces defeated the British in the Battle of Saratoga in  October 1777, which the National Park Service notes renewed the  patriots' hope for independence and helped secure foreign recognition  and support for the American Revolution.

This truly was a turning point that helped invigorate the fight for  our independence.

As a testament to the importance of this monument, Congress has on  permanent display in the Capitol rotunda, just steps away from here and  to the left of the monument of three great suffragists, a famous oil  painting by John Trumbull of the surrender of the British General  Burgoyne at Saratoga.

The State of New York began efforts to preserve the battlefield in  1927, establishing a park known as the Saratoga Battlefield Park.  However, the site's name changed to the Saratoga National Historical  Park when Congress designated it as part of the National Park System in  1938.

Today's bill would restore the use of the term ``battlefield'' in the  park's name to reflect the site's significance in the American  Revolution. This is a fitting tribute as we prepare for next year's  250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
