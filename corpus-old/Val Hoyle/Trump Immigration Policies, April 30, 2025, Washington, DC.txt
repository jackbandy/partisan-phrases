Trump Immigration Policies


Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, when we took office, we swore an oath to support and  defend the Constitution. It was a promise to the American people that  we would uphold the law, protect their rights, and defend our  democracy.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was living legally in the United States,  was wrongfully disappeared to a horrific prison in El Salvador because  of an administrative error.

This week, U.S. citizens in Oklahoma were dragged out of their home  while ICE agents, with no warrant for them, took their phones, laptops,  and life savings, even though they weren't the suspects in question.

One of the most basic rights guaranteed in our Constitution is the  right to due process. The Due Process Clause in the Fifth Amendment and  14th Amendment demands that you cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or  property without the due process of law. That means a fair hearing, a  chance to be heard, and a chance to defend yourself in court. That is  the standard.

Mr. Speaker, our immigration system is broken, and I will work with  anyone in a bipartisan way to fix it. Yet, that is not what is  happening here.

Weaponizing fears and frustrations as a justification for interning  innocent people in a foreign prison is unacceptable and  unconstitutional. Everyone deserves due process in court with evidence  beyond a reasonable doubt. If we don't defend these rights now, who is  next: our neighbor, our family, or us?

Affording due process is not being soft on crime. It is the very  foundation of American justice to ensure that the rights enshrined in  our Constitution are guaranteed, as the Founders intended. Standing up  for the Constitution is not partisan. It is patriotic. It is our duty,  and we need to do it.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.
