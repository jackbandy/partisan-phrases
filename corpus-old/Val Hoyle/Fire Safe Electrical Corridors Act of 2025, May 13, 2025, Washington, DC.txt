Fire Safe Electrical Corridors Act of 2025


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2492, the Fire Safe Electrical  Corridors Act of 2025, introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr.  Carbajal).

This bill would authorize the Secretaries of Agriculture and the  Interior to permit electrical utilities to remove trees and vegetation  near power lines on National Forest System and Bureau of Land  Management lands without the need for a timber sale.

This bill addresses a critical public safety issue, preventing  wildfires caused by overgrown vegetation near electrical  infrastructure, particularly in high-risk areas of the West.

Current requirements for timber sales can delay essential maintenance  and fire prevention efforts. This legislation would streamline that  process while maintaining environmental safeguards under existing land  management plans and Federal law.

Importantly, the bill would ensure taxpayer fairness. If utilities  sell any of the removed material, they must return the net proceeds to  the Federal Government. Altogether, this bill provides a commonsense,  bipartisan solution to reduce wildfire risk, improve grid safety, and  enhance coordination between Federal land managers and utility  providers.

The bill respects environmental protections, avoids unnecessary  bureaucracy, and promotes responsible land stewardship. I thank  Representative Carbajal for his hard work on this bill. It will support  community safety in his district and throughout the country.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
