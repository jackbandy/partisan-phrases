Recognizing Jennifer Denson


Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a member of our  community doing incredible work to combat hunger in Eugene: Jennifer  Denton.

Since 2015, she has led as executive director of Burrito Brigade, a  volunteer-driven nonprofit that has hand-delivered hundreds of  thousands of warm, nutritious meals to hungry people across Eugene and  Springfield. She also created Free Little Pantries, giving neighbors a  way to share food directly with those in need.

During COVID, she launched Waste to Taste, a free, no-questions-asked  grocery store that now serves more than a thousand families each month.

Time and time again, Ms. Denson has stepped up to serve our most  vulnerable neighbors. Her grassroots work has touched thousands of  Oregonians and should serve as an inspiration to all of us.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Jennifer for her contributions and am grateful  to have her in our community.
