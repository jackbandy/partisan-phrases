Wetlands Conservation and Access Improvement Act of 2025


The Wetlands Conservation and Access Improvement Act of 2025 would  extend critical wetlands conservation funding through 2033.

Many of my constituents live and breathe wetlands conservation.  Whether you are a duck hunter on the river or a birder exploring the  coastal marshes or a family counting on clean water and flood  protection, wetlands deliver for everyone.

Since 1937, the Pittman-Robertson Act has created successful  conservation models where hunters and sportsmen support wildlife  restoration through excise taxes on firearms, ammunition, and archery  equipment.

Currently, the interest earned from these funds supports wetlands  protection through 2026, and this bill ensures that funding continues  uninterrupted through 2033.

This is conservation funding that works. It is user funded, results  driven, and focuses on protecting habitats that benefit all Americans.  The North American Wetlands Conservation Act has helped to protect  millions of acres of wetlands and grasslands across North America.

I commend Representatives Hurd and Elfreth for their bipartisan  leadership in advancing this proven funding mechanism and ensuring that  future generations inherit healthy wetlands and thriving wildlife.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this really great legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
