Free Iran


Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of a free Iran  and in solidarity with the women that are leading that fight. These  women are asking for basic human dignity, the right to live without  fear, to speak freely, and to make decisions about their own lives.

For too long they have been silenced, imprisoned, and even killed for  demanding those very freedoms, but they still courageously protest and  persist.

They are fighting not just for themselves but for their daughters and  their families, so the next generation can grow up with hope instead of  fear and opportunities instead of oppression.

In America, we believe freedom should not depend on your gender, your  religion, or where you were born. No government should be able to  control a woman's body or take away her voice or determine her future,  not here nor in Iran.

In Oregon, where thousands of families with Iranian roots have built  their lives, we understand that their fight for freedom is not distant.  It lives right here in our own communities.

The people of Iran deserve a future without fear, a future with free  speech, free assembly, and the right to choose their own leaders and  their own path.

I stand with the women of Iran. I stand with their courage. I will  continue fighting for a future where every person in Iran can live  free, speak freely, and dream without fear.
