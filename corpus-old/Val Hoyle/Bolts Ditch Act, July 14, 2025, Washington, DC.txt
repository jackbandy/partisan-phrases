Bolts Ditch Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1729, the Bolts Ditch Act,  introduced by my colleague and good friend from Colorado (Mr. Neguse).

Mr. Speaker, the Bolts Ditch Headgate and ditch segment are located  within the Holy Cross Wilderness in Colorado's White River National  Forest. This infrastructure is essential for delivering water to the  Bolts Lake Reservoir, supporting water supply needs and economic  development in Eagle County.

Mr. Speaker, to balance the protection of the wilderness area with  the continued operation of Bolts Ditch, Congress previously authorized  the town of Minturn access to use, maintain, and repair the headgate  and ditch under the John Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and  Recreation Act.

The Bolts Ditch Act would expand this authority to the Eagle River  Water and Sanitation District and the Upper Eagle Regional Water  Authority as eligible entities.

Under this new authority, they would be eligible to receive a permit  from the Secretary of Agriculture for nonmotorized access to use,  maintain, and repair Bolts Ditch Headgate and 450 feet of Bolts Ditch.

Representative Neguse's legislation would ensure continued access to  critical water infrastructure, and promote efficient regional water  supply management while protecting the wilderness area.

It would also support higher in-stream flows for Cross Creek, reduce  energy consumption, and foster long-term economic benefits for Eagle  County. This is a priority for this community, and I thank  Representative Neguse for his hard work and leadership.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
