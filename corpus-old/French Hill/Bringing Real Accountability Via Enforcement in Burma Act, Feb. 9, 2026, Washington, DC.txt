Bringing Real Accountability Via Enforcement in Burma Act


Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3190) to amend the Burma Unified through Rigorous  Military Accountability Act of 2022 to extend the sunset, to require a  determination with respect to the imposition of sanctions on certain  persons of Burma, and for other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3190

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Bringing Real Accountability       Via Enforcement in Burma Act'' or the ``BRAVE Burma Act''       SEC. 2. MODIFICATIONS TO REPORTING REQUIREMENT.

Section 5571(e) of the James M. Inhofe National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (22 U.S.C. 10222(e))       is amended to read as follows:

``(e) Assessment and Report on Sanctions With Respect to       Burmese Persons.--

``(1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 7       years, the President shall determine whether the following       persons meet the criteria for sanctions described under       subsection (a) or under Executive Order 14014 (86 Fed. Reg.       9429; relating to blocking property with respect to the       situation in Burma):

``(A) Any Burmese state-owned enterprise described in       subsection (c)(1).

``(B) Myanma Economic Bank.

``(C) Any foreign person that the President determines       operates in the jet fuel sector of the Burmese economy,       including through activities such as the provision of       financial services or the importation, exportation,       reexportation, sale, supply, trade, storage, or transport,       directly or indirectly, of jet fuel in Burma.

``(2) Report required.--Upon making the determination       required by paragraph (1), the President shall submit to the       appropriate congressional committees a report on the       assessment.

``(3) Form of report.--The report required by paragraph (2)       shall be submitted in unclassified form but may include a       classified annex.''.       SEC. 3. LIMITATION OF SHAREHOLDING BENEFITTING THE STATE                     ADMINISTRATION COUNCIL OF BURMA.

(a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall       instruct the United States Executive Director at the       International Monetary Fund to use the voice and vote of the       United States, when assessing potential changes to any       shareholding formula in connection with a governance review       of the Fund, to limit, as appropriate, an increase to the       shareholding of Burma if the country is subject to the rule       of the State Administration Council.

(b) Waiver.--The President of the United States may waive       the application of subsection (a) upon certifying to the       Committee on Financial Services of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the       Senate that the waiver is important to the national interest       of the United States, with a detailed explanation of the       reasons therefor.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our vice chairman, Mr.  Huizenga's bill, the BRAVE Burma Act. The vice chairman is also a  senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Burma has been plagued with an ongoing humanitarian crisis for far  too long. The Burmese people have been the victims of genocide as a  direct result of the military junta's use of funds that fuel these  abhorrent acts.

The bill introduced by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga)  addresses this crisis head-on. H.R. 3190 requires the Treasury  Secretary to limit any increase in Myanmar's influence at the  International Monetary Fund, or IMF, so long as it is governed by the  military dictatorship.

This bill also requires the President to annually determine whether  the United States should impose stronger sanctions on the Myanma Oil  and Gas Enterprise, their economic bank, and any foreigners working in  the jet fuel sector of the Burmese economy.

I commend the vice chairman for his hard work and leadership in  fighting for the humanitarian rights in Burma by cutting off the source  of the funding that is empowering these human rights travesties.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO  estimate for this bill.   H.R. 3190, BRINGING REAL ACCOUNTABILITY VIA ENFORCEMENT IN BURMA ACT AS REPORTED BY THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES ON OCTOBER 3, 2025 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                           By fiscal year, millions of                                                    dollars--                                      -----------------------------------                                          2026      2026-2030   2026-2035 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Direct Spending (Outlays)...........          *           *           * Revenues............................          *           *           * Increase or Decrease (-) in the               *           *           *  Deficit............................ Spending Subject to Appropriation             *           *           *  (Outlays).......................... ------------------------------------------------------------------------  * = between -$500,000 and $500,000.

Increases net direct spending in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036? < $2.5       billion.

Increases on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive       10-year periods beginning in 2036? No.

Statutory pay-as-you-go procedures apply? Yes.

Mandate Effects:

Contains intergovernmental mandate? No.

Contains private-sector mandate? No.

H.R. 3190 would require the Administration to annually       determine whether people or entities connected to the state-      owned enterprises in Burma or certain sectors of the Burmese       economy meet the criteria for sanctions under Executive Order       14014. The bill would require the Administration to report on       its determinations. The bill also would require the United       States Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund       to advocate against increases in shareholding for Burma while       the country is under the control of the State Administrative       Council.

Under current law, the Administration can impose sanctions       on individuals and entities that undermine democracy and       peace. Those sanctions include denying visas and blocking       some asset and property transactions for certain people who       have undermined democratic institutions and peace in Burma.       H.R. 3190 does not require the imposition of sanctions or       expand the types of sanctions that could be imposed. If       enacting the bill leads the Administration to broaden those       sanctions, more people would be denied visas by the       Department of State, resulting in an insignificant decrease       in revenues from visa fees. Although most visa fees are       retained by the Department of State and spent, some       collections are deposited into the Treasury as revenues.       Denying foreign nationals entry into the United States also       would reduce direct spending on federal benefits (emergency       Medicaid or federal subsidies for health insurance, for       example) for which those people might otherwise be eligible.

As a result of the determinations required by the bill,       transactions involving certain assets either in the United       States or under the control of people or entities in the       United States could be blocked. Any person or entity       violating those prohibitions would be subject to civil or       criminal monetary penalties. Such penalties are recorded as       revenues, and a portion can be spent without further       appropriation.

On the basis of data about similar sanctions, CBO estimates       that any additional sanctions resulting from the bill would       affect a small number of people. Thus, enacting H.R. 3190       would have insignificant effects on revenues and direct       spending, and would, on net, reduce deficits by less than       $500,000 over the 2026-2035 period.

On the basis of information about the costs of similar       reporting requirements and on diplomatic efforts to influence       the actions of       other nations and international organizations, CBO estimates       that the reporting and advocacy required by the bill would       cost less than $500,000 over the 2026-2030 period. Such       spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated       funds.

The estimate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy       Director of Budget Analysis.                                                 Phillip L.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for his dedicated  work on our committee, as well as the Committee on Foreign Affairs, in  crafting economic deterrence to bad actors--certainly, the military  junta in Myanmar is a bad actor--calling loudly for a strong bipartisan  vote in this House on the BRAVE Burma Act, which I hope then will be  promptly considered by the Senate.

This is when the legislative branch and the executive branch work  best together, when we are in alignment on putting pressure against bad  actors around the world.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for his work. I urge  a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.
