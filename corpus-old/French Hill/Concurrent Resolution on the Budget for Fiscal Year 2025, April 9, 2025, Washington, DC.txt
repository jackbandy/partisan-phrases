Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for kindly  yielding to me.

Mr. Speaker, the policies of the Biden-Harris administration crushed  the spirit of the American people under the weight of rising costs from  a 40-year high inflation, open borders, uncertain futures, and spending  an avalanche on Biden's Big Government spending priorities that have  saddled us with an annual deficit of $2 trillion.

The resolution before us today offers a path forward to rein in  wasteful spending and put our Nation on a responsible and sustainable  fiscal path. It reflects the commitment to the American people that  would secure a better future for all of us.

This resolution secures the opportunity for tax cuts for hardworking  American families and small businesses. It reins in the regulatory  overreach that has long stifled our economic growth. It roots out  waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal budget.

It is simply common sense that we focus on fiscal responsibility and  rein in wasteful spending to which Washington has become so addicted.

Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my House colleagues,  Chairman Arrington, and the Members of this body to accomplish the  President's goals by way of this reconciliation measure.
