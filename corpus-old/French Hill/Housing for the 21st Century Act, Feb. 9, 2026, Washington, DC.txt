``(ii) Maximum cost to the deposit insurance fund.--Not       later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this       subparagraph, the Corporation, by rule, shall establish       criteria for determining on a case-by-case basis the maximum       allowable cost against the net worth of the Deposit Insurance       Fund that may be utilized to account for any determination       under clause (i).

``(iv) Report to congress.--Not later than 30 days after       selecting an alternative described in clause (i), the       Corporation shall issue a report to the Committee on       Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the       Senate containing an analysis of the economic difference       between the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund of the       selected alternative and the cost to the Deposit Insurance       Fund of the least costly alternative that would have been       selected absent the application of this subparagraph.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support today of our collaborative and  bipartisan bill titled: ``Housing for the 21st Century Act.''

Americans across our Nation have faced the tough reality of out-of- control costs because of the recent spike in inflation coming out of  the pandemic.

President Trump has prioritized addressing affordability, and the  Financial Services Committee has been working on solutions in our  Committee's area of jurisdiction.

Alongside Ranking Member Waters, Chairman Flood of our Housing and  Insurance Subcommittee, and Ranking Member Cleaver of our Housing and  Insurance Subcommittee, together, we have introduced the Housing for  the 21st Century Act to deliver a straightforward approach to housing.  This includes building more homes and removing barriers standing in the  way with an eye towards driving down that marginal cost of a new unit.

Mr. Speaker, the Housing for the 21st Century Act will streamline  approvals and simplify the Federal and local housing process to give  rural and urban communities the tools they need to build homes faster.  Importantly, our bill helps banks access stable deposit funding. It  streamlines the exam process that is tailored particularly for our  vital community banks. It helps promote more community banks to do what  they do best, which is lend locally and support their communities.

I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, that on this House floor all of  us know that without our community banks and without vigorous lending,  homes don't get built. Our communities and regional banks play a key  role in that housing construction ecosystem.

When there are not enough homes, prices go up. The Housing for the  21st Century Act includes real bipartisan solutions to expand supply,  lower costs, and, more importantly, give our families more options.

Let's deliver this real solution and return the housing market back  to working for the very people that it should serve, the very people we  do serve in the people's House.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas.  I include in the Record the CBO estimate for this bill.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, from Los Angeles, California, to  the capital city of Little Rock, Arkansas, I have heard directly, Mr.  Cleaver has heard directly from Kansas City, and other Members hear  directly about what is wrong at HUD. We are asked about how we can  improve these programs and make them work for the American people and  how they can have more accountability and more effectiveness for the  taxpayer dollars that are expended.

That is at the heart of the work that Mr. Cleaver and Mr. Flood have  done, as I say, benefiting a big city like the Los Angeles Basin all  the way to a capital city like Little Rock, Arkansas, and certainly to  Lincoln, Nebraska.

I am so pleased to have the leadership of the gentleman from Nebraska  (Mr. Flood), who serves as the chair in this Congress of the Housing  and Insurance Subcommittee. Mr. Flood has spent a lot of time working  with Mr. Cleaver to do exactly that: How to make these programs more  effective for the American people.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cleaver for his work with Mr. Flood on this  bill and his leadership in trying to find bipartisan solutions.

Mr. Speaker, I met last week with the community development folks  from Little Rock, Arkansas. Kevin Howard, my friend who runs Housing  and Community Development for the city of Little Rock, was in, singing  the praises of this bill of how it will make their work so much more  effective were the 21st century housing proposal enacted into law  today.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a link to a list of over 70  organizations that support this bill being enacted: https:// financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work of my friend from Illinois on this  bill, the important work he has done both in the housing portion and on  the work we have done together on nonbank designations. I appreciate  his leadership.

Mr. Speaker, he mentioned the importance of community banks, from  Texas to California, Arkansas, and across this country. The reason why  it is so important to link housing and lowering housing cost policies,  these HUD-related policies, to banking is because our banks under $10  billion, Mr. Speaker, make about 60 percent of all the home  construction loans in our country.

Therefore, that is why the ranking member and I, and our committee,  have chosen to come to this House floor to talk about some specific  housing measures. I want to make sure that the American people know  that we know that the supply of housing has to be financed. Some 60  percent of that is done by our local community banks and credit unions  spread across this country.

De  La Cruz), the author of section 106 in this bill.

Ms. De La CRUZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 6644, the Housing for  the 21st Century Act, sponsored by Chairman Hill.

This legislation includes dozens of commonsense, bipartisan housing  solutions that meet the needs of the housing crisis that everyday  Americans are dealing with.

I am particularly proud to see three key provisions of mine included  to update the FHA's mortgage insurance loan limits for residential  multifamily construction to bring more homes on the market, ensure  veterans are made aware of the VA loan products they are eligible for,  and strengthen the coordination of our Federal housing agencies to  maximize the impact of our current Federal housing programs.

H.R. 6644 is a critical step toward putting our housing sector back  on the right footing, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Rose certainly talked about  cost savings due to the deregulatory nature of this bill, lowering  costs. All of us here know that we have learned in our committee work  that 25 percent of the price of a new home in America is due to  regulatory costs, State, local, and Federal. So, our bill has that as a  theme.

He has worked hard at making sure these improvements in the Housing for  the 21st Century Act fully apply to housing in rural areas, not just  urban areas.

Mr. Speaker, first, I have to say a big thank-you to Ranking Member  Waters; the ranking member of our subcommittee, Mr. Cleaver; and the  tireless leadership of  Mike Flood, the chair of our Subcommittee on  Housing and Insurance. They have collaborated for a year to bring these  proposals to the House floor today.

I reiterate that the linkage of housing and community banking is two  sides of the same coin that leads to a better outcome, more choice,  more accessibility, more affordability, and more housing choices for  the American people.

This bill also has important HUD oversight, which I think is critical  to make sure those who are tenants in HUD programs have the care,  oversight, and safe and sound conditions they deserve.

Mr. Speaker, I also thank the staff on both sides of the aisle for  their work in putting this bill together, particularly on the majority  side, Ed Skala and Maura Woosley, for their collaboration on the  banking provisions with their minority colleagues and the community  banking provisions.

I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to provide a ``yes'' vote  for this important banking and housing legislation.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
