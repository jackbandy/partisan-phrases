Small Entity Update Act


Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3382) to require the Securities and Exchange  Commission to carry out a study and rulemaking on the definition of the  term ``small entity'' under the securities laws for purposes of chapter  6 of title 5, United States Code, and for other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3382

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Small Entity Update Act''.       SEC. 2. STUDIES, REPORTS, AND RULES REGARDING SMALL ENTITIES.

(a) Definitions.--In this section--

(1) the term ``Commission'' means the Securities and       Exchange Commission; and

(2) the term ``small entity''--

(A) has the meaning given the term in section 601 of title       5, United States Code, with respect to the activities of the       Commission; and

(B) includes any definition established by the Commission       of the term ``small business'', ``small organization'',       ``small governmental jurisdiction'', or ``small entity''       under paragraph (3), (4), (5), or (6), respectively, of       section 601 of title 5, United States Code, with respect to       the activities of the Commission.

(b) Studies and Reports.--Not later than 1 year after the       date of enactment of this Act, and again 5 years thereafter,       the Commission shall--

(1) conduct a study of the definition of the term ``small       entity'' with respect to the activities of the Commission for       the purposes of chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code,       which shall consider--

(A) the extent to which the definition of the term ``small       entity'', as in effect during the period in which the study       is conducted, aligns with the findings and declarations made       under section 2(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5       U.S.C. 601 note);

(B) the amount by which financial markets in the United       States have grown since the last time the Commission amended       the definition of the term ``small entity'', if applicable;       and

(C) how the Commission should define the term ``small       entity'' to ensure that a meaningful number of entities would       fall under that definition; and

(2) submit to Congress a report that includes--

(A) the results of the applicable study conducted under       paragraph (1); and

(B) specific and detailed recommendations on the ways in       which the Commission could amend the definition of the term       ``small entity'' to--

(i) be consistent with the results described in       subparagraph (A); and

(ii) expand the number of entities covered by such       definition.

(c) Rulemaking.--Concurrently with, or after the completion       of, each study required under subsection (b), the Commission       shall, subject to public notice and comment, revise the rules       of the Commission consistent with the results of such study.

(d) Inflation Adjustments.--After the Commission issued the       final rule revisions required under subsection (c), and every       5 years thereafter, the Commission shall adjust any dollar       figures under the definition of small entity established by       the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price       Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of       Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, H.R. 3382, the  Small Entity Update Act.

Small businesses are the backbone of this country. Everyone on both  sides of the aisle knows that. They drive innovation and job creation  in our districts, but they are often limited from reaching their full  capacity or capability because of overregulation.

The bill introduced by our subcommittee chair, Ann Wagner, addresses  this challenge by directing the SEC to carry out a study and a  rulemaking to modernize the definition of a small entity and ensure  that small firms are given tailored, proportional oversight.

Mr. Speaker, years ago I had the privilege of serving as a  nonexecutive chairman for a small-cap public company board of  directors. I know firsthand the critical need for attention for what we  are dealing with here today.

The bipartisan bill of the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner)  will empower our small businesses to focus on growth, hiring, and  innovation, rather than unnecessary red tape.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO  estimate on this bill.    H.R. 3382, SMALL ENTITY UPDATE ACT, AS REPORTED BY THE HOUSE COMMITTEE                   ON FINANCIAL SERVICES ON JUNE 3, 2025 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                            By fiscal year, millions  of                                                      dollars--                                          -------------------------------                                             2025    2025-2030  2025-2035 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Direct Spending (Outlays)...............        0          0          0 Revenues................................        0          0          0 Increase or Decrease (-) in the Deficit.        0          0          0 Spending Subject to Appropriation               *          *         **  (Outlays).............................. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ * = between -$500,000 and $500,000. ** = not estimated.

Increases net direct spending in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036? No.

Increases on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive       10-year periods beginning in 2036? No.

Statutory pay-as-you-go procedures apply? No.

Mandate Effects:

Contains intergovernmental mandate? No.

Contains private-sector mandate? Yes, Under Threshold.

H.R. 3382 would require the Securities and Exchange       Commission (SEC) to study its current definition of ``small       entity'' under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and       revise its rules based on the results of the study. Under       current law, agencies subject to the RFA need to determine if       their rules have a significant economic effect on small       entities, including businesses, nonprofit organizations, and       governmental jurisdictions. If so, agencies must consider       alternatives that minimize that effect.

Using information about the cost of similar provisions, CBO       estimates that implementing the bill would cost $2 million       over the 2025-2030 period. CBO expects that the SEC would       need about five employees, at an average annual cost of       $330,000 for each employee, to carry out the study and amend       the rules. Because the SEC is authorized to collect fees each       year to offset its annual appropriation, CBO expects that the       net effect on discretionary spending over the 2025-2030       period would be negligible, assuming appropriation actions       consistent with that authority.

If the SEC increases fees to offset the costs associated       with implementing the bill, H.R. 3382 would increase the cost       of an existing mandate on private entities required to pay       those assessments. CBO estimates that the incremental cost of       the mandate would be small and would fall well below the       threshold established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act       (UMRA) for private-sector mandates ($206 million in 2025,       adjusted annually for inflation).

H.R. 3382 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined       in UMRA.

The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Aurora Swanson       (for federal costs) and Rachel Austin (for mandates). The       estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director       of Budget Analysis.                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                             Director, Congressional Budget Office.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of Mrs. Wagner's work. This is  exactly the kind of commonsense, bipartisan legislation that our  constituents expect us to pass. To lower costs and encourage companies  to be public is a good thing for our Nation. It will grow the economy  faster. Companies can go public sooner in their growth period.

Mr. Speaker, for all the reasons I have explained, I urge my  colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
