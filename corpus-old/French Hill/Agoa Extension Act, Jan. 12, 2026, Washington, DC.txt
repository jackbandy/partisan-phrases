Agoa Extension Act


Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6500,  the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Extension Act, introduced  by Chairman Jason Smith.

This bill reauthorizes the AGOA program--first established by  Congress in 2000. AGOA is a nonreciprocal U.S. trade preference program  that encourages trade and investment with sub-Saharan African  countries.

Economic benefits of AGOA include:

The bolstering of economic growth.

Promoted economic and political reform.

Improved U.S. economic relations in the sub-Saharan Africa region.

Diversified supply chains.

New markets for American goods and services.

Stronger and diversified American investments.

National security benefits of AGOA include:

Peace and stability in a region that our adversaries, such as China,  are trying to exploit.

An American presence in a region rich in critical minerals.

American values are being promoted abroad, resulting in governance  improvements that align sub-Saharan African nations with American  foreign policy.

AGOA greatly benefits our national security and economy. For those  reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6500.
