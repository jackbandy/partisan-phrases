Special Interest Alien Reporting Act of 2025


Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 275, the  Special Interest Alien Reporting Act.

This bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to publish  monthly reports on the number of special interest aliens attempting to  unlawfully enter the U.S., including specifications on the encounter  location and the alien's country of origin.

During President Biden's tenure, we saw an unprecedented number of  special interest aliens from China, Iran, and Russia.

A special interest alien is a person who poses as a potential threat  to the United States. This is alarming and a national security risk.

Last Congress, I asked the Biden Administration to be transparent  about encounters with known or unknown terrorists entering our country.  Their answers were unsatisfactory.

Publishing the number of special interest aliens who have been  granted entry to the U.S. would educate the public on the risks the  U.S. Government is subjecting its citizens to. It would also allow the  public to hold the government accountable for its actions.

Border Patrol had produced small iterations on this data for 2016 to  2018 and it would be helpful to re-start this publication at a more  frequent cadence.

I urge you to support H.R. 275.
