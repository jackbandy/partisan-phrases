Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act of 2025


Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3339) to require certification examinations for  accredited investors, and for other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3339

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Opportunity for All       Investors Act of 2025''.       SEC. 2. CERTIFICATION EXAMINATIONS FOR ACCREDITED INVESTORS.

(a) In General.--The Commission shall revise the definition       of ``accredited investor'' under Regulation D (section       230.500 et seq. of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations) to       include any natural person who is certified through the       examination required under subsection (b).

(b) Establishment of Examination.--Not later than 1 year       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission       shall establish an examination (including a test,       certification, or examination program)--

(1) to certify an individual as an accredited investor; and

(2) that--

(A) is designed with an appropriate level of difficulty       such that an individual with financial sophistication would       be unlikely to fail; and

(B) includes methods to determine whether an individual       seeking to be certified as an accredited investor       demonstrates competency with respect to--

(i) the different types of securities;

(ii) the disclosure requirements under the securities laws       applicable to issuers and offerings of securities exempt from       registration under section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 as       compared to issuers and offerings of securities subject to       such section 5;

(iii) corporate governance;

(iv) financial statements and the components of such       statements;

(v) aspects of unregistered securities, securities issued       by private companies, and investments into private funds,       including risks associated with--

(I) limited liquidity;

(II) limited disclosures;

(III) subjectivity and variability in valuations and the       analytical tools investors may use to assess such valuations;

(IV) information asymmetry;

(V) leverage risks;

(VI) concentration risk; and

(VII) longer investment horizons;

(vi) potential conflicts of interest, when the interests of       financial professionals and their clients are misaligned or       when their professional responsibilities may be in conflict       with financial motivations; and

(vii) such other criteria as the Commission determines       necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the       protection of investors.

(c) Administration.--Beginning not later than 180 days       after the date the examination is established under       subsection (b), such examination shall be administered and       offered free of charge to the public by a registered national       securities association under section 15A of the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-3).

(d) Commission Defined.--In this section, the term       ``Commission'' means the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3339, the Equal  Opportunity for All Investors Act.

The accredited investor definition is severely outdated. While its  intention is to protect investors, its overly broad definition excludes  millions of Americans who are experienced and knowledgeable enough to  invest in private markets.

Wealth alone should not be the sole determinant as to who can invest  in these markets. My friend from Nebraska, Representative Flood's bill,  provides a merit-based alternative by the establishment of an exam that  allows individuals to qualify as accredited investors by demonstrating  their understanding of investments and private markets.

This is a smart, commonsense modernization of these outdated rules  that provides a meaningful step towards making private markets more  accessible.

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I include in the record the CBO  estimate for this bill.   H.R. 3339, EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL INVESTORS ACT OF 2025, AS REPORTED

BY THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES ON JUNE 3, 2025 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                            By fiscal year, millions  of                                                      dollars--                                          -------------------------------                                             2025    2025-2030  2025-2035 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Direct Spending (Outlays)...............        0          0          0 Revenues................................        0          0          0 Increase or Decrease (-) in the Deficit.        0          0          0 Spending Subject to Appropriation               *          *         **  (Outlays).............................. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ * = between -$500,000 and $500,000. ** = not estimated.

Increases on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive       10-year periods beginning in 2036? No.

Statutory pay-as-you-go procedures apply? No.

Mandate Effects:

Contains intergovernmental mandate? No.

Contains private-sector mandate? Yes, Under Threshold.

H.R. 3339 would require the Securities and Exchange       Commission (SEC) to develop an exam and certify people who       pass as ``accredited investors,'' which would allow them to       make investments for which they are not currently eligible.       Under current law, accredited investors are defined as people       or entities with sufficient financial sophistication and       resources to sustain the risk of loss, including banks,       broker-dealers, and investment companies. Accredited       investors may participate in investment opportunities not       available to nonaccredited investors, such as purchasing       securities that are exempt from registration with the SEC.

Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates that       implementing H.R. 3339 would cost $1 million in both 2026 and       2027. CBO expects that the SEC would need three employees, at       an average annual cost of $330,000 for each employee, to       establish the examination and amend the current rules on       accredited investors. Because the SEC is authorized to       collect fees each year to offset its annual appropriation,       CBO expects that the net effect on discretionary spending       over the 2025-2030 period would be negligible, assuming       appropriation actions consistent with that authority.

If the SEC increases annual fees to offset the costs of       implementing provisions of H.R. 3339, it would increase the       costs of an existing private-sector mandate on entities       required to pay those fees. CBO estimates that the       incremental cost of the mandate would be small and would fall       well below the annual threshold established in the Unfunded       Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) for private-sector mandates ($206       million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation).

The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates.

The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Aurora Swanson       (for federal costs) and Rachel Austin (for mandates). The       estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director       of Budget Analysis.                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                             Director, Congressional Budget Office.

Mr. Speaker, for all the reasons that I have identified, changes need  to be made in the credit investor rule. After 40 years, I think the  changes proposed by the gentleman from Nebraska are solid.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
