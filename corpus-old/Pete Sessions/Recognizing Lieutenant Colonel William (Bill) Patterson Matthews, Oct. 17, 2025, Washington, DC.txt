Recognizing Lieutenant Colonel William (Bill) Patterson Matthews, Usa, Retired, with A Congressional Veteran Commendation


Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to present retired USA  Lieutenant Colonel William (Bill) Patterson Matthews, of Mexia, Texas,  with a Congressional Veteran Commendation in recognition of his  outstanding service to both his country and his community.

After receiving his Bachelor of Science in Education from Texas A&M  University, Lt. Col. Matthews served with distinction in the United  States Army for over 24 years. His military career included service in  over 30 countries, and a particularly harrowing tour in Vietnam from  1967 to 1968 with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (Blackhorse), where  he served under Colonel George Patton and Colonel Jimmie Leach. During  that time, he was twice wounded by RPG attacks, survived two mine  explosions, and earned two Bronze Stars for Valor, the Army  Commendation Medal, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. He was  medevacked to Fort Hood after his second Purple Heart. He continued to  serve in command roles for the rest of his active service and  subsequently earned a Master's in Business Administration from Syracuse  University, eventually retiring in 1992.

Following his military retirement, Lt. Col. Matthews settled in  Mexia, Texas, where he launched a second career in education. He earned  teaching and principal certifications from Tarleton State University.  Beginning in 1994, he taught 7th grade science in Mexia ISD and went on  to become principal at Mexia Intermediate and later R.Q. Sims  Intermediate School. He earned a reputation as an innovative and  passionate educator, implementing impactful programs like ``Blackcats  Don't Bully'' to combat bullying and ``Colonel's Kids'' to support  underperforming students from low-income backgrounds. These initiatives  benefited over 400 students and helped earn him recognition as runner- up for Association of Texas Professional Educators (ATPE) Elementary  Principal of the Year in 2002. He also helped the district achieve its  first-ever ``Exemplary'' rating and introduced several science-focused  initiatives, including dedicated labs and an outdoor classroom. His  educational philosophy emphasizes that every child can learn when  properly led and supported, a belief he carried throughout his career.

In addition to his educational work, Lt. Col. Matthews remained  deeply engaged in civic life. He served multiple terms as president and  song leader of the century-old Mexia Lions Club and founded the ``Red,  White, and Blue Car Show'' in 2012, which became the club's major  fundraising event. He has also been a dedicated member of the First  Baptist Church of Mexia since 1992, serving as a deacon, Sunday school  teacher and director, and choir member. He has actively participated in  church productions like the Easter Pageant and Christmas Dinner  Theater. His return to teaching in 2012, where he taught physics and  coached golf until his final retirement in 2022, underscores his  unwavering commitment to  youth development and community enrichment.

His exemplary record of military valor, educational leadership, and  civic dedication makes him an ideal recipient of the Congressional  Veteran Commendation. It is with great honor and respect that I present  retired USA Lieutenant Colonel William (Bill) Patterson Matthews with a  Congressional Veteran Commendation from the 17th Congressional District  of Texas.
