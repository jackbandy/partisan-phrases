National Strategy for School Security Act of 2025


Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2259) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the  development of a national strategy to secure elementary and secondary  schools against acts of terrorism, and ensure domestic preparedness for  and the response to terrorism, and for other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2259

(a) In General.--Subtitle A of title XXII of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) is amended by       adding at the end the following new section:       ``SEC. 2220F. NATIONAL STRATEGY TO SECURE SCHOOLS FROM                     THREATS OF TERRORISM.

``(a) In General.--To assist in the domestic preparedness       for and response to acts of terrorism and to coordinate       Federal efforts to secure elementary and secondary schools       (as such terms are defined in section 8101 of the Elementary       and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801)), not       later than one year after the date of the enactment of this       section, the Secretary, in consultation and cooperation with       the Secretary of Education and the heads of other appropriate       Federal agencies and departments, shall submit to the       Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Education       and Workforce of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and       the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of       the Senate a national school security strategy (in this       section referred to as the `strategy'). The Secretary, in       consultation and cooperation with the Secretary of Education       and the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies and       departments, shall brief such committees on the strategy.

National strategy to secure schools from threats of                terrorism.''.

Mr. GUEST.  2259.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2259, the National Strategy  for School Security Act. Despite rising attacks against our Nation's  schools, there is currently no comprehensive Federal strategy to  protect schools from acts of terror.

This bill closes this dangerous gap, requiring DHS to produce a  school security strategy that identifies and works to mitigate  vulnerabilities. In doing so, our schools will no longer be soft  targets.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and to  protect our children.

Mr. GOLDMAN of New York.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2259, a bill directing the  Department of Homeland Security to develop a national strategy to help  secure our elementary and secondary schools from acts of terrorism.

This bill moves us in the right direction. It acknowledges a painful  truth, that the safety of our students and teachers cannot be taken for  granted. It recognizes that schools need Federal support, coordination,  and expertise to prepare for the threats they face, and it moves us on  a bipartisan basis toward a more consistent, nationwide approach to  keeping our children safe.

However, let me be clear. This is only a start. Creating a strategy  is very important, but a strategy alone will not solve the problem. We  owe it to every student, every educator, and every family to keep  working to take meaningful, comprehensive action that matches the scale  of the threats facing our communities.

I applaud my colleague Congressman Gonzales' efforts, and I encourage  all my other colleagues to support H.R. 2259.

Mr. Speaker,

Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as the founder and co- chairman of the Bipartisan School Safety and Security Caucus, I rise  today to share a few words about my bill, the National Strategy for  School Security Act.

As a father of six, I, too, share every parent and grandparent's  worry when it comes to school safety. It is a sad reality that our  Nation's schools have become soft targets for violence.

Across this Chamber, too many of our home districts have witnessed  tragedies, including my own. In May of 2022, 19 children and two  teachers were senselessly killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde.  Our children, the most vulnerable among us, sit in schools without a  national plan in place to protect them from acts of terror.

This bill closes that gap. It requires the Secretary of Homeland  Security to develop a strategy and place resources for securing our  schools against acts of terrorism and best practices to prevent an act  of violence from happening in the first place.

This bipartisan bill is a much-needed step toward safer classrooms  across America.

Mr. GOLDMAN of New York.

Mr. Speaker, the reality is that school shootings and acts of  targeted violence continue to devastate towns and communities across  this country. They leave lasting trauma in classrooms, in families, and  in the hearts of children who should never have to wonder whether they  are safe at school.

H.R. 2259 deserves our support. It shows that even in a deeply  divided  Congress, we can still find common ground when it comes to protecting  our children, but our work cannot end here with this bill. We must  continue pushing for stronger, more comprehensive solutions that  address the full range of threats to our schools and communities.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  2259. I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, as a Representative of a school that was once subject to  an act of violence, I fully support this legislation, and I thank  Representative Gonzales for his introduction of H.R. 2259.

I urge my colleagues to please support this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
