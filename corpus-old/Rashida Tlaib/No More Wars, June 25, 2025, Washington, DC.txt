No More Wars


Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, no more wars. The majority of Americans do  not support our country getting into another endless war.

President Trump violated the United States Constitution by sending  the United States troops to bomb Iran without congressional  authorization.

Taking our country to war requires a vote in Congress. Every single  one of us represents close to 800,000 people, and they deserve a vote.

The American people do not want another war. They do not want us  spending endless amounts of money to invest in death and destruction.  They want us to fund Medicaid, housing, and Head Start. They want  access to clean water and so many critical programs that our  communities desperately need.

We have seen our government manufacture consent for the invasion of  Iraq that killed and displaced millions of people, our loved ones, and  created total devastation and instability in the region.

We have seen our government lie about weapons of mass destruction  before. We are not going to fall for it again. Instead of listening to  the American people who are saying no more wars, Trump is listening to  genocidal maniac war criminal Netanyahu who lied about Iraq and now is  lying about Iran.
