Disastrous Floods


Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, disastrous floods, horrific floods are  devastating the lives of our residents in southeast Michigan and across  the Nation.

The dangers don't stop when the flooding ends. Too many of our  families are denied FEMA assistance because current rules and policies  don't cover repairs and reconstruction for most basements where floods  are the most destructive.

Without Federal assistance, Mr. Speaker, they are forced to live in  extremely unsafe conditions, being exposed to serious health risks like  mold and mildew and moisture damage.

One of my residents, a 90-year-old woman, had no hot water, a broken  furnace, and toxic mold in her basement.

There are people recovering from disasters, and many of them are on a  fixed income. They are seniors who cannot afford the thousands of  dollars in repairs to their basement.

That is why I am proud to introduce the Fix Our Flooded Basements Act  to make sure that Federal disaster assistance finally covers those  costs.

We must make this change so that our residents, our constituents,  live in a safe home after a flood. They need to be able to rebuild  their lives from these disastrous floods.
