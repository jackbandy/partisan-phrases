Eid Mubarak


Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, this week, we celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the end  of the holy month of Ramadan.

As we finish this month of fasting, I want to recognize the beautiful  Muslim community in Michigan's 12th Congressional District and around  the world. Eid Mubarak.

This Ramadan has been a time of deep spiritual reflection and an  opportunity to be in community with each other, but it also has been a  painful time for so many Muslim families around the world.

I remind my colleagues that many of the Muslim families you represent  are thinking of the Palestinians in Gaza who continue to be starved and  ethnically cleansed. On the day of Eid, when children were celebrating  in their Sunday best, as many call it, they were killed. They were  killed as they were celebrating Eid.

As we gather to celebrate Eid, we have to also recognize and hold in  our hearts all those facing violence and oppression around the world.

May this Eid bring peace, justice, and freedom for all.
