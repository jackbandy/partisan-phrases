Caribbean American Heritage Month


Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I recognize Caribbean American Heritage  Month, celebrating the culture, contributions, and history of Caribbean  Americans in Michigan's 12th Congressional District and across the  country.

Caribbean American Heritage Month, first recognized in 2005, was  established after years of global efforts to uplift our Caribbean- American neighbors. Their vibrant culture and contributions to our  country and throughout the 12th Congressional District has uplifted  many of our communities.

The Caribbean communities in northwest Detroit, as well as in the  city of Inkster and throughout western Wayne and Oakland County, have  created powerful legacies through food, beauty businesses, fresh  markets, and nonprofits working to care for our families and new  immigrants.

Caribbean Community Services in my district, a nonprofit  organization, has done an outstanding job in uplifting Caribbean  history. Through their engaging events, Mr. Speaker, they have  celebrated the rich cultural heritage of the Caribbean and its  significant impact on our communities. Please join me in ensuring that  our Caribbean-American neighbors throughout our country are recognized  as we celebrate this month.
