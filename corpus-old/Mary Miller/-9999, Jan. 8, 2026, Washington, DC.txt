Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, Doug was one of the first  friends that I made when I joined the Agriculture Committee back in  2021.

I soon learned that we had a lot in common. We are both fourth- generation family farmers with a shared love for the land which we call  home. Doug was also one of the first Members to join my Congressional  Family Caucus and was a strong advocate for parents and children.

One of my funny memories was somehow we were having a conversation  about what we would do if we had to bug out of D.C., and he offered to  give me a ride in his classic Cadillac--I guess he had it here--and  give me a ride to Illinois, as he headed to California.

I was deeply saddened to hear of his passing. Mr. Speaker, because  Doug accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior, he is now in the presence of  the Lord.

I am praying for his wife, Jill, and their children. May they receive  comfort from Revelation 21:4 and the promise that: ``He will wipe away  every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall  there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things  have passed away.''

We thank Doug for his friendship, and we will carry on with the work  that he started. He will be missed.
