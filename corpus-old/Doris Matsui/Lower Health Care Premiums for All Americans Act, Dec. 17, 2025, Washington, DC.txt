Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this bill.  This should be called the lower healthcare premiums for none act.

Next year, my constituent, Natalie's, insurance will go from $175 to  $400 a month, a fifth of her monthly wages. She is a college student  who relies on her insurance for mental health care. She wrote to me: I  don't want to pick between my dream, mental health, and food.

What does this bill do for her? Nothing. I know Republicans are  getting similar calls. Yet, instead of caring about the millions of  Americans who are being forced to make impossible choices, they are  putting up this sham of a bill. They should be ashamed.

Mr. Speaker, we came here to deliver for our constituents. Let's vote  on a clean extension and avert the cliff. Let's put an end to this  scam.
