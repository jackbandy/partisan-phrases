Congratulating Garrett Illerbrunn's Career in the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division


Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chief Warrant  Officer Garrett Illerbrunn for his dedicated service in the U.S. Army's  82nd Airborne Division.

Chief Warrant Officer Illerbrunn, a native of North Dakota, with a  love of the outdoors and dedication to farming, started his service in  the U.S. military in 2005 and is now retiring after more than twenty  years of service.

Garrett served honorably for those twenty years, as an Apache AH64  crew chief before becoming a pilot and officer. He is retiring as Chief  Warrant Officer 4, where he provided leadership and support to units  from the battalion to the corps and beyond.

At the end of 2023, Garrett suffered a life-altering injury to his  skull during a drone attack in Iraq. He's accomplished great strides in  his recovery with his family by his side, even learning sign language  from his son Tucker, and I look forward to seeing further successes in  his future.

Garrett has many accomplishments in his time of service, including  being awarded the Purple Heart Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star  Medal and many more. But it's clear his most beautiful life  accomplishments have been marrying his wife, Lorna, and becoming a dad  to Tucker.

I hope Garrett celebrates with a Miller High Life and Jimmy John's  and I'll be sure to do the same to honor his service today.

Mr. Speaker, please join me today in honoring Chief Warrant Officer  Garrett Illerbrunn for his dedicated service to our great country. I  wish him the happiest retirement with his family.
