Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the language I helped secure in the  Agriculture appropriations bill addresses a serious concern regarding  the manufacturing and selling of unregulated, intoxicating THC products  nationwide.

I led the effort to legalize industrial hemp through the 2014 pilot  program and the 2018 farm bill. Unfortunately, companies have exploited  a loophole in the 2018 legislation by taking legal amounts of THC from  hemp and turning it into intoxicating substances and then marketing it  to children in candylike packaging and selling it in easily accessible  places like gas stations and convenience stores all across our country.  So the children end up being the unknowing consumers of these poisonous  products and being sent to the hospital at an alarming rate.

My efforts to close this loophole and stop this from happening are  included in this appropriations package. It will keep these dangerous  products out of the hands of children while preserving the hemp  industry for farmers. Industrial hemp and CBD will remain legal for  industrial applications--such as seed, stock, fiber, grain oil--or will  be used in drug trials. This language merely clarifies the original  intent of the 2018 farm bill, rooting out the bad actors and protecting  the growing hemp industry.

While some may masquerade as advocates for hemp farmers, even  sometimes threatening to hold up government funding over this issue, I  will continue to work on behalf of Kentucky's farmers while protecting  our children not only in my State but in yours as well. I would urge my  colleagues to do the same.                            3941, and I ask for  the yeas and nays.
