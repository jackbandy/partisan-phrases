Congratulating Memorial Medflight on its 20th Anniversary


Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an important  milestone for our region. On January 1, 2026, Memorial MedFlight will  celebrate its 20th Anniversary of service to the people of northern  Indiana and southwestern Michigan.

For two decades, Memorial MedFlight has provided lifesaving air  medical transport to our communities, often responding in the most  critical moments when every second matters.

Their pilots, flight nurses, paramedics, and support teams have  demonstrated extraordinary skill, professionalism, and courage day and  night, in all conditions.

Thousands of families across our region have been touched by the  fast, expert care this team delivers. Their work has strengthened our  emergency response system, expanded access to advanced medical care,  and saved countless lives.

Today, we honor Memorial MedFlight's dedication, their unwavering  commitment to the people they serve, and the strong partnerships they  have built with hospitals, first responders, and local communities.

We celebrate 20 years of excellence, and we express our deepest  gratitude for the lives they have protected and the hope they continue  to provide.

I congratulate Memorial MedFlight on this remarkable anniversary and  thank them for their continued service.
