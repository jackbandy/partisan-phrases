One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the One Big Beautiful Bill  Act.

President Trump inherited a disastrous open-border policy from the  Biden-Harris administration. There were nearly 9 million encounters at  the southern border under President Biden, more than the last 14 years  combined.

You can plainly see the difference between the first 5 months of  President Biden and the first 5 months of President Trump on this  chart.

As it turns out, all we really needed was a new President. Now the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act will permanently secure the southern border.  It completes the wall, funds thousands of new border agents, and equips  them with the cutting-edge tools that they need.

I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' because border security is  national security.
