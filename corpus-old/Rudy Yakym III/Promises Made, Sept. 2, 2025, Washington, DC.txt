Promises Made, Promises Kept


Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the already tremendous impact  of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

During the August work period, I traveled across all 11 counties in  my district, hitting over 40 stops, meeting with Hoosiers where they  live and work.

I heard from Chuck at Allie's Cafe, who shared about how limiting tax  on tips puts more money directly into workers' pockets.

I spoke with Camping World and other companies about how the Made in  America provision and immediate expensing strengthened American  manufacturing jobs.

I joined law enforcement officers at a drug enforcement roundtable to  discuss how this bill invests billions of dollars in border security to  stem the flow of fentanyl into our communities.

I celebrated 100 years of egg production with Creighton Brothers, a  century of hard work and family enterprise.

That is just a fraction of the stories I encountered.

Each day on the road, I was reminded that the strength of Indiana and  America lies in our people, families, farmers, workers, and small  businesses. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act was written for them and  because of them.

Together, we are proving that when we keep government out of the way,  Americans can keep more of what they earn, and there is no limit to  what we can achieve.
