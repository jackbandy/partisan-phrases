We Are At the Crossroads of Democracy and Autocracy


Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, and I rise today  because I believe my country to be at the crossroads of democracy and  autocracy. The moment of decision is near. We will have to decide  whether we will have a country that abides by a Constitution that is  meaningful or ignores a Constitution such that it becomes meaningless.

I choose to stand on the grounds laid by the Founders and Framers of  the Constitution. I stand today to announce that at the conclusion of  this 1-minute message, I will bring Articles of Impeachment to the  attention of the House of Representatives.
