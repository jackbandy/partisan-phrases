Tax Cuts and Spending


Mr. GREEN of Texas. Will the gentleman yield?

Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, if I may, I want to let people know  this not just for the Honorable Chip Roy, but I have relationships with  people across all lines in this Congress. When he comes to the floor  and says that he wishes me safe travels, I want to let people know that  I will extend that to him, but also that notwithstanding what others  may think, I have great respect for the gentleman. I don't have to  agree with him to have great respect for him, and the gentleman doesn't  have to agree with me, but at some point, we have to do what we are  doing now and let people know that we have respect for each other  notwithstanding these differences.

I really appreciate the way the gentleman has called for regular  order. That means something to me. So while I have not been on the  floor with the gentleman when he has done it, I want him to know that I  have noticed that he has done it. I appreciate the gentleman, and I  consider him a friend.
