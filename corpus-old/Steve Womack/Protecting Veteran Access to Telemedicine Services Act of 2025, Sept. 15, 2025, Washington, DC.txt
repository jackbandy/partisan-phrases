Protecting Veteran Access to Telemedicine Services Act of 2025


Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time  this afternoon.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 1107,  the Protecting Veteran Access to Telemedicine Services Act of 2025.

Mr. Speaker, this legislation is pretty simple. I argue that it is a  very commonsense bill. Most importantly, it is vital. It ensures that  our veterans, whether they live in the heart of our largest cities or  in the most rural, remote communities, have uninterrupted access to the  healthcare that they have earned.

I thank my good friend Chairman Bost and Ranking Member Takano for  their support in advancing this bill as one part of the effort to  support our veterans.

I also thank my friend Mark Berry, a former adjutant general for the  great State of Arkansas and a former State representative, for his  advocacy on behalf of our veterans on this issue. Mark brought this to  my attention, and I wouldn't be standing here today without his  encouragement.

In 2008, Congress passed the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer  Protection Act to address the rise of rogue online pill mills and the  potential for abuse in prescribing controlled substances. At the time,  it was the right step to safeguard public health. Yet, the world of  2008 is not the world of today, and the law has not kept pace with the  realities of modern medicine or the unique needs of our veterans.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the in-person requirement for  prescribing controlled substances under the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy  Consumer Protection Act was temporarily waived. This flexibility  allowed VA doctors and specialists to reach veterans where they are  through secure, effective telemedicine. The Department of Justice and  the Department of Health and Human Services have continued to extend  this waiver. Yet, without further action, it will expire at the end of  this year.

My bill would permanently extend the exemption for VA healthcare  professionals with the appropriate safeguards so that they can continue  to prescribe medically necessary treatments to veterans via  telemedicine.

For veterans in our urban communities, letting this waiver expire  means longer wait times, fewer appointment slots, and even more strain  on an already overburdened VA system.

For veterans in rural America, the consequences are even more  serious. Many of these men and women live hours away from the nearest  VA provider. For them, the exemption has meant timely care without the  cost and hardship of traveling hundreds of miles for a single  appointment.

Mr. Speaker, this is not just a matter of convenience. It is a matter  of necessity. It is about ensuring that every  veteran, regardless of where they live, has equal access to the care  that they have earned through their service and sacrifice to this  Nation. Our veterans have given this Nation their best. It is our duty  to give them our best in return.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation and to act swiftly to make sure that our veterans never see  their care delayed, denied, or diminished because of outdated laws.
