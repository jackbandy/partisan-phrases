One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time.

Mr. Speaker, the American people sent us here to work together to  address issues like the affordability crisis. Democrats are ready to  work with anyone to make housing more affordable, to make childcare  more affordable, and to make everyday goods like groceries less  expensive.

Mr. Speaker, the policies within this big, ugly bill are going to  raise costs and not lower them. Healthcare costs are going to go up as  Medicaid gets gutted. Electric bills are going to go up when clean  energy tax credits are wiped out at the request of the oil lobbyists.

Cutting food assistance programs like SNAP are going to hurt working  people who are already getting squeezed at the checkout line because of  these reckless tariffs. These are the same working people who were told  by my Republican friends that lowering costs would be their top  priority. That has not been the case. The American people are poorer,  and it is more expensive to live here as a result.

Mr. Speaker, the economy is teetering on the brink. Every single  piece of evidence tells us that a vote for this bill is a vote to make  things worse, and I urge a ``no'' vote.
