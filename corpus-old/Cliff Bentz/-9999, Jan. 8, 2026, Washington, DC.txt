Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Doug LaMalfa, my good friend.  His office is right across from mine and his district is right across  from mine in California from Oregon. This meant we worked together over  and over again on issues involving water to try to save it from the  grasp of misguided environmentalists.

He was a great friend and an incredible advocate for his district. He  did his very best for his constituents. He never gave up. He focused on  wolves, water, forests, and fire. May my good friend find solace in  Heaven and may his family find comfort in knowing he was a man of  integrity, faith, and truly deserving of our honor and our deepest  respect.
