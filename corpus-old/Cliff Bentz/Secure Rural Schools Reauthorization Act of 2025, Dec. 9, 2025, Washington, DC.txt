Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Act of 2025


Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 356, the Secure  Rural Schools Reauthorization Act of 2025.

Mr. Speaker, in 1990, the spotted owl was listed under the Endangered  Species Act as a threatened species. Almost immediately, timber  production from Federal forests in the Western United States plummeted  by 80 percent.

The economic and societal costs of timber-dependent States and their  timber-reliant counties was appalling. Demand for SNAP and Medicaid  shot up. Alcoholism and meth addictions became routine. County tax  revenues were decimated.

A belated but needed response was the Secure Rural Schools Act first  passed in 2000, 10 years after the listing of the owl. This law, and  the funding it provides, was designed to partially offset the massive  decline in Federal timber revenue. It provides a modest amount of  funding for critical services, including: infrastructure maintenance,  search and rescue, fire prevention, and, most importantly, money for  children's education.

As this chart shows, all of those billions did nothing to help  recover the owl. The population has declined from 1,200 pairs in 1980  to around 200 pairs today. When society enacts laws that seemingly  benefit the broader public but end up harming small communities,  society must assume responsibility for that harm. That is what this  bill partially accomplishes.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues. I thank the leaders of the  committees that helped put this bill together. I thank Speaker Johnson  for this bill and the funding my counties so desperately need. I urge  my colleagues to support S. 356.
