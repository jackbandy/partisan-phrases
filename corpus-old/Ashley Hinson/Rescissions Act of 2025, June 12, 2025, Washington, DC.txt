Rescissions Act of 2025


Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, Iowans overwhelmingly rejected the  Washington status quo in November, demanding an end to unelected  bureaucrats misusing taxpayer resources.

President Trump's rescissions package cuts $9.4 billion, including $3  million for Iraqi ``Sesame Street'', $6 million for net-zero cities in  Mexico, and $1 million for voter ID in Haiti, not here in the United  States.

We are only scratching the surface with this package. Imagine being  able to redirect those dollars to veterans' care or specialty crop  programs in a State like mine.

This package also rescinds funds for NPR and PBS. For decades, public  broadcasting has not adhered to objectivity standards enshrined in law.  It has pushed biased narratives and forced inappropriate content on  children, like a movie celebrating the sex change of a child, and a  feature on the racial origins of fat phobia. I am not sure what that  means.

Children should not be fed woke propaganda, certainly not on the  taxpayer's dime. That is coming from a former broadcaster.

I thank President Trump for exposing this waste and working to  protect Americans' hard-earned dollars. I urge my colleagues to join me  in passing this bill.
