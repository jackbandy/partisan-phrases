Demanding Resignation of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.


Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to demand the resignation of  Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., as Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Since taking office, RFK Jr. has failed to recommend the measles  vaccine for children, even after the deaths of two children. He said  pregnant women should not receive COVID vaccines. He has pulled funding  for vaccines for diseases like bird flu and HIV. He has spread lies and  stigma about autism. Last week, he released a report citing research  that does not exist--written by AI.

How many children have to die from measles and other preventable  diseases for RFK Jr. to resign? How many pregnant women have to get  sick with COVID and risk miscarriage? How many people have to get hurt  before Congress holds RFK Jr. and this administration to account?

This is why Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., needs to resign as Secretary of  Health and Human Services.
