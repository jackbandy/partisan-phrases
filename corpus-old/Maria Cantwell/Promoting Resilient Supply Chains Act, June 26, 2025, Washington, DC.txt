Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act


Ms. CANTWELL.  257, the Promoting  Resilient Supply Chains Act, a bill to improve the resilience of  critical supply chains, and for other purposes.

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I introduced the Promoting Resilient  Supply Chains Act, S. 257, with Senators Blackburn and Blunt Rochester  to mitigate or prevent disruptions of critical supply chains that could  have a devastating impact on the U.S. economy. The bill charges the  Department of Commerce's Assistant Secretary for Industry and Analysis  with promoting the stability and resilience of critical supply chains.  It creates a new government-wide Supply Chain Resilience Working Group,  led by the Assistant Secretary, to prepare for and respond to supply  chain shocks by mapping, monitoring, and modeling U.S. supply chains  for critical industries and emerging technologies in consultation with  the private sector. The group will identify any gaps or vulnerabilities  for critical goods, including any gaps in manufacturing, warehousing,  transportation, and distribution and providing strategies to mitigate  supply chain shocks. The bill calls for consultation with allies and  key international partner nations to identify potential critical goods  or manufacturing capacity in their countries that might be needed to  avert supply chain disruptions. Finally, the bill requires ongoing  reporting to inform Congress and the public, including a national  strategy and review on critical supply chain resiliency and U.S.  manufacturing.

Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Senator Wyden, I agree with you and will  work with you and our House colleagues to incorporate these changes  into the bill as the legislative process moves forward.
