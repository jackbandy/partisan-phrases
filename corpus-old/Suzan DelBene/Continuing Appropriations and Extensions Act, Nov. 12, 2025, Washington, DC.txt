Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, this bill fails to address the fundamental  needs of families across our country.

Americans have made it crystal clear that affordability is their  number one concern. President Trump and Republicans promised to lower  costs on day one, and that has been one big broken promise.

Healthcare premiums are skyrocketing because Republicans refuse to  extend the ACA tax credits, causing healthcare costs to go up for  everyone.

Over 4 million people will be forced off their coverage next year  because it is too expensive. This is on top of soaring prices for food,  energy, and housing. That is unacceptable for the wealthiest nation in  the world.

Republicans who say they support affordable healthcare should be  standing up for their constituents rather than falling in line behind  President Trump.

I am going to keep fighting for affordable healthcare and lower  costs. The American people deserve better.
