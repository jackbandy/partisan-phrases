Impact of Expiring Tax Credits


Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call out the impact of the  Republican healthcare crisis in my community, particularly those hurt  by the expiring tax credits.

One of those people is Gerry from Kirkland. Gerry has cancer and  depends on his Affordable Care Act coverage to afford treatment. Right  now, Gerry and his wife pay $2,800 a month in premiums. Without the ACA  tax credits, the same plan next year will cost him nearly $4,500 a  month. That is a 67 percent increase.

Gerry and his wife thought they could retire comfortably. Instead,  they are facing $54,000 a year in insurance premiums alone because of  the healthcare crisis that Republicans and Donald Trump created. There  is no way they will be able to sustain themselves with that much of a  price increase.

Mr. Speaker, I am going to keep fighting for Gerry and the millions  of other Americans so that they can afford the coverage they need.
