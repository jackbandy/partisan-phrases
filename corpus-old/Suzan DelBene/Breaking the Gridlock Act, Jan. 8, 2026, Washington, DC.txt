Breaking the Gridlock Act


Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my unwavering  support for this extension of the enhanced ACA tax credits.

For the last year, my colleagues and I have fought to keep these  enhanced tax credits. While this vote is later than it should have  been, it is not too late to do what is right for the American people  and for my constituents like Gerry, who has already seen a 60-percent  increase in his premiums; Steve, whose plan went up by over 40 percent;  and Mitch, who is looking at a 420-percent increase for him and his  wife.

Republicans and the Trump administration promised to bring down  prices. Instead, they have made healthcare a luxury that only some can  afford.

I believe everyone should have affordable, quality, accessible  healthcare. Because of that, I will be voting in favor of this  legislation and supporting the extension of the enhanced ACA tax  credits.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me.
