Recognizing Owen Zhang for Scientific Excellence


Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Owen Zhang as  a top 40 finalist for the 2025 Regeneron Science Talent Search  (Regeneron STS). Regeneron STS is the most prestigious science  competition for high school seniors in the country and has been held  annually as a program of Society for Science since 1942. Alumni from  Regeneron STS have gone on to become recipients of the world's most  distinguished science and math honors, including the Nobel Prize and  National Medal of Science.

In this 84th year of Regeneron STS, Owen is one of the top 40  finalists that were selected from nearly 2,500 entries. For his  project, he developed a solution to a problem about 3-uniform  hypergraphs. This project, ``Tetrahedron-Intersecting Families of 3- uniform Hypergraphs,'' utilized computer programming techniques to  answer a long-standing question about the maximum number of unique  connection conformations that can be found in 3-uniform Hypergraphs  with the same vertices. Owen believes the result of his project is the  first time such a problem has been solved in a hypergraph setting.

Owen Zhang, the son of Yunjing Ma and Geqiang Zhang, attends Bellevue  High School in Washington's 1st Congressional District, where he leads  the math club and competes in DECA events. Mr. Speaker, I ask my  colleagues to join me in celebrating Owen Zhang and this victory for  science education in Washington state. We are grateful for his  contributions to the scientific community and wish him a successful  career.
