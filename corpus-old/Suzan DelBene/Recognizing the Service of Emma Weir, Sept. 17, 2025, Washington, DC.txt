Recognizing the Service of Emma Weir


Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Emma Weir for her  outstanding service as Communications Director and Senior Advisor for  the New Democrat Coalition over the past four years.

As former chairwoman of the New Democrat Coalition, I had the  privilege of working closely  with Emma. She brought strategic insight, professionalism, and a deep  commitment to public service that strengthened our message, expanded  our reach, and supported every member of the Coalition. During some of  the most pivotal debates during the Democratic majority, Emma's  creativity and instinct were instrumental in advancing New Dem  priorities that helped improve the lives of Americans across the  country. Her work has left a lasting impact on the New Dems and the  values we fight for.

While we will miss her leadership, I am excited to see Emma take on a  new role with Chairman Pete Aguilar and the House Democratic Caucus. I  know she will continue to serve with the same skill and dedication that  made her so effective with the New Dems.

I thank Emma for her service, and I wish her the very best in this  next chapter.
