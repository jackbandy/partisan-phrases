Recognizing Marie and David Troy


Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Marie and David  Troy of Greenwich, New York for their admirable patriotism.

Marie Troy is a lifelong New Yorker and resident of Washington  County. For four years now, she and her husband David Troy have  dedicated time and effort to bringing patriotic pride back to their  community on Memorial Day. Together the Troys line their town's main  streets with American flags made here in the USA by the Saratoga Flag  Company.

To pay for all 78 flags and the necessary hardware the Troys raised  money through neighbors and local businesses. To install the flags, the  Troys partnered with Veteran Mike Savage, the Middle Falls Fire  Department, and local leaders so that the flags are all up by Memorial  Day. Marie and David Troy are an  example to New Yorkers and to Americans. I truly respect and admire  them for their enthusiasm and patriotism.

On behalf of New York's 21st District, I want to thank Marie and  David Troy for being model citizens of our community.
