Holding Ice Accountable


Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, yesterday our Nation witnessed the killing  of a fellow American in broad daylight, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her  name was Renee Nicole Good. She was a concerned citizen and a mother.  The loss of her life was entirely preventable.

This tragic loss of life comes the same week that we remember what  occurred here 5 years ago on January 6. On that day, violent  insurrectionists attacked police officers, many of whom sustained  serious injuries and five of whom have passed away since the attack,  including Brian Sicknick, a New Jersey native and a proud Capitol  Police officer.

Instead of remembering and healing from the events of that day,  President Trump pardoned close to 1,600 seditious and violent  insurrectionists who were convicted of criminal charges. The President  and House Republicans have tried to vanish the events of that day from  our collective memory, but we will not let them.

Last year, alongside my colleagues Congresswomen Watson Coleman and  McIver, I witnessed firsthand outside Delaney Hall how far this  administration will go to silence dissent and opposition when more than  20 armed ICE and HSI officers physically prevented us from doing our  job.

What I said then and what I would say today is that all of this  should be completely unacceptable to all Americans and should shake  every American to their core. I have said time and time again that no  one is safe in Trump's America. Mothers, Capitol Police officers, our  neighbors, Members of Congress, no one, not a single person should feel  safe with him as our President.

This administration's extreme agenda does not reflect the best of who  we are as a country but, instead, seeks to turn us against each other.  We cannot allow that to happen.
