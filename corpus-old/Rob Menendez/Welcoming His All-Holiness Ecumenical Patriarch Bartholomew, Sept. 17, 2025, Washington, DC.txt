Welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and welcome the  Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, His All-Holiness Bartholomew,  to Washington, DC. The spiritual leader of the Orthodox Christian  Church, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew comes to the United States to  accept the Templeton Prize, which recognizes an individual who has  ``made an exceptional contribution to affirming life's spiritual  dimension, whether through insight, discovery, or practical works.''

Born in current day Gokceada, Turkey, His All-Holiness received his  undergraduate degree at the Theological School of Halki and completed  graduate studies at three universities in Italy, Switzerland, and  Germany. He was elected in October 1991 as the 270th Archbishop of  Constantinople-New Rome, a Church of 300 million individuals worldwide,  including many of my constituents in New Jersey's 8th Congressional  District. He has devoted his life to advocating for peace-building  measures, organizing interfaith summits, and promoting religious  freedom and human rights.

It is a privilege to welcome such a leading figure to the Nation's  Capital and recognize his significant contributions to peace,  interreligious dialogue, and cultural understanding.

I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating this historic visit.
