Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, America's resources should always serve  America's interests, and 22 rescissions to wasteful foreign aid and  biased media totaling $9.4 billion is a good start.

I commend this legislation because as the national debt climbs toward  $37 trillion, U.S. taxpayers deserve a government that serves them, not  radical policies abroad or at home.

The reality is that the radical left has seized these institutions  and wielded them for an agenda that doesn't serve America's interests.  Wasted government revenues siphoned off the backs of Americans' labor  through tax dollars should not be tolerated.

I commend the $1 billion rescission to the Corporation for Public  Broadcasting. Taxpayer funding for woke media entities is absurd. NPR  and PBS already have a business model that doesn't need to rely on 150  million Americans' taxed income. It does not need to promote any  agenda, including their radical agenda, with stuff like what to do if  you experience a microaggression or some other promotion of their  agenda.

Additionally, international institutions have abandoned their  original missions to promote development in exchange for radical gender  ideological and climate priorities.

That is why I support the rescissions package, and I urge support for  the bill.
