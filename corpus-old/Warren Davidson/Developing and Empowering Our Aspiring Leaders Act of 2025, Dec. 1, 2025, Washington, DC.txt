Developing and Empowering Our Aspiring Leaders Act of 2025


Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4429) to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to  revise the definition of a qualifying investment, for purposes of the  exemption from registration for venture capital fund advisers under the  Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to include an equity security issued  by a qualifying portfolio company and to include an investment in  another venture capital fund, and for other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4429

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Developing and Empowering       our Aspiring Leaders Act of 2025''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

Not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Securities and       Exchange Commission shall--

(1) revise the definition of a qualifying investment under       paragraph (c) of section 275.203(l)-1 of title 17, Code of       Federal Regulations--

(A) to include an equity security issued by a qualifying       portfolio company, whether acquired directly from the company       or in a secondary acquisition; and

(B) to specify that an investment in another venture       capital fund (as defined in paragraph (a) section 275.203(l)-      1 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations) is a qualifying       investment under such definition; and

(2) revise paragraph (a) of such section to require, as a       condition of a private fund qualifying as a venture capital       fund under such paragraph, that, immediately after the       acquisition of any asset, such fund holds no more than 49       percent of the amount of the fund's aggregate capital       contributions and uncalled committed capital (excluding       short-term holdings) in--

(A) one or more venture capital funds; or

(B) qualifying investments acquired in a secondary       acquisition, valued at cost or fair value, consistently       applied by the fund.

Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO estimate  for this bill.      Legislation Considered Under Suspension of the Rules

The Majority Leader of the House of Representatives       announces bills that will be considered under suspension of       the rules in that chamber. Under suspension, floor debate is       limited, all floor amendments are prohibited, points of order       against the bill are waived, and final passage requires a       two-thirds majority vote.

At the request of the Majority Leader and the House       Committee on the Budget, CBO estimates the effects of those       bills on direct spending and revenues. CBO has limited time       to review the legislation before consideration. Although it       is possible in most cases to determine whether the       legislation would affect direct spending or revenues, time       may be insufficient to estimate the magnitude of those       effects. If CBO has prepared estimates for similar or       identical legislation, a more detailed assessment of       budgetary effects, including effects on spending subject to       appropriation, may be included.

For reasons I explained earlier, I urge all of my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
