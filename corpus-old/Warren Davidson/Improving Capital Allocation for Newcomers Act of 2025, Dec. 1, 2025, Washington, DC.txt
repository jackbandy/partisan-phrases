Improving Capital Allocation for Newcomers Act of 2025


Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4431) to amend the Investment Company Act of 1940 with  respect to the definition of qualifying venture capital funds, and for  other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4431           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives       of the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.           This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Capital       Allocation for Newcomers Act of 2025''.       SEC. 2. QUALIFYING VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS.           Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15       U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(1)) is amended--          (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking       ``250 persons'' and inserting ``500 persons''; and          (2) in subparagraph (C)(i)--          (A) by striking ``$10,000,000'' and inserting       ``$50,000,000''; and          (B) by striking ``beginning from a measurement made by       the Commission on a date selected by the Commission'' and       inserting ``beginning from a measurement made on the date of       the enactment of the Improving Capital Allocation for       Newcomers Act of 2025''.       SEC. 3. STUDY AND RULEMAKING.           (a) Study Required.--          (1) In general.--Beginning 5 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Advocate for Small Business       Capital Formation, in consultation with the Investor       Advocate, shall conduct a study on the effect of the       amendments made by section 2 on the businesses and startup       entities in which qualifying venture capital funds invest,       specifically including, with respect to such businesses and       startup entities, changes or trends relating to--          (A) the geographic distribution of capital to portfolio       companies;          (B) the socio-economic characteristics of founders or       controlling persons;          (C) the veteran status of founders or controlling       persons;          (D) the industry sector, size, stage of development, and       related details; and          (E) other factors or metrics determined by the Advocate       for Small Business Capital Formation.          (2) Authorities related to required study.--For purposes       of conducting the study required by paragraph (1), the       Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation and the       Investor Advocate shall have authority to--          (A) obtain from the Securities and Exchange Commission       (in this section referred to as the ``Commission'') and       utilize any       data or information necessary to carry out the study;          (B) request and receive assistance from any division or       office of the Commission, including the Division of Economic       and Risk Analysis; and          (C) enter into agreements with third parties to assist in       data analysis.          (b) Report.--The Advocate for Small Business Capital       Formation shall issue a report to the Congress containing all       findings and determinations made in carrying out the study       required by subsection (a)(1), and make such report available       to the public on the website of the Commission.          (c) Public Comment.--During the 180-day period beginning       on the date the report is issued under subsection (b), the       Commission shall solicit feedback from the public on the       findings and determinations contained in the report.          (d) Rulemaking.--          (1) In general.--The Commission, in consultation with the       Investor Advocate and the Advocate for Small Business Capital       Formation, may, after considering all comments received under       subsection (c) and only if the Commission determines in such       report that the amendments made by section 2 have had a       demonstrable effect on increasing the geographic distribution       of capital to portfolio companies, increasing the variety of       the socio-economic characteristics of founders or controlling       persons, or increasing the number of founders or controlling       persons who are veterans, issue rules to--          (A) increase or decrease the 500 person threshold       described in the matter preceding subparagraph (A) of section       3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, but such       threshold may not exceed 750 persons or be reduced below 250       persons; and          (B) increase or decrease the $50,000,000 dollar figure in       section 3(c)(1)(C)(i) of the Investment Company Act of 1940,       but such dollar figure may not exceed $100,000,000 or be       reduced below $10,000,000.          (2) Deadline for rulemaking.--The rulemaking authority in       paragraph (1) only applies to a rule with respect to which       the proposed rule was issued during the 180-day period       beginning at the end of the public comment period described       in subsection (c).          (3) No effect on inflation adjustments.--A rule issued       under this subsection shall have no effect on the requirement       under clause (i) of section 3(c)(1)(C) of the Investment       Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(1)(C)), as amended by       section 2, to index the first dollar amount in such clause       for inflation.

Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO estimate  for this bill.       Legislation Considered Under Suspension of the Rules

The Majority Leader of the House of Representatives       announces bills that will be considered under suspension of       the rules in that chamber. Under suspension, floor debate is       limited, all floor amendments are prohibited, points of order       against the bill are waived, and final passage requires a       two-thirds majority vote.

At the request of the Majority Leader and the House       Committee on the Budget, CBO estimates the effects of those       bills on direct spending and revenues. CBO has limited time       to review the legislation before consideration. Although it       is possible in most cases to determine whether the       legislation would affect direct spending or revenues, time       may be insufficient to estimate the magnitude of those       effects. Tf CBO has prepared estimates for similar or       identical legislation, a more detailed assessment of       budgetary effects, including effects on spending subject to       appropriation, may be included.
