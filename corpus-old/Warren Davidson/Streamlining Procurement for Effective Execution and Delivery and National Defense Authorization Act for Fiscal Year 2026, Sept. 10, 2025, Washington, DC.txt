Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026


Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and ranking member for  their work on keeping the NDAA bipartisan.

There is such a vital focus on national security here, and there are  some truly good reforms. As Mr. Hill highlighted, the Defense  Production Act has broader implications than just the Department of  Defense.

This turf war is, frankly, as old as the Defense Production Act, back  to 1950. When Chief of Staff James A. Baker, III, was navigating this,  he highlighted that tension. Since then, all kinds of things have taken  place with the Defense Production Act. This year is the first  opportunity to reauthorize it since the COVID pandemic, so HHS has been  used.

There is a lot of thoughtful work underway as we seek to modernize  and reauthorize this. I look forward to future collaboration.

Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Rogers for his commitment to Chairman  Hill. As chairman of the National Security, Illicit Finance, and  International Financial Institutions Subcommittee, this authorization  does go through my subcommittee, and I am happy to work with colleagues  across the spectrum here to get a good product across the finish line.

Mr. Chair, I am opposed to this en bloc because of this amendment.
