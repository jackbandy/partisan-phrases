Medical Debts of Tribal Members


Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage the House to  take up and pass my bill, the Purchased and Referred Care Improvement  Act.

This bill works to correct an all-too-common occurrence, which is  that Tribal members are referred to collection agencies because the  Indian Health Service failed to pay its bills.

Sometimes Tribal members utilizing the Indian Health Service will be  referred to an outside specialist or another provider, and this is what  is known as purchased and referred care. IHS is still responsible for  the payment of this care but all too often fails to follow through on  that obligation. These unpaid bills often lead to Tribal members paying  those themselves and being saddled with medical debt that they should  never have incurred in the first place.

Chairman Jarred Erickson and members of the Colville Tribe came and  visited my office. We talked about this, and they brought it to my  attention. Colville Tribal members have been hounded by debt collection  agencies for bills that the Indian Health Service failed to pay.

This bill would ensure that this never happens again and that Tribal  members will not be burdened with IHS' debts or saddled with medical  debt. I thank Chairman Erickson and the Colville Tribe for their  advocacy, and I encourage the House to pass this bill.
