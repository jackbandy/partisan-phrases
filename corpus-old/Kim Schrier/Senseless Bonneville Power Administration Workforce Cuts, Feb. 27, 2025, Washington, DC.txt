Senseless Bonneville Power Administration Workforce Cuts


Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of millions of people in  Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, I rise to express outrage and  bewilderment at the senseless workforce cuts by Elon Musk and President  Trump to Bonneville Power Administration, an agency that is not even  funded by taxpayer dollars but by our utility bills.

Bonneville system operators keep the lights on. They match supply to  demand, whether in a heat wave or a cold snap. They maintain the  majority of our transmission lines so when we have a wind storm like  our recent ones, their linemen go out and fix those lines in the worst  weather. These specialized employees, frankly, are irreplaceable.

The decision by Elon Musk and by the President to fire nearly 20  percent of Bonneville workers in the name of efficiency and saving  taxpayer dollars is not just wrongheaded. It is reckless and  outrageous. It will make power less reliable and more expensive for our  four States. In other words, it is all downside, no upside.

We have now seen weeks of taking a chain saw to our Federal programs  and damage to our grid, national forests, national security, and,  frankly, personal security. It is time for Congress to take our power  back and protect our constituents.
