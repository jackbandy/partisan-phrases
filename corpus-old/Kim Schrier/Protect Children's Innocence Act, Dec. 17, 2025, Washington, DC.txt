Protect Children's Innocence Act


Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, as the first and only pediatrician in  Congress, I rise today to condemn the so-called Protect Children's  Innocence Act.

I have served children and their families for over 20 years, and I  find this piece of legislation to be dangerous and an absolute slap in  the face for parents and for doctors who have dedicated their lives to  caring for children and families.

This bill could put doctors behind bars for up to 10 years for  providing medically appropriate care for children, and it doesn't even  stop there. It could put parents behind bars for making, after deep  consideration, and in many cases, anguish, the decision that they deem  best for their own child.

This bill will instill fear in doctors and patients and rob parents  of their freedom to make decisions for and with their own children.  Instead, it puts that power in the hands of D.C. lawmakers.

Healthcare decisions are deeply personal. The confidential  relationship between a patient, their parents, and their physician is  sacred. Physicians follow evidence-based guidelines and use their best  clinical judgment.
