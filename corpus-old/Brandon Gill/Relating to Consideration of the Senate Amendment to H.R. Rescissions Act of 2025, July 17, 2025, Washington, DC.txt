Relating to Consideration of the Senate Amendment to H.R. Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, tonight is the culmination of months  of work from House Republicans to defund leftwing state-sponsored media  outlets like NPR.

During that process, we got to bring in leadership from these outlets  like the CEO of NPR, Katherine Maher, to testify before the House  Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

I got to ask her about a lot of her past public statements. It turns  out she has a prolific Twitter history. She has written extensively  about every single major woke buzzword that you can think of, Mr.  Speaker, including ``the ravages of late-stage capitalism,''  ``structural privilege,'' and her own ``cis White mobility privilege.''

Mr. Speaker, most Americans, including myself, didn't know what that  meant until reading this.

She wrote about the ``politics of representation,'' and, of course,  ``toxic masculinity.''

She also wrote about herself, about one of her major pet peeves,  which is whenever she goes on an airplane and finds out that the  demographics are ``usually > 80% male, usually white.''

Mr. Speaker, that is flagrantly racist. She has written about how:  ``I do wish Hillary''--meaning Hillary Clinton--``wouldn't use the  language of `boy and girl'--it's erasing language for non-binary  people.''

Mr. Speaker, this is the person running the outlet the other side of  the aisle wants our tax dollars to subsidize.

Of course, she has written extensively about race, about how America  is ``addicted to white supremacy,'' how she grew up ``feeling  superior'' because she is White, how ``America begins in black plunder  and white democracy.'' Mr. Speaker, this is directly from her own  Twitter account.

Mr. Speaker, nonpartisan news outlets are not run by lunatics like  this. Republicans are done using the power that voters give us to fund  Democrat media machines. We are playing to win now.
