Oscar J. Upham Post Office


Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 2283) to designate the facility of the United States  Postal Service located at 201 West Oklahoma Avenue in Guthrie,  Oklahoma, as the ``Oscar J. Upham Post Office''.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2283

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. OSCAR J. UPHAM POST OFFICE.

(a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 201 West Oklahoma Avenue in Guthrie,       Oklahoma, shall be known and designated as the ``Oscar J.       Upham Post Office''.

(b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Oscar J. Upham Post Office''.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would rename a  post office in Guthrie, Oklahoma, for Oscar J. Upham. Oscar John  Jefferson Upham was a private serving in the United States Marine Corps  during the Boxer Rebellion and Spanish-American War, ultimately earning  the Medal of Honor for his service in Peking, China, in the summer of  1900.

In addition to serving in the marines, Mr. Upham worked as a letter  carrier for the Guthrie Post Office for 40 years. He retired from the  U.S. Postal Service, and he died February 14, 1949, in Guthrie,  Oklahoma, where many of his family still live today.

I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my House colleagues to  support this bill naming a post office for Oscar Upham, an American  military hero.
