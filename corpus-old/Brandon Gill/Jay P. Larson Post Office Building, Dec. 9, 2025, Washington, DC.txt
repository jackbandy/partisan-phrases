Jay P. Larson Post Office Building


Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 2466) to designate the facility of the United States  Postal Service located at 5225 Harrison Avenue in Rockford, Illinois,  as the ``Jay P. Larson Post Office Building''.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2466

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JAY P. LARSON POST OFFICE BUILDING.

(a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 5225 Harrison Avenue in Rockford,       Illinois, shall be known and designated as the ``Jay P.       Larson Post Office Building''.

(b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Jay P. Larson Post Office Building''.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would rename a  post office in Rockford, Illinois, for Jay P. Larson.

Mr. Larson worked as a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service for  25 years. Serving with enthusiasm and commitment, known for his joy and  warmheartedness, Jay Larson was tragically killed in a mass stabbing  spree in March 2024 while delivering the mail.

Mr. Larson is survived by his mother, seven siblings, 10 nieces and  nephews, and many friends.

I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my House colleagues to  support this bill naming a post office for Jay P. Larson who served his  community with distinction as a U.S. Postal Service letter carrier.
