Paul Piperato Post Office Building


Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1009) to designate the facility of the United States  Postal Service located at 86 Main Street in Haverstraw, New York, as  the ``Paul Piperato Post Office Building''.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1009

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PAUL PIPERATO POST OFFICE BUILDING.

(a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 86 Main Street in Haverstraw, New York,       shall be known and designated as the ``Paul Piperato Post       Office Building''.

(b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Paul Piperato Post Office Building''.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would rename a  post office in Haverstraw, New York, for Paul Piperato.

Paul served the county of Rockland for over 30 years, 15 of them as  county clerk. He was responsible for numerous innovative services in  the county clerk's office, and his passion for the people who he worked  with was evident in the quality of his work.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my House colleagues to  support this bill naming a post office for a local public servant, Paul  Piperato, and I yield back the balance of my time.
