Somalia Immigration Moratorium


Mr. GILL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a core part of American sovereignty  is the ability to determine who is able to enter our country. The sole  purpose of our immigration system is to benefit American citizens.

That is why today I introduced a bill that would implement a Somalia  immigration moratorium.

Mr. Speaker, we have seen the multibillion dollar Somali fraud  scandal just in the past week, and Americans are furious. The reality  is that Somali immigration makes America less prosperous, less safe,  and less culturally cohesive.

Mr. Speaker, 78 percent of Somali immigrants in Minnesota alone  receive welfare benefits, even after being in the United States for 10  years or longer. Somali men commit crimes at rates significantly higher  than Americans, and only about half of Somali immigrants can speak  English very well. Again, that is even after being in our country for  over a decade.

The reality is that Somalia's clan-based society is unassimilable  into American society.

It is time to put the American people first, and I urge the House to  support my bill.
