Recognizing William Woodard Butler Veteran of the Year


Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a lifetime of  service of one of my constituents, Colonel William Woodard Butler, the  2025 Veteran of the Year for Virginia's Fourth Congressional District.

With over 38 years of service between Active Duty and the Reserves,  Colonel Butler has devoted his military career and beyond to improving  the lives of our servicemembers, advancing medical research, and giving  back to his community.

Colonel Butler completed two overseas deployments, one to Okinawa and  another to Qatar. He has over 980 hours of flight time, of which 65 are  in combat.

He then rounded out his military career as a professor of aerospace  medicine at the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine.

In addition to this, he now serves as an active member of his  community, as a trustee for the John Randolph Foundation, and as a  member of the city of Hopewell's planning commission.

He helped establish a permanently endowed scholarship for  Chesterfield, Hopewell, and Prince George students pursuing a medical  career.

I thank Colonel Butler for his service to our Nation and admire all  he has done to improve the lives of those in our community,  Commonwealth, and country. I am honored to name him the 2025 Veteran of  the Year for Virginia's Fourth Congressional District.
