Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted By the Department of Energy Relating to ``Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer Gas-Fired Instantaneous Water Heaters''


Ms. McCLELLAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Pallone) for yielding me time.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 20,  which will undo a commonsense energy conservation standard and raise  costs for consumers, all to benefit the gas industry.

My friends on the other side of the aisle talk a lot about how we  need to lower costs, we need to lower costs, we need to lower costs.

The best way, the fastest way, and the most efficient way to lower  energy costs and to lower utility bill costs that every American pays  is to reduce energy demand.

We have seen that time and time again. This standard is a way to help  lower energy demand needed for water heaters. Energy efficiency  standards are popular, and it is a commonsense tool and, again, the  fastest way to save taxpayers and American people money on their energy  bills.

This resolution targets these standards, not realizing that these  standards will save consumers $3.1 billion and are good for the  environment because they cut 32 million metric tons of carbon dioxide  emissions over 30 years.

All major manufacturers already sell models that meet these  standards, which is why they widely support the standards. Consumer  groups, efficiency advocates, and consumers widely support the  standards.

Again, the only manufacturers that oppose them are the foreign  manufacturers and industry CEOs who make more money when water heaters  are less efficient and use more gas.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution and  live up to the promise of lowering costs for the American people by  lowering their energy bills.
