Cleaning Up Government


Ms. ANSARI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call out and condemn Donald  Trump's astounding corruption.

Just last week, he signaled that he would change the name of the  Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf. Today, he arrived in the Middle East,  where he is expected to accept a luxury 747 worth $400 million from  Qatar to replace Air Force One.

From attempting to rename the Persian Gulf to accepting luxury  airplanes as unprecedented personal gifts, Donald Trump would rather  waste time on ridiculous political stunts designed to curry favor with  foreign governments and line his own pockets than address the issues  affecting the American people.

Mr. Speaker, as the first Iranian-American Democrat elected to  Congress, I can tell you that the Persian community in the United  States and across the world is outraged at the attempt to change the  historically significant name.

That is why, today, I am proud to introduce the Persian Gulf Act to  prohibit any Federal funds from being used to rename the body of water  and prevent government documents from referring to the Persian Gulf by  anything except that name.

As Donald Trump acts only for himself, I will continue fighting  against his corruption and the American people.
