Mass Shooting in Glendale, Arizona


Ms. ANSARI. Mr. Speaker, on Sunday night, the community that I  represent in Glendale, Arizona, was rocked by yet another mass shooting  in America.

As families and friends came together to eat, drink, and dance, they  looked forward to celebrating Cinco de Mayo and spending time in their  community. Instead, their worlds were shattered as someone with a gun  fired into the crowd outside the restaurant, killing three people and  injuring five more.

I cannot imagine the pain and sadness that their families and loved  ones now feel, and I am sending them love and strength.

Every single person there will be forever impacted by the violence  and trauma that mass shootings impose on communities.

For far too long, we have been forced to watch as gun violence  devastates our communities, and we feel unsafe going to the movies or  eating out at a restaurant.

One thing is clear. These acts of violence and the trauma they  inflict on all of us are preventable. They are a policy choice. It is  time for us to make a new choice.

Commonsense policy reforms to regulate guns and prevent mass  shootings like this one in Glendale have broad, bipartisan support. It  is beyond time we stand up and do something.
