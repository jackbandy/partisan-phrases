School Shootings Are Not Inevitable


Ms. ANSARI. Madam Speaker, only in the United States of America do we  now have college students who have survived not one but two school  shootings.

That is the reality for students at Brown University right now,  students like Zoe Weissman, who was a middle schooler at the school  next to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School during the Parkland  massacre. Years later, she found herself again facing an active shooter  on a college campus. Mia Tretta was shot as a teenager at Saugus High  School and survived, and now, she has lived through yet another school  shooting at Brown.

Let that sink in: Two shootings in one lifetime, all before  graduating college.

We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to this. This level of  trauma is not normal. It is not inevitable. It is not acceptable.

If we are serious about protecting young people in America, Congress  must act now. That means universal background checks, a ban on assault  weapons designed for mass killing, cracking down on ghost guns, and  investing in mental health and safe storage policies grounded in data.

Ms. ANSARI. I will say it again. This is not inevitable.
