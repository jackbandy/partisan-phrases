Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025


Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, the SAVE America Act will block illegal  immigrants and noncitizens from voting.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation out there being  spread by the media and my friends across the aisle. House Republicans  and President Trump want to protect the ballot box and ensure integrity  in our elections across this great country.

Only U.S. citizens should participate in the election process. The  laws we create in Congress affect all Americans, and Americans should  be the ones who select their leaders.

This SAVE America Act puts in place safeguards, Mr. Speaker, to  prevent noncitizens from abusing our democratic process. United States  citizens should be the people choosing our elected leaders, not illegal  immigrants.

I am not a drinker. Everybody knows that. But I know if I go to  Weigel's in Knoxville, Tennessee, down on the corner of Emory Road and  Tazewell Pike, and I go in there to buy a six-pack or a can of Skoal or  a scratch-off, then I have to produce an ID.

Mr. Speaker, when you purchase a firearm, when you board a plane, and  when you open a bank account, if I put $100 in the bank and right then  ask for $20 of it back, I have to show a dadgum ID.

Why can't you vote for an elected official without one, Mr. Speaker?

This legislation codifies President Trump's executive action to  secure our voter registration process, which has been a key platform of  President Trump this term.

Democrats are lying, Mr. Speaker, saying this bill prevents  minorities from registering to vote. It protects their vote. It  protects every American citizen's vote. It disgusts me, and, frankly, I  find it racist to assume that minorities cannot obtain an ID.

We need to have the guts to stand up and protect our dadgum election,  Mr. Speaker, and that means we need to pass the SAVE America Act.
