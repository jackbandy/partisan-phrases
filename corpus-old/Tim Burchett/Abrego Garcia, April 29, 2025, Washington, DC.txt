Abrego Garcia


Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to speak to America  about Abrego Garcia, the alleged MS-13 member and illegal alien who the  Trump administration deported back home to El Salvador.

I would like to ask my Democrat colleagues this question: Where was  your outrage when the Biden administration allowed millions of  undocumented illegals into our country? Where was your outrage when my  own constituents, the Corcoran family, were crying over the body of  their child who was killed at the hands of an illegal? Where were you  when Laken Riley and many other Americans were slaughtered by illegal  aliens who were allowed into our country under your open-border  policies?

Now you want to go on TV and act outraged about Abrego Garcia being  deported? Give me a break.

Here are the facts. He was pulled over by the Tennessee Highway  Patrol for speeding with an expired license. He was detained. He had  folks in his vehicle that were apparently not American citizens. Then  he was ordered by Biden's FBI to be released.

In court documents, his wife even said: ``At this point, I am afraid  to be close to him.'' She goes on to say: ``I have multiple photos,  videos of how violent he can be . . . ''

When Democrats grandstand on the deportation of a wife-beating El  Salvadorian, MS-13 gang member and chant ``Bring him home,'' I have  good news for you. He is home, and he will never be able to call  America home.
