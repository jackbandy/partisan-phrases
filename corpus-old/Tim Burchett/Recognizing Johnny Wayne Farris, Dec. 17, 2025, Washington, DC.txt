Recognizing Johnny Wayne Farris


Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my good friend, Johnny  Wayne Farris, who was recently nominated as candidate for Time magazine  Dealer of the Year. He is also being recognized nationally by Time  magazine for his community service and industry accomplishments.

Johnny Wayne Farris is the president of Farris Motor Company, founded  by his grandfather in 1929. Farris grew up in the industry and joined  the company full-time in 1972--when I was in the second grade, Mr.  Speaker--after graduating from Tennessee Tech University.

Farris Motor Company's mission is to be the dealer of people and  truly has accomplished that in his time with the company across  Tennessee.

Farris has an honorable record of humanitarian aid and philanthropy,  as well. He has shipped over 140 containers of humanitarian assistance  over the last 12 years to support east Tennessee families and refugees  at home and abroad.

Johnny Wayne Farris is not only a great businessman; he is in my  fraternity, Sigma Chi. He is also even a better member of his  community, helping anyone and everyone he can.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my dear friend, Johnny Wayne Farris, and  thank him for all that he has done for east Tennessee and me and my  family.
