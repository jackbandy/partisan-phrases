Happy 90th Birthday to Willis Roscoe Bowman


Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a very good friend  of  mine and a dadgum good east Tennessean, Mr. Willis Roscoe Bowman, on  his 90th birthday.

He is a lifelong resident of Bristol, Tennessee, and a lifelong  entrepreneur. If I had to guess, I think his proudest accomplishment is  his family. Mr. Bowman is married to his loving wife, and he is an  outstanding father and grandfather to nine grandchildren. I know they  keep him very busy.

He began his career after purchasing a small gas station, going on to  own nine different domestic and foreign car dealerships across east  Tennessee. At the age of 90, he still continues to go into the office  three to four times a week, Mr. Speaker. I think Congress could learn a  lot from his work ethic and dedication to his community.

Roscoe is also a NASCAR fanatic and never missed a race at Bristol  Motor Speedway from 1961 until 2019. He even earned the coveted  position of dropping the starting flag at a race. Over the years, he  has become a collector of classic cars, restoring many of them himself.

Friends, family, employees, and customers of Roscoe's will always  tell you that he is one of the best men in all of east Tennessee, and I  agree with that.

He is most well-known for giving you his word and coming through  every time, Mr. Speaker. This is yet just another example how Members  of Congress could learn a little of something from Roscoe.

Mr. Speaker, from up here in Washington, D.C., I thank Mr. Bowman for  his friendship, and I wish him the happiest 90th birthday. I thank him  for his time and commitment to the people of east Tennessee.
