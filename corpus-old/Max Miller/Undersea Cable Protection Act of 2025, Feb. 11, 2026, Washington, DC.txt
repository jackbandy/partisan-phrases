Undersea Cable Protection Act of 2025


Mr. MILLER of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 261, the Undersea Cable Protection Act.

Undersea cables are the backbone of our modern economy. These cables  are no bigger than a garden hose but support over $10 trillion in  international commerce on a daily basis.

Mr. Speaker, you would think that this clear significance would  prompt us to make sure that it is easy to build these things, but no.  The United States is one of the most difficult countries in the world  to lay and operate undersea cables. This is a national security  liability.

There is simply no reason to require a special use permit for an  undersea cable because there is absolutely zero--and I say ``zero''-- environmental impact.

It is time for Congress to pay more attention to the critical  infrastructure that surrounds us in this country. That is why I  introduced the NEPTUNE Act, to make sure that the Navy maintains its  undersea cable laying and repair capabilities. That is why I intend to  vote for this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.
