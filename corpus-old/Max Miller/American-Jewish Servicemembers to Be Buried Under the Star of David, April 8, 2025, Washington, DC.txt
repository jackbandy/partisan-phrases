American-Jewish Servicemembers to Be Buried Under the Star of David


Mr. MILLER of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, every American who puts on the  uniform deserves to be remembered with dignity and respect.

I was proud to introduce the bipartisan Fallen Servicemembers  Religious Heritage Restoration Act to help ensure that hundreds of  fallen American-Jewish servicemembers are buried under military grave  markers that represent their true religion and heritage.

An estimated 600 American-Jewish servicemembers remain improperly  buried under the Latin Cross, not the Star of David. Many brave  servicemembers made the ultimate sacrifice while defending freedom in  World War I and World War II, but due to clerical errors or concerns  for their safety during service, their religious identities were not  properly recorded.

This bill is a meaningful step to correct those errors and to ensure  that these heroes are laid to rest with the honor and dignity that they  deserve.
