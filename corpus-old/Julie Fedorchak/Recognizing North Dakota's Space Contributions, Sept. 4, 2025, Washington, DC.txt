Recognizing North Dakota's Space Contributions


Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great  milestone in North Dakota's history and our Nation's future in space.

Earlier this summer, the University of North Dakota launched our  State's first-ever satellites into orbit, a bold step forward in  satellite operations and a powerful example of homegrown innovation.

These low Earth orbit satellites, developed in partnership with the  AVS US, are operated from my alma mater, Odegard Hall in Grand Forks.

The mission, known as ROADS, is about more than technology. It is  about inspiring the next generation of scientists, engineers, and  leaders in space.

North Dakota has long led in agriculture, energy, defense, and  aviation.  Now, we are expanding that leadership into space.

I am proud of the students, faculty, and innovators who made this  mission possible.
