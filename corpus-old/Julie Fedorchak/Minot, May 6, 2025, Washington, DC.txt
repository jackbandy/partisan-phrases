Minot, North Dakota Named A 2025 Great American Defense Community


Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Minot, North  Dakota, my husband's hometown, named one of the 2025 Great American  Defense Communities.

Only three cities across the Nation received this honor, reflecting  the remarkable commitment the people of Minot have shown to the men and  women stationed at the Minot Air Force Base.

Through events like the Prairie Warrior Auction and efforts by local  leaders and initiatives led by the Minot Area Chamber, this community  goes above and beyond to welcome airmen and support their families.

Whether it is raising funds to send airmen home for the holidays or  educating the Nation on nuclear deterrence, Minot leads with pride and  purpose. Their motto sums it up best: Only the Best Come North.

Again, congratulations to the city of Minot on this well-earned  recognition, and thanks to this amazing community for standing behind  our military every day.
