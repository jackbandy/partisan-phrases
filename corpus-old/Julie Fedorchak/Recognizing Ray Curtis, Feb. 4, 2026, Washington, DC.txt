Recognizing Ray Curtis


Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable  North Dakotan--this handsome young man--Ray Curtis of Minot.

On February 11, Ray will turn 109 years old. He is the oldest living  World War II veteran in North Dakota and one of the oldest in our  entire country.

Ray served our Nation during one of the most defining moments in  world history. Like so many from his generation, he answered the call  without hesitation and helped secure freedom.

Ray now resides at Minot Lodge Senior Living, surrounded by family  and caregivers.

North Dakota is so proud of Ray Curtis. We are grateful for his  service, his sacrifice, and his example.

Happy birthday to Ray. Congratulations on a life well-lived in  service to our country.
