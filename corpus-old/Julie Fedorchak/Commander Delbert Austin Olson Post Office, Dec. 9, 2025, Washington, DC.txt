Commander Delbert Austin Olson Post Office


Mrs. FEDORCHAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true North  Dakota hero from Casselton, North Dakota, Commander Delbert Austin  Olson.

Commander Olson, as my colleagues mentioned, answered the call of  duty not once, not twice, but across three major conflicts: World War  II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war.

In Vietnam, he served with distinction, participating in some of the  most dangerous missions of the war. He flew low over Ho Chi Minh Trail  to gather intelligence that protected American servicemembers on the  ground.

On January 11, 1968, Commander Olson and his crew were killed in  action when their plane went down. His name is etched on the Vietnam  Veterans Memorial Wall, and today we gather to take another step to  make sure future generations know his story.

My legislation will rename the Casselton Post Office as the Commander  Delbert Austin Olson Post Office. This is a small way to show how much  we value his sacrifice and to make sure his story lives on in the town  he loved.

North Dakota does not forget its heroes. Commander Olson's life  reminds us of the quiet strength and devotion that defined the very  best of this country.

I am proud to bring this bill forward, and I urge my colleagues to  join me in honoring Commander Olson's remarkable service and sacrifice.
