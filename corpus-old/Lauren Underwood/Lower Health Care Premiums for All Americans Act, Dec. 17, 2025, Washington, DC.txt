Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, in just 2 weeks,  the Affordable Care Act tax credits that help millions of Americans  afford their premiums will expire, and this Republican healthcare bill  does absolutely nothing to keep costs from surging.

In fact, every House Democrat has signed a discharge petition for my  bill to extend these tax credits for 3 years, and now four Republicans  have signed on, as well.

For this reason, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill back to committee. If the House rules permitted, I  would have offered the motion with an important amendment to this bill.

My amendment would extend the enhanced premium tax credits for 3  years to do what this Republican bill fails to do and help American  families afford their healthcare.

Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in  voting for the motion to recommit.

Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.

Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
