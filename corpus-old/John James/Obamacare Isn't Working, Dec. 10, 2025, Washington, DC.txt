Obamacare Isn't Working


Mr. JAMES. Mr. Speaker, today I rise for the families in my district  and across America who are getting crushed by medical bills they never  saw coming. Enough is enough. It is time we put patients back in charge  of their own healthcare.

Let me tell you what is happening out there, Mr. Speaker. The average  family health insurance premium now tops $24,000 a year. That is more  than a lot of folks pay in their mortgage or rent. That is insane.

Barack Obama stood right here in this Chamber and promised us  affordable care. He said that if we like our doctor, we can keep him;  and if we like our plan, we can keep it.

That was determined to be the biggest lie of 2012.

What we got instead was the most expensive healthcare system on the  Earth with hospitals and insurance companies cashing in while working  families foot the bill.

In the last 25 years, medical costs have gone up over 121 percent,  and since ObamaCare passed, healthcare spending has exploded another  60-plus percent. Even Bernie Sanders admits that the status quo isn't  working.

Just last week Kelly from St. Clair Shores called my office. Her  family of four is staring at a $40,000 bill because of a medical  emergency under the so-called Affordable Care Act. Eileen in  Shelby Township is as healthy as can be. Yet her premium just jumped  $10,000 this year. That is the ACA in a nutshell: You are in trouble if  you are healthy, and you are really in trouble if you get sick.

This is what affordable care looks like in their world. This isn't  what care is in the real word. Mr. Speaker, everywhere else you see it  works when patients and people make their own decisions.

Mr. Speaker, if you need a plumber at 2 a.m., there is no problem. He  is at your door in 1 hour, Mr. Speaker. If you show up at the ER,  though, Mr. Speaker, bring a book and a sandwich because you are going  to be there for a while.

Michigan has the longest wait times on average of any State in that  immediate region and some of the longest wait times in the country. If  you want a flat-screen TV, Mr. Speaker, you can have one delivered to  your doorstep in hours. However, a lifesaving dialysis machine will  cost you $30,000 and might take you weeks to get.

Do you know why, Mr. Speaker?

It is because government doesn't meddle in television manufacturing  and people have choices.

Mr. Speaker, you can fix your eyes for $1,500, but if you need your  heart fixed, it will cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Do you know why, Mr. Speaker?

It is because people have choices.

Here is the truth: Every single time Washington gets its mitts deeper  into healthcare, prices go through the roof and care gets worse.

That is why I introduced the Patients Deserve Price Tags Act. The  Patients Deserve Price Tags Act is pretty simple. Before a person walks  into a hospital or to a doctor's office, he ought to be able to know  what the heck something costs: No more games, no more surprises, and no  more $47 aspirin.

This is bipartisan, bicameral, and commonsense stuff. In literally  every part of life elsewhere, buying a car, groceries, or a cell phone,  you know the price before you swipe your card and before you put your  hard-earned cash on the register, Mr. Speaker. You can shop around,  find a better deal, and walk away if it is too rich for your blood. It  is your choice, Mr. Speaker. Only in healthcare do they hide the price  until after you have already gone on the table, Mr. Speaker. Then they  send you a bill that ruins your life and puts you in debt.

While hospitals and insurance companies rake in record profits,  American families are drowning in medical debt, more medical debt than  credit cards, car loans, and everything else combined. My bill ends  this nonsense and gives the power back to you, Mr. Speaker.

Every hospital in America will have to post their real prices online  in plain English where everyone else can see them. If they don't hold  the prices, we fine them and hold them accountable to the people. Fines  will actually mean something.

Mr. Speaker, insurance companies will have to give you a straight  answer online, on the phone, or in the paper about exactly what your  care is going to cost you before you get it. For the first time, they  will have to publicly post their real rates and drug prices, too.

Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and that is all the people demand.

Mr. Speaker, the people back home know how to spend their money  better than the Federal Government. We give them a price, and they will  find the best deal. Give them the power, and the prices will come down.  That is how the real world works.

We are keeping a promise that should have been kept a long time ago:  real transparency, real competition, and real power will be back in the  hands of patients.

I am asking every one of my colleagues to join our bipartisan bill,  Republican and Democrat, to stand with the families getting hammered by  these bills.

Mr. Speaker, cosponsor the Patients Deserve Price Tags Act. Let's  finally give the American people, all of the people who sent us to  represent them, honesty and the control they deserve.
