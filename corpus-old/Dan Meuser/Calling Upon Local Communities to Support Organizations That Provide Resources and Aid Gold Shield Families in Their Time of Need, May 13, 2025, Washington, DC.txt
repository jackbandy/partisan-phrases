Calling Upon Local Communities to Support Organizations That Provide Resources and Aid Gold Shield Families in Their Time of Need


Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Onder) for his leadership, and I also thank my good friend and  colleague Congressman Rob Bresnahan for his participation and great  work and support of this resolution.

Mr. Speaker, this is National Police Week, and I rise in support of  my legislation, H. Res. 364, the Gold Shield families resolution. Out  of all of the priorities that we face in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker,  none is more fundamental than ensuring public safety and protecting  human life. It is the foundation for everything else--our economy, our  freedoms, and our way of life--so the people on the front lines of that  effort are our first responders.

Police officers, firefighters, EMTs, correctional officers, and  dispatchers are the tip of the proverbial spear. They put themselves in  danger, often on a regular basis, in order to keep the rest of us safe.  They are the thin blue line, the thin gold line, and the thin red line  that holds society together. They serve not for accolades but out of  duty and honor.

Mr. Speaker, I know this personally. My father was a police officer  and a detective, while my grandfather also was a firefighter. He was  the captain of his house.

I remember clearly the risks that my father took every day he walked  out the door. I remember well what it meant to be a police family, and  I know the courage it takes not just for the officer but for the family  members who stand behind them.

When the worst happens, when a first responder is lost in the line of  duty, it is the family who bears the burden of that sacrifice for the  long term. They are the ones picking up the pieces, mourning their  loved ones, and carrying their legacy forward.

The term ``Gold Shield families'' is modeled after the Gold Star  families, which honors the families of fallen military servicemembers.  Gold Shield families are those whose loved ones wore a different kind  of uniform and who served in our communities rather than abroad but  whose sacrifice was no less significant.

The resolution simply acknowledges that reality, Mr. Speaker. It  affirms that these families who have lost a loved one in the line of  duty deserve the respect and support of the communities that they  served. Their sacrifices and their struggles will not be forgotten, and  our local communities must play their part to support nonprofit  organizations that serve Gold Shield families during their time of  grief and hardship.

H. Res. 364 encourages Gold Shield families to turn on these trusted  groups for connection, care, and healing as they navigate life after  loss. This resolution was inspired by one such organization, Camp  Freedom in Carbondale, Pennsylvania. Their executive director, my good  friend Matt Guedes, is in the Chamber with us tonight. He brought this  idea forward, and I thank Matt very, very much for a great idea and for  helping us see it through.

Mr. Speaker, Matt is a veteran and a passionate advocate for those  who serve. He saw firsthand the need to give proper recognition to the  families of fallen first responders, especially those who had once  served our country in uniform and continued that service here at home.

Camp Freedom provides outdoor healing experiences for disabled  veterans, first responders, and their families. Their mission is rooted  in community, connection, and recovery. I thank Matt and all of his  team for all that they do to support those who served our country.

To date, Camp Freedom has served more than 12,000 veterans', first  responders', and servicemembers' families from across Pennsylvania and  the country.

Mr. Speaker, I also recognize Bill Bachenberg, who founded Camp  Freedom. His passion and vision have made Camp Freedom what it is  today: a special place for many.

Mr. Speaker, this resolution is only two pages long, but its message  is powerful. It recognizes these families. It thanks them and affirms  that their sacrifices are worthy of our continued support.

This resolution has strong bipartisan backing, and I thank all of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have joined as cosponsors.

During National Police Week, let me say this to every police officer,  firefighter, EMT, dispatcher, and emergency responder: I thank them for  their service. They are the thin gold line that separates us from  chaos. They are the reason that our Constitution is more than words on  paper.

Mr. Speaker, to every Gold Shield family, their loved one's service  mattered. The sacrifice of their loved one will not be forgotten, and  neither will theirs.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 364. Let's pass  this resolution and give these families the recognition and community  support that they have long deserved.
