America is Worth Cheering for


Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, during the joint session Tuesday night,  Republicans cheered for the vision, plan, and great future of America.  We cheered for secure borders, wiping out fentanyl and human  trafficking, and an energy policy that lowers fuel cost and inflation.

We cheered for our military, increased recruitment of young patriots,  and readiness. We cheered for peace, world stability, and an America  first economy, bringing a renaissance to U.S. technology,  manufacturing, great-paying jobs, and the Made in the USA logo.

We cheered for the President's leadership in fighting waste, abuse,  fraud, and corruption. We cheered for the vision of a new Golden Age,  and Americans cheered with us.

We saw in the polls over 75 percent, nearly 80 percent, appreciated  the optimistic, yet realistic outlook for our great country. We cheered  for a child who overcame cancer, a family who suffered loss, and the  brave who were knocked down but got back up, truly an American thing.

Unfortunately, not everyone cheered. Rather, there was seemingly  opposition without a cause. That is not productive. It is  counterproductive. America is an idea about hope; always will be;  always was.

Mr. Speaker, America is worth cheering for.
