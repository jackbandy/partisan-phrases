One Big, Beautiful Bill


Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, the budget resolution passed yesterday sets  the stage for President Trump's one big, beautiful bill.

This bill is going to deliver dominant energy policy and border  security, stopping human trafficking and the rampant drug flow that is  occurring. This bill will continue the tax relief that gave us a great  and strong economy. It is also providing savings to the American people  by rooting out waste, abuse, and fraud.

Despite this, the media and the left want to malign this resolution,  stating, for instance, that Medicaid is going to be reduced. That is  absolutely not true. That is a false claim.

Let me say it from the not-so-cheap seats: No Medicaid or Medicare  benefits will be reduced.

The only cuts will be to waste, abuse, fraud, and ineligibility in  the system if found, which I believe 98 percent of Americans do  support.

Look, we are overspending by nearly $2 trillion a year. Clearly, any  business, any company, any family, any government with such a spending  problem must make corrections, which is what we are doing and what  President Trump said he would do upon being elected.

This resolution will help usher in the golden age in America, and I  am very happy to be supportive of it.
