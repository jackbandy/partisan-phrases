Stop Illegal Entry Act of 2025


Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R.  3486. Let's be clear. This bill is not about border security. It is  about pouring gasoline on a prison system that is already bloated,  broken, and unjust.

While American families are begging us to release the Epstein files,  to lower grocery prices, to keep doctors' offices open, to confront  mass shootings, Republicans have chosen to waste our time and taxpayer  dollars on a bill that criminalizes what is already a crime under  Federal law.

This legislation would impose draconian mandatory minimums, even life  sentences, for nonviolent acts like returning to reunite with loved  ones. That is not justice. That is cruelty. We should be investing in  humane immigration policies, not building more cages. Expanding prisons  has never made us safer. It rips families apart, disproportionately  targeting Black and Brown communities, and it deepens cycles of poverty  and punishment that we should be dismantling, not expanding.

Mandatory minimums don't deter migration. They tie judges' hands,  treat every case the same, and devastate communities. We don't need  harsher prison sentences. We need pathways and solutions that actually  work.

H.R. 3486 is punitive, expensive, and unnecessary. It is waste. It is  fraud. It is abuse. I urge my colleagues to stop scapegoating  immigrants, stop playing politics with people's lives, and vote ``no''  on this cruel and cynical bill.
