Trump Must Reverse Course


Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise as the ranking member of the  House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on South and Central Asia to sound  the  alarm about the deterioration of our strategic partnership with India  at the hands of Donald Trump.

As two major democracies and economies, U.S.-India cooperation is  essential to advancing our mutual interests and confronting our shared  competitors.

President Biden took the relationship to new heights, strengthening  collaboration on defense, strategic technologies, and the Quad.

In mere months, Trump's reckless foreign policy style has unraveled  decades of progress, suddenly slapping India with 50 percent tariffs  because his fragile ego was so triggered.

Republicans have refused to go to bat for the U.S.-India relationship  when it really matters, beholden to their MAGA isolationist base.

This partnership is too important to be sacrificed by Trump's ego and  Republican complicity. Trump must reverse course, make a deal, and fix  the damage that he has caused. He needs to get his act together on  behalf of this country and our relationship with India.
