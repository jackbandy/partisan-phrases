Relating to Consideration of the Senate Amendment to H.R. Rescissions Act of 2025


Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

I rise today in opposition to the rule to consider the rescissions  package of  2025 and its reckless cuts to public broadcasting.

It is not hyperbole to say that public broadcasting saves lives  during emergency situations and natural disasters. My State knows that  firsthand.

When Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina last year,  public broadcasting was there when traditional communication failed.  Widespread power, cellular, and internet outages meant that, for  thousands of North Carolinians, public radio was how they received  their news.

Our local public broadcasting stations provided lifesaving updates  for our residents, broadcasted emergency resource information like food  and water and distribution, and gave a direct line for North  Carolinians to speak to their communities.

Slashing public broadcasting funding will limit their ability to  operate during crises and delay critical information to the people who  need it most.

Make no mistake: Without public broadcasting, we would have seen more  lives lost in Helene. We need to protect these stations so we can  protect our communities.
