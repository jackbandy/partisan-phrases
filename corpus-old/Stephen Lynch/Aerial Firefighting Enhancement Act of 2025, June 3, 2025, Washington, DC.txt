Aerial Firefighting Enhancement Act of 2025


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 160, the Aerial Firefighting  Enhancement Act.

This bill amends the Wildfire Suppression Aircraft Transfer Act of  1996 to reauthorize the sale of aircraft and parts by the Defense  Department for wildfire suppression for 10 years.

This bill reauthorizes the Secretary of Defense to sell excess  Department of Defense aircraft and aircraft parts, which are acceptable  for commercial sale to persons or entities that contract with the  government for the delivery of fire retardants or water by air to  suppress wildfires. The aircraft and parts could only be used for fire  suppression.

This bill will help the U.S. suppress wildfires and recognizes the  unfortunate reality that fire season is now year-round and additional  resources, including aircraft, are required to effectively suppress  catastrophic wildfires.

S. 160 is a bipartisan, commonsense bill that will help the United  States maintain a robust fleet of wildfire suppression aircraft. I urge  all of my colleagues to support this bill, the Aerial Firefighting  Enhancement Act.
