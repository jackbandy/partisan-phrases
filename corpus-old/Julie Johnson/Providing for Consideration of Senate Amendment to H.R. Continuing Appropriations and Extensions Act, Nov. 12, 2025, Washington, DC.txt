Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this bill. I am a  ``hell no'' vote on any legislation that strips healthcare away from  millions of Texans.

In my district, nearly 100,000 of my constituents rely on the  Affordable Care Act's tax credits to pay for their coverage. Without  these lifesaving credits, many of them will go without healthcare at  all.

Every day during this shutdown, my office has heard from thousands of  families across my district saying: For the love of God, save my  healthcare.

Tucked away in this bill is a brazen payoff of millions of taxpayer  dollars funneled to the benefit of a handful of Senators. While  families are struggling to afford groceries and healthcare, we are  being asked to sign off on a deal that lines the pockets of the very  people who wrote it. That is an insult to every hardworking taxpayer  who expects honesty from their government.

The contrast could not be clearer. Republicans are operating in the  currency of cruelty and corruption while Democrats are fighting with  courage and compassion. The American people deserve better, and I will  never stop fighting to protect the basic necessities that every family  needs to survive.
