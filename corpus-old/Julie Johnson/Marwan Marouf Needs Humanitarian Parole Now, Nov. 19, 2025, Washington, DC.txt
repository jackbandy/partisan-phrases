Marwan Marouf Needs Humanitarian Parole Now


Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of  my constituent, Marwan Marouf.

Marwan has lived in the United States for more than 40 years. He is a  devoted father of U.S. citizens, a respected community leader, and he  has no criminal history. He suffers from a life-threatening heart  condition and has fully complied with every requirement of our  immigration system, submitting every application on time, providing  extensive documentation, and cooperating completely with USCIS.

Yet, 2 months ago, after dropping his 15-year-old son off at school,  Marwan was detained by ICE. This is a man who founded the largest Boy  Scout troop in north Texas, who delivered food and supplies to families  across our community during the pandemic, and who is recognized by the  city of Richardson for his outstanding service to our community.

Tomorrow, Marwan faces a proceeding where he will face removal. I  have repeatedly requested humanitarian parole on his behalf, and those  requests have gone unanswered.

Mr. Speaker, Marwan is exactly the kind of person humanitarian parole  was created for: a dedicated public servant, husband, and father. I  urge DHS to grant him humanitarian parole.
