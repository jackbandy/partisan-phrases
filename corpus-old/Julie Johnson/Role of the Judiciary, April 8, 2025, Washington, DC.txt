Role of the Judiciary


Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am rising in opposition to the  Republicans' dismantling of the Judiciary Act. It is not about justice;  it is about power. It is a full-scale assault on our Constitution, the  courts, and the people those courts are meant to protect.

The American people must be able to challenge unconstitutional laws  and seek relief when they are harmed. That is the role of the  judiciary, to be a check on our government from overreach and to  safeguard our public rights. Instead of respecting that, Republicans  are attacking judicial independence because they don't like the outcome  when the courts rule against them.

Earlier today, Republicans in debate acknowledged that President  Trump has been overruled by judges more than the last three Presidents  combined, and that is because he is insistent on extending an overreach  of the executive branch. We have the courts to safeguard that.

What the Republicans are trying to do is to require every single  person who has been harmed in any way to file individual lawsuits,  clogging up our courts, requiring them to hire expensive attorneys,  precluding their access to the courts. It is unconstitutional, and this  rule must be voted down. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote  against it.
