Visit to Bluebonnet Detention Facility


Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, I visited the  Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas, about 3 hours outside of  Dallas. What I saw was deeply disturbing. It speaks to the harmful  policies under Donald Trump and Secretary Noem, policies that are  ripping families apart, wasting taxpayer dollars, and making our  communities less safe.

Bluebonnet was built to house prisoners under the Texas Department of  Criminal Justice, but in 2019 the first Trump administration handed a  contract to a private prison company to convert it into an ICE  detention center. Today, instead of prioritizing dangerous criminals,  those who commit rape, murder, or trafficking drugs, people who pose  real threats to our communities, ICE is filling this facility with  people who have done absolutely nothing wrong and are being targeted  simply because of the color of their skin.

As a Member of Congress and as a member of the Homeland Security  Committee, I have both the right and the responsibility to see what is  happening inside these facilities. For years, Members of Congress could  visit unannounced, but under Secretary Noem, that right was stripped  away. My team and I worked for weeks just to gain entry and finally got  a scheduled appointment.

When I visited, 1,079 people were being detained at Bluebonnet.  Nearly 700 of them, almost two-thirds, were designated by ICE itself as  a low threat. Let me repeat: Hundreds of people with no violent  history, no record of serious crimes, targeted solely because of the  color of their skin, were denied their constitutional rights and then  locked away in a detention center.

I met with several detained individuals. Here is a common story that  we came across. A man came here more than two decades ago and worked a  blue-collar job. He raised his family in Texas. He has children whom he  loves and who depend on him. He hasn't committed any violent crimes or  sold any drugs. His only offense was a traffic stop. Now, he faces  deportation to a country he left decades ago.

My question is: How is this fair? Why are people who are contributing  to our economy, who are working hard and making sure that our citizens  are being taken care of, being targeted instead of all of the violent  criminals?

This is what is happening under Trump. They are not prioritizing  threats to public safety. They are not going after violent offenders.  They are taking workers out of our economy. They are spreading fear in  communities where families should feel safe, and they are doing it with  our taxpayer dollars.

Let me be very clear. Locking up people who pose no danger to our  communities does not make us safer. It weakens us. It destabilizes  families. It wastes resources that should be used to pursue violent  criminals, traffickers, and those who actually endanger our neighbors.

As I left the detention center that day, an employee from ICE made  one request: Stop politicizing us.

It is the White House that needs to hear this message most of all.  Trump and Secretary Noem are not using taxpayer dollars to keep  communities safe; they are using it as political theater. They dress up  in ICE jackets, parade through detention centers, and turn detainees  into props for their campaigns.

This isn't law enforcement. It is performance. It makes a mockery of  our justice system by prioritizing sensational videos over safety and  cruelty over compassion. This is political theater at the expense of  human lives.

We need a smarter and fairer approach. That means alternatives to  detention that allow people to remain with their families while their  case moves forward. It means investing in an immigration system that is  fair, fast, and final so that people can have their cases heard in  front of a judge and are not left in limbo for years. It means  prioritizing dangerous individuals, not hardworking parents who have  built their lives in our communities.

People who play by the rules, follow the law, and adhere to the  guidelines laid out before them should never be targeted because of the  color of their skin and denied due process. Our society should not  accept this, and this administration needs to put a stop to this  injustice.

That is what I saw at Bluebonnet, a betrayal of our values as a  nation. We are a country of immigrants. We are a country that claims to  honor family, community, and fairness. Yet, the Trump administration is  locking up people who are simply trying to work, raise families, and  contribute to our community. This is not about fairness or safety, and  it is not who we claim to be as Americans.

Congress must step up and hold this administration accountable. We  must work in a bipartisan way to build an immigration system that keeps  people safe and ensures that people's rights are respected. Locking up  neighbors who pose no threat does not make us stronger. It divides us.  It weakens us, and it undermines everything that we stand for.
