Don't Vote for A Bill That Dismantles the Government


Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, the House is soon going to vote  on some legislation that guts Medicaid and it slashes healthcare for  veterans. It cuts funding from important infrastructure projects and  takes food away from families struggling to survive.

We have a choice: We can invest in the people we serve, or we can let  Republicans burn it down.

I am fighting for $2 million to help our Dallas Police Officers  tackle violent crime, gangs, and drug trafficking. I am working to  secure over $1 million to upgrade security at Dallas Fort Worth  International Airport because keeping Americans safe should not be up  for debate.

We can fund these programs, but instead of trying to make government  work, Republicans are doing everything they can to break it, stripping  away services that millions of people rely on.

I will not vote for a bill that carries out Trump's mission to  dismantle our government. I will not vote for a bill that takes  healthcare, food, and security from the people who need it most,  especially as they work to line the pockets of Trump and his friends on  the backs of hardworking Americans.

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleague to do what is right and vote ``no''  on this bill. Let's stand up for the people who sent us here.
