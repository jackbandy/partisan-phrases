Consumer Safety Technology Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1770, the Consumer  Safety Technology Act.

Our consumer protection agencies play a critical role in ensuring  unsafe products do not enter the U.S. market. Advancements in  technology, especially as it relates to artificial intelligence, have  the potential to help alleviate the stress some of these agencies may  face in being underfunded and understaffed.

H.R. 1770 would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to  stay up-to-date on new and emerging technologies by integrating them  into their daily agency functions. It also requires the Federal Trade  Commission to study blockchain technologies and tokens.

The CPSC and the FTC do important work to protect all Americans from  dangerous products, including emerging technologies. While this bill  will help assist in those efforts, it is no replacement for strong,  independent, and bipartisan agencies or proper funding and staffing  levels.

I hope, in addition to supporting this bill, that my Republican  colleagues will finally speak up against President Trump's dangerous  attempts to weaken or even dismantle these critical agencies.

I commend Representative Soto for his leadership on this issue, and I  encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1770.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill  on a bipartisan basis. It is important from a consumer safety point of  view.
