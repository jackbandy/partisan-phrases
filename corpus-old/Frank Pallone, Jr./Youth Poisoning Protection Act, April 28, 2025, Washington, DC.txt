Youth Poisoning Protection Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1442, the Youth  Poisoning Protection Act.

Sodium nitrite is a highly toxic substance. Ingesting even a small  amount is likely to be fatal. Unfortunately, online forums are  providing detailed instructions and real-time guidance on how to  acquire and use this substance to take their own lives. Sadly,  according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  this has led to a sharp increase in self-poisoning using sodium  nitrite.

By banning the sale of high-concentrate sodium nitrite to consumers,  H.R. 1442 will make it less accessible to people contemplating suicide.  Experts have made it clear that there is no good reason for consumers  to purchase sodium nitrite at such high concentrations.

I commend Representative Trahan for her leadership on this issue, and  I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I reserve the balance of my  time.

Mr. PALLONE.  Mr. Speaker, as you can see, a lot of these consumer protection  bills that we are considering today are actually very important, as is  this. I urge bipartisan support and yield back the balance of my time.
