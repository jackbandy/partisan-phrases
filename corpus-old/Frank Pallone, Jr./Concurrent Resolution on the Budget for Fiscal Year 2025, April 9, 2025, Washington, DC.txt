Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have heard my Republican colleagues today  admit that they were extending the tax cut for the rich and the large  corporations. I have heard them say they are worried about the debt.  Certainly, this resolution would also increase the debt.

What I have not heard the majority admit is that they are cutting  Medicaid to pay for all this. They will not admit that. This is the  second time now the budget resolution passed the House, and the budget  resolution came over from the Senate. They are going to vote today on  instructing my committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, to cut  $880 billion at least.

Mr. Boyle, our ranking member, pointed out that the CBO got back to  us and said that most, if not all, of that has to come from Medicaid  cuts.

My Republican colleagues should please admit that they are voting  today on Medicaid cuts. Do not deny it. Do not try to put it aside.  That is what this is all about.

What does that mean? It means there is less money to the States, so  they are going to cut back on nursing home care and on the money that  goes to hospitals. Hospitals and nursing homes will close, or they will  have such terrible quality of service or, in the case of the hospitals,  will pass on those extra costs to other people who have insurance, and  their insurance premiums go up.

What about people with disabilities? Most of them are dependent on  Medicaid. Their services will be eliminated or cut back, as well.

Please, understand that a vote for this by the Republicans today is a  vote to cut people's healthcare, to reduce their services, to kick  people out of nursing homes, and to make hospitals unavailable.
