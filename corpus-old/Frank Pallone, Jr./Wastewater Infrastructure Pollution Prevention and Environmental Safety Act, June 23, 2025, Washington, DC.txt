Wastewater Infrastructure Pollution Prevention and Environmental Safety Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 2269, the WIPPES Act.

The improper disposal of nonflushable wipes can damage plumbing and  lead to environmental contamination and pollution. Environmentalists  from across the country have expressed the need for manufacturers to  clearly label their wet wipe products so consumers know how to properly  dispose of them.

This bill ensures that wipe manufacturers, and other covered  entities, clearly and conspicuously label nonflushable wipes as just  that.

By requiring these labels on the packaging of all nonflushable wipes,  this bill will help ensure our plumbing and wastewater treatment  facilities do not break down as a result of these wipes.

However, the implementation and enforcement of this bill requires a  strong, independent, and bipartisan Federal Trade Commission. House  Republicans have stood by in silence as this critical agency is being  compromised by President Trump's illegal attempts to remove the two  Democratic commissioners from their posts, undermining the legitimacy  and transparency of the FTC.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to stand up for the two  representatives, or I should say for the restoration of an independent  FTC, to ensure this bill and the many others that are tasked with  implementing are fully effective and enforced without fear or favor. We  need a strong FTC.

I commend Representatives Mullin and McClain for their leadership of  this issue.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation. I do  think that from an environmental point of view and to protect our waste  treatment facilities this is important legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
