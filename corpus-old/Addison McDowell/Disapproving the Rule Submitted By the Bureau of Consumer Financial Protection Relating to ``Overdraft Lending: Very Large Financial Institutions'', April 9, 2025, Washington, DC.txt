Disapproving the Rule Submitted By the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Relating to ``Overdraft Lending: Very Large Financial Institutions''


Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution to  overturn a ludicrous rule which imposes government price controls on  financial institutions across the country.

The Biden administration's CFPB issued this rule right before they  left town, and they sold it as a defense of consumers. Mr. Speaker, you  can say something a million times, and it still won't make it true.

Instead of helping consumers, government price controls will simply  lead to more denied transactions and less consumer freedom.

Here is the reality, Mr. Speaker: Many local banks across the country  already offer overdraft services that provide Americans a safety net on  their financial services, and it is exactly these types of services  that foster competition, giving consumers a choice in where to bank.

This resolution would repeal the Biden administration's government  price control scheme. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  resolution.
