Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Chair, while we may not agree on whose State has  better barbecue, one thing we do agree on is that today is a momentous  day; not for one party, but for all Americans. Today, we take a giant  step toward fulfilling the mandate given by millions of Americans.

For too long, the people's interests have been drowned out by an  agenda pursued by elite, leftwing politicians. The elite, leftwing  politicians don't feel the impact of their reckless policies. Whether  it be pursuing open border policies or policies that fuel inflation, it  is normal citizens who feel the impact.

Today, we start the process of restoring America's strength. Rather  than pursue a reckless, ideological joyride agenda, this resolution  paves the way for historic investment in our country's border security,  permanent tax relief for the middle class, getting rid of the inflation  tax that has hit the working class, and rooting out waste, fraud, and  abuse throughout our government.

Mr. Chair, Americans demand better. This resolution does that. I urge  a ``yes'' vote.
