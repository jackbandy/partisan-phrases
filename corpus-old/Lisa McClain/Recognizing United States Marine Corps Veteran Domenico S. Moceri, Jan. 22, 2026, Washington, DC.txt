Recognizing United States Marine Corps Veteran Domenico S. Moceri


Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with deep respect and  gratitude to recognize the honorable service of United States Marine  Corps veteran, Domenico S. Moceri, our distinguished Veteran of the  Month for January 2026. His years of service reflect courage,  adaptability, and an unwavering commitment to mission and community.

Born and raised in Rochester Hills, Michigan, he graduated from Eaton  Academy before answering the call to serve his country. He enlisted in  the Marine Corps on November 7, 2017, completing recruit training at  Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, followed by infantry training  at the School of Infantry.

During his military career, Domenico served as an Infantry Rifleman  and later as a Small Unmanned Aircraft System Operator. He was assigned  to 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, Bravo Company, where he served as an  Automatic Rifleman and advanced to become a Senior SUAS Operator. He  later transferred to 6th Marine Regiment Headquarters Battalion,  expanding his technical and operational expertise in unmanned aerial  systems.

Mr. Moceri's service included multiple overseas assignments in  challenging environments. Early in his career, he joined a Special  Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force for operations in Norway, where he  participated in NATO exercises under Operation Thunder Reindeer and  completed intensive arctic survival training. Later, he deployed with  the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit during Operation Allies Refuge,  contributing to a critical mission that secured the safe relocation of  Afghan allies and demonstrated the Marine Corps' commitment to  humanitarian assistance and international security.

Throughout his service, Domenico earned numerous decorations,  including the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, two Marine Corps  Good Conduct Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, the  Afghanistan Campaign Medal with one Bronze Service Star, the Global War  on Terrorism Service Medal, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon with one  Bronze Service Star, and the Presidential Unit Citation.

Following his honorable discharge in 2023, Mr. Moceri returned to  Michigan and continues to serve his community as a Construction Project  Manager with Moceri Companies, supporting development projects across  Lake Orion, Auburn Hills, Rochester Hills, and the City of Rochester.  He remains actively engaged in the veteran community as a member of VFW  Post 334, exemplifying the same discipline, integrity, and commitment  that marked his military service.

Mr. Speaker, Domenico Moceri's honorable service to our Nation and  his continued dedication to his community exemplify the very best of  the United States Marine Corps, and it is my privilege to recognize him  as our Veteran of the Month.
