Recognizing Community First Health Centers on 50 Years of Service to the Ninth Congressional District


Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Community First  Health Centers, a truly remarkable organization that has spent the last  50 years delivering accessible, high-quality, patient-centered health  care, driven by a team of respectful and compassionate health  professionals.

Since opening its doors in 1975, Community First Health Centers has  placed patients at the heart of its mission. For over five decades, it  has not only provided vital medical services but also built strong  connections to community support systems and resources.

Serving over 10,000 Michigan residents, the organization provides  quality medical, behavioral, and educational health services. Community  First Health Centers is also a leader in key neighborhood programs,  including Homeless Health Care, Primary Health Care, and Transportation  Services. Each one of these programs serves as a testament to their  unwavering commitment to community well-being.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the Community First Health  Centers staff and volunteers who have worked tirelessly to bring  accessible, high-quality healthcare to communities across Michigan's  Ninth Congressional District. The staff, volunteers, and leadership of  Community First Health Centers should be immensely proud of this  milestone and the impact they have made over the past five decades.
