Recognizing Robert Longo As April 2025 Veteran of the Month


Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with profound respect and  gratitude to recognize the exceptional service and unwavering  dedication of Robert Anthony Longo, a proud veteran of the United  States Air Force and our esteemed Veteran of the Month for April 2025  from Michigan's 9th Congressional District. His lifelong commitment to  duty, both in uniform and beyond, exemplifies the highest ideals of  service, sacrifice, and community.

Robert Longo answered the call to serve his country in July 1968,  enlisting in the United States Air Force at the height of the Vietnam  War. Over the next four years, he attained the rank of Buck Sergeant  and was assigned to the Military Airlift Command (MAC) in New Jersey,  where he served as a crew chief and aircraft mechanic on the C-141  Starlifter. His critical role ensured the operational readiness of  military transport aircraft, supporting strategic global airlift  operations that spanned four continents and 20 countries. Longo's  expertise took him through advanced training at Edwards Air Force Base  and flight school in Washington, D.C., further strengthening his  contributions to the Air Force's mission.

After completing his military service in April 1972, Longo continued  his lifelong commitment to helping others, particularly his fellow  veterans. For the past six years, he has served as a chaplain,  providing spiritual guidance and emotional support to those who have  sacrificed for our nation. Today, he serves as Chaplain for People of  Impact at Freedom Lake in Lapeer, Michigan, a nonprofit organization  dedicated to assisting veterans with transitional housing, job  placement, and recovery support. He also serves as Chaplain for the  Lakepoint Church Veterans Ministry, which further exemplifies his  devotion to uplifting and strengthening the veteran community.

Beyond his professional and military service, Robert Longo is a  devoted family man. He and his wife, Cindy, have shared 38 years of  marriage, raising triplets--one son and two daughters--who are now 33  years old. He is also a proud grandfather to two grandchildren,  instilling in them the same values of dedication and service that have  guided his own life.

Robert Anthony Longo's story is one of duty, perseverance, and  selfless service. His contributions to the United States Air Force and  his continued efforts to support veterans in need reflect the very best  of our Nation's values. His legacy of service is an inspiration to all  who know him.

Mr. Speaker, let us express our deepest gratitude to Robert Longo for  his military service and his unwavering dedication to his fellow  veterans. His life's work reminds us of the strength and resilience of  those who have worn the uniform, and we honor his contributions to our  country and community.
