Recognizing United States Marine Sgt Richard Loughran As July 2025 Veteran of the Month


Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with profound respect and  gratitude to recognize the extraordinary service and unwavering  dedication of Sgt. Richard Loughran, a proud veteran of the United  States Marine Corps and our distinguished Veteran of the Month for July  2025 from Michigan's 9th Congressional District. His exceptional  military career and steadfast commitment to duty, excellence, and  patriotism embody the very best of American service.

Richard Loughran answered the call to serve his country at the young  age of 17--with his father's permission--when he enlisted in the United  States Marine Corps. He graduated from the Detroit Institute of  Technology in 1942 and enlisted in 1943. He began basic training and  soon after completed training as a Private First Class, demonstrating  his strong performance upon graduation. Richard continued to  demonstrate his strong performance and high skill set when he was  recruited to the Communication Intelligence Group as a Japanese Code  Interpreter in the Pacific Theater during World War II.

Over his three years of service, Richard was on the battlefields of  Tinian, Saipan, Guam, and Okinawa. During these years, Richard also  took part in the Wind Talkers Initiative. This initiative involved the  use of the Native American language of Navajo by the U.S. military to  create coded messages the Japanese couldn't decipher. Being a part of  this initiative highlights Richard's high aptitude in languages and his  deep dedication to serving our country.

Richard was also a part of the radio deception that led to the 1942  Battle of Midway. In this operation, codebreakers successfully  deciphered Japanese naval codes and intercepted messages detailing an  attack, which was later confirmed to be targeting Midway. Richard's  group also contributed to the Buckner Bay capture of a German Enigma  Code Machine. Being involved in such critical turning points in United  States history is a testament to Richard's intelligence, bravery, and  impact.

After his service, Richard earned an Associate's Degree in  Engineering from Valparaiso Institute, using that knowledge to become a  manufacturer's representative. In 1961, he launched his own business-- Data Electronics--which grew across five states and demonstrated his  entrepreneurial drive and success in the field.

In the years that followed, Richard pursued a wide range of  interests, from photography to the art of stage makeup. He even  revitalized a struggling makeup studio in Chicago, turning it into a  thriving business. More recently, he continued his service to others  through volunteering for the Marine Corps. Richard helped run the Toys  for Tots program in Illinois and served as an ombudsman for local  nursing homes. His dedication earned him the title of Volunteer of the  Year, further demonstrating his compassion and commitment to community.

Richard is also a frequent guest speaker at local elementary and  middle schools, where he shares his World War II experiences with  younger generations, ensuring that the legacy of service and sacrifice  lives on.

Above all, Richard is a loving husband and devoted father. Together  with his wife, he raised three children. He recently celebrated his  100th birthday, surrounded by over fifty family members including  seventeen great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren, a  remarkable milestone befitting a remarkable man.

Mr. Speaker, let us express our sincerest appreciation to Richard  Loughran for his outstanding military service and for his excellent  acts of valor that have protected our country and our freedoms in our  great nation. His story is a testament to the American spirit of  service, sacrifice, and resolve, and it is an honor to recognize him as  our Veteran of the Month.
