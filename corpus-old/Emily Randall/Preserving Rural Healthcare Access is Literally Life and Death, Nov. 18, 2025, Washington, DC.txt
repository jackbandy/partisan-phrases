Preserving Rural Healthcare Access is Literally Life and Death


Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, as the Representative of a district full of  forests, mountains, and rugged coastlines that are beautiful but often  mean a long drive to the hospital, I know that preserving rural  healthcare access is literally life and death in our communities.

Tribal health clinics, federally qualified health centers, rural  hospitals, and independent providers are facing challenge upon  challenge upon challenge. At Grays Harbor Community Hospital, I saw  firsthand how tariffs are driving up costs for medical devices and  supplies, adding financial strain to already stretched rural  facilities.

The hospital recently invested in a new MRI machine, a critical  upgrade that offers faster scans and higher resolution images, but  because of tariffs, they had to pay significantly more money to  purchase this machine. That is money they now can't use for other  things.

Advanced medical equipment like this is increasingly expensive under  the Trump administration. Add to that the Medicaid cuts in the big,  ugly bill and the end of the ACA tax credits, the strain and  uncertainty is challenging.

On National Rural Health Day, we should be working together to expand  care, not making it more difficult for rural communities.
