Jay P. Larson Post Office Building


Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2466. This is a  bipartisan bill to rename a local Illinois post office after Jay  Larson, who served his community as a dedicated letter carrier.

Jay Larson was killed while doing his job, delivering mail to his  community. Mr. Larson was one of four people killed in attacks that  took place last year in Rockford, Illinois. He gave more than 25 years  of service to the United States Postal Service.

Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Congressman Sorensen, for  advocating on behalf of his constituent and bringing this bill to the  floor.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 2466, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
