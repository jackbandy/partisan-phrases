Dalles Watershed Development Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 655, the Dalles Watershed  Development Act, introduced by my colleague from the Pacific Northwest,  Representative Bentz from Oregon.

This bill would direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey  approximately 150 acres of Federal land in the Mount Hood National  Forest to the City of The Dalles, Oregon.

This land is vital to the City's watershed and supports roughly 80  percent of its annual water supply. Local ownership of this land will  allow the City to better manage its water resources, protect water  quality, and plan for future water infrastructure.

Under the bill, the land transfer would occur at no cost to the City  and be subject to valid existing rights.

The City would cover the administrative expenses of the conveyance,  including surveying, and the conveyance would be executed by quitclaim  deed.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority for working with us to include  language that guarantees the property is used by the City for the  public in perpetuity. With this important update, the legislation  offers a practical, bipartisan solution to address clear infrastructure  need and to adapt to a changing climate in which water resources are  becoming more and more scarce. I thank Representative Bentz for his  leadership on this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 655, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
