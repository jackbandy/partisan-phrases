Adams Memorial-Great American Heroes Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2306, legislation introduced  by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar).

This bill would extend the authority for the Adams Memorial  Commission and authorize a prominent location for the eventual memorial  to commemorate the legacy and contributions of John Adams and the  entire Adams family, including Abigail and their son, John Quincy  Adams.

It has been nearly a quarter-century since Congress first authorized  this memorial in 2001. It is time to finish what we started.

We are speaking of a family that didn't merely participate in the  American experiment but helped define it. Thomas Jefferson called John  Adams the Colossus of Independence, and his thoughts on government  frame the very Constitution we swear to uphold every day we report to  work here in our Nation's Capitol.

Abigail Adams was an early beacon for women's rights, and John Quincy  Adams fought the gag rule and slavery right here in the House. The  contributions of the Adams family to the founding and development of  our country are countless.

Finally, because John Adams was the first to live in the White House,  it is only fitting that this memorial will be located nearby. We can  only hope that the hard work, wisdom, and dedication of these American  heroes rub off on the current and future residents of the White House.

I thank Representative Moolenaar and all of the members of the Adams  Memorial Commission for their dedication to this project. Hopefully, we  will all be able to visit the new memorial very soon.

Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.

Ms. RANDALL.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
