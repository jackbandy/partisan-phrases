Studying Nepa's Impact on Projects Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Representative Yakym's  Studying NEPA's Impact on Projects Act. This legislation would direct  agencies to  submit to the Council on Environmental Quality an annual report on NEPA  lawsuits filed, the basis for the legal claim, and the outcome, if  applicable.

I believe these reports will show there are far fewer NEPA lawsuits  holding up projects than my colleagues across the aisle sometimes argue  about, but regardless, this will be good data for decisionmakers to  have.

The bill would also require reporting on the time it takes agencies  to complete environmental impact statements and the number of pages of  those analyses. The Council on Environmental Quality will then report  annually on average lengths of time, page counts, and any directional  trends.

I appreciate the majority working with us to also include  requirements for disaggregating reporting to show page limits and  timelines pre- and post-passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. This  law placed new limits on page counts and 2-year deadlines for  environmental impact statements. It will be important for us to know if  these new requirements are really working.

Mr. Speaker, again, I support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.
