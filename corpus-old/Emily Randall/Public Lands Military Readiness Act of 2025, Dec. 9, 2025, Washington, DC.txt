Public Lands Military Readiness Act of 2025


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5131, legislation introduced  by my colleague from Alaska (Mr. Begich). This important bill will  extend the public land withdrawals for several military installations  that operate on public lands in Alaska, California, and New Mexico.

Our public lands do a lot. As we have already discussed on the floor  of the House today, they mean a lot to the American people.

One critical function that many Americans may not know about is their  role in supporting military training, readiness, and other strategic  missions throughout the country.

The use of these lands, as made possible by the extensions provided  by this bill, is incredibly important to the U.S. Army and the  Department of Defense. I thank the majority for working with us in a  bipartisan manner to ensure swift consideration of these provisions.

A version of this language is expected to be included in this year's  final version of the National Defense Authorization Act, which is  expected to get a floor vote very soon. This will ensure that the  critical operations at each of these installations proceed without  interruption.

Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Begich for his work on  this bill.

Ms. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
