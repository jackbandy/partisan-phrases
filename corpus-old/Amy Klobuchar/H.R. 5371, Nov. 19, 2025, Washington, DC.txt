H.R. 5371


Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the legislation  that was recently signed into law to fund the Federal Government  through January 30, 2026. Like many of my colleagues and people across  the country, I wanted the shutdown to end. I also believe the  legislation to reopen the government should have included provisions to  lower escalating healthcare costs. Lowering costs overall, from  healthcare to groceries to electricity, is the top priority for  Minnesotans and for me. The Nation is facing a healthcare crisis that  will raise costs and threaten access to healthcare for many Minnesotans  if Congress does not act.

If the President and congressional Republicans do not extend the  healthcare tax credits, the health insurance premiums of millions of  Americans will double next year. This premium increase will be felt by  many, including families, small businesses and their employees, and  people living in rural communities. I am committed to lowering  healthcare costs and will do everything I can to get this done. I urge  my colleagues to do the same.
