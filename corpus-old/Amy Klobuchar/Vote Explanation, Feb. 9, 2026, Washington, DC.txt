Vote Explanation


Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I was unable to cast a vote on rollcall  vote No. 623, passage of H.J. Res. 130, disapproving the Bureau of Land  Management resource management plan that made certain land managed by  the Buffalo Field Office unavailable for new coal leases.

Had I been present, I would have voted against the measure as I had  voted against the identical Senate companion, S. 89, the day before,  rollcall vote No. 621. The Congressional Review Act is not the  appropriate tool for reversing Bureau of Land Management decisions that  are developed with years of analysis and public engagement.
