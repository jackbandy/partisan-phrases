Paul Amendment No. 3941 to H.R. 5371


Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my concerns  regarding the hemp provisions in this bill. I voted against the motion  to table Paul amendment No. 3941. I strongly support protecting kids  and ensuring they do not have access to harmful products. The  provisions in the funding bill, however, did not strike the right  balance and would have put small businesses and jobs in my State at  risk. I believe efforts by Congress to regulate hemp products should  account for States like Minnesota that already have strong regulations  in place rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Moving forward, we  should protect our kids and support our small businesses.
