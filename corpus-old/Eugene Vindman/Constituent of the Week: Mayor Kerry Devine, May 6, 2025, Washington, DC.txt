Constituent of the Week: Mayor Kerry Devine


Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, today, on National Teacher Day, I rise to  recognize Fredericksburg Mayor Kerry Devine as this week's Constituent  of the Week.

Mayor Devine also spends her time as a history teacher in Stafford  County. She is a role model in civic leadership, both for the city of  Fredericksburg and for her students in Stafford.

Whether in city hall or in the classroom, she has made community a  cornerstone of her tenure as a public servant and educator. She has  also tirelessly worked to increase reading comprehension, counter the  harmful impacts of social media on young people, and she supports  phone-free schools.

Her work reminds us that educators don't just teach; they shape the  future. As a dad of two kids who have attended Virginia schools, I am  grateful.

Mr. Speaker, today, I thank Mayor Devine and all the teachers across  Virginia's Seventh Congressional District who go above and beyond to  make sure every student feels seen, valued, and empowered. Their work  is incredibly important.
