Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act


Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, as the vice ranking member of the Commodity  Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development Subcommittee of the  House Committee on Agriculture, I rise today in support of both the  CLARITY and GENIUS Acts.

These bills aren't perfect, but digital innovation is critical to our  economy, and I support a regulatory framework that protects consumers  in the financial system.

However, I am concerned about the ability of certain officials to use  these assets for self-enrichment at the highest levels of our  government. These bills ensure Members of Congress and many other  government officials must abide by ethics rules that we expect from  government officials, allowing the industry to innovate as it should.  Two individuals are exempted, the President and Vice President.

This is incredibly dangerous, and it undermines confidence in this  important industry. It also further degrades the public trust in our  government, especially at a time when that trust is already eroded by  the President's refusal to release the Epstein files.

We need to take important steps to establish a regulatory framework  for digital assets to thrive and to restore public trust. We need  action now, and I hope we can close these loopholes.
