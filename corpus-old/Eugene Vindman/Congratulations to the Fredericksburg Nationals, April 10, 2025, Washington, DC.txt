Congratulations to the Fredericksburg Nationals


Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Fredericksburg Nationals on winning their first-ever Carolina League  Championship.

Under manager Jake Lowery's leadership, the team made a thrilling  late-season run and delivered a dominant performance to win the  championship.

Standout prospects like Seaver King and Travis Sykora showed  incredible talent, while veteran leaders brought unity and heart to the  clubhouse.

My team was honored to present a congratulatory letter when joining  their recent ring ceremony and celebration.

This win is not just a triumph for the team; it is a moment of pride  for owner Art Silber, his family, and the entire Fredericksburg  community.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Fredericksburg Nats on the  unforgettable season and championship well earned.
