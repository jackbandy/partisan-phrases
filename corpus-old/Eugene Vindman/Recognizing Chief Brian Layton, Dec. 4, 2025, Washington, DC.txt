Recognizing Chief Brian Layton


Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Chief Brian  Layton on his retirement from the Fredericksburg Police Department  after three decades of service.

Chief Layton has served in the department since 1994 and as chief  since January 2020. He has strengthened department recruitment and  retention, modernized their operations, and is expected to soon achieve  national accreditation for the city's emergency 911 center.

The role that Chief Layton has played in regional public safety is  invaluable. On behalf of the city of Fredericksburg and its residents,  I extend our deepest gratitude to Chief Layton for his unwavering  service and dedication. His impact on our community will be felt for  years to come.

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to congratulate Chief Layton on this well- earned moment and recognize him as this week's constituent of the week.  I wish him a restful retirement.
