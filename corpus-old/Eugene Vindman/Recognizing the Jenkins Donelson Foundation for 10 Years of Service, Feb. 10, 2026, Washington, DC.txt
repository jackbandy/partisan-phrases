Recognizing the Jenkins Donelson Foundation for 10 Years of Service


Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the  Jenkins Donelson Foundation (JDF) located in Stafford, Virginia for  their decade of service to the communities of the District of Columbia,  Maryland, and Virginia.

Since 2016, the Jenkins Donelson Foundation have worked to promote  health and healthy lifestyles for the homeless, veterans, and  underserved communities. Over the years, they have provided socks,  shoes, foot care supplies, clothing, blankets, beds/bedding,  kitchenware, bathroom goods, and toys.

In addition to their core activities, the JDF recently began hosting  The Robert E. Jenkins Scholastic Chess Tournament, named after co- founder Robert Jenkins, who was an avid chess player. These tournaments  help students develop decision-making and strategic thinking skills,  which help improve their mental and physical well-being.

The JDF has also hosted numerous interactive Health Fairs, offering  critical information on diabetes, hypertension, healthy eating, and  foot health. Most notably, the JDF was recognized as a Top-Rated  Nonprofit by Great Nonprofits, a prestigious recognition that reflects  their unwavering dedication to serving our community.

I want to thank all the board members and volunteers that play a  crucial role in making sure our communities have access to these  necessary resources.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating and  honoring the Jenkins Donelson Foundation for their ten years of service  in our community. I look forward to witnessing their continued impact  in the years to come.
