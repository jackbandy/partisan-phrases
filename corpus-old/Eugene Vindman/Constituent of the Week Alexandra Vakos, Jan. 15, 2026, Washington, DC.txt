Constituent of the Week Alexandra Vakos


Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Alexandra  Vakos on being named the 2025 Distinguished Assistant of the Year in a  medium-sized office by the Virginia Association of Commonwealth's  Attorneys.

Each year, this award honors just three prosecutors across the  Commonwealth. Alexandra was selected from approximately 1,000  prosecutors who were qualified. She stood out because of her  outstanding trial accomplishments and contributions to the Virginia  Association of Commonwealth's Attorneys.

She played a pivotal role in establishing a regional behavioral  health docket in the Fredericksburg area. This initiative helps connect  individuals with serious mental health illness and substance abuse  disorders to treatment and support through evidence-based practices and  judicial oversight.

As her Representative in Congress, I am grateful for her commitment  to justice and strengthening our community. That is why I am proud to  name her Constituent of the Week.
