Commending Virginia's Seventh District Law Enforcement Officers for Their Bravery


Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, today during National Police Week, I rise  to commend the bravery of law enforcement officers across Virginia's  Seventh Congressional District.

In early April, tragedy struck Spotsylvania County when a mass  shooting left three people sadly deceased and three others injured. Law  enforcement officers from Spotsylvania County and the city of  Fredericksburg swiftly answered the call and put their lives on the  line to protect their neighbors.

As a former prosecutor and Army veteran, I understand the mission  that our men and women in uniform take on every day. They serve knowing  that their work is bigger than any one person. It is about protecting  our communities and upholding the law for our families and loved ones.

Mr. Speaker, today, I thank the brave law enforcement officers of  Spotsylvania and Fredericksburg and all officers serving across the 11  counties of Virginia's Seventh Congressional District. Their service  and sacrifice is deeply valued.
