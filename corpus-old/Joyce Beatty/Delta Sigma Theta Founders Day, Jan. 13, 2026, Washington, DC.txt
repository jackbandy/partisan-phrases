Delta Sigma Theta Founders Day


Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a proud member of Delta Sigma  Theta Sorority, Incorporated, to honor our Founders Day. Mr. Speaker,  113 years ago, 22 Black, courageous young women at Howard University  founded our sorority.

Delta women have always met the moment with purpose and courage, from  demanding the right to vote to leading the global fight for equitable  education and opportunity.

I carry that legacy alongside my sorors--Congresswomen Yvette Clarke,  Valerie Foushee, Stacey Plaskett, Lucy McBath, Jasmine Crockett, Summer  Lee, Jennifer McClellan, and Senator Angela Alsobrooks--leading in  social action, protecting voting rights, education, economic justice,  and housing.

Mr. Speaker, to Deltas across the world, I say Happy Founders Day.
