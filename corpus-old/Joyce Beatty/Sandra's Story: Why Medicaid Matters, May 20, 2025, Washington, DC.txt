Sandra's Story: Why Medicaid Matters


Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, tonight is about the millions of lives  Republicans are destroying.

I rise for a single mother in my district caring full-time for her  16-year-old daughter, Naomi, who has chronic health conditions.

I want Americans to know the face of this family. Sandra Black is one  of the millions whose family could lose their healthcare.

Sandra left her job as a veterinarian to care for her daughter. She  would tell you tonight, Mr. Speaker: ``Without Medicaid, literally, our  lives would be at stake.''

Republicans want to slash Medicaid and bankroll billionaires. Let me  say that again. Republicans want to slash Medicaid and bankroll  billionaires.

Mr. Speaker, today is about billionaires over hardworking Americans  like Sandra Black's family.

Tonight, Mr. Speaker, you will hear story after story. Tonight you  will hear Democrats standing up for the American people and staying  here tonight for however long it takes. That is because we want America  to know that we are standing up for Medicaid.

I will not be silent. I will fight for lives like Sandra's and  Naomi's.
