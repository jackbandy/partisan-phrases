President Trump's Proposed Department of Education Shutdown


Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud member of the  Congressional Black Caucus because our children are our future--and the  Department of Education is one of the strongest tools we have to  prepare them for that future.

In 1954, Brown v. Board of Education affirmed what Black America had  long known: separate is not equal. That landmark decision was more than  a legal ruling--it was a promise. A promise that every child, no matter  their ZIP code, deserves a fair and quality education.

Since then, the Department of Education has helped to keep that  promise. It protects students from racial and gender discrimination and  enforces critical civil rights laws. It supports Pell Grants and other  forms of student aid, strengthens our Historically Black Colleges and  Universities (HBCUs), and ensures that students with disabilities  receive the services they need to succeed.

But now, President Trump wants to destroy all of that. Eliminating  the Department of Education is not about policy--it is about  punishment. And I want to go on the record: we will fight back--against  President Trump, against you, Speaker Johnson, and against every  Republican who remains silent in the face of this attack.

This is punishment for being poor. For being Black. For attending  public schools.

A report from UCLA's Civil Rights Project reveals that 40 percent of  Black students attend schools where 90 percent or more of their  classmates are also students of color. These schools too often have  fewer counselors, overcrowded classrooms, and outdated materials. When  you cut the Department of Education, you don't just cut red tape--you  cut protections. You cut resources. You cut off opportunities.

And while this assault affects communities across the country, it  hits especially hard in my district--Ohio's Third. We stand to lose  $109 million per year in basic public school funding that keeps  students learning and teachers employed. We also stand to lose $21  million in special education support, and $19 million for school  meals--because no child should be too hungry to learn. More than 1,300  teaching jobs are on the line.

All of this--to make billionaires richer? Mr. Speaker, we are not  going backward. Not to Jim Crow classrooms. Not to separate and  unequal.

The Congressional Black Caucus stands united. We will fight for our  students. For our schools. And for the future every child deserves.
