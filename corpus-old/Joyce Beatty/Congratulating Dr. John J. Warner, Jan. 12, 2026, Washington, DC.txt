Congratulating Dr. John J. Warner


Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today proudly to enter into the  Congressional Record that the Ohio State University Wexner Medical  Center cut the ribbon and opened the University Hospital today with 820  large private rooms sitting 26 stories high.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the Ohio State University's president, Ted  Carter, and our CEO of the Wexner Medical Center, Dr. John J. Warner,  for making not only my district but central Ohio and this country  healthier. As we are in this time in need of better healthcare, I thank  them for understanding the healthcare needs of the citizens of the  Third Congressional District.

It is, Mr. Speaker, the only IV maternity care hospital in central  Ohio. It includes 16 labor and delivery rooms and 51 NICU rooms. It is  in partnership with Nationwide Children's Hospital. We salute Columbus  because it is stronger and healthier because of this investment.
