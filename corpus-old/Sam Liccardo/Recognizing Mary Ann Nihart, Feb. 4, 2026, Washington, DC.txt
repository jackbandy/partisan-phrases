Recognizing Mary Ann Nihart


Mr. LICCARDO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mary Ann Nihart,  whose life of commitment to healing and community uplifted countless  neighbors across Pacifica, California, and beyond.

Mary Ann's career in nursing and mental health spanned four decades.  She began her service with the County of San Mateo and later joined the  San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center where she rose to become  clinical director and chief nurse of Mental Health Services.

Her excellence earned her Nurse of the Year and distinguished service  awards from the American Psychiatric Nurses Association, among many  other honors. While caring for thousands of veterans, she also inspired  and guided younger professionals pursuing careers in the practice of  psychiatric nursing.

Mary Ann's dedication to the community didn't stop with her day job.  She also served on the Pacifica City Council and for two terms as  Pacifica's mayor. She was a hands-on, visionary leader who championed  public engagement and collaborative governance.

In her final battle with cancer, as with every other facet of her  life, Mary Ann Nihart embodied courage, kindness, and an unwavering  dedication to others.

Though we mourned her loss last Saturday, we will be celebrating her  inspiring legacy for many years to come.
