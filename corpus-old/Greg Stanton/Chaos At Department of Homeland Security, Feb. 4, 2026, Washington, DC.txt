Chaos At Department of Homeland Security


Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, Arizonans are sick and tired of the chaos  at the Department of Homeland Security. Instead of targeting hardened  criminals, DHS is arresting hardworking people off our streets to meet  arbitrary deportation quotas.

Faith leaders in my district tell me constituents are avoiding  church, keeping kids home from school, and skipping medical care,  terrified of being profiled based on the color of their skin.

To meet their quotas, DHS is proposing to turn an industrial  warehouse in a Phoenix suburb into a 1,500-bed detention facility.  ICE's Acting Director called it Amazon Prime but with human beings.

People across the political spectrum are strongly opposing this and  for good reason. They don't want human beings held in a makeshift jail  down the street from their child's high school. They don't want masked  agents in their church parking lot. None of this makes Arizonans safer.

Congress has a duty to rein in the Department of Homeland Security  that is absolutely out of control. I won't stop until that happens.
