First 100 Days


Ms. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, it has been 100 days of broken promises,  cuts, and chaos from the Trump administration.

The damage has been done from my district in Cleveland to rural  America.

Here is how Trump has hurt the farm economy in just 100 days:

President Trump has fired critical staff at USDA and gutted key  programs that support rural communities.

He has enacted tariff chaos, driving up the cost of fertilizer, fuel,  and equipment.

He has launched a trade war, again putting farmers at risk of  retaliatory tariffs that will dry up export markets.

He has slashed over a billion dollars from food programs that put  fresh produce in school cafeterias and keep food banks stocked.

Meanwhile, Republicans are pushing to gut SNAP, a program that feeds  40 million Americans and delivers billions in revenue back to the farm  country.

Working families in urban, suburban, and rural communities across  America are footing the bill for Trump's chaos.

The bottom line is that Trump's broken economy isn't working for  anyone.
