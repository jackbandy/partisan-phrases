Recognizing Myoungsub Choi


Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Mr. MyoungSub Choi  for his exceptional efforts to preserve and share cultural heritage  through the practice of Taekwondo.

Mr. Choi understands that Taekwondo is more than a martial art--it is  a means of storytelling, cultural connection, and youth empowerment.  Through his leadership and mentorship, he has inspired students across  North Texas to embrace both the physical and philosophical dimensions  of the sport.

By nurturing discipline and pride within a diverse community, Mr.  Choi has built a lasting legacy. His work during the 23rd Annual Korean  American National Sports Festival is a testament to his enduring  commitment to cultural celebration and civic unity.

We commend Mr. Choi for using sport as a bridge across generations  and communities.
