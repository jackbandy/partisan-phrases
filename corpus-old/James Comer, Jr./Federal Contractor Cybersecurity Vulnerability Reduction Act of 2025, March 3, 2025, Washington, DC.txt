Federal Contractor Cybersecurity Vulnerability Reduction Act of 2025


Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 872) to require covered contractors implement a vulnerability  disclosure policy consistent with NIST guidelines, and for other  purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 872

(B) recommend updates to such requirements and language to       the Federal Acquisition Regulation Council.

(2) Contents.--The recommendations required by paragraph       (1) shall include updates to such requirements designed to       ensure that covered contractors implement a vulnerability       disclosure policy consistent with NIST guidelines for       contractors as required under section 5 of the IoT       Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020 (15 U.S.C. 278g-3c;       Public Law 116-207).

(b) Procurement Requirements.--Not later than 180 days       after the date on which the recommended contract language       developed pursuant to subsection (a) is received, the Federal       Acquisition Regulation Council shall review the recommended       contract language and update the FAR as necessary to       incorporate requirements for covered contractors to receive       information about a potential security vulnerability relating       to an information system owned or controlled by a contractor,       in performance of the contract.

(1) to the maximum extent practicable, align with the       security vulnerability disclosure process and coordinated       disclosure requirements relating to Federal information       systems under sections 5 and 6 of the IoT Cybersecurity       Improvement Act of 2020 (Public Law 116-207; 15 U.S.C. 278g-      3c and 278g-3d); and

(2) to the maximum extent practicable, be aligned with       industry best practices and Standards 29147 and 30111 of the       International Standards Organization (or any successor       standard) or any other appropriate, relevant, and widely used       standard.

(d) Waiver.--The head of an agency may waive the security       vulnerability disclosure policy requirement under subsection       (b) if--

Mr. Speaker, I am happy to support H.R. 872, the Federal Contractor  Cybersecurity Vulnerability Reduction Act.

Mr. Speaker, this bill will require Federal contractors to have a  vulnerability disclosure policy, or VDP. This would help contractors  more quickly alert Federal agencies about vulnerabilities, which could  avoid a future cybersecurity breach.

Federal agencies must act quickly when dealing with a cyberattack.  The sooner a Federal agency knows that it may have a problem, the  sooner it can take steps to protect its systems and data, including the  personal data of millions of Americans.

It is reasonable to require Federal contractors to play a proactive  role in addressing vulnerabilities in Federal information systems. This  bill complements the committee's ongoing work aimed at helping Federal  agencies protect their data and information systems.

Mr. Speaker, I thank our great Cybersecurity, Information Technology,  and Government Innovation Subcommittee chairwoman, the gentlewoman from  South Carolina (Ms. Mace), for introducing this important legislation,  which the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee unanimously  passed last year and the House later passed as part of the fiscal year  2025 National Defense Authorization Act.

I also thank the Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and  Government Innovation Subcommittee ranking member, the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Brown), for cosponsoring this legislation, building on the  bipartisan support from last year.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R.

Mr. COMER.  Mace), the chairman of the Cybersecurity,  Information Technology, and Government Innovation Subcommittee.

Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  important legislation, which will streamline cybersecurity  vulnerability disclosure to protect Federal IT systems.
