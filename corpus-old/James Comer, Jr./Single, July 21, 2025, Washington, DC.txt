Mr. Speaker, the Postal Service structures the delivery of mail  around ZIP Codes, five-digit numbers that organize how to deliver the  mail. There are currently over 41,000 ZIP Codes in the United States.  While ZIP Codes are usually aligned with local boundaries, this is  sometimes not the case.

H.R. 3095 creates new ZIP Codes for local communities listed in the  bill and will help address concerns raised by these localities.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the bill's sponsor and my colleague on the House  Oversight Committee, the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Boebert), for  leading this legislation. She has been a tireless advocate for these  communities represented in the bill, and I appreciate her hard work and  dedication.

Mr. COMER.  Boebert), who is the sponsor of the bill.

Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Harris).

Mr. HARRIS of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding.

Earlier this year, Mayor Jim Bell of Weddington, North Carolina,  reached out to me to let me know that the city had a problem. Having  different ZIP Codes across a single city has caused confusion about  where residents file property taxes or even show up to vote.

Concerned about how this problem might continue to compound, my  office was able to work together with Representative Boebert to ensure  that Weddington is included in today's legislation requesting a single,  unique ZIP Code.

Representing my constituents has been the honor of a lifetime, and I  have learned that there is no issue too great or too small that I can't  champion for North Carolinians, whether it is casting my vote for a  once-in-a-generation tax reform bill like the One Big Beautiful Bill  Act or today's ZIP Code update, it is my mission to be a voice that  responds to the needs of my constituents.

I stand here today, Madam Speaker, to urge support for this package  to ensure that communities across this country can have the clarity  that they absolutely deserve.

Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Kim).

Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of  the Boebert bill. I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
