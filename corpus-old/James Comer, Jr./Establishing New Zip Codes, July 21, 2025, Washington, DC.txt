Establishing New Zip Codes


Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 672) to establish new ZIP Codes for certain communities, and for  other purposes, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 672

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ESTABLISHING NEW ZIP CODES.

Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the United States Postal Service shall designate a       single, unique ZIP Code for each of the following       communities:

(1) Eastvale, California.

(2) Scotland, Connecticut.

(3) Cooper City, Florida.

(4) Miami Lakes, Florida.

(5) Ocoee, Florida.

(6) Village of Estero, Florida.

(7) Urbandale, Iowa.

(8) Mills, Wyoming.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 672 designates single and unique ZIP Codes for  communities across the Nation. There are currently over 41,000 ZIP  Codes in the United States. In some cases, ZIP Codes are misaligned  with local boundaries. H.R. 672 addresses the concerns of various  localities and establishes new ZIP Codes for communities across the  Nation.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart),  the bill's sponsor, for putting this bill together.

Mr. COMER.  Hageman).

Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
