District of Columbia Judicial Nominations Reform Act


Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 707, I call up  the bill (H.R. 5125) to amend the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to  terminate the District of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission, and  for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 5125, the District of Columbia Judicial  Nomination Reform Act.

This legislation aligns with the appointment of D.C. judges with the  constitutional process for appointing members of the Federal judiciary.  This bill preserves the President's authority to nominate, with the  advice and consent of the U.S. Senate, anyone deemed appropriate to sit  on the D.C. court.

The current system, where the President is restricted to nominating  only those candidates put forward by the D.C. Judicial Nomination  Commission, inappropriately limits the President's authority.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the Representative from Texas (Mr. Sessions) for  his leadership on this legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this effort, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Another day on the House floor where the Republicans try to address  the D.C. crime crisis with serious, substantive solutions and another  day where the Democrats try to act like there is no crime problem in  Washington, D.C., and reverberate the symptoms of their Trump  derangement syndrome.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Sessions legislation  which corrects an inappropriate limitation on Presidential authority to  appoint judges in the District of Columbia.
