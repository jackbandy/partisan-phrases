Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act


Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 331, the HALT  Fentanyl Act.

This bill is not a solution to the proliferation of Fentanyl Related  Substances (FRS) in America. We need legislation and investments in  health interventions that will save lives while taking meaningful  action to stop illicit drug sales.

S. 331 would permanently criminalize all FRS based solely on their  molecular structure. This would seriously hamper the medical community  from working on the development of treatments to fentanyl overdose or  other medically beneficial FRSs. The HALT Fentanyl Act also imposes  harmful mandatory minimum sentences. Decades of research shows that  mandatory minimum laws that focus solely on supply reduction and  incarceration are not effective in slowing the flow of illicit drugs  into our country or the rates of overdoses in our communities. In fact,  the current fentanyl epidemic has been found to have its roots in  crackdowns on prescription opioids and heroin that were not paired with  evidence-based overdose prevention and treatment services. We should be  pursuing policy solutions that incorporate evidence-based strategies to  addiction and overdose prevention that are rooted in health and  science, not just increasing criminalization.

Congress should bring forward a comprehensive bill that reflects the  input of medical professionals, addiction specialists, researchers, and  law enforcement. Republicans are trying to present a ``quick and easy''  solution to a complex problem.
