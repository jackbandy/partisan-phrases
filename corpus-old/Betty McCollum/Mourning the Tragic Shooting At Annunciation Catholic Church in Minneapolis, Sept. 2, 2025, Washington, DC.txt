Mourning the Tragic Shooting At Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota


Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I would like to include in the Record the  following statement mourning the tragic shooting at Annunciation  Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

SAINT PAUL, Minn.--Congresswoman Betty McCollum (MN-04),       Dean of the Minnesota Congressional Delegation, issued the       following statement on Wednesday after a gunman opened fire       on a mass service during the first week of classes at       Annunciation Catholic School, killing two children and       wounding 17 others.

``The horrific violence this morning at Annunciation       Catholic Church in Minneapolis is heartbreaking. As a mother       and grandmother, the tragic shooting of young school       children, teachers, staff, and parishioners while they       gathered at mass to celebrate the new school year is a       tragedy beyond comprehension. The Twin Cities and all of       Minnesota grieve alongside the victims and their families.       They deserve and have the full support of our community, our       state, and our nation.

``The immediate actions of adults, older children, law       enforcement, EMTs, and medical personnel saved lives. I       commend Governor Walz for acting swiftly and sending the       State Patrol and Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to respond       to this horrific crime.

``President Trump and Congress have a duty to take action       to end this epidemic of gun violence. We cannot once again       wait for another tragedy before we enact common sense gun       safety laws.''
