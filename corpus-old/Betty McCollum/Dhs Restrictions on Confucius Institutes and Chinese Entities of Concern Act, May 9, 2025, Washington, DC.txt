Dhs Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act


Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 881, the DHS  Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern  Act.

H.R. 881 is a solution in search of a problem. In 2018, Congress  passed provisions prohibiting the Department of Defense from providing  funds to any U.S. institution of higher education that hosts a  Confucius Institute, unless that institution receives a waiver from the  Department. Since its passage, no waivers have been issued, and the  number of Confucius Institutes in the United States has declined from a  peak of 118 in 2017 to fewer than five today. The current protections  against Chinese intellectual property theft through Confucius  Institutes have worked, and Congress should not place additional  burdens on our colleges, universities, and their students.

Mr. Speaker, instead of addressing the harms of the President's on- again-off-again tariffs, or working to address rising costs for  American consumers, Republicans used this week to negotiate their  Reckless Budget Scheme and rename a body of water. My constituents do  not want Congress to give trillions of dollars of tax cuts to  billionaires. They do not want cuts to SNAP or Medicaid, vital  lifelines in my home state of Minnesota. It's time Congress starts  working to address the real issues--starting with passing full year  appropriations bills. I am ready to get to work.
