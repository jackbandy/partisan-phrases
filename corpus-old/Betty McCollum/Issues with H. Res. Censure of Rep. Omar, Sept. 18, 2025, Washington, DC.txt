Issues with H. Res. Censure of Rep. Omar


Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I strongly object to this censure  resolution which does not include a single quote from Representative  Ilhan Omar (MN-05) and seeks to punish her for comments she never made.  After the unconscionable act of gun violence that took the life of  Charlie Kirk, Representative Omar clearly and immediately condemned  this assassination. She expressed her profound shock, sadness, grief  about this despicable act of political violence. She expressed sympathy  and empathy for Mr. Kirk's wife and young daughters who are enduring  unimaginable pain and sorrow.

Sadly, Republicans are misleading Americans and deliberately using  this resolution to further divide Democrats and Republicans at a time  when all Americans need to come together to condemn acts of political  violence, which are becoming all too commonplace in our Nation.

Censure is a serious tool that should be reserved for holding Members  of Congress accountable for unethical or criminal behavior, like  committing assault or accepting bribes, or for specific categories of  speech that are not protected by the First Amendment, including direct  threats against individuals, inciting treason or insurrection, or the  use of aggressively insulting ``fighting words'' against another Member  on the House Floor.

Mr. Speaker, I voted against this censure and will continue to defend  our right to free speech to represent our constituents and voice our  conscience as Representatives in this great democracy.
