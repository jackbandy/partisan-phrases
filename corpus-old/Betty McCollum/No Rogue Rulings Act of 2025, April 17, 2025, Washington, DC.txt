No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025


Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1526, the No  Rogue Rulings Act of 2025.

Just as House and Senate Republicans have ceded their constitutional  responsibility to conduct oversight on the Executive Branch,  Republicans want to force federal judges to give up their power of  judicial review. The duty and responsibility of federal courts is to  review laws and policies that have a national impact. Federal courts  are not local courts. By design their role is national and is not  limited to one state or one county. Limiting the ability of federal  courts to carry out their duty would undermine the rights and freedoms  of all Americans.

The No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025 would prevent federal district court  judges from providing nationwide injunction relief when one of  President Trump's executive orders, policies, or actions violates  people's constitutional rights and freedoms. Nationwide injunctions are  issued against the federal government when its actions are  unconstitutional and have a broad national effect. If a federal judge  can no longer issue a national injunction, the Administration could  continue to violate the rights of the American people until the case  reaches the Supreme Court. This bill is designed to drastically limit  federal judges' ability to prevent unconstitutional actions from doing  broad harm. It is about giving more power to Donald Trump.

Donald Trump is losing in court because he keeps trying to do  unlawful and unconstitutional things, not because of judicial  overreach. This bill a scheme to give more power to the President,  making it easier for him to carry out his illegal actions without  consequence.

I urge my colleagues to reject this bill.
