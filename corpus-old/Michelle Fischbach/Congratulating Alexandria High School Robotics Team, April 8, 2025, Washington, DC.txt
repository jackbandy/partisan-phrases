Congratulating Alexandria High School Robotics Team


Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Mechatronics Team  3133, the Alexandria Area High School's robotics team, on winning the  Impact Award.

This prestigious award will send the team to the world championship  in Houston, Texas. This is their third Impact Award, and it is clear  why. The team is extremely dedicated, having offered hours of their  time in the summer to work with elementary and middle school robotics  teams.

Teammates Bridger Klavetter and Gunner Sellnow said they appreciate  the worldwide community that the sport has allowed them to be part of  and said that their team works to be professional in defeat and  gracious in victory.

On behalf of the Seventh District, I wish them the best of luck in  Houston.
