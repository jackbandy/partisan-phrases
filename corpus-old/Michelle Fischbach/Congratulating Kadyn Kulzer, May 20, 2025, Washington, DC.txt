Congratulating Kadyn Kulzer


Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Kadyn  Kulzer from Paynesville on being awarded the State FFA Degree, the  FFA's highest honor.

Kadyn has been a member of the Paynesville FFA since seventh grade  and has been a great chapter officer for the past 2 years. She has  demonstrated years of commitment to the FFA chapter in Paynesville.

Kadyn plans to attend college to earn a degree in exercise science  and eventually pursue a career as a chiropractor. I am sure she will  excel in her career, just as she has excelled in the FFA.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Kadyn on her hard work and dedication to  the FFA and the community.                    Congratulating Dorothy Vandendriessche

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Dorothy  Vandendriessche of Marshall, Minnesota, on receiving the Minnesota  Woman of the Year Award at the Catholic Women's convention. This award  recognizes significant and outstanding contributions made by a  councilwoman in areas of service to the church, the Council of Catholic  Women, her parish, and the community. This honor is given to women who  serve as an inspiration to others.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Dorothy on this outstanding achievement  and for her contributions to her community and her church.                         Congratulating Mason Miller

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Mason Miller of  Ada, Minnesota, on signing a free-agent contract with the Detroit  Lions.

Mason started in all 16 games of the NDSU Bison season last year and  was named a first team All-American. Mason played an important role  propelling the Bison to their tenth FCS National Championship.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mason on this incredible accomplishment  and wish him well as he begins the next chapter of his life.
