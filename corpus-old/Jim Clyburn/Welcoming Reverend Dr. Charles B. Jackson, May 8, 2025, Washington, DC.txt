Welcoming Reverend Dr. Charles B. Jackson, Sr.


Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to welcome to  these Chambers and to this well a good friend and a personal, I will  say, savior to a multitude of South Carolinians.

Reverend Charles B. Jackson has been serving as pastor of Brookland  Baptist Church now for 54 years, having been installed at the age of  18.

I first met him about 2 or 3 years into his pastorate when he was  still a student at Benedict College in Columbia. He graduated from the  Morehouse School of Religion in Atlanta and has served not only as a  pastor of their church, but as a great leader in South Carolina.

He serves to make true the words of James when he wrote in his  epistle: ``Faith without works is dead.''

His work is a living monument to the people of South Carolina and  these United States of America, and I am pleased to welcome him here  today.
