Amendment No. 1 Offered By Mr. Massie


Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Chair, the bipartisan infrastructure law requires  drunk and impaired driving technology to become standard equipment in  new cars once a rule has been finalized by the Department of  Transportation.

More than 30 people in the United States die every day in drunk  driving crashes, and more than 12,000 people a year suffer these  preventable deaths.

Using the appropriations process to delay or in any way impede the  development of technology to prevent drunk driving is inappropriate and  reckless.

What we have before us today is a bipartisan, conferenced bill. It is  already a compromise from what Members on both sides of the aisle  wanted. Debating and attaching an amendment to this bill risks the  entire package.

Mr. Chair, I look forward to the time when we can debate the  substance of this amendment because I have some thoughts on the data  that I want the administration to be thinking about, but the time for  debate on the individual policies is not now.

This amendment, which could delay the technology that would limit  drunk driving and save lives, is not the amendment to support. This  amendment should not be inserted into this bipartisan bill at this  point in the process.

I strongly oppose it and urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the distinguished ranking member of the Energy  and Commerce Committee.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Chair, I have one additional speaker.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Gillen).

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.

Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Chair, I would like to take that 15 seconds to thank  those who spoke in opposition to this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
