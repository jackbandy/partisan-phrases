Federal Supervisor Education Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5810, the Federal Supervisor  Education Act of 2025. The bill was reported favorably by the Oversight  Committee unanimously on December 2 with bipartisan support.

The bill would require Federal agencies to create and implement  training and development programs for agency supervisors. These  programs will help improve their management skills, communicate with  their colleagues, and mentor fellow employees. It will also help them  when it comes to knowing what is prohibited when it comes to personnel  practices, employee rights, and how those rights must be protected.

A lot of these Federal agency supervisors actually live in my  district. Those supervisors should know that they won't have to do this  annually. This is once every 3 years. This will be beneficial to our  agencies and to the supervisors as well.

I thank the majority for incorporating feedback from the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Walkinshaw) and committee Democrats prior to the  bill reaching the floor. Due to this, committee Democrats unanimously  supported this legislation in markup.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
