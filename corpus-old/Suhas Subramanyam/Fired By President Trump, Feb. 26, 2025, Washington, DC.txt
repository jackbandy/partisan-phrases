Fired By President Trump


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the story of a Federal  worker, an FAA scientist, who DOGE and the administration fired. This  person's job was to create and maintain flight maps that air traffic  controllers and pilots could use to navigate airspace. Without these  maps, ``pilots would quite literally be flying blind.''

Yet the Trump administration says they didn't fire anyone at FAA  working in critical safety positions. However, it is pretty obvious  that the scientists who make the maps pilots use to fly are critical to  aviation safety.

Moreover, aviation safety has become a big issue lately, with recent  close calls and crashes, including one in my home State of Virginia.

Mr. Speaker, how do we expect Americans to feel safe if we are firing  the very scientists who keep us safe?

These cuts aren't going to save much money. These dollars are a drop  in the bucket, but they will cost lives.
