Making Homelessness A National Priority


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, America is the richest country in the  world. Yet, we have 700,000 homeless people including tens of thousands  of veterans. Getting Americans housing and mental health services needs  to be a national priority.

It is alarming to hear that instead of solving the problem there are  some rightwing media commentators who want to execute mentally ill  homeless people. I think the words they said were to just kill them.  This was followed by a lackluster apology. It makes me think that maybe  they meant it.

I don't think this is the position of the rightwing or the Republican  Party. What this administration is doing is banning encampments with no  long-term strategy and cutting funding for community services to those  individuals.

Out of sight and out of mind is not a solution to homelessness. We  cannot sweep homelessness and the homelessness crisis under the rug. We  have been talking about violent rhetoric recently. Let's apply that to  homeless people, as well.

Since these comments, there were two mass shootings at Minnesota  homeless encampments. Our words do matter. We need to come together to  solve the homelessness crisis in our country and not incite violence  against them.

Mr. Speaker, let's work together in a bipartisan way instead of  continuing that kind of rhetoric.
