In Memory of Nihaal Grandhi


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  memory of Nihaal Grandhi, a brother, son, and student from Loudon  County who tragically passed away in an accident over the weekend.

At just 19 years old, Nihaal was a proud graduate of Rock Ridge High  School and a freshman at Indiana University's Kelley School of  Business. He was known for his joyful smile and ability to inspire a  sense of community wherever he went.

As a volleyball team captain and a STEM competition coach, Nihaal was  always attuned to the needs of those he led. Whether mentoring a  teammate  through a difficult challenge or calmly navigating high-stakes  competitions, he knew when to guide or be a reassuring presence.

Above all, he was a man of deep principles and kindness.

Mr. Speaker, I and so many in my community are sending prayers to his  family and friends and all who had the privilege to know him.

May he rest in peace.
