Proposed Cuts to Medicaid and Snap Benefits


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I am genuinely alarmed by the budget  that we may be voting on this week.

There is a lot not to like, but every American should be paying  attention to the cuts being proposed to Medicaid and SNAP benefits.  These cuts will hurt millions of Americans and create irreversible  damage to our communities.

Mr. Speaker, it will hurt my community, where tens of thousands of  people benefit from these programs, but this is going to impact every  community across every district and across Virginia and across the  country. Is it because the richest country in the world can't feed  hungry kids or can't get people the care they need?

No. It is because this budget takes that money and it gives it to the  very richest corporations at the expense of small businesses and  working families. The unintended consequences of these cuts will hurt  every American, even if they are not on Medicaid or SNAP, and force  more middle-class families to live paycheck to paycheck while giving  the ultrarich a tax break.

Mr. Speaker, let's talk about a bipartisan budget that doesn't hurt  Americans and is not a giveaway to companies who don't need it.
