Veterans Accessibility Advisory Committee Act of 2025


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the so- called SAVE America Act.

The supporters of this bill claim that undocumented immigrants are  overrunning our elections and voting in droves, but I will give an  example of the reality.

We actually did a study in Virginia of all the election  irregularities over 20 years. How many instances of noncitizens voting  do my colleagues think we found? We found zero. Another study found it  was pretty much nonexistent between 1999 and 2023 in the United States.  They are solving a problem that does not exist.

What this bill does do is it creates other problems that make it  harder to vote. It undermines our democracy. It makes it harder for  military voters who move a lot. It makes it harder for families  impacted by natural disasters who lose documents. It makes it harder  for the nearly 70 million women who have changed their name after  marriage and have a birth certificate that no longer matches their  voter IDs. It also makes it harder for the half of Americans who don't  have passports.

The President claims that this is just an attempt to secure our  elections. But let's be real. This is just another attempt to tilt the  electoral deck in his favor.

If we want to make elections safer, we should stop threatening to  nationalize elections. Stop threatening to have ICE at voting  locations. Why don't we save America from this bill and vote ``no.''
