Recognizing the Puerto Rican Alliance of Northern Virginia


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Puerto Rican  Alliance of Northern Virginia for hosting and organizing their third  annual festival.

Virginia is home to a vibrant Puerto Rican community, and the  festival celebrates the community's culture and contributions. It  brings in vendors, volunteers, music, and a vibrant community.

The festival made history in 2023 as the first-ever Puerto Rican  festival in the DMV region. Each year, the festival draws over 10,000  attendees and continues to showcase the community's culture. The  festival made history again in 2024 with over 18,000 guests in  attendance.

I thank the Puerto Rican Alliance of Northern Virginia, and I wish  them a great event this year.
