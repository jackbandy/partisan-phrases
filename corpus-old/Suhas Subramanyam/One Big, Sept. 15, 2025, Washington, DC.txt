One Big, Beautiful Repeal


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, Virginians are already paying the price  for the one big, ugly bill.

Two small-town clinics and one regional urgent care center in  Virginia just closed as a direct result of the bill. Now, six more  rural hospitals around the Commonwealth are at risk of closure. That  means mothers, children, and Virginians with urgent healthcare concerns  have to drive further to get urgent care or wait months to see a  specialist.

Remember, this majority and this President said that this bill  wouldn't take away benefits or close rural hospitals. Well, they were  wrong. We don't need more broken promises. What we need is a different  approach, a one big, beautiful repeal instead.

Let's pass the Protecting Healthcare and Lowering Costs Act, which  will restore people's benefits and access to care, ensuring that people  in small towns and rural communities will have more access to quality  care, not less.
