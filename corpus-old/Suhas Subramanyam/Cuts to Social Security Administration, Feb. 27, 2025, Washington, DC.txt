Cuts to Social Security Administration


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, there is new reporting that the Social  Security Administration has been told to cut its workforce in half.

Unfortunately, I heard from a constituent who works there who was  just put on a 30-day leave with no promise to keep their job.

This agency helps keep 364,000 of Virginia's seniors out of poverty,  supports over 181,000 disabled Virginians, and upholds the American  promise that if you spend your life paying into a system, the next  generation will have your back.

This agency is already understaffed, only reaching 20 percent of  their hiring goals.

So why would DOGE do this?

They want to gut Social Security.

My constituents sent me here to protect their benefits.

It is clear to me that my colleagues across the aisle and this DOGE  program will never stand up against this administration.

The Democrats will.

As the President and DOGE delay payments, disrupt services, and deny  these hard-earned benefits, I will push back and protect Social  Security.
