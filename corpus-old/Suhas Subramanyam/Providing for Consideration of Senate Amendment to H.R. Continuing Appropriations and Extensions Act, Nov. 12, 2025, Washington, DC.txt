Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding  me time.

Mr. Speaker, do you know what people hate more than seeing their  costs go up? It is seeing their costs go up while corrupt politicians  line their pockets with taxpayers' money. That is what they really  hate, yet that is what this bill does.

Republican Senators slipped into this bill a legal pathway for them  to personally receive millions of dollars of taxpayers' money for being  investigated after January 6. My colleagues on the other side talk  about fiscal responsibility and say that there is no money for  healthcare, but somehow there is taxpayer money for Republican  Senators. This an ethics violation. This is a breach of trust, and it  calls into question the very legitimacy of this institution.

Mr. Speaker, I put forward an amendment to reject this corruption,  but  committee Republicans voted it down last night. They said that they  knew that it was corrupt but that there was nothing that could be done  and that the system didn't work.

Republicans are the system, and House Republicans promised a vote on  this next week as a standalone bill. There is no guarantee that the  Senate will act. In fact, they probably won't act. The majority has the  power to join us in righting this wrong today. Let's take out this  ridiculous kickback. Otherwise, a vote for this bill is a vote for  corruption.
