Recognizing Food Pantries


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to give a huge thank-you to all  of the food pantries, food banks, and nonprofits that helped so many  families during this past shutdown, and really all year, with food  insecurity. They have been giving out hundreds of thousands of meals,  very rarely ever turning away anyone.

The ones in my community include ones like Dulles South Food Pantry,  Haymarket Regional Food Pantry, Mobile Hope, Northern Virginia Food  Rescue, Creating Foundations for Hope, House of Mercy Food Pantry, and,  of course, Loudoun Hunger Relief. They did so much: fresh produce,  sweet treats, pantry essentials, and even Thanksgiving meals coming up  next week.

Some saw up to a 500 percent increase in new families asking for  food, and this is still going to be a big issue. We saw the SNAP cuts  over the summer. All of them told me that that is going to be a big  issue.

We need to continue to address food insecurity in America, and I  thank those organizations for stepping up when we needed them most.
