Markets Sent Into A Tailspin


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the President posted on  social media: ``This is a great time to buy.'' Then, shortly after  that, he paused his tariff plan, the very one that sent markets into a  tailspin.

The market bounced back, although it is down again, and the President  celebrated in the Oval Office with top financial executives. They  celebrated at whose expense? The parents who watched their kids'  college savings accounts get depleted, the retirees who rely on their  investments to carry them through their remaining years, and the small  business owners, including many in my district, who don't know how to  plan and don't know how to keep the lights on at this point.

This wreaked havoc on millions of Americans, and those Americans also  deserve to know about what happened and who profited off of it.

Did the financial executives know about what was going to happen? Did  the President's donors know? Who knew and who profited from this  ``great time to buy'' tweet and everything that was leading up to it?

We need a full investigation into what happened and who profited from  it. The American people deserve better.
