Brigadier General Donald Wayne Hansen Celebrates 92nd Birthday


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Brigadier General  Donald Wayne Hansen, who recently celebrated his 92nd birthday. This  milestone marks a lifetime of extraordinary military service and  leadership.

General Hansen's nearly three-decade career began commissioning as a  second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's Corps.  During the Vietnam war, he served as an assistant staff judge advocate  for the 1st Infantry Division, the legendary Big Red One, and later as  a staff judge advocate for the U.S. Army Support Command in Saigon.

In 1985, he was appointed assistant judge advocate general of the  U.S. Army, capping a distinguished career characterized by integrity,  valor, and commitment to military justice.

I celebrate not only General Hansen's 92nd birthday but also his  enduring legacy of patriotism and exemplary service that continues to  inspire our Nation.

I thank him and wish him a happy birthday.
