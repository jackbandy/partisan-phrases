Recognizing Valluvan Tamil Academy's 15th Annual Day Celebration


Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, since its founding, the Valluvan Tamil  Academy, or VTA, has played a vital role in teaching the Tamil language  to children in Virginia. Tamil, one of the world's oldest languages, is  spoken by over 80 million people globally, including 360,000 Americans.

This past weekend marked a major milestone: the VTA's 15th Annual Day  Celebration.

I was honored to join students, families, and community leaders to  celebrate and recognize the work that has been done to educate the next  generation on Tamil history.

I congratulate the Valluvan Tamil Academy, and I thank them for all  that they do for our community in Virginia. I am looking forward to  working together for many years to come.
