Confirmation of Linda McMahon


Mr. WELCH. Mr. President, I was absent from the Senate on March 3,  2025. Had I been present for rollcall vote No. 99 on the nomination of  Linda McMahon, of Connecticut, to be Secretary of Education, I would  have voted no. As Secretary, Mrs. McMahon will be a rubberstamp on  President Trump's agenda to dismantle the Department of Education.  President Trump has even said that he hopes that Mrs. McMahon ``puts  herself out of a job.''

The Department of Education is responsible for distributing funds to  K-12 schools and administering Pell grants, the Federal Student Loan  Program, and programs that help support students with disabilities.  Already, the Trump administration has cut funding contracts within the  Department that support data collection, learning tools, and programs  to increase test scores.

Mrs. McMahon does not have the experience required to support the  more than 62 million students in their elementary to postsecondary  education across the country. Mrs. McMahon has no experience teaching  or working in a school. Her experience does not lend her the tools the  Secretary of Education needs to address the complex needs of our  Nation's students, who are struggling with rising mental health issues.

I do not have confidence that, under Mrs. McMahon's leadership, the  Department of Education will continue to perform its core duties and  support students across the country, in all stages of their education.
