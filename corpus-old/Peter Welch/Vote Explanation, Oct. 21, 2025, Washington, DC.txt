Vote Explanation


Mr. WELCH. Mr. President, unfortunately, I was not present to once  again vote on the Republican continuing resolution proposal, rollcall  vote no. 576. Had I been present, I would have voted no. We are now 3  weeks into this shutdown. It is time for Republicans to come to the  table and negotiate in good faith to reopen the government and ensure  millions of Americans can continue to access truly affordable  healthcare. The Republican spending proposal misses the mark. Let's  work together to fix it.
