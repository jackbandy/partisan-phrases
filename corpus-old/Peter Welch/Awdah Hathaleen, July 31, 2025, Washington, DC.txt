Awdah Hathaleen


Mr. WELCH. Mr. President, I am horrified and outraged by the  assassination of Awdah Hathaleen, a Palestinian teacher, community  leader, father, and peace activist in the West Bank town of Umm Al- Khair.

Awdah was a nonviolent activist, respected advocate for his  community, and a voice for freedom in the West Bank.

Awdah was shot by a settler terrorist Yinon Levi, who has been  sanctioned by the UK, Canada, and the European Union and previously  sanctioned by the United Sates under the Biden administration for  perpetrating violence against Palestinians. The world knows how  dangerous and reckless he is. Yet, on the first day of President  Trump's second term, his administration removed the sanctions on Levi  and other violent settlers.

We need to call these actions what they are: terrorism--part of a  violent, systematic effort, supported by the Israeli military, to  forcibly remove Palestinians from their land.

Awdah worked with film directors Basel Adra and Yuval Abraham on  their Oscar-winning documentary ``No Other Land,'' which heroically  showcased the violence in the West Bank, enabled by Israeli forces.

I call on the White House to immediately reinstate the sanctions on  those who disrupt the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank.  I also urge Israel to hold Yinon Levi accountable for his crime. He  should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Israeli officials  often speak of their independent system of justice. Impunity for Mr.  Levi's crime and the crimes of other settlers must end. We cannot be  complacent in the face of this deadly violence and injustice.
