Congratulating Duchesne High School Girls' Wrestling Team


Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride to  congratulate the Duchesne High School girls' wrestling team on their  remarkable achievement of winning the 1A/2A State championship.

I also recognize their coach, Shane Ivie, for being honored with the  prestigious title of Outstanding Coach of the Year.

Individual champions include Breann Ivie, Ariana Jones, McKenlee  Sprecher, Daniella Spencer, and Abigail Woods. Additionally, Duchesne's  Leah Ivie and Altamont's Preslee Thacker each earned second-place  finishes in their respective categories.

Their success is a testament to their resilience as they overcame  countless challenges along the way. Breann Ivie faced serious heart  issues; Daniella Spencer competed with a broken arm; and Ariana Jones,  with profound strength and courage, competed while mourning the recent  passing of her mother.

These young women embody the values of hard work, perseverance, and  grit. I am in awe of their determination and spirit. They have shown us  what true resilience looks like.

We are incredibly proud to have such talented and dedicated  individuals representing Utah's Third District. Their success is not  just their own. It reflects the strength and character of our  community.
