Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand in support of  the SAVE America Act.

Consider the simple realities of life. In this country, you are  required to show an ID to drive a car, to board an airplane, or to cash  a paycheck. These are routine requirements for everyday participation  in our society. Yet, for the most fundamental act of a self-governing  people, the right to vote, that same standard of verification is  missing.

Let us be clear. Despite the rhetoric, this is not about creating  hurdles at the polling place. It is about the integrity of the  registration process. As Americans, our right to vote is sacred, but  that right is only as strong as a system that protects it. When one  single illegal vote is cast, a legal vote is diluted. When a foreign  national influences an election, the voice of an American citizen is  silenced. This isn't a hypothetical concern. It is a matter of  protecting the value of everyone's choice.

The SAVE America Act is guided by one simple principle: Only  Americans should decide American elections.

Across this country, we have seen noncitizens identified on voter  rolls. This is a vulnerability we can no longer afford to ignore. By  passing this act, we provide the public with the one thing our  political system needs most: trust--trust that the process is secure;  trust that the rules are followed; and trust that every legal vote  counts.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me. Let us unify around the  democratic principles that built this Republic. Let us pass the SAVE  America Act to keep our elections exclusively in the hands of the  American people.
