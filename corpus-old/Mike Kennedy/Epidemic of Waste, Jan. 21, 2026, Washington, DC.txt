Epidemic of Waste, Fraud, and Abuse


Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  epidemic of waste, fraud, and abuse that is ripping off taxpayers with  impunity.

Too often, Congress forgets that every dollar of government money  collected comes from an American who worked hard for it. That is why  waste, fraud, and abuse are not abstract problems. They are real  problems that hurt real people.

When government programs pay twice for the same service, fund  projects that never get built, or lose track of billions, taxpayers  suffer and confidence in government weakens.

We need to honor hardworking families by pursuing the bad actors with  a vengeance. Stewardship is our sacred responsibility.

We just found out about a case in my own district where an individual  was collecting her dead mother's Social Security checks for 3 years.  Her blatant fraud was finally discovered, and she was sentenced and  ordered to repay $25,000 in restitution. This case is not isolated. The  Government Accountability Office estimates that the Federal Government  loses up to $521 billion to fraud every single year.

The American people expect honesty, fiscal discipline, and respect  for their sacrifice. I am proud of the Republican Conference for doing  just that.
