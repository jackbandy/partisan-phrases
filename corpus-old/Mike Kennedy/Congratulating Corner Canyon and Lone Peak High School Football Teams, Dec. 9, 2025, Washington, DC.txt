Congratulating Corner Canyon and Lone Peak High School Football Teams


Mr. KENNEDY of Utah. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate both  the Corner Canyon and the Lone Peak High School football teams who  recently faced off in the Utah 6A State Championship. Their matchup  showcased exactly what Utah embodies: determination, grit, and  exceptional spirit.

Corner Canyon emerged victorious, securing their sixth State title in  the past 8 years and their third straight championship. This  championship capped a phenomenal season where they finished with a  record of 12-1 and boasted one of the highest scoring offenses in the  Nation. Their success reflects the leadership of head coach Eric Kjar,  who instilled in these men values of dedication, perseverance, and hard  work.

I hope you all join me in wishing them good luck as they play in  their first ever Overtime National Championship against St. Frances  Academy.

I would also like to congratulate Lone Peak High School and their  head coach Bart Brockbank. Despite their loss in the championship, they  played admirably throughout the entire season, even giving Corner  Canyon their only loss of the season back in September.

I congratulate the teams, the coaches, and the schools. They  certainly make Utah proud.
