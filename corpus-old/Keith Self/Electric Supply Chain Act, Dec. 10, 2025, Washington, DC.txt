Electric Supply Chain Act


Mr. SELF. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R.  3638. The bill requires DOE to assess supply chain vulnerabilities for  the generation and transmission of electricity, including barriers to  expanding capacity here in the United States.

My amendment makes a simple clarification. It ensures that DOE  evaluates barriers not only to manufacturing components, but also to  their delivery and installation. In the real world, grid reliability  depends on whether critical equipment can actually reach the job site  and be installed on time.

If we want a serious assessment and serious recommendations, then we  cannot stop at the factory gate.

Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. SELF. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
