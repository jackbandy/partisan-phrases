Defending Education Transparency and Ending Rogue Regimes Engaging in Nefarious Transactions Act


Mr. SELF. Mr. Chair, I rise to support my amendment. I am outraged  that our universities and institutions are receiving gifts or entering  into contracts with foreign countries that seek to destroy or harm the  United States.

H.R. 1048, the DETERRENT Act, would strengthen disclosure  requirements by reducing the threshold from $250,000 to $50,000, but  those provisions are not strong enough. The American people deserve to  know about every  single dollar coming from adversary foreign sources, no matter how  small.

That is why I am introducing an amendment to slash the reporting  threshold from $50,000 all the way down to $1; total transparency of  every cent. Any foreign gift, no matter how small, can influence our  democracy, and we must close any loophole that lets foreign actors  purchase access or sway our institutions.

This is not about research. This is about human intelligence  collection and business espionage. Having spent time in the  intelligence community while I was in the military, this is a serious  matter.

I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and ensure full  transparency. Our constituents demand transparency today, and I say  let's give them transparency. I yield back the balance of my time.
