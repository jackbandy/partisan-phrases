America in Decline Under Republican Economic Policies


Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, under the economic policies of Donald Trump  and Republicans, America is now in decline. For the first time in 3  years, we have negative GDP growth. That means our economy actually  shrank this year.

It takes a special kind of stupid to take 12 consecutive quarters of  positive economic growth and make it go negative. We also know  inflation has increased, and Trump Republicans want to make it worse.  They want to pass the big, ugly bill that is going to cut off  healthcare for over 16 million Americans, all in service of massive tax  breaks to billionaires.

Tell them to take their heads out of the sand and stop harming the  American people. Trump and Republicans should be working for the  American people, not for billionaires.
