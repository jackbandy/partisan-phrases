Recognizing Gold Award Girl Scout Recipients


Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to  join me in congratulating several remarkable Girl Scouts from  Wisconsin's 5th Congressional District for demonstrating leadership,  creativity, and a commitment to making a lasting impact by earning the  most prestigious award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award.

Gold Award Girl Scouts help their communities and the world by  identifying a community need, investigating it, devising a plan, and  leading a team of experts and community members to implement a project  that produces lasting change. Over the course of 1 to 2 years, Gold  Award Girl Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and  leadership, distinguishing them from their peers. Through their  resourcefulness and perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to  make the world a better place.
