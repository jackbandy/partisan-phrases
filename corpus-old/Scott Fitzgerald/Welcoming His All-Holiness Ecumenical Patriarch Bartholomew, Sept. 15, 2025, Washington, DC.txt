Welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to  join me in welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew  to our Nation's Capital. As the Head of the second largest Christian  Church in the world, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew leads a Church of  300 million people, including a large community in Southeastern  Wisconsin.

His work towards the cause of peace should be commended, and on  behalf of Wisconsin's 5th Congressional District, I congratulate  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew ahead of receiving the Templeton  Prize.
