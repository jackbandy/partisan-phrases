Welcoming the Honorable James Walkinshaw to the House of Representatives


Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as dean of the  Virginia congressional delegation to introduce and welcome to Congress  the newest Representative from the Commonwealth of Virginia, James  Walkinshaw.

James was born in Northern Virginia, the very region of the  Commonwealth that he will now represent in Congress. He graduated from  New York University with a degree in politics. He then returned home  and got involved in his local community. He managed our dear friend  Gerry Connolly's 2007 campaign for chairman of the Fairfax County Board  of Supervisors, and a year later he managed Gerry's successful campaign  for Congress.

While a new Member, James is no stranger to Congress. After Gerry's  election to Congress, James went on to serve as his chief of staff for  over a decade, where he worked closely with many of us and our staffs.  James consistently fought alongside Gerry for the people of Virginia's  11th Congressional District.

In 2019, he followed in his political mentor and boss' footsteps and  was elected to serve on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors,  representing the Braddock district, where he has continued to be a  powerful advocate for his community.

He resides in Fairfax County with his wife, Yvette, and his son,  Mateo. With his victory in this week's special election, I know he will  make an outstanding addition to our delegation and this Chamber with  his steadfast commitment to the 11th Congressional District of  Virginia, fighting to have their voices heard in this body.

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to now yield to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Walkinshaw).
