Protect America's Workforce Act


Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2550, a  bill that would restore collective bargaining rights for all Federal  employees.

Earlier this year, President Trump launched one of the largest  attacks on labor in the history of the United States, on the working  people who voted to join a union and have a voice.

President Trump suggests that this is a problem of national security.  Quite frankly, it has not been. They cited that there would be strikes.  There hasn't been, and it is illegal to strike. In fact, we are looking  for workers to help build our military at the very time that the  President is trying to beat down those workers.

This is where the real problem is. That executive order stripped  Federal workers of their collective bargaining rights.

The suggestion is that they canceled the contracts. We always deal in  contracts. A collective bargaining agreement is a contract between the  people and the public entity. We do it across the board each and every  day.

Less than 24 hours ago, in this very room, we had a chance to  immediately restore the collective bargaining rights just for the  Department of Defense. They all voted ``no.'' Today, they want to vote  ``yes''? A day late and a dollar short is what I am talking about. They  could have voted for a fraction of the people yesterday, and it would  have become law. Today, they vote for it. You can't have it both ways,  Mr. Speaker.

Let me be clear. We want to work together, both sides of the aisle.  This is incredibly important. We need to remember that collective  bargaining agreements are about a vote by the people. Don't steal the  vote.
