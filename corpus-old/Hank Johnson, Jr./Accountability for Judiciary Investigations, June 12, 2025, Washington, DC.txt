Accountability for Judiciary Investigations


Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, a judiciary cannot stand as a  pillar of trust and independence unless it is also anchored in  accountability. Yet, as it stands, Federal judges facing serious  misconduct allegations can stop an investigation in its tracks by  simply stepping down from the bench. This loophole not only undermines  public trust but leaves serious questions unanswered about conduct  unexamined.

My legislation, the TRUST Act, would fix this by requiring an  investigation to continue even if the judge resigns or retires to avoid  accountability. This cannot and should not be a partisan issue.  Congress must act to ensure that credible allegations follow judges  beyond the robe, and that retirement or resignation is not mistaken for  resolution.

I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation.
