Recognizing the Life of Corey Lee Sidney


Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join the Sidney family  in celebrating the life of Corey Lee Sidney, who was born on June 10,  1977, and died all too soon on October 11, 2025. He was a quiet man  with a gentle spirit, and was cherished by his family, loved ones, and  friends.

Corey Lee Sidney was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Melanie  Sidney and Norman Gladden. After spending his early childhood in  Philadelphia, he returned to Pittsburgh around age eight, where he  lived until moving to Buffalo, New York, where he made his home for the  past decade.

Corey was a devoted man of faith, a lifelong member of Rodman Street  Missionary Baptist Church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he  faithfully served as a Trustee. His love for God and church was a  guiding force throughout his life. Family was at the heart of Corey's  world. He cherished his grandmother, the late Margaret Lucinda Sidney,  his aunt Sylvia Sidney, and his cousin Arthur Dennis Sidney, both of  whom now reside in Washington, D.C. Corey was proud of his close-knit  family and maintained affectionate relationships across the country.

Though he might have claimed to be shy, Corey was truly a social  butterfly, effortlessly making friends wherever he went, thanks to his  gift of gab and genuine warmth. He loved good food and embraced new  experiences, dedicating himself recently to a passion for international  travel. Among many things, he will be remembered for his care,  compassion, loving kindness, sense of humor, his unique laugh, and his  face full of freckles.

Corey's circle of love extended to his beloved partner, Laurence  Jones; many aunts--including Carole (and husband Clayton), Clarice,  Yvonne, and Sylvia; cousins Juan, Jose, Thomas, and countless others;  and a wide community of close friends who will dearly miss him.

Corey touched countless lives with his kindness, faith, and joyful  spirit. He leaves behind a legacy of love that will be remembered by  all who knew him.
