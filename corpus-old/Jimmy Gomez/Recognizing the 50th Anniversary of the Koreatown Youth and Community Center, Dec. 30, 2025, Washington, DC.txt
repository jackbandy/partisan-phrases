Recognizing the 50th Anniversary of the Koreatown Youth and Community Center


Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Koreatown Youth and  Community Center--KYCC--as it celebrates 50 years of dedicated service  to Los Angeles.

Founded in 1975, KYCC has grown into a leading multiservice  organization in Koreatown, serving more than 12,500 people each year.

From youth development and counseling, to housing, health care, and  economic empowerment, KYCC has met the evolving needs of families  across Koreatown

And we have seen KYCC give back year after year.

During the pandemic, during the unrest in the 1990's, and through the  economic challenges our city has faced, we have seen how their work  reminds us that our city is stronger together.

KYCC represents the very best of us. They understand that people come  from all different walks of life, and that people need to be supported,  uplifted, and heard.

KYCC's work reflects a simple truth: when families are supported,  communities thrive.

I thank all the dedicated staff, board members, and everyone at KYCC  who makes this work possible every single day.

I am proud to congratulate KYCC on 50 years of impact and service,  and I look forward to 50 more years of them serving, lifting up, and  strengthening our community.
