Executive Calendar


Mrs. MOODY.  3082 and the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; further, that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed, and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table. And prior to any  further ruling by the chair, if I might make a comment--I withdraw so I  might be able to make a comment, and then I will resubmit it.
