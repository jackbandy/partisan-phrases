Antoinette Brown Blackwell


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the 200th anniversary of  the birth of Antoinette Brown Blackwell, a trailblazer born in my  district in Henrietta, New York, and the first woman ordained as a  mainstream Protestant minister in the United States.

Antoinette dedicated her life to justice, equality and faith. She  captivated audiences as a lecturer on women's rights and temperance and  preached wherever she was welcome. In 1850, she proudly stood at the  first National Women's Rights Convention.

Committed to voting rights, she lobbied President Theodore Roosevelt  for suffrage and remained a steadfast advocate for women. At age 95,  she cast her very first vote, proof her decades of advocacy helped  transform our Nation.

She was a minister, a reformer, a writer, and, above all, a woman of  courage and conviction. We remember Antoinette Brown Blackwell not just  for what she achieved but for the path she paved for generations to  follow.

Let us honor her on her 200th birthday and follow in her footsteps as  we fight to protect every American's right to vote.
