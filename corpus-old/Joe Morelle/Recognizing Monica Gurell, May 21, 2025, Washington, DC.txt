Recognizing Monica Gurell


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Jewish American  Heritage Month to recognize a remarkable leader and educator in our  Rochester Jewish community: Monica Gurell.

Monica Gurell serves as the President of Temple B'rith Kodesh, where  she has led with passion, humility, and inclusiveness. She began her  journey at TBK by nurturing young minds--teaching a class of four-year- olds--and later, with her husband Dan, advising the youth group for  five years. Her sustained commitment and deep sense of purpose led her  to the board in 2010 and eventually to her current leadership role.

A veteran teacher in the Rochester City School District, Monica has  also volunteered extensively throughout the Jewish community, including  service on the board of Jewish Family Services. Her experience in the  Wexner Heritage Program--a prestigious two-year leadership initiative-- helped her forge deeper bonds across our city and champion unity across  diverse Jewish organizations.

It is an honor to recognize Monica Gurell during Jewish American  Heritage Month. Her unwavering dedication to faith, education, and  community has enriched the lives of countless others and continues to  serve as a beacon of strength.
