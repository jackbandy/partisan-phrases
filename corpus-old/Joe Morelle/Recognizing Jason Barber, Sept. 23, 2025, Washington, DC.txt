Recognizing Jason Barber


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Hispanic American  Heritage Month to recognize an extraordinary artist, educator, and  community leader from Rochester, New York, Jason Barber.

As a Cuban-American artist and educator, Jason Barber has devoted his  creative journey to exploring the intersection of memory and place,  weaving together Rochester's histories with the lived experiences of  its people. His work reflects on how communities preserve memory,  identity, and family history, often drawing inspiration from our city's  legacy as the birthplace of modern photography through Kodak Park.

Beyond his artistic practice, Jason manages the International Plaza,  a vibrant cultural and economic hub that celebrates the diversity of  Rochester, New York. Under his leadership, the Plaza has grown into a  welcoming space where small businesses, artists, and community members  share food and traditions from around the world. His guidance has  uplifted local entrepreneurs while fostering stronger connections  across the region.

Jason's heritage and perspective deeply inform his approach to both  art and education. With more than a decade of experience in the arts  and nonprofit sectors, he has worked tirelessly to bridge culture and  community. His career includes leadership roles as a Creative  Consultant and Gallery Director with organizations such as the  Rochester Brainery, Oxford Gallery, Memorial Art Gallery, and The Yards  Art Collective. Through these roles, Jason has fostered collaborations  across disciplines, enriching Rochester's cultural fabric and ensuring  that creativity remains a force for connection and inclusion.

It is with great pride and admiration that I recognize Jason Barber  this Hispanic American Heritage Month. His advocacy continues to uplift  and enrich our community, leaving a lasting impact for generations to  come.
