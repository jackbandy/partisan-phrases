Recognizing Orlando Ortiz


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Hispanic American  Heritage Month to recognize an outstanding business and community  leader from Rochester, New York, Orlando Ortiz.

Serving as President, Orlando Ortiz has played a pivotal role in  shaping and leading the Puerto Rican Festival for over 15 years. He has  worked tirelessly to honor Puerto Rican heritage and create a welcoming  space where thousands of residents and visitors gather each year. Under  his leadership, the festival has become more than an event, it is a  unifying force that strengthens community bonds and promotes cultural  pride.

A native of Cayey, Puerto Rico, Orlando moved to Rochester in 1991  and has carried his heritage with him throughout his life and work.  Alongside his leadership of the festival, he has built a distinguished  career as Real Estate Investor and Property Manager for RocOn Property  Management. In 2019, his impact was recognized when the Rochester  Hispanic Business Association named him Hispanic Business Person of the  Year.

Orlando's commitment to service extends well beyond his professional  accomplishments. In 2020, he was honored with the Minett Professorship  at the Rochester Institute of Technology, recognizing his leadership  and dedication to education and community engagement. The year before,  he and his wife, Denishea, were named the NextGen Rochester Young  Philanthropists of the Year, a testament to their shared commitment to  giving back. Across these roles and recognitions, Orlando has  exemplified a steadfast devotion to advancing our community and  preserving cultural heritage.

It is with great pride and admiration that I recognize Orlando Ortiz  during Hispanic American Heritage Month. His professional achievements  and civic service have left a lasting mark on both the Hispanic  community and the Greater Rochester region.
