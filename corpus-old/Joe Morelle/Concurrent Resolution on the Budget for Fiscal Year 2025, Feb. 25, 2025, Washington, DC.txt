Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. MORELLE. Madam Chair, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Virginia, for yielding me time.

I rise today in strong opposition to this budget resolution. As an  Appropriations Committee member, thoughtful consideration of government  spending is a responsibility I don't take lightly. I believe every  hard-earned taxpayer dollar must work for all Americans, not fuel  wildly irresponsible economic theory.

I would like to think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  believe the same thing, given the rhetoric we have all heard over the  last several years.

So I encourage the American people to watch what House Republicans  do, not what they say.

Remarkably, instead of lowering costs, this reckless budget  resolution bestows tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans  while jeopardizing essential healthcare and nutrition programs. For  this reason, I strongly oppose the budget resolution authored by House  Republicans.

Shockingly, gutting programs our communities rely on isn't harmful  enough because this resolution will also require taxpayers to borrow  another $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years.

Our Nation's Founders vested in the House of Representatives the  unique set of powers to make it responsive to the will of the people.  The father of our Constitution, James Madison, said that ``the House  should have an immediate dependence on, and intimate sympathy with, the  people.''

House Republicans demonstrate no dependence on nor sympathy with the  American people.

Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this handout to  millionaires and billionaires and work on a budget that instead  advances the interests of American families.
