Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from  Massachusetts, the ranking member of the Rules Committee, for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, as we reach the apparent conclusion of this absurd  exercise, it is worth asking: What is the purpose of this bill? This  bill will strip away health insurance from nearly 17 million people,  devastating communities like mine in Rochester, New York. This bill  will recklessly eliminate food assistance for nearly 3 million  Americans, including nearly a million senior citizens. This bill will  explode the deficit by $3.3 trillion.

For what?

Well, Mr. Speaker, sometimes the simplest explanation is closest to  the truth. We all saw the gaggle of billionaires sitting behind Donald  Trump on Inauguration Day earlier this year. The driving force behind  this entire legislative effort has been to grant handouts to those same  billionaires and special interests all at the expense of hardworking  families.

Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will  stop and think again before voting for the worst piece of legislation  in generations. But I know one thing for certain, House Democrats will  never stop fighting for American families.
