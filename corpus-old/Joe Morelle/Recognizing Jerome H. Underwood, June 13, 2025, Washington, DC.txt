Recognizing Jerome H. Underwood


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Caribbean American  Heritage Month to pay tribute to a distinguished community leader from  Rochester, New York: Jerome H. Underwood.

As Chief Executive Officer of Action for a Better Community and a  founding member of the Greater Rochester Black Agenda Group, Jerome  Underwood has led with clarity, purpose, and unwavering integrity.  Throughout his years of dedicated service, he has been a moral compass  and unifying force in our community, championing social justice and  equity.

Born on the Caribbean island of Antigua, Jerome brought with him to  the United States a deep-rooted sense of community and justice. In  Rochester, he has emerged as a tireless advocate for racial equity and  economic justice, working to expose and dismantle the structural racism  that continues to harm communities of color.

Jerome's leadership extends far beyond boardrooms and policy tables.  He is also a powerful role model for our youth. Merging his love of  soccer with a deep passion for mentorship and ``peaceful'' demeanor, he  has served as Director of Coaching for the River Flow Soccer Club and  President of the Flower City Soccer League.

It is with great pride and admiration that I recognize Jerome H.  Underwood this Caribbean American Heritage Month. His unwavering  commitment to equity, youth empowerment, and community transformation  continues to uplift our community here in Rochester and beyond.
