Recognizing Randy Gorbman's Retirement


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the  distinguished career of Randy Gorbman, the News Director of WXXI, who  will retire at the end of March. With over 45 years in journalism, he  is leaving an indelible mark on the industry and our community as one  of the longest-serving news directors in all of New York State.

Randy oversees WXXI's daily news operations across radio and digital  platforms, all while reporting on local issues himself. Over his  career, his work has covered historic moments including Y2K, the  tragedy of 9/11, the changes in Rochester's economy and iconic  businesses such as Kodak and Bausch + Lomb, and the local jazz festival  every year. A steadfast leader in journalism, he has continually upheld  the principle that every story matters.

I have had the privilege of knowing Randy since my time in the New  York State Assembly, and I have always admired his keen ability to  delve into complex legislative issues with both thoughtfulness and  precision. Those who know him often describe him as insightful, sharp- witted, and deeply dedicated to his craft. His contributions to  journalism and our community have been invaluable, leaving behind a  remarkable legacy that will be difficult to replicate.

As he embarks on this well-earned retirement, I extend my heartfelt  congratulations and gratitude for his many years of service. On behalf  of the WXXI community and all those who have benefited from his  journalism, I wish Randy Gorbman all the best in his next chapter.
