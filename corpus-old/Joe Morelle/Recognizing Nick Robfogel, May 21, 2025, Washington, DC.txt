Recognizing Nick Robfogel


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Jewish American  Heritage Month to recognize an extraordinary individual from Rochester,  NY, whose commitment to service and leadership continues to uplift our  Jewish community: Nathan (Nick) Robfogel.

Nick Robfogel has long exemplified civic responsibility, compassion,  and tireless devotion to the betterment of our region. As Chair of the  Board of Trustees of the Max and Marian Farash Foundation, he has  guided philanthropic efforts that have empowered countless individuals  and organizations across Rochester. Prior to his retirement, Nick  served as a distinguished partner at Harter Secrest & Emery, where he  combined his legal acumen with a deep-seated sense of justice.

A dedicated member of the Board of Governors for the Jewish  Federation, Nick has played a pivotal role in strengthening Jewish life  and fostering a culture of generosity and community-mindedness. His  decades of service and thoughtful leadership have made him an  indispensable figure in our region.

During Jewish American Heritage Month, it is my great privilege to  recognize Nick Robfogel. His legacy of philanthropy, wisdom, and  community-building stands as an inspiration to us all.
