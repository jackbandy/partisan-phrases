Recognizing Rose Bonnick


Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Caribbean American  Heritage Month to recognize an exceptional public servant from  Rochester, New York: Rose Bonnick.

Born in Jamaica, Rose is a proud member of the Caribbean American  community and a tireless advocate for equity and opportunity. As a  Monroe County Legislator and Community Affairs Coordinator for New York  State Senator Jeremy Cooney, she has dedicated her career to amplifying  underrepresented voices and advancing policies that create a lasting  impact. Whether championing local initiatives or supporting statewide  policy efforts, she brings passion and dedication to every role she  undertakes.

Rose is known for her unwavering commitment to uplifting her  constituents, addressing systemic disparities, and building a stronger,  more inclusive Rochester. She embodies the very essence of public  service, leading with empathy and an unshakable belief in the power of  community.

Long before she held public office, Rose was deeply embedded in the  Rochester community through her longstanding work helping Jamaican  immigrants navigate complex landscapes of services and programs. She  became affectionately known among family and friends as a ``community  connector''--someone with a unique ability to guide others through the  hoops and ladders of life. Her knowledge of local systems and her  natural inclination to serve positioned her as a trusted resource and  advocate, particularly for new arrivals seeking stability and  opportunity.

She consistently creates spaces for engagement, education, and  empowerment, fostering the next generation of civic leaders. Her vision  of a more just and equitable society is not just spoken--it is actively  pursued through her daily work and presence in the community.

This Caribbean American Heritage Month, it is with deep respect and  admiration that I recognize Rose Bonnick. Her advocacy continues to  uplift and enrich our community, leaving a lasting impact for  generations to come.
