Recognizing Joe Schumacher's 25 Years of Dedicated Public Service


Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Joe  Schumacher in honor of his 25 years of dedicated public service to  Virginia's 1st Congressional District. Joe has had a profound impact on  my work in Congress, and he is truly one of the finest leaders I know.  Mr. Schumacher served as Chief of Staff and District Director for my  predecessor, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis. I am grateful that Joe brought  his past public service expertise when he began serving as my District  Director in 2007. Joe is a native Virginian, an Air Force veteran, and  a graduate of the University of Virginia.

In his 25 years of service, Joe has proven to be an indispensable  member of my team. His pride for the 1st District extends into  everything he does. Not only is Joe passionate about his work, his  commitment to bettering  the lives of Virginians and Americans alike is unparalleled. Joe is  unwavering in his effort to go above and beyond to serve constituents  and support his fellow staff. For example, his work as the Academy  Coordinator has inspired countless young applicants as they begin their  careers in service to this Nation. Joe's leadership is an outstanding  example of what other District Directors should strive to be and truly  embodies what it means to be a servant leader. I am deeply grateful to  Joe for his years of service, his expertise, and his countless  contributions.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me to recognize Joe Schumacher for  his 25 years of selfless dedication to Virginia's 1st District. Joe is  a crucial member of our team, and I am forever grateful for his service  to our office and to Virginia's 1st District.
