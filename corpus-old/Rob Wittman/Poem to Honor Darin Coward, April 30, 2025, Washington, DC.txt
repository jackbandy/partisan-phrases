Poem to Honor Darin Coward


Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Darin Coward who  worked for 23 years at Colonial Williamsburg. He was beloved by all his  co-workers and many guests over the years due to his hospitality and  welcoming nature. My thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones. I  include in the Record the following poem:                                a spirit of 76       In these the days of our lives, there are those who to us             such warmth provide.      All in their thoughts and deeds realized.      Filling our hearts up so deep inside.      Darin was such a man of warmth and caring.       Imbuing The Sprit of 76 in all his sharing.      Born in Michigan in 1976, later to cross the heartland for a             career to pursue.      To work in one of our forefather's bastion of freedom true.      Colonial Williamsburg of that old red, white, and blue.      A lover of history, why she called out to his heart there was             no mystery.      Like all the great Inn Keeper's of old, he too was a shining             example of hospitality to behold.      Treating his guests like gold, to warm all of their hearts             and souls.      With that kind of smile from across the room heart's would             hold.      Humble as the day was long, all a part of his life's and our             Lord's song.      As year after year, visitors walked up to the front desk             hoping he'd appear.      Creating bonds of friendship throughout all those years.      And why it hurts so bad, knowing what a wonderful friend we             once had here.      Who never let power go to his head, rising up the ranks in             what his fine life to all had said.      The kind of boss every worker wishes by to be led.      Now, proving only the good die young with tear in eye, now in             heaven in The Army of our Lord an angel on high.      And in the coming years, as I walk the paths of all             magnificent patriots of the past so here.      All have met Darin will remember him and all those patriots             and shed a tear.      All one in the same, great American Patriots who once walked             the streets here.      Tonight across Michigan and Williamsburg as you lay your             heads down to rest.      There comes a gentle rain, are but our Lord's tears from up             in Heaven to ease your loved ones pain.      And they will hear Darin on the wind, and when they wake will             feel him next to them where he's been,      Watching over them, until one fine day up in Heaven they meet             again.      And won't have to cry no more.      Our moments are fleeting, so it's our time on Earth which             surely shows our worth in our greetings.      All over our Nation so many have been touched by Darin             meeting.      For his kindness and his caring this spirit of 76 with them             sharing.      Like Frost said, ``I have miles to go'' before I rest.      Life is short so like Darin always give your best.      Rise . . . rise up to heaven Darin with tears in yours eyes,             for our world you have blessed.       In loving memory of Darin Coward.      by Albert ``Bert'' Carey Caswell
