Recognizing the 250th Anniversary of the United States Marine Corps


Mr. ALFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 250th anniversary  of the United States Marine Corps, an institution championing courage,  discipline, and devotion to duty. For two and a half centuries, Marines  have stood on the front lines of freedom, defending our Nation's ideals  at home and abroad with unwavering honor.

Since its founding on November 10, 1775, at Tun Tavern in  Philadelphia, the Marine Corps has embodied the highest standards of  service and sacrifice. From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of  Tripoli, Marines have answered the call of duty with unwavering courage  and honor. Through centuries of conflict and change, they have earned  their reputation as one of the world's most disciplined and lethal  fighting forces, steadfast in their mission to defend our freedom.

In Missouri's 4th Congressional District, we are proud to be home to  two outstanding detachments of the Marine Corps League: the Sgt. Darell  S. Cole Marine Corps League Detachment in Richland and the Warsaw  Leathernecks Marine Corps League Detachment in Warsaw. These  detachments continue to exemplify the Marine spirit long after active  service: honoring fallen comrades while supporting veterans, their  families, and our local communities.

As we commemorate this remarkable milestone, we recognize not only  the 250 years of service and sacrifice by the United States Marine  Corps but also the enduring legacy carried forward by the brave men and  women who wear, or have worn, the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor. Their  commitment to God, Country, and Corps remains a model of selfless  devotion that inspires us all.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Missouri's 4th District, I  extend my deepest gratitude to every Marine, past, present, and future,  for their extraordinary service to our great Nation. May we continue to  honor their courage and uphold the values they so bravely defend.  Semper Fidelis.
