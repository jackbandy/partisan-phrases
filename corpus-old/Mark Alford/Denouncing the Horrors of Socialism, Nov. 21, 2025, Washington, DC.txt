Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism


Mr. ALFORD. Mr. Speaker, my blood pressure is up right now. I cannot  believe what I just heard on the House floor, the ranking member of  this distinguished committee denouncing Trump but will not denounce  socialism on the House floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.

History is clear. Socialism kills people. It leads to the deaths of  tens of millions. It crushes religious liberty and destroys free  markets.

Our Founders built this Nation on a revolutionary idea that  individual liberty and not government control is a source of human  achievement. They understood that when the government owns the economy,  they soon seek to own the people.

I hope people who are watching right now on C-SPAN or on the news get  what is going on in this body today. This side is against socialism.  That side is for socialism. I am disgusted with what is going on in  this body, and I hope the American people see through the charade, the  gaslighting, and the lies that are being told.
