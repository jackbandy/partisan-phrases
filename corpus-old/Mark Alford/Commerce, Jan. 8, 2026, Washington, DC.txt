Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. ALFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and my good friend,  Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, for their leadership.

Mr. Speaker, for too long, Washington has governed by crisis:  shutdown threats, continuing resolutions, these omnibus bills, and  backroom deals that the American people never asked for.

Mr. Speaker, this bill proves that those days are coming to an end.  The Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and  Interior and Environment Appropriations Act, 2026 is bipartisan,  bicameral, and built the right way--from the ground up, from  subcommittees up.

It strengthens our national security, restores American energy  dominance, backs law enforcement, combats illicit drugs, and supports  responsible land management, all while spending less than the current  continuing resolution.

Mr. Speaker, that is not chaos. That is responsible governing. There  are no poison pills, no partisan games, and full-year funding that  takes shutdown leverage off the table and allows America to plan,  build, and lead.

As an appropriator, I am proud of what this bill delivers for  Missouri's Fourth Congressional District. There are several investments  that I won't go into here, but I am proud of this process. I am proud  to be under the leadership of   Tom Cole. I have never seen a  committee--and I know I have been on your committee, as well. I have  never worked this hard in my life, but I have never been more proud of  what I am able to do in this body and on this committee.

Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill.
