Transparency and Predictability in Small Business Opportunities Act


Mr. ALFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for yielding, and I thank  our friend from Kentucky for his leadership.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 789, the  Transparency and Predictability in Small Business Opportunities Act.

Small businesses aren't just part of our economy. They are our  economy, Mr. Speaker. They are the innovators, the job creators, the  backbone of our communities, and the heartbeat of Main Street America.

Far too often, as we have seen, they have been overlooked,  underserved, and, frankly, undermined by the very government they pay  taxes to support. Federal agencies are simply not doing enough to open  the door for small businesses to compete. Mr. Speaker, this must  change.

To do that, I am proud to co-lead this bipartisan bill because  supporting our small businesses should never be a Republican or  Democratic issue. It is an American issue, Mr. Speaker.

Here is what is happening: When a Federal agency determines they have  a need for certain products or services, then that agency's acquisition  personnel will post a solicitation on the Federal Government's SAM.gov  website for a contract to fill the requirements. That solicitation lays  out what the agency wants to buy, how it will evaluate the bids, and  when responses are due.

In good faith, small businesses dedicate precious time, money, and  resources, sometimes thousands of dollars, to just submit these  proposals. Too often, they are met with silence, confusion, or outright  cancelation of the solicitation without any explanation. That is not  just inefficient. That is unfair.

Agencies right now have broad discretion to cancel or amend  solicitations without any transparency whatsoever. A small business can  go all in on a contract proposal only to watch it vanish like that with  no reason given. That is unacceptable.

H.R. 789 brings much-needed transparency and accountability to this  process. It requires agencies to disclose why a solicitation was  canceled because our small businesses deserve to know. Additionally,  our bill requires a Federal agency's Office of Small Business and  Disadvantaged Business Utilization to help small businesses find  additional opportunities if a solicitation on which they made an offer  is canceled so that they can go after these opportunities.

Small businesses create most of the new jobs in this country. In  fact, in Missouri's Fourth Congressional District and in rural  communities across America, they are the lifeline and fabric of our  communities, but time and time again, they are squeezed out by  overregulation and ignored by the bureaucracy. They are pushed aside in  favor of corporations with high-paid consultants and armies of  lobbyists.

That is wrong, and by passing H.R. 789, we take a concrete step  toward restoring fairness in Federal contracting and rebuilding the  relationship between our government and the small businesses it is  supposed to serve.

I thank Congressmen Latimer and Mfume for their partnership on this  legislation. I also applaud the Small Business Committee chairman,  Roger Williams, for his leadership in putting Main Street America  first.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support the Transparency and Predictability in Small Business  Opportunities Act.
