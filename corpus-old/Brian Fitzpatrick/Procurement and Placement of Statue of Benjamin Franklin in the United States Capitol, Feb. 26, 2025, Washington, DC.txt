Procurement and Placement of Statue of Benjamin Franklin in the United States Capitol


Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman, my friend from  Wisconsin, Representative Steil, for yielding.

To my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan), this is  really the product of her hard work. I was proud to partner with her  and accept an invitation. If Benjamin Franklin were here today, he  would give Representative Houlahan a big hug of gratitude for finally  recognizing him.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in resolute support of H.R. 250, the  Benjamin Franklin statue placement act. Alongside my friend and  colleague from Pennsylvania, Congresswoman Houlahan, I am proud to  advance this effort to enshrine one of America's most extraordinary  minds and consequential patriots in the heart of our Nation's Capitol.

Madam Speaker, few figures in our history so fully embody the spirit  of American ingenuity, perseverance, and democratic virtue as Benjamin  Franklin. He was a statesman whose diplomacy secured our independence,  a philosopher whose wisdom guided our early Republic, and an inventor  whose genius advanced mankind.

More than a son of Pennsylvania, Benjamin Franklin was and remains a  towering architect of the American experiment, a testament to what is  possible when vision and virtue work in concert with one another.

As we approach the 250th anniversary of our great Nation, it is both  fitting and necessary that Benjamin Franklin take his rightful place  amongst the great figures enshrined in this amazing  place. To commemorate this milestone without visibly honoring one of  its chief architects would be to overlook the very ideals that built  our great Republic.

Benjamin Franklin lived his life with a deliberate sense of purpose,  beginning each day by asking: What good shall I do on this day? And  ending every evening in reflection: What good have I done today?

Madam Speaker, that is not just a measure of a life well lived. It is  the measure of leadership, of duty, and of a nation that strives always  to be better than it was the day before. Let us take up that challenge  not merely in words but in action.

Let us ensure that Benjamin Franklin's presence in these Halls serves  as a constant reminder that our charge is not to serve ourselves, but  to serve a greater good.

At the close of each day, may we too be able to answer that question  with certainty, having served with purpose, led with integrity, and  upheld the ideals that Franklin and our Founders entrusted to us.
