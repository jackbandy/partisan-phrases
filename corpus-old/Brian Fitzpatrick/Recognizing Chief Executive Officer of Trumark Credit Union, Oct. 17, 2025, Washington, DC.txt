Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate  Ms. Kelly Botti, a respected leader, advocate, and CEO of Trumark  Credit Union, whose birthday on November 3rd provides a fitting  occasion to honor her outstanding service and dedication to our  communities.

Based in the Greater Philadelphia region, Ms. Kelly Botti has built a  distinguished career marked by integrity, compassion, and an unwavering  commitment to financial empowerment. As CEO of Trumark Credit Union,  she has championed innovative approaches to serve the underserved and  underbanked, expanding access to fair, transparent, and affordable  financial services for families and small businesses alike. Her  leadership reflects the very best of what community driven institutions  can achieve when guided by a mission of service over profit.

Kelly has also been a steadfast advocate for the credit union  movement on both state and national levels. Her thoughtful engagement  with policymakers like myself rooted in collaboration, expertise, and  genuine care for people, has advanced the cause of financial inclusion  in the First Congressional District of Pennsylvania and across the  entire Commonwealth and beyond. Through her advocacy, countless  individuals have gained new opportunities to achieve financial  stability, education, and independence.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of  Representatives, to help me extend my heartfelt congratulations to Ms.  Kelly Botti for her achievements, her leadership, and her continuing  efforts to make a meaningful difference in the lives of others.
