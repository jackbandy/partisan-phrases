Recognizing Neshaminy School District Core Creek Elementary School Principal Brian Kern for 32 Years of Service


Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an incredible  individual from my district. Brian Kern of Bucks County, Pennsylvania  has served the Neshaminy School District for the past 32 years. On July  1, Principal Kern retired from his career in public education, closing  a chapter marked by educational leadership, unwavering support for  students, and dedicated service to his community.

In August 1993, Principal Kern began his career in education as a  Music Teacher at Maple Point Middle School. Six years later, he rose to  the challenge of administrative leadership, serving as Assistant  Principal at Neshaminy High School and later at Neshaminy Middle  School. In 2004, he became Principal of Oliver Heckman Elementary  School, a role he held for 11 years. In 2015, he took on the position  of Principal at Pearl S. Buck Elementary School--which recently  transitioned to Core Creek Elementary School--where he has served for  the past decade.

Principal Kern's service extends well beyond his three decades of  educational leadership within the Neshaminy community. From 2011 to  2013, he served as President of Friends of Steinert Jazz, a group  dedicated to supporting the Steinert High School Jazz Band Program. In  this role, he helped organize events and fundraisers for these  students. Between 2014 and 2017, he volunteered with the music program  at Princeton High School. Additionally, for the past decade, he has  volunteered as a docent for Cranbury Historic Home Tours. Throughout  his entire professional journey, Principal Kern has seamlessly combined  his passion for music, arts, and culture with his work in educational  administration.

Beyond his professional achievements, Principal Kern is a devoted  husband and father. His wife, Diane, is a full-time realtor, and the  couple celebrated their 35th anniversary in July before traveling to  Europe together this fall. Together, they have raised two sons and a  daughter, all of whom have excelled in their respective fields:  nursing, aerospace engineering, and special education.

Principal Brian Kern is truly a remarkable figure in our district. We  commend him on his retirement after 32 years of dedicated service to  public education in Neshaminy. He soon will be working at Darianna  Bridal and Tuxedo in Warrington as manager of the tuxedo department,  focusing on business development and community connections.  Congratulations again to Principal Kern.
