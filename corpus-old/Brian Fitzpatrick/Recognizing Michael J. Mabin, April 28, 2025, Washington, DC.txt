Recognizing Michael J. Mabin, Jr.--50 Years of Life, Leadership, and Service


Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable  leader, dedicated family man, and proud son of Bucks County--Mr.  Michael J. Mabin, Jr., President and CEO of PennFab, Inc.,  headquartered in Morrisville and Martelli Companies, headquartered in  Ivyland.

Mike Mabin is more than a successful businessman--he is a builder of  community, a job  creator, and a champion for working families in Pennsylvania's First  Congressional District. Through his leadership, generosity, and vision,  Mike has helped shape not only the economic fabric of our region, but  its moral character as well.

Mike was born on February 24, 1975, in Bucks County. He grew up in  Levittown before moving to the Holland neighborhood and later settling  with his wife Kristie (nee Kash) and their children--Michael, Ashlynne,  and Jamison--in Ivyland, Pennsylvania.

Born and raised in Bucks County, Mike Mabin, Jr.'s story is one of  homegrown leadership, generational grit, and a deep-rooted commitment  to community. He got his start on the shop floor of his family's  fabrication business, PennFab, where he worked side-by-side with his  father and gained not just a trade, but a calling. From the very  beginning, Mike understood that real leadership isn't about titles-- it's about responsibility: to your people, to your hometown, and to the  future.

When Mike assumed leadership of PennFab following his father's  passing in 2018, he did far more than carry on a legacy--he redefined  it. With bold vision and relentless determination, he transformed a  respected local operation into a nationally recognized infrastructure  partner. He expanded operations, acquired PennFab's sister company,  Martelli Companies LLC, and positioned both businesses as critical  players in some of the Nation's most vital sectors while keeping their  roots firmly planted in Bucks County.

But the measure of Mike's success isn't just found in the scale of  the business--it's in the strength of the community he's built around  it. He has created hundreds of family-sustaining jobs right here at  home. He's mentored young tradespeople, empowered second-chance  workers, and in doing so, restored something too many communities have  lost: the dignity of work, and the hope that comes with it.

At a time when much of our Nation's industrial foundation has eroded,  Mike made a different choice--he reinvested. He proved that American  manufacturing can still thrive, that ``Made in Bucks County'' still  matters, and that a business rooted in values can lift entire  neighborhoods.

Mike's commitment to the community doesn't stop at the manufacturing  doors. Whether it's stepping up in times of need, supporting local  nonprofits, or quietly funding initiatives that benefit area youth,  families and veterans, Mike has always led by example--without seeking  credit, and always putting others first.

Mr. Speaker, the story of Mike Mabin, Jr. is the story of Bucks  County Leader at his best--rooted in family, built by hard work, and  driven by a relentless belief in the power of community. We thank him  for the lives he's uplifted, the jobs he's created, and the example he  continues to set for what local leadership should look like.

He hasn't just carried forward a legacy--he's forged one of his own.
