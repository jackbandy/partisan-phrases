Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend  Mr. Paul Calderaio for his extraordinary dedication to public service  and his lasting contributions to Buckingham Township in Bucks County,  Pennsylvania.

Paul's commitment to service began early in his life while living in  Florida. That dedication only deepened after he and his family made  Buckingham Township their home. For more than three decades, Paul  Calderaio has exemplified the very best of local civic leadership,  devoting his time, energy, and experience to strengthening his  community.

A resident of Buckingham Township since 1955, Paul and his wife have  raised their four children in Bucks County, firmly rooting their family  in the community he has worked so diligently to serve. His public  service to the Township spans nearly 25 years, first as Township  Auditor and later as a Township supervisor, roles in which he  demonstrated integrity, responsibility, and a steadfast commitment to  transparency and good governance.

Throughout his tenure, Paul was a strong advocate for open space  preservation and played a key role in campaigning for a Township bond  dedicated to protecting land for future generations. His leadership  helped ensure that Buckingham Township balanced growth with  preservation, safeguarding its rural character and quality of life.

The results of his dedication are clear and admirable. Under the  leadership of officials like Paul Calderaio, Buckingham Township has  been ranked the safest township in Pennsylvania for its size, maintains  some of the lowest township tax rates in Bucks County, and has achieved  an exceptional AAA bond rating. This is an honor shared by only seven  townships in the entire Commonwealth. Additionally, more than 6,500  acres of open space has been preserved, and the Township is  consistently recognized as one of the best places to live in  Pennsylvania,

Mr. Speaker, these accomplishments do not happen by chance. They are  the product of years of thoughtful leadership, careful use of public  resources, and an unwavering commitment to the people of Buckingham  Township. Paul's legacy is one of service, accountability, and  community pride.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Paul  Calderaio for his many years of service and to thank him for the  positive and lasting impact he has had on Buckingham Township, Bucks  County, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
