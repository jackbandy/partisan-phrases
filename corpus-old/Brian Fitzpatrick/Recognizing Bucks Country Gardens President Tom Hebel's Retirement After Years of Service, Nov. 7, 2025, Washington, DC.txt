Recognizing Bucks Country Gardens President Tom Hebel's Retirement After Years of Service


Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable  constituent from my district, Mr. Tom Hebel, proprietor of Bucks  Country Gardens in Doylestown, Pennsylvania--a business that has, for  more than six decades, helped beautify homes and enrich communities  throughout Bucks County and beyond.

Founded in 1961 as Royer Nurseries, the family run business has  become a cornerstone of the local community, known for its commitment  to excellence, creativity, and service. Mr. Hebel joined the company in  1981 as a young landscape designer, quickly finding a mentor and  partner in owner Mr. Dick Royer who shared his vision for inspiring  outdoor living. After a decade of collaboration, Mr. Hebel assumed  ownership, guiding the business through decades of growth and  transformation while remaining true to its founding principles.

Under Mr. Hebel's leadership, Bucks Country Gardens has thrived as  both a retail garden center and a landscape design firm. The garden  center offers an impressive array of plants, trees, and flowers as well  as fine outdoor furniture from trusted brands such as Castelle,  Hanamint, Telescope, and Jensen Outdoor. The boutique complements these  offerings with unique gifts, jewelry, and home decor that reflect the  artistry and taste of the region. From modest terraces to expansive  poolside retreats and vegetable gardens, Bucks Country Gardens has  helped countless homeowners turn their dreams into reality--always  balancing creativity, functionality, and responsibility.

Mr. Hebel, a proud graduate of Penn State University's Landscape  Architecture program, has long emphasized that landscaping is both a  financial and a lifestyle investment. Through his guidance, the company  has earned a reputation not only for its design expertise but also for  its enduring client relationships through many generations.

Now, as Bucks Country Gardens enters a new chapter, Mr. Hebel looks  with pride to his sons, Gregory and Ryan Hebel, who together represent  the next generation of leadership. Gregory, who oversees the company's  design-build operations, and Ryan, who manages the retail garden  center, share their father's passion for connecting people to the  outdoors. With their dedication and vision, the future of Bucks Country  Gardens shines brightly.

Mr. Hebel's decades of work have brought joy, inspiration, and beauty  to the people of Bucks County. His story reflects the very best of  American entrepreneurship--family, creativity, and community spirit-- and stands as a testament to the enduring value of small businesses in  our Nation's fabric.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Tom Hebel  and the entire Bucks Country Gardens team for their remarkable  contributions to the community, their commitment to excellence, and  their role in nurturing both the community and the people they serve.
