Recognizing the Heroism of the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department


Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the  courageous divers and first responders of the District of Columbia Fire  and Emergency Medical Services Department, whose swift and selfless  actions in the aftermath of the devastating collision between American  Airlines Flight 5342 and a United States Army Blackhawk Helicopter over  the Potomac River showed heroism in the face of tragedy.

When the unthinkable happened on that cold January evening, it was  the brave men and women of D.C. Fire and EMS who rushed to the scene.  Without regard for their own safety, these highly trained professionals  entered dangerous, frigid conditions, diving into the depths of the  Potomac to conduct a search and rescue, and bring comfort to the  families and civilians anxiously watching and waiting onshore.

In the face of disaster, the efforts of the D.C. Fire and EMS divers  were nothing short of heroic. Their steadfast presence and commitment  to vigorously search amidst the confusion and chaos was a source of  strength to a city, region, and Nation in mourning.

The divers of D.C. Fire and EMS showed us the very best of public  service. Their leadership, courage, and compassion make us proud. They  upheld their duty with unwavering courage and commitment.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that this body join me in extending our deepest  gratitude to these first responders. Let the record show our respect,  our appreciation, and our enduring thanks to the divers of D.C. Fire  and EMS. May their service continue to be an example for future  generations of public servants to follow.
