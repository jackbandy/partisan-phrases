Recognizing Chief Glenn Forsyth's 50 Years of Service with the Newtown Fire Association


Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with deep pride and  gratitude to recognize a truly remarkable individual from my district-- Chief Glenn Forsyth of Newtown Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

This year, Chief Forsyth is celebrating an incredible milestone--50  years of continuous service with the Newtown Fire Association.

Let me repeat that: Five decades of commitment, sacrifice, and  leadership in the name of public safety. Glenn's journey with the fire  service began in 1975 as a junior firefighter. But really, you could  say it started even earlier--his family has proudly served in the  Newtown Fire Association since 1915. Service is in his blood.

Over the years, Glenn has worn many hats--President, Trustee,  Battalion Chief, Safety Officer. At every level, he's brought steady  leadership, tireless work ethic, and a deep love for this community.

But Chief Forsyth's public service didn't stop at the firehouse. In  1984, he joined the Newtown Township Police Department, where he served  for 28 years, ultimately retiring as a respected Police Lieutenant.  That experience made him uniquely qualified to lead when Newtown  created its first full-time, paid fire chief position in 2012.

And who better to take on that role than Glenn Forsyth?

Since then, he has guided the department through growth,  modernization, and challenges--building a unified team of career and  volunteer firefighters, all committed to protecting the people of  Newtown.

Chief Forsyth has given his entire adult life to the safety and well- being of this township. His name is respected, his leader ship is  trusted, and his example is one we should all strive to follow.

On behalf of a grateful community, I want to thank Chief Glenn  Forsyth for 50 years of extraordinary service. May his legacy of  courage and commitment inspire the next generation of firefighters and  public servants for many years to come.

I congratulate Chief Forsyth. We salute him.
