National Police Week


Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week  to honor the men and women in law enforcement for their invaluable  service to our Nation.

I especially thank all of the police officers in my district who work  tirelessly to ensure that southeastern Arizona is safe, secure, and the  best place to live and to carry out our own American Dream.

During times of crisis, when others run away, our brave police  officers run toward danger, putting themselves at risk to protect life  and property.

Their courage, selflessness, and dedication deserve our deepest  respect, not just this week, but every single day.

Let us also remember, honor, and mourn the officers who made the  ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Their legacy lives on in the  lives they protected, the officers they mentored, and the communities  they kept safe.

Mr. Speaker, I thank every single office across this great Nation for  their service. We are a stronger, safer, and more prosperous Nation  because of them.                       Recognition of Shanequa Matthias

Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today full of pride to  congratulate Cochise County Teacher of the Year and Carmichael  Elementary School's fifth grade teacher Shanequa Matthias.

Mr. Speaker, I thank her for her tireless efforts on behalf of our  students.

I firmly believe that education is the pillar of the American Dream,  and it is our teachers who care for our students, pass on the knowledge  and skills that they need to succeed, and inspire them to dream big and  embrace all of the opportunities our great Nation has to offer.

As a teacher, she embraced a nontraditional, engaging classroom  style, where learning is less about memorization and more about  creativity, play, and hands-on experience.

Her dedication, compassion, and unwavering belief in the potential of  every single one of her students is deeply inspiring and has left a  permanent mark on all who learn from her.

Her work is directly contributing to a bigger, better, and brighter  future for Cochise County.

Mr. Speaker, I thank her for always uplifting her students. May she  enjoy this well-deserved recognition. Once again, congratulations to  Shanequa Matthias.                  Congratulating Canyon del Oro High School
