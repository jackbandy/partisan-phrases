Prioritizing Veterans' Survivors Act


Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Bost for yielding me  time today to speak in support of my bill, H.R. 1228, the Prioritizing  Veterans' Survivors Act.

Since being elected, I have heard from military servicemembers and  surviving family members about their struggles accessing VA benefits.

In my district, I started a Veterans Advisory Council, and we often  discuss this very topic to find ways to better this situation. I am  always looking to ensure that Department of Veterans Affairs leaders  hear the concerns of veterans' loved ones.

From its creation, the Office of Survivors Assistance, OSA, was meant  to serve as the principal adviser to the VA Secretary on all survivors'  benefits and services, as well, including medical care and burial  benefits.

When the VA placed OSA within the Veterans Benefits Administration,  they deprioritized survivors' policies and skirted Congress' intent  when it created this office.

My bill would fix this by requiring OSA to operate within the  Secretary's office, thereby prioritizing advocacy and services for  servicemembers' and veterans' surviving spouses and families, as well.

I will highlight the comment of a member of my Veterans Advisory  Council, Ms. Jane Strain, a surviving spouse and an Army veteran  herself. She said: Surviving spouses and families who cared for  children, moved many times during a military career, compromised their  own careers, and maintained their homelife while the servicemember was  deployed have earned and deserve attention when the spouse has passed.  Placing the OSA directly under the Secretary will help to recognize the  importance of this population.

Mr. Speaker, I was proud to work alongside Chairman Bost on this to  ensure survivors have a seat at the table.  I urge my colleagues to support and pass this commonsense legislation  again in the 119th Congress as it did without objection last Congress.
