Veterans Education and Technical Skills Opportunity Act of 2025


Mr. CISCOMANI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1458,  the VETS Opportunity Act of 2025, a bill I introduced to modernize  veterans' education benefits and align them with today's workforce  needs.

As I represent nearly 80,000 veterans in southern Arizona, I know  firsthand when servicemembers transition to civilian life, they bring  discipline, leadership, and a strong work ethic, but too often the  system limits how they can use the benefits that they earned. This bill  changes that by modernizing the GI Bill and expanding access to high- quality certificates and technical training programs, possibly offered  in a hybrid format, that lead directly to good-paying jobs in high- demand fields.

Not every veteran wants or needs a traditional 4-year degree. Many  want fast, skills-based training that connects them to careers in the  trades, healthcare, technology, and other critical fields. This bill  recognizes reality, and it gives veterans the flexibility to choose the  path that works best for them and their families.

Furthermore, this legislation includes clear protections to ensure  the program operates efficiently and that veterans' benefits are used  responsibly as well. Programs like this one must be accredited,  approved by the VA, and provide regular and substantive interaction  between instructors and students.

The VETS Opportunity Act is about modernizing our VA benefits and  programs to empower veterans, strengthen the workforce, and honor the  promise this country made to those who served. By strengthening  education benefits, we empower veterans, build a stronger workforce,  and drive a stronger economy.

This bill turns service into opportunity and commitment into careers.  That is what our veterans deserve, and that is what our communities  need.

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1458 and vote  ``yes.''
