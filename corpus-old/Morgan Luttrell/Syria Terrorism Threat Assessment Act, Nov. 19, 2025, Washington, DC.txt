Syria Terrorism Threat Assessment Act


Mr. LUTTRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Guest for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for the passage of H.R. 1327,  the Syria Terrorism Threat Assessment Act.

When the Assad regime was toppled in Syria late last year, the threat  of terrorism did not disappear. It just actually shifted, adapted, and  found new ways to survive.

For decades, the Assad regime gave terrorist groups a place to train,  organize, and plan attacks. You don't just swipe away the leadership  and make the terrorism go away. Those threats don't disappear  overnight, and we would be foolish to think otherwise.

Although Syria's Government is in transition and terrorist  designations against its new leadership have been lifted, we must not  be naive to other terrorist threats that may still originate in the  region.

This bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a  threat assessment posed to the U.S. by individuals in Syria associated  with foreign terrorist organizations.

As this body and this administration determine how best to engage  with Syria in a post-Assad era, this threat assessment ensures that we  have the information we need to make these decisions with eyes wide  open. By doing so, we can better examine and mitigate emerging threats  from the region.

Our mission is clear. We must protect American lives and prevent  future attacks on the homeland by strengthening our counterterrorism  efforts.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Correa for his support, and I urge my  colleagues to support this sensible legislation.

Mr. GOLDMAN of New York.

Mr. Speaker, we have a duty to be vigilant about potential terrorist  threats to the homeland. This bill ensures that the Department of  Homeland Security will do just that.

I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
