Congratulating Supercross Rider Aaron Plessinger


Mr. LUTTRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Monster  Energy American Motocross professional supercross racer Aaron  Plessinger on his remarkable victory and his second career win under  what many are calling the worst conditions in track history this year.

This wasn't just a race. It was a test of endurance, resilience, and  unwavering determination. In the face of deep ruts, relentless mud, and  brutal terrain, Mr. Plessinger, ``The Cowboy,'' displayed not only  exceptional athleticism but also the kind of mental toughness that  defines true champions.

His performance serves as an inspiration not only to inspiring  athletes but to Americans who know the success that often comes when  the odds are stacked against them.

We salute Aaron's grit, his perseverance, and his example, and we  congratulate him on a well-earned victory.
