March for Life


Mr. MESSMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about something very  important to me, my family, and the majority of Hoosiers in Indiana's  Eighth District: the protection of the unborn and the 2026 March for  Life.

As a devout Catholic, I am grateful that from my position in  Congress, I can support legislation that protects the defenseless  unborn and can stand up for their God-given right to survive, a gift  that truly should only be endowed upon any of us by the grace of our  creator.

It is truly inspiring to witness the multitudes of Americans who  journey from far distances across this great country to attend the  march.

In my role in the House of Representatives, I am a reliable vote for  the pro-life community and have been able to sponsor many pieces of  legislation that provide for the needs of pregnant mothers and the life  they are carrying in the womb.

I am honored to celebrate each person participating in this year's  march, and I am grateful to be in the position to support the hopes of  every Hoosier and American devoted to the sanctity of life.

It is my great privilege and fervent promise that I will never give  up fighting for those who cannot fight for themselves.
