Congratulating South Knox Girls' Basketball Team


Mr. MESSMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my personal  congratulations to the South Knox girls' basketball team for taking the  Class 2A State championship. In the stunning 55-33 win, the South Knox  Spartans earned the school's first statewide championship victory.

Basketball is a foundational part of our identity as Hoosiers, and  they even gave us a term, ``Hoosier Hysteria,'' to describe just how  seriously we take this sport and how many top players we produce.

Congratulations once again to the girls' basketball team at South  Knox and to Coach Hollie Eaves for showing everyone just how well they  play basketball in Verne, Indiana.
