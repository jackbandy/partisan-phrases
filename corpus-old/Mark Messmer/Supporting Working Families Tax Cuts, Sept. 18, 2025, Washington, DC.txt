Supporting Working Families Tax Cuts


Mr. MESSMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the massive  benefits that my constituents in Indiana and all Americans will reap  thanks to the passage of the working families tax cuts.

I am so pleased we are able to put hardworking taxpayer dollars back  into the pockets of deserving Americans. Mr. Speaker, because of this  important legislation, the critical savings they will now receive can  be poured back into the economy to fuel it and get our country's fiscal  health back on track.

At home in Indiana's Eighth Congressional District, more than 80,000  Hoosier families have been protected from losing half of the child tax  credits. Thanks to the death tax exemption, Hoosier farmers can pass  their family-owned farms down to their children without losing most of  it to the IRS.

Mr. Speaker, I look forward to more opportunities to deliver tax  relief and eliminate waste and fraud for my constituents so they can  survive and continue raising their families in the greatest country in  the world. May God bless Indiana, and may God bless America.
