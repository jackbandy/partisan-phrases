Harry Christensen Remembered for Decades of Public Service


Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Harry Christensen, a devoted public servant, attorney, and United  States Marine Corps veteran from Marblehead, Massachusetts, who passed  away earlier this month at 86.

Harry Christensen exemplified what it means to live a life of  service. He was a highly decorated veteran of the United States Marine  Corps, receiving numerous awards, including the prestigious Silver Star  for gallantry in action. After his military service, Harry returned to  Massachusetts and built a respected legal and civic career. He was  deeply committed to his community, especially his hometown of  Marblehead, serving for decades on the Marblehead Board of Selectmen.

Beyond his official roles, Harry shared his wartime experiences with  local students, believing that personal stories brought history to life  in ways textbooks could not. For over a decade, he spoke to classes at  Marblehead High School, helping students understand the human cost of  war through his firsthand accounts. His honesty and devotion left  lasting impressions on Marblehead students, making the lessons of  history real and deeply felt.

Harry never wanted to be far from Marblehead Rock. He loved the  Marines, his country, his town, and--most of all--his family.

May Harry's life remind us all that public service is a calling  grounded in humility and honor. I extend my deepest condolences to his  family, friends, and the countless members of the community whose lives  he touched. We miss Harry. Semper Fi.
