Recognizing Sadie Pirez, Chevrolet Play Ball Player of the Month


Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sadie Pirez of  Readington, New Jersey, who has been recognized nationally as a  Chevrolet Play Ball Player of the Month by Major League Baseball. This  program highlights outstanding young athletes across the country who  demonstrate exceptional talent, sportsmanship, and dedication to the  game. Sadie has achieved remarkable success both on and off the field.  She has been a part of three championship teams over the past three  seasons and was selected for the Branchburg Recreation Spring 2025 All- Star Team. Sadie led her travel team to the Parkway League Spring  Division Championship and was team leader in runs scored and RBI's,  carrying an impressive .521 batting average and .662 on-base percentage  this past spring.

Off the field, Sadie is a two-time Hunterdon Art Museum Young Artist  Award recipient and has been featured in the Holland Brook School  Bobcat Bulletin. She also maintains straight A's in all core subjects.  I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring Sadie and her remarkable  achievements, and I look forward to seeing Sadie continue to be  successful both on and off the field for years to come.
