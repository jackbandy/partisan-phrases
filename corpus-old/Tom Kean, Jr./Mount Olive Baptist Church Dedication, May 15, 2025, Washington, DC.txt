Mount Olive Baptist Church Dedication


Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the dedication of  the historic Mount Olive Baptist Church in Mount Olive Township, New  Jersey. On June 7th, the community will gather to celebrate the  completion of a renovation project, honoring the legacy of this  cherished place of worship. The Mount Olive Baptist Church has been a  cornerstone of faith, fellowship, and community for generations. Its  restoration represents not only the preservation of an important  historic landmark but also the enduring strength of the congregation  and the broader Mount Olive community. I commend the Mount Olive  Township and the Mount Olive Township Historical Society for their  dedication to this project. Their efforts ensure that future  generations will continue to find connection and purpose within the  church's walls. As we mark this special occasion, I extend my  congratulations to the church leadership, parishioners, and community  members whose vision and hard work brought this renovation to fruition.  May the Mount Olive Baptist Church continue to serve as a beacon of  faith and hope for many years to come.
