Recognizing John Post


Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy  of John N. Post--a patriot who was and still is truly committed to  service, community, and country. John moved to Westfield, New Jersey,  at age ten and graduated from Westfield High School in 1958. He  attended St. Peter's College, where he joined the U.S. Marine Corps  Platoon Leaders Class program. On the day he graduated in 1962, he was  commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Marine Corps. John went on  to study at Georgetown Law School and was admitted to the bar in both  New Jersey and the District of Columbia. He served for three years as a  legal officer in the Marine Corps, advising commands both in the U.S.  and in Vietnam. In 1966, while still on active duty, John married his  wife, Mary. After completing his service, he founded the law firm now  known as Post Polak, P.A., where he served as managing partner until  2008.

Today, I am pleased to join the Borough of Mountainside in honoring  John Post as he serves as a Co-Grand Marshal of the Mountainside  Memorial Day Parade. His life is a testament to the core principles  that define our Nation: service, commitment, and integrity.
