Recognizing Chester First Aid Squad's 80th Anniversary


Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service and  commitment of the Chester First Aid Squad. Since 1945, the Chester  First Aid Squad has provided exceptional care in times of need. For 80  years, these volunteers have provided free and professional support to  the people of Chester and to neighboring communities during medical  emergencies. The squad has logged thousands of hours administering  emergency assistance to others exemplifying the spirit of sacrifice and  volunteerism that embody New Jersey's 7th Congressional District.

I ask my colleagues today to join me in commending this exemplary  organization and congratulating them on 80 years of extraordinary  community service.
