Recognizing Jay Post


Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jay Post--a  dedicated patriot, family man, and valued member of his community. Jay  moved to Westfield, New Jersey, in 1951. He graduated from Westfield  High School in 1957 and earned his degree from Siena College in 1961.  Soon after, he completed Officer Basic Training at the U.S. Army Field  Artillery School in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and was deployed to Korea with  the 7th Infantry Division, where he helped defend the Demilitarized  Zone. After being honorably discharged as a First Lieutenant in 1963,  Jay worked for Ford Motor Company and later earned an MBA in Finance  from Columbia University. In 1965, he married his wife, Arleen. They  returned to Westfield to raise their four children, and in 1995, moved  to Mountainside, where they still live today.

I am pleased to join the Borough of Mountainside in recognizing Jay  Post as a Co-Grand Marshal of this year's Memorial Day Parade. His life  of service, leadership, and love of country is truly deserving of our  gratitude and shall be remembered for years to come.
