Recognizing the Land of Make Believe, the World's Greatest Amusement Park


Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Land of Make  Believe in Hope Township, Warren County the ``World's Greatest  Amusement Park,'' the ``Most Iconic Amusement Park in New Jersey'' and  the ``Number One Amusement Park in New Jersey.''

The Land of Make Believe has provided lasting entertainment and fun  in the Northern New Jersey area for over seven decades. Since its  founding in 1954 by Herman Maier, the park has remained family-owned  and operated, with the Maier family upholding the same high standards  of excellence and service that have defined it from the beginning.  These high standards also earned the Land of Make Believe the award of  ``Best Theme Park in New Jersey'' by MSN.com earlier this summer.  Christopher Maier, Herman's son and the park's current owner, credited  its most recent achievement to the park's enduring commitment to  affordability, safety, and family-centered fun.

As we celebrate this accomplishment, I invite my colleagues to join  me in honoring this beloved institution and its legacy. I look forward  to seeing it continue to bring joy to generations of families for years  to come in Warren County and beyond.
