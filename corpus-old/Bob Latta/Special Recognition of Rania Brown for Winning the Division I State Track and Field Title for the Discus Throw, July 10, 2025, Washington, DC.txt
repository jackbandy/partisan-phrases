Special Recognition of Rania Brown for Winning the Division I State Track and Field Title for the Discus Throw


Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school athlete  from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. Rania Brown, a senior at Avon  High School, has represented her school ably on her way to achieving  the Division I State Title for the Discus Throw at the State Track and  Field Meet. Rania overcame the challenges posed by intense competition  in her effort to win the title.

In pursuing the State Championship, Rania defeated her opponents with  an impressive throw of 153 feet 4 inches. Her hard work and dedication,  both on and off the field, in achieving this accomplishment is truly  outstanding. She has achieved an impressive season, bringing pride to  her school and community.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to Rania Brown of Avon High School. On behalf of the people of the  Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great achievement.
