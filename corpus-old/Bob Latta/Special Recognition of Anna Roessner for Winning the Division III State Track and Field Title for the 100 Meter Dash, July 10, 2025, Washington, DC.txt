Special Recognition of Anna Roessner for Winning the Division III State Track and Field Title for the 100 Meter Dash


Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school athlete  from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. Anna Roessner, a senior at  Fort Recovery High School, has represented her school ably on her way  to achieving the Division III State Title for the 100 Meter Dash at the  State Track and Field Meet. Anna overcame the challenges posed by  intense competition in her effort to win the title.

In pursuing the State Championship, Anna defeated her opponents with  an impressive time of 11.75 seconds. Her hard work and dedication, both  on and off the track, in achieving this accomplishment is truly  outstanding. She has achieved an impressive season, bringing pride to  her school and community.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to Anna Roessner of Fort Recovery High School. On behalf of the people  of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great  achievement.
