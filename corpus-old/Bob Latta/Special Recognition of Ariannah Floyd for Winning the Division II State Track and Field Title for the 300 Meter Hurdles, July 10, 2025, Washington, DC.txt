Special Recognition of Ariannah Floyd for Winning the Division II State Track and Field Title for the 300 Meter Hurdles


Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school athlete  from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. Ariannah Floyd, a senior at  Firelands High School, has represented her school ably on her way to  achieving the Division II State Title for the 300 Meter Hurdles at the  State Track and Field Meet. Ariannah overcame the challenges posed by  intense competition in her effort to win the title.

In pursuing the State Championship, Ariannah defeated her opponents  with an impressive time of 42.76 seconds. Her hard work and dedication,  both on and off the track, in achieving this accomplishment is truly  outstanding. She has achieved an impressive season, bringing pride to  her school and community.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to Ariannah Floyd of Firelands High School. On behalf of the people of  the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great  achievement.
