Special Recognition of Owen Scott for Winning the Division II State Track and Field Title for the 1600 Meter Run


Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school athlete  from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. Owen Scott, a senior at Van  Wert High School, has represented his school ably on his way to  achieving the Division II State Title for the 1600 Meter Run at the  State Track and Field Meet. Owen overcame the challenges posed by  intense competition in his effort to win the title.

In pursuing the State Championship, Owen defeated his opponents with  an impressive time of 4:10.19. His hard work and dedication, both on  and off the track, in achieving this accomplishment is truly  outstanding. He has achieved an impressive season, bringing pride to  his school and community.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to Owen Scott of Van Wert High School. On behalf of the people of the  Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great achievement.
