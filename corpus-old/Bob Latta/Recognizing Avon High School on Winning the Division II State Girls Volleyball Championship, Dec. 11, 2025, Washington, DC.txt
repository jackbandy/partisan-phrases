Recognizing Avon High School on Winning the Division II State Girls Volleyball Championship


Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school volleyball  team in Ohio's 5th Congressional District. The young women of the Avon  High School girls volleyball team have represented their school ably on  their way to achieving the Division II State Girls Volleyball Title. In  their effort to surpass all other teams in the Division II State  Volleyball Playoffs, the Avon Eagles overcame the challenges posed by  intense competition.

In pursuing the State Championship, the Avon Eagles defeated the  Anthony Wayne Generals to win the state volleyball championship. The  members of this very special team have shown that their sport requires  an individual effort for a team result. Their hard work and dedication,  both on and off the field, in achieving this accomplishment, is truly  outstanding.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to the Avon High School girls volleyball team. On behalf of the people  of the 5th District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great  achievement.
