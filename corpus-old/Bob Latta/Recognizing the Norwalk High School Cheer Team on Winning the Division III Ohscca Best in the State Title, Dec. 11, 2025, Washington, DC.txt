Recognizing the Norwalk High School Cheer Team on Winning the Division III Ohscca Best in the State Title


Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school cheer team  in Ohio's 5th Congressional District. The young student athletes of the  Norwalk High School cheer team have represented their school ably on  their way to achieving the Ohio High School Cheerleading and Dance  Coaches Association Division III Best in the State title.

In their effort to surpass all other teams in the division, Norwalk  overcame the challenges posed by intense competition. The members of  this very special team have shown that their sport requires an  individual effort for a team result. Their hard work and dedication,  both on and off the floor, in achieving this accomplishment, is truly  outstanding.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to the Norwalk cheer team. On behalf of the people of the 5th District  of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great achievement.
