Recognizing Avon High School on Winning the Division II State Boys Soccer Championship


Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise  to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school soccer team  in Ohio's 5th Congressional District. The young men of the Avon High  School boys soccer team have represented their school ably on their way  to achieving the Division II State Boys Soccer Title. In their effort  to surpass all other teams in the Division II State Soccer Playoffs,  the Avon Eagles overcame the challenges posed by intense competition.

In pursuing the State Championship, the Avon Eagles defeated the  Kings Mills Knights to win their first state soccer championship. The  members of this very special team have shown that their sport requires  an individual effort for a team result. Their hard work and dedication,  both on and off the field, in achieving this accomplishment, is truly  outstanding.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute  to the Avon High School boys soccer team. On behalf of the people of  the 5th District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great  achievement.
