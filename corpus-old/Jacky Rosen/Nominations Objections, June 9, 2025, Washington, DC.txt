Nominations Objections


Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, in response to the Trump administration's  reckless decision to rescind Nevada's approval to receive its share of  Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment Program funding, I hereby  announce that I intend to object to the nominations of Arielle Roth to  be Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information  (PN22-25), Paul Dabbar to be Deputy Secretary of Commerce (PN26-12),  Pierre Gentin to be General Counsel of the Department of Commerce  (PN22-6), and Harry Kumar to be an Assistant Secretary of Commerce  (PN26-26). I have submitted to the legislative clerk formal notices of  my intent to object to these nominees.
