Aca Tax Credits Set to Expire


Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, in just a few weeks, tax credits for the  Affordable Care Act are set to expire.

The President has had weeks and months to negotiate a deal that  addresses the healthcare crisis in this Nation. Instead, here in the  House of Representatives, the Speaker chose for us to be out of session  for 8 weeks, while people across this country and in my State of  Florida are getting letters in the mail saying that their healthcare  premiums will go up anywhere from 50 to 300 percent. Mr. Speaker,  189,000 of my own constituents have been getting these notices.

One of my constituents, battling stage IV breast cancer, said that  without these credits, she can't afford insurance or the lifesaving  medicine that she needs.

For her and millions more, this isn't about partisan politics. It is  literally about life or death.

Donald Trump's latest idea is to give money directly to the people to  pick their health insurance, but that is exactly how these ACA  subsidies worked.

Since he can only make concepts of a plan for our healthcare system,  I have a plan. Let's fix it, let's invest in it, and let's make our  government actually work for the people, not just the ultrawealthy. I  believe healthcare in this country should be a human right.
