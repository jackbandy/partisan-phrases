Protect Children's Innocence Act


Mr. FROST. Madam Speaker, Republicans' whole healthcare plan is to  restrict our ability to access healthcare. They are raising premiums,  kicking millions off of Medicaid, and now forcing children to go  without lifesaving care.

Under this bill, doctors and parents will spend 10 years in prison  for saving kids' lives. If trans kids need care, they should have the  freedom to get it, and their parents and doctors should not be jailed  for it.

It amazes me that Republican politicians can't think of any better  use for the power of the Federal Government than to bully transgender  kids in bathrooms and schools. Now they want to be inside of their  doctors' offices.

What amazes me even more is that they dare to call this bill the  Protect Children's Innocence Act. Do you know what actually robs a  child of their innocence? When they have to hide in a closet, in a  bathroom, or in a locker as someone shoots and murders their classmates  right in front of them.

If you want to protect the innocence of a child, why don't you ban  assault weapons instead of banning healthcare. After all, the leading  cause of death for a child in this country is bullets.
