Recognizing Jj Holmes and Alison Holmes


Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor this year's Orlando  Sentinel's Central Floridians of the Year, JJ Holmes and his mother,  Alison Holmes. Together, they are a force, not just in central Florida  but across the entire State and country.

JJ has a severe disability, but he hasn't allowed that to stop him  from speaking out and advocating tirelessly for our disability  community.

His mother, Alison, shows up every day to care for JJ and to stand up  for families across the country just like theirs.

Their advocacy and their continued work started 10 years ago when JJ  was just 12 years old and was removed from a Trump rally in 2016, after  protesting the President's mockery of a reporter with a disability.

For over a decade, they have continued to speak out at the local,  State, and Federal levels, advocating for expanding Medicaid, closing  coverage gaps, quality healthcare, and affordable healthcare for  everyone.

The way that they lead with love and courage should stand as a  testament to their strength and the amazing work they do. Central  Florida is stronger because of both of them.

I congratulate both JJ and Alison on this honor. I thank them for  never giving up on the fight to build a more inclusive world for  everybody, no matter who you are. I am so proud to be in this work with  them.
