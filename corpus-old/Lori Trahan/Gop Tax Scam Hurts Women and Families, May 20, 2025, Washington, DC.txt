Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, proponents of Donald Trump's so-called big,  beautiful bill are lying to the American people. They claim it won't  cut Medicaid, but it slashes $715 billion, gutting care for seniors and  children with disabilities.

They insist moms and kids won't lose food assistance, but this bill  will cut SNAP benefits for over 7 million Americans, stripping food  from families' tables.

They say new red tape will improve efficiency. Come on, we know  better. New GOP paperwork hurdles will cause millions of eligible  Americans to lose Medicaid and SNAP, not because they don't qualify,  but because they missed a form or got stuck in the system.

We have seen it before in Arkansas, Georgia, and New Hampshire.  Republicans tried this approach, and people suffered.

Why are they doing it? They are doing it to fund tax breaks for  billionaire donors--who won't have to fill out a single form, by the  way.

Are these your priorities, tax cuts for the rich paid for by taking  healthcare and food assistance away from everyone else? Prove us wrong.  Reject this bill, and stand up for working families.
