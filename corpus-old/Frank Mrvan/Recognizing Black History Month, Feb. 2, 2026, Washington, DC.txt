Recognizing Black History Month


Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Black History Month  and its 2016 theme, ``A Century of Black History Commemorations.'' I  would like to honor retired Army Sergeant 1st Class Oscar Primm, Jr., a  104-year-old veteran from northwest Indiana whose service is an  inspiration to us all.

In 1941, Oscar enlisted in the United States Army. Over the course of  his heroic military career, he served in World War I, the Korean war,  and the Vietnam war.

Today, Oscar is a proud member of the Greater Gary AMVETS Squadron  Post 6 where he can frequently be found supporting veterans throughout  northwest Indiana as they return home from service.

It is because of the sacrifices of veterans just like Oscar that we  are able to live in a free, democratic country.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating Black History Month and a  century of national Black history commemorations by recognizing the  selfless service, bravery, and patriotism of retired Army Sergeant 1st  Class Oscar Primm, Jr.
