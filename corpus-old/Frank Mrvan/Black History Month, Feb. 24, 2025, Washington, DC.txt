Black History Month


Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate Black History Month and  its 2025 theme, African Americans and Labor.

The economic foundation of northwest Indiana and our Nation is  reliant upon the advancement of a strong workforce, and I would like to  recognize two dedicated African-American leaders from Indiana's First  Congressional District who diligently work to support economic  opportunities for everyone.

First, Arvella Greenlaw is a member of the United Steelworkers local  6787 in Portage and serves as the Women of Steel District 7 Coordinator  where she consistently organizes community service projects and leads  volunteer efforts to support individuals throughout our region.

Secondly, Joree Richards is an IBEW representative and leads efforts  through the Indiana Plan, which is a pre-apprenticeship program which  provides students with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the  construction and building trades.

Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating Black History Month and  recognizing the invaluable contributions of Arvella Greenlaw, Joree  Richards, and countless others who selflessly fight for our labor  workforce, safe working conditions, living wages, and economic  opportunities for everyone.
