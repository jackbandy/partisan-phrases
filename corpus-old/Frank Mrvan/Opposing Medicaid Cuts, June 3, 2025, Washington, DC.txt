Opposing Medicaid Cuts


Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my profound  opposition to the callous cuts to Medicaid included in the House  majority's reconciliation legislation.

Throughout my career, I have worked to support all individuals when  they need emergency assistance or encounter a setback in the economy. I  have seen the tangible value of the Medicaid program in northwest  Indiana and how it predominantly assists seniors, individuals with  disabilities, and children.

It is deeply regrettable that this misguided legislation will not  only strip away these healthcare benefits, but it also increases  private healthcare costs and reduces services for everyone.

Take Jake, a high school student who uses a wheelchair. He relies on  a Medicaid waiver for school support and depends on our healthcare  system to move, thrive, and survive. Cutting his Medicaid isn't just  wrong, it is cruel.

This legislation amounts to the largest transfer of wealth from the  pockets of the most vulnerable and working families to the richest  among us.

I urge my Senate colleagues to reject this harmful legislation.
