Do No Harm


Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, my father was a physician. One of the main  things he was taught in medical school--and I think it is part of the  Hippocratic oath--is do no harm.

Our budgets are doing a great deal of harm to our healthcare system.

The Association of Medical Colleges came out with a statement  yesterday that our healthcare is in existential crisis because of the  cuts to research and the cuts to graduate medical education; that our  medical schools will suffer; and the number of doctors that are  produced will suffer. That is not even to mention the problems  immediately to people from taking away their Medicaid, taking away  their ACA, and taking away that healthcare.

Do no harm. This bill is a big, deadly bill. People will die because  of it because we are not putting money in the  NIH that does the research to protect us from the diseases that kill us  such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, heart disease, and diabetes.  The NIH is our Department of Defense. Francis Collins did a great job.  He left it in good hands. Let's keep ourselves safe. Do no harm.
