Recognizing the Importance of A New Libya


Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity late last month to  spend some time with a delegation of high-level officials from the  leadership of Libya.

Sent to Washington by the Libyan Prime Minister, the group presented  solid evidence that a new Libya is in the making.

The new Libya is focused on creating circumstances that will make  free and fair elections a reality. The new Libya is taking concrete  steps to lessen long-standing tribal animosities that have divided the  country. The new Libya is committed to a unified country without the  internationally recognized transitional government in Tripoli being  held hostage to a would-be regime in the east.

These profound changes and commitments were well-reflected in an  article from Newsweek published during the delegation's visit. I asked  unanimous consent that the article be included in the Record: Libya Has  a Deal for Trump That Could Reshape Africa and Europe: https:// www.newsweek.com/libya-deal-trump-could-reshape-africa-europe-11063123.
