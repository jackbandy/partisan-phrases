Count the Crimes to Cut Act


Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I got on this bill when it was first  introduced, I think, last spring. Representative Roy and I have served  on the Judiciary Committee for quite a while, and I respect his  intellect. I certainly hope that he gets to be Attorney General of  Texas. That would be great for him, and I think it would be great for  Texas, too.

I will miss him in working on this act, Article I bill. We agreed to  work on that just as a kind of a legislative check on Article I  executive actions. That is something we may be able to bring up again  next year, although I think it was more popular in certain places when  President Biden was the President, but it is still an important bill.

This is a commonsense bill. It is bipartisan, and I am happy to be a  cosponsor. I look forward to the gentlewoman from South Carolina, the  gentlewoman from Georgia, the gentlewoman from Colorado, the gentleman  from Illinois, and all the other people who have been highlights of our  last week of legislation to vote with us in unanimous passage.
