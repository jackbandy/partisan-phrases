Authoritarianism is A Threat to Democracy


Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, we have talked at long length about the  threat to democracy and the fear of an authoritarian leader in  Washington.

The time is now. The authoritarian leader in this administration has  surfaced. When the head of a communications company says that a  television personality's comments can cause a television station or  should cause a television station to cancel his show and  it happens, that is authoritarianism. It is also when the government  dictates what should and shouldn't be said on television and whether  they should be punished and using the power of the government to  suppress free speech.

The President then followed up and said that NBC should get rid of  two of its late-night shows. CBS has canceled their late-night show.

I don't know what Johnny Carson or Jack Paar would think about all of  this. I am sure Alec Baldwin wouldn't like it, and President Trump  didn't like the way he treated him. Chevy Chase falling over Gerald  Ford would probably put him in bad positions, too. Comedy is comedy.  Free speech is free speech, and we shouldn't step on it.

God bless the First Amendment.
