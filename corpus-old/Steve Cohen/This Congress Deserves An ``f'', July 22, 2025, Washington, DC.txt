This Congress Deserves An ``f''


Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, we are going to adjourn and not do the  people's business because we, thus far, have gotten an ``F'', an ``F''  for the work for the people of this Congress.

We have taken healthcare away from hundreds of thousands of people.  We have taken SNAP payments and nutritional sustenance away from tens  of hundreds of thousands of people. We have made injuries to the Earth,  God's Earth, which we are here to preserve and we only use.

We have taken away women's rights to go to Planned Parenthood to have  the healthcare that they need, important healthcare about their bodies.

We have taken away protections for clean energy, to change the rate  of growth of global warming that affects our planet and affects our  future with hotter and hotter summers and more and more problems: flash  floods, fires, and disasters.

This Congress has earned an ``F.'' We do not deserve any more.

I am ashamed to be a part of this Congress, but I will be because  people need to stand up, speak the truth, and stand up for things that  the American people have stood for for a long time like justice, due  process, fairness, caring about the little guy, and caring about giving  people something who have not enough but not something to people who  have too much: millionaires and billionaires.
