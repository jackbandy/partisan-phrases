United States Institute of Peace


Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the United States Institute of Peace was  created  by the Congress of the United States. It is in a beautiful building,  and it served the function of trying to bring people together.

In February, President Trump issued an executive order dismantling  the United States Institute of Peace. Subsequently, law enforcement  removed the president of the United States Institute of Peace forcibly  from his office, and then the Trump administration fired every employee  and dismantled the office.

A district court has ruled that he acted improperly because the  Congress created the United States Institute of Peace and the President  didn't have the authority to dismantle it.

Today, I have learned that President Trump has had his name in  massive letters put over the United States Institute of Peace calling  it the Donald J. Trump Peace Institute, none of which is legal.

Will his ego stop staining this city by putting his name and his  picture all over banners contemporaneous or similar to Teddy Roosevelt  at the Department of Labor and others?
