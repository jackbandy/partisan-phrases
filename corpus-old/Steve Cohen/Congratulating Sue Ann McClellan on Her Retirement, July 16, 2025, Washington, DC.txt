Congratulating Sue Ann McClellan on Her Retirement


Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Sue Ann  McClellan, the University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law  Assistant Dean for Admissions, who will be retiring on July 30 after 30  years.

Dean McClellan has guided students at my law school alma mater into  the legal profession by keeping a close eye on undergraduate prospects,  encouraging applicants, evaluating candidates and then watching them  mature through the bar exam and on to successful legal careers both  locally and across the country. She was instrumental in the creation of  the Summer Law Intern Program (known as SLIP), which encourages diverse  and talented high school students to work as interns in private law  practices, corporate law offices and government agencies, often  spurring an early interest in pursuing the profession. She was also  involved in the school's response to COVID-19, by addressing the  ongoing decline in enrollment, and in the School's 2010 move from the  main university campus to the former U.S. Customs House, Court House  and Post Office building on the Mississippi River Bluff downtown. She  is a 1976 graduate of Blackburn College in Carlinville, Illinois, with  a degree in Sociology. She received a Master's degree in Higher  Education Administration in 1985 from Southern Illinois University-- Carbondale, and a Doctor of Education degree in Higher Education  Administration in 1995 from the University of Memphis.

Through the years, Dean McClellan has been like a mother to students  and follows their careers with pride. In a statement released by the  University, Dean McClellan said: ``I've always felt that listening is  such a critical element of building a relationship. And relationships  are what all of this is built upon.''

I congratulate Dean McClellan for a stellar career advancing legal  education and helping produce the talented legal professionals for  which the university is known.
