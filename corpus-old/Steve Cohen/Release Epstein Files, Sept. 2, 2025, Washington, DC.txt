Release Epstein Files


Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, what Members of the Democratic Caucus are  doing to my right is signing a discharge petition to release the  Epstein files.

They need to be released because the American public wants to see  them. The fact that so many people in power don't want them released  says there is something there that smells.

What smells is the fact that children, girls, were raped and sexually  abused. The people who did it don't want it revealed to the American  public.

We need to be open and transparent. If there are perverts among the  leadership, they need to be exposed, because the American people do not  respect that and will not respect anybody that engaged in that kind of  conduct.

Mr. Speaker, I am going to sign the petition. I hope everybody signs  the petition, and we get an unredacted copy of the files.
