Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 3381, the  Encouraging Public Offerings Act.

This legislation builds on the success of the JOBS Act by making it  easier for companies of all sizes to go public while maintaining the  transparency and investor protections our markets depend on.

H.R. 3381 allows any company, not just emerging growth companies, to  test the waters by gauging investor interest before or after filing  with the SEC. It also ensures that an issuer can submit a confidential  draft registration statement before making it public, giving companies  more flexibility and clarity as they prepare to go public.

These tools, Mr. Speaker, testing the waters and confidential  filings, have proven valuable since the JOBS Act, especially for  smaller companies navigating the complexities of going public. My bill  makes them available to all issuers with consistent timelines tied to  when a registration statement becomes effective, not when a road show  begins.

This bill is about giving growing businesses the confidence to enter  the public markets and helping them reach new investors, expand  operations, and create jobs across our country.

I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and my Democratic  cosponsor, Mr. Meeks, for supporting these efforts to modernize our  capital markets.

Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

In closing, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act is about giving  growing businesses the confidence to enter the public markets and  helping them reach new investors, expand operations, and create jobs  across the country.

I ask my colleagues to support my bill, H.R. 3381, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
