Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act


Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3394) to amend the Securities Act of 1933 to codify certain  qualifications of individuals as accredited investors for purposes of  the securities laws, as amended.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3394

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Investment       Opportunities for Professional Experts Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF ACCREDITED INVESTOR.

(a) In General.--Section 2(a)(15) of the Securities Act of       1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(15)) is amended--

(1) by redesignating subparagraphs (i) and (ii) as       subparagraphs (A) and (F), respectively; and

(2) in subparagraph (A) (as so redesignated), by striking       ``; or'' and inserting a semicolon, and inserting after such       subparagraph the following:

``(B) with respect to a proposed sale of a security, any       natural person whose individual net worth, or joint net worth       with that person's spouse or spousal equivalent, at the time       of such sale, exceeds $1,000,000 (which amount, along with       the amounts set forth in subparagraph (C), shall be adjusted       for inflation by the Commission every 5 years to the nearest       $10,000 to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for       All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor       Statistics) where, for purposes of calculating net worth       under this subparagraph--

``(i) the person's primary residence shall not be included       as an asset;

``(ii) indebtedness that is secured by the person's primary       residence, up to the estimated fair market value of the       primary residence at the time of such sale, shall not be       included as a liability (except that if the amount of such       indebtedness outstanding at the time of such sale       exceeds the amount outstanding 60 days before such time,       other than as a result of the acquisition of the primary       residence, the amount of such excess shall be included as a       liability); and

``(iii) indebtedness that is secured by the person's       primary residence in excess of the estimated fair market       value of the primary residence at the time of such sale shall       be included as a liability;

``(C) any natural person who had an individual income in       excess of $200,000 in each of the 2 most recent years or       joint income with that person's spouse or spousal equivalent       in excess of $300,000 in each of those years and has a       reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in       the current year;

``(D) any natural person who is--

``(i) currently licensed or registered as a broker or       investment adviser by the Commission, a self-regulatory       organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934), or the securities division of a State,       the District of Columbia, or a territory of the United States       or the equivalent division responsible for licensing or       registration of individuals in connection with securities       activities; and

``(ii) in good standing with respect to such licence or       registration;

``(E) any natural person the Commission determines, by       regulation, to have demonstrable education or job experience       to qualify such person as having professional knowledge of a       subject related to a particular investment, and whose       education or job experience is verified by a self-regulatory       organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934); or''.

(b) Rulemaking.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission       shall revise the definition of accredited investor under       Regulation D (17 CFR 230.500 et seq.) to conform with the       amendments made by subsection (a).

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3394, the Fair  Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act.

I thank our Financial Services Committee chairman, the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), for his leadership on this bipartisan legislation.

For decades, the SEC's accredited investor definition has served as a  gatekeeper to private investment opportunities, relying almost entirely  on income and net worth thresholds.

This approach has excluded millions of Americans who may not meet  those financial metrics but have the education, licenses, or  professional experiences to make informed investment decisions.

H.R. 3394 modernizes that definition. It directs the SEC to expand  eligibility to individuals who hold certain professional  certifications, relevant degrees, or job experience, criteria that  actually reflect financial sophistication.

This change is long overdue. It will unlock capital for small  businesses, broaden investor participation, and better align our rules  with how Americans build expertise and manage risk in today's economy.

The bill maintains investor protections, while removing arbitrary  barriers that have held back individual investors and early-stage  entrepreneurs alike.

Mrs. WAGNER. In closing, Mr. Speaker, the Fair Investment  Opportunities for Professional Experts Act maintains investor  protections while removing arbitrary barriers that have held back  individual investors and early-stage entrepreneurs alike.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3394, and I yield  back the balance of my time.

Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The yeas and nays were ordered.
