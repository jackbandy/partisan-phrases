Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026


Mr. ROY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York. I am  proud to work with him and others of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle and to stand for a simple proposition that, 23 years after this  Chamber authorized force, at a time when most of the Members who did so  aren't even here, at a time when numerous facts have changed, after  Saddam Hussein was captured in 2003 and was executed in 2006, when  troops were withdrawn and the hostilities were over in 2011, and then  we went back in--regarding ISIS--and then out by 2021, that we should  not be operating under a 23-year-old authorization of the use of  military force. We can do better than that.

We are not touching 2001. We are touching 2002 and 1991. Come on. Mr.  Chair, we don't need to have Congress effectively, modern day,  declaring war and leaving it in place for one-quarter of a freakin'  century or, in this case, 34 years since 1991.

We can do better. If we want to actually authorize force, we should  deliberate, vote, and authorize force, but Article I has to mean  something. Please support this amendment to end an endless  authorization of force.
