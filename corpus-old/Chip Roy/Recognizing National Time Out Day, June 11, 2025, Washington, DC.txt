Recognizing National Time Out Day


Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, wrong-patient, wrong-site, and wrong-procedure  surgeries are rare, but can be life-altering for patients. Members of  the Association of PeriOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) are committed  to safe surgery. Since 2004, AORN and the Joint Commission have  recognized National Time Out Day to bring greater awareness to the safe  surgery practice of taking a ``time out'' before operative and other  invasive procedures to prevent wrong-site, wrong-patient, wrong- procedure surgery.

The National Time Out Day initiative supports the Joint Commission's  Universal Protocol and builds greater awareness among surgical and  procedural team members about the critical steps that keep patients  safe. This initiative's goal is to prevent errors by ensuring that all  members of the surgical team pause before invasive procedures, so they  can communicate as a group and confirm key information about the  patient and the procedure.

I commend perioperative and procedural teams in hospitals across  Texas' 21st Congressional District for their hard work and dedication  every day to ensure safe environments for procedural and surgical  patients. I also applaud their efforts to reduce unnecessary healthcare  costs.

Today, I recognize these efforts on behalf of my constituents,  celebrating June 11, 2025, as National Time Out Day in District 21 and  across Texas.
