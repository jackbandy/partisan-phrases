Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.

Mr. Speaker, my question to the Republican Party is, what are you  doing?  What are you doing? Why won't you use your immense powers as the  majority to help the American people?

The bill before us does nothing for the 15 million Americans who are  about to lose their health insurance, the 1 million children who are  about to become uninsured, the hundreds of hospitals that are closing  or on the verge of closing, or the 24 million people who are staring  down premiums they simply cannot afford.

It does nothing to solve a crisis that the Republicans have inflicted  on the American people, but, but, but, in typical fashion, here is what  it does do. It does promote the GOP dream of a nationwide abortion ban.

You found time for that, but today is the day to stop these tax  credits from expiring. You called us back in July from recess to make  sure that we voted on tax cuts, to make them permanent for the very  richest Americans, but now that we have a bipartisan discharge petition  ready to vote on today, you can't find the time to do it.

We are ready to vote, Mr. Speaker. You have the power to bring that  to the floor today.

Let the will of the people be the will of the people's House. Let's  stop the premium hikes, extend the ACA tax credits, and get back to  building a healthcare system that is worthy of the American people.
