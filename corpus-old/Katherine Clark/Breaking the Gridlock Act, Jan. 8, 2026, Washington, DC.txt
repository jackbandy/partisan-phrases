Breaking the Gridlock Act


Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  the Commonwealth for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, today, thanks to the persistence of the American people,  because millions of constituents have called their Members of Congress,  shown up at townhalls, shown up and marched in the streets, because of  parents who spoke out for their kids, for doctors who spoke out for  their patients, neighbors who mobilized together, today, Congress has a  chance to vote for Americans' healthcare.

Today, thanks to the strength and unity of our Democratic Caucus, the  House will vote to restore the ACA tax credits, and I will vote to  restore the affordable marketplace plans that working people depend on  to stay healthy, to live, to survive.

Today, I will vote to prioritize the lives of regular people over the  greed of billionaires and start bringing the Republican healthcare  crisis to an end.

This vote won't solve every problem the GOP has created. We still  have to reverse their cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We still have to  stop the closure of rural hospitals and deal with the maternity health  crisis and work together--yes, work together--to create a healthcare  system that is affordable and accessible to everyone.

Today, we can begin. Today, the people's House has a chance to stand  with and for the people. I hope we have a strong bipartisan majority  for this vote and that the Senate will immediately do the same.
