Epstein Files Transparency Act


Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, this should be an easy vote.  This is about justice for the victims and survivors of Jeffrey Epstein.  This is about every victim of trafficking and sexual abuse, monstrous  crimes that thrive in secrecy and fear.

Yet, instead of shining a light on that darkness, just moments ago,  Donald Trump defended the continued obstruction of releasing these  files. Even as House Republicans prepared to vote ``yes'' today,  Speaker Johnson is calling this a show vote. He is calling it  dangerous. He is signaling the U.S. Senate to block it.

Republicans continue to use their power to shield rich pedophiles  from justice. If you can't stand up for these survivors, how can anyone  trust you to stand up for them?
