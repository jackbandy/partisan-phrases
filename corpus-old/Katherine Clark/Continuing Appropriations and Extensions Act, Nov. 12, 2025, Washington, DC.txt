Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump said the cost- of-living crisis is fake news, ``a con job by the Democrats.''

Mr. Speaker, 60 percent of Americans can't afford a basic quality of  life, 45 percent have had to skip a doctor's appointment or a  prescription because they can't afford it, and 41 percent are living  with medical debt. The American people are simply not making it.

Not only is that crisis real, it is a crisis that Republicans  promised to solve. Voters believed them. Now, after a 54-day hiatus,  what are Republicans doing? They are voting to raise the cost of  living. They are voting to make it even harder to get by, not by some  marginal amount. They are doubling, tripling, and quadrupling monthly  premiums.

What is their defense? They are looking people in the eye and flat- out gaslighting them: Costs aren't up; costs are down.

Trump says: ``I don't want to hear about the affordability.'' Well,  get used to hearing about it. You are going to hear about it a lot  because people are feeling it every single day. People can't make rent.  They can't afford their prescriptions. They can't afford to take their  kid to a doctor. They can't find childcare. When they find it, they  can't afford that, either. Grocery and utility bills are spiking. This  is the crisis of our time, and it is about to get exponentially worse  because of the GOP's craven allegiance to billionaires over working  people.

The cost-of-living crisis is not fake news. It is not a perception  issue. It is daily life for the people that we all represent. Let's do  something about it. Let's reject this budget. Let's stop the healthcare  cuts. Let's stop the premium hikes. Let's stop the hospital closures,  and let's stop the billionaire giveaways.
