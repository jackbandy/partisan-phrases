One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member  for his leadership.

Mr. Speaker, as we are here in the early morning hours, and 60  percent of the families in this country cannot afford the basics. Mr.  Speaker, 60 percent of the Americans cannot afford that first rung of  the American Dream. This is an existential failure of the wealthiest  Nation on Earth.

With this big, ugly bill, Republicans are on the verge of moving that  dream further out of touch. They are making people sicker and poorer.  We hear the message. If Americans do not have great wealth, they do not  matter to the GOP.

If my Republican colleagues vote for this cruel monstrosity, they are  condemning families to poverty. They are condemning seniors and  veterans in this country to hunger. They are condemning children to  sickness without treatment. They are voting to enrich billionaires at  the expense of what makes us American, which is our freedom to build a  better life for our families.

Mr. Speaker, the American people overwhelmingly oppose this bill, and  they will not forget if my Republican colleagues sell out their freedom  this Independence Day.
