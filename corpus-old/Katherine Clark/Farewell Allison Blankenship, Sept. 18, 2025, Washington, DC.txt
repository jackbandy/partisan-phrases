Farewell Allison Blankenship


Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I rise to bid farewell to my  senior floor adviser and alumna of Teams Jayapal, McBath, and Pelosi,  the one and only, the incomparable, Allison Blankenship.

The last few years have been some of the most unpredictable in the  history of this Chamber, and throughout all of it, Allison has been a  constant and joyful guiding light.

From the longest speech in House history to the longest vote, Allison  has skillfully navigated the unprecedented.

She has powered through all-nighters with a smile, with pride, and  always with helpful information, because above all, she is driven by a  love of country, a love of justice, and a love of this institution and  its people.

We thank Allison for her hard work, and we wish her all the best on  her next chapter.

We will not forget Allison, and we hope she will not forget us.
