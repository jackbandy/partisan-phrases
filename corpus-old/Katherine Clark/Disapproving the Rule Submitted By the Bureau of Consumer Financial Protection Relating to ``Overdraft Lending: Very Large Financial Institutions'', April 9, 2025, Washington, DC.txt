Disapproving the Rule Submitted By the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Relating to ``Overdraft Lending: Very Large Financial Institutions''


Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, remember when the GOP  promised to lower the cost of living? It really wasn't that long ago.

Today, we have a tax on cars. We have a tax on coffee. We have a tax  on the eggs we import to fill the empty shelves. We have a tax of 125  percent on clothes, toys, and electronics.

What does this all add up to? It adds up to a tax of $4,600 a year on  American families. While Trump shrugs at all those rising costs, he  certainly wants us to know this. While all this was happening to  American families, he wanted us to know that he won his Senior Club  Championship golf tournament.

What are House Republicans doing?

Are they voting to cancel these taxes? No, they are carving them into  stone, prohibiting us from revealing them, no matter how painful they  get. Then they are pushing the costs even higher. Today, they are  voting to raise overdraft fees.

After crashing the economy, eliminating jobs, and destroying people's  retirement savings, they are making it more expensive to be short on  money by $225 a year per family. Also, the banks can pocket more, which  is their priority.

Later today, Republicans will be back on their tax plan, the one  where they take deserving taxpayer dollars and give them to the  billionaire class in the form of tax cuts for them.

By defunding Medicaid, the largest healthcare program in our country,  by defunding food programs that feed 15 million children, by  dismantling Social Security, firing veterans, closing and cutting  public schools, and abandoning special needs children, the rich will  get richer. That is who they work for.

Mr. Speaker, we will continue to work and vote for working people,  and we will vote ``no'' on this budget.
