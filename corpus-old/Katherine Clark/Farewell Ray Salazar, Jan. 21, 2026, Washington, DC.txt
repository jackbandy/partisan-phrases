Farewell Ray Salazar


Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bid farewell  to my floor director, the incomparable Ray Salazar.

If you have had the privilege of serving in this Chamber, you know  what a gem, what a patriot, and what an indispensable pillar of this  institution Ray is. You also know what a reliable friend and adviser he  is, and you know what a loss his departure will be for the House of  Representatives.

From his time with Leader Hoyer to his years on my team, every time  he stepped onto this floor he has strengthened our institution, always  leading with values and integrity, bringing a steady hand to his work  along with his encyclopedic knowledge of parliamentary procedure.

I thank Ray for his 13 years of extraordinary service. He is the  model of what it means to be a public servant, waking up every day to  work for the American people. We wish him all the best in his next  chapter.
