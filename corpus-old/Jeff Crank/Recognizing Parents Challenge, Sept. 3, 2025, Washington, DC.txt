Recognizing Parents Challenge


Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the  25th anniversary of the extraordinary impact that Parents Challenge has  made in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Parents Challenge empowers low-income families to access the best  schools for their children by providing critical financial support for  tuition, tutoring, transportation, technology, and school supplies.  School choice opportunities span the full spectrum of educational  options, including traditional public schools, private schools, charter  schools, and home schools.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating and  thanking Parents Challenge for its steadfast commitment to empowering  parents with school choice.

Over the past 25 years, Parents Challenge has enriched the lives of  more than 4,000 low-income students and their families.
