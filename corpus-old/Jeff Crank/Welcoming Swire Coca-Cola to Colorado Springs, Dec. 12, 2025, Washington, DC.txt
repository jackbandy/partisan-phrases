Welcoming Swire Coca-Cola to Colorado Springs


Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome the Swire Coca-Cola  manufacturing plant to Colorado Springs. This week, the company  announced a 620,000-square-foot facility at Peak Innovation Park near  the Colorado Springs airport. This is an investment of $475 million and  will create at least 170 jobs. It will modernize production for more  than 230 beverage options across 60 well-known Coca-Cola brands.

I also congratulate the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce for  bringing this economic boost to the Pikes Peak region. This news shows  once again that Colorado Springs is becoming an economic titan of the  West and a destination for global brands.

Mr. Speaker, I am personally very excited for easier access to my  favorite drink, Diet Coke, right in my hometown.
