Boulder Terrorist Attack


Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the unspeakable  tragedy that happened in Boulder, Colorado, in my home State of  Colorado.

The person who perpetrated that crime obtained a visa in August of  2022. Their visa expired in February of 2023, and my home State of  Colorado issued them a driver's license in July of 2024.

Mr. Speaker, Colorado lawmakers and our Governor gave him a sanctuary  pass. This tragedy could have been avoided. He also was blocked from  buying a gun in 2024, and the Biden FBI and the Polis Colorado Bureau  of Investigation were on notice and didn't do anything.

Let's pray for the victims and for our Jewish community.
