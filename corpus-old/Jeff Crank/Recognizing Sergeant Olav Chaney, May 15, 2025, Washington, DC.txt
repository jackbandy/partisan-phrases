Recognizing Sergeant Olav Chaney


Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sergeant Olav  Chaney, of the Colorado Springs Police Department, for his 35 years of  service to our community.

I had the pleasure of taking Sergeant Chaney and his family last  night on a Capitol tour, and a delightful family he has.

Sergeant Chaney has also served us in the United States Army. He has  become a recognized leader within the police department, and Sergeant  Chaney helps lead the Downtown Area Response Team and the Homeless  Outreach Team, where he serves our vulnerable population with  compassion and with grace.

Sergeant Chaney has also served as Santa Claus for the Toys for Tots  program. He is part of the honor guard, and he is an active participant  in the Cadet Explorers program.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in Congress to join me in thanking  Sergeant Olav Chaney for his dedication and his service to the Pikes  Peak region, to Colorado, and to America.
