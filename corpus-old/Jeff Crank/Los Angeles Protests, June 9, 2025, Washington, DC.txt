Los Angeles Protests


Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have a choice to make.

They thought it was cute to defund the police. That didn't work out  for  cities like Portland, Seattle, and St. Louis.

Then they thought it was cute to ignore our border. They allowed  millions to storm America. Many were sex traffickers, drug runners,  child predators, murderers, and thugs. Now thugs are rioting and  burning Los Angeles, all because ICE is arresting and deporting  killers, rapists, and drug dealers.

They are attacking local police, Federal agents, and the rule of law.

I think they would have learned, but they have doubled down. They are  supporting mayhem, burning American flags, and foreign nationals are  waving flags from other countries.

They can't support the police while supporting those who attack them.
