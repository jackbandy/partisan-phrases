Congratulating Willie Adams on His Retirement


Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Willie Adams,  former president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union,  who recently retired. For more than 40 years, Willie focused on  supporting working families, workers' rights, and civil rights.

Born in Kansas City, he first came to Tacoma, Washington, as a  longshore worker at the port in 1978, and worked his way up, including  to secretary-treasurer of the executive board. In 2018, he broke  barriers as the first Black international president of the ILWU.

He fought for increased wages and benefits for his longshore brothers  and sisters and navigated the safety and supply challenges of the  COVID-19 pandemic.

As the former mayor of Tacoma and now a Member of Congress, I have  witnessed Willie's leadership firsthand for working people everywhere.

In Tacoma, he highlighted notable Black figures and entrepreneurs  with celebrations of Black history, which led to his being the  recipient of the City of Tacoma Destiny Award.

I thank Willie for his contributions to the international labor  movement, and I congratulate him on his well-earned retirement.
