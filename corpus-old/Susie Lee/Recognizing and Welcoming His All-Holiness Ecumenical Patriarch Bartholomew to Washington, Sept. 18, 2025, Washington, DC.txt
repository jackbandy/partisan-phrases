Recognizing and Welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, D.C.


Ms. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome His All- Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, D.C. He will  be in our Nation's Capital this week after visiting New York City,  where he will receive the distinguished Templeton Prize. The Templeton  Prize was previously received by Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, and  Archbishop Desmond Tutu, among others.

Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is a world-leading advocate for  interfaith dialogue and peace. As Ecumenical Patriarch of  Constantinople for nearly 35 years, the Patriarch has taken on the most  difficult issues facing the world, whether it's building bridges  between East and West, protecting our environment, or fostering  dialogue between religious faiths.

Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is also an international  environmental leader and has earned the title ``Green Patriarch.'' He  consistently used his role to bring people of different faiths together  to discuss how they could be good stewards of the Earth, and he made  caring for the environment a central commitment in his role as  spiritual leader. In 1997, the Patriarch even received the  Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor awarded by this body.

On behalf of the vibrant Greek Orthodox community in Southern Nevada,  I extend my deepest respects to His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming  him to our Nation's Capital.
