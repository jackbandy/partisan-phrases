Recognizing Dr. Lynn Kowalski and Dr. Stephanie Wishnev for Completing the Transamerica Route


Ms. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two  extraordinary women, Dr. Lynn Kowalski and Dr. Stephanie Wishnev, for  completing one of the TransAmerica routes. It is one of the most  challenging cycling endeavors in the world, spanning from Astoria,  Oregon to Yorktown, Virginia.

As an avid cyclist myself, I know the grit and determination it takes  to complete even a single long-distance ride. What these two women  accomplished is nothing short of remarkable. Over the course of five  years, they rode coast-to-coast, fully self-supported, conquering steep  mountain climbs, unpredictable weather, and thousands of miles of open  road.

Their journey not only tested their endurance but also embodied the  very spirit of perseverance and adventure that defines our Nation. I  commend Dr. Kowalski and Dr. Wishnev for their incredible achievement  and for inspiring all of us who strive to push past limits and see what  lies on the other side.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing their  achievement.
