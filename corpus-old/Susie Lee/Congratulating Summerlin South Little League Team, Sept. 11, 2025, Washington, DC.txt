Congratulating Summerlin South Little League Team


Ms. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2025  U.S. Little League champions: the Summerlin South Little League.

After undefeated runs at the District Four, Nevada, and Mountain West  tournaments, Summerlin South punched their ticket to the Little League  World Series, making them the third consecutive Nevada team to qualify.

In Williamsport, they went on an incredible 5-2 run against the best  teams from across the country and around the world, including a win  over Fairfield to claim the U.S. Championship.

Led by their coaches, a trio of volunteer dads, Tony D'Ambrosio, TJ  Fechser, and Americo Miranda, this team showed the world how Nevada  plays ball.

I was so proud to join the community in downtown Summerlin to give  these all-stars the homecoming they deserve.

Mr. Speaker, Summerlin South made Nevada proud on the world stage,  and I can't wait to see what is next for these incredible athletes.
