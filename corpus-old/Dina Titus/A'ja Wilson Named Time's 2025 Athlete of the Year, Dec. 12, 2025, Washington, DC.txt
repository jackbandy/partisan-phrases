A'ja Wilson Named Time's 2025 Athlete of the Year


Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, just check out this picture. This fabulous  woman is A'ja Wilson, who was named Time's 2025 Athlete of the Year.

A'ja became the first player in either the WNBA or the NBA to win a  championship, claim the scoring title, and be named Finals MVP, league  MVP, and Defensive Player of the Year all in one season.

A'ja's impact was pivotal as the Las Vegas Aces won a record 16  straight games at the end of the regular season and then swept the  finals to capture their third championship in 4 years.

Beyond those statistics, A'ja continues to elevate the sport. She  inspires young girls, and she uses her platform to advance equity and  empowerment across women's basketball.

We all want to be like A'ja: beautiful, smart, talented, and kind. I  congratulate A'ja. We are so, so proud of her in Las Vegas District  One.
