Do Not Sell Off Public Lands


Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to send a message to Senator Lee  and his allies: We are not going to let you use our treasured public  lands as revenue raisers to pay for tax cuts for billionaires.

We made it clear here in the House that selling off our public lands  faced bipartisan opposition. With the House version of the bill, I was  pleased and proud to lead the effort to strike that provision to sell  off public lands in my congressional district in southern Nevada  without our consent.

Now, Senator Lee is trying to introduce a similar provision in the  Senate version of the bill. Nevadans see this for what it is, and there  is public outrage from outdoor enthusiasts and conservationists.

I am pleased that the Senate Parliamentarian, with the Byrd rule, has  correctly ruled that this reckless provision has no business in a  reconciliation bill. These are our public lands. Look at this map, and  you can see what is at stake. It is not in the bill right now, but the  fight is far from over, and so we will continue to do that. This is the  reason why, for future generations.
