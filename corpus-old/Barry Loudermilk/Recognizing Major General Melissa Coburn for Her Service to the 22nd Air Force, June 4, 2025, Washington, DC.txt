Recognizing Major General Melissa Coburn for Her Service to the 22nd Air Force


Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Major General  Melissa Coburn for her service to the 22nd Air Force at Dobbins Air  Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia.

Major General Coburn commissioned through the United States Air Force  Academy in 1992 and served eleven years on active duty, before  transitioning to the Air Force Reserve in February 2003. During her  service, Major General Coburn has more than 6,000 flight hours in the  T-37, T-38, C-141B, C-123, KC-135, C-17A, C-40, C-130H/J, including 279  combat hours in support of operations in Hungary, Iraq, and  Afghanistan.

Major General Coburn has been a close partner in improving our  Nation's tactical air mobility operations capability through  recapitalization of the Air Force Reserve's C-130 inventory. She has  heavily invested in servicemember quality of life improvements  throughout her command, especially at Dobbins Air Reserve Base. With  more than 12,000 Reserve Airmen and 59 unit-equipped aircraft, her  leadership of the 22nd Air Force has directly contributed to our  Nation's security through aerial spray, fire suppression, weather  reconnaissance, tactical airlift and airdrop and aeromedical  evacuation.

As Major General Coburn continues her service to the United States  upon her departure from Dobbins Air Reserve Base and the 22nd Air  Force, it has been a pleasure working closely with her to benefit our  servicemembers. I congratulate Major General Coburn on her Change of  Command and look forward to working with her again soon in the years to  come.
