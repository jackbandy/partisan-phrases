Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Chair, our Armed Forces face an ever-evolving  landscape of warfare demanding servicemembers who are capable of high  performance under extreme operational stress, yet we face a readiness  crisis. Suicide rates remain high. One in four servicemembers suffer  from PTSD, and over 40 percent meet the criteria for alcohol use  disorder.

Meanwhile, access to mental health support remains limited,  especially in key military regions. Recognizing the need to address  this reality is a step in the right direction, but we can and must do  more to equip our military personnel to continue being the finest  fighting force in the history of the world.

My amendment will provide for wearable technology research that  addresses these very issues by monitoring and improving stress response  and cognitive performance in real time. This real-time resilience  optimization for military readiness tool could track fatigue, deliver  tailored solutions for the wearer, and integrate with military health  systems all while keeping data secure.

Adopting this amendment provides a targeted solution to the  challenges we face and ensures that American warfighters remain the  most prepared, most adaptable, and most resilient force on Earth.

Mr. Chair, I urge Members to support this amendment.
