Recognizing the 160th Anniversary of the First Congregational Church of Stockton


Mr. HARDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 160th  anniversary of the First Congregational Church of Stockton--a steadfast  pillar of faith, fellowship, and service in the heart of the Central  Valley.

For over a century and a half, the First Congregational Church has  nurtured generations of Stockton families, offering not only a place of  worship, but a community rooted in compassion, justice, and shared  purpose. From its earliest beginnings in the aftermath of the Civil War  to its continued presence today, the church has grown alongside  Stockton, adapting and expanding to meet the spiritual and civic needs  of its neighbors.

What began as a small gathering of individuals committed to living  out their faith in community has become one of the city's enduring  institutions. Over the years, the church has called several sanctuaries  home--each one a reflection of its growing and evolving congregation.  Through every chapter, the church has remained unwavering in its  mission to provide spiritual guidance, inspire moral courage, and serve  those in need.

Beyond the pulpit, the First Congregational Church has played a vital  role in the cultural and social life of Stockton. Its members have long  championed education, civic engagement, and social justice--offering  programs and outreach efforts that extend far beyond its walls. Whether  through fellowship events, support groups, or charitable initiatives,  the church continues to be a source of hope and healing for the broader  community.

In marking 160 years of ministry and service, we celebrate not just a  building or a date, but a living legacy of faith in action. The First  Congregational Church of Stockton remains a guiding light, grounded in  its values and open to all.

I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this milestone and in  expressing our deepest gratitude to the First Congregational Church of  Stockton for its profound and enduring contributions to our region.
