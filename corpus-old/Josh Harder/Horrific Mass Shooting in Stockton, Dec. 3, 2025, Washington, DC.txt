Horrific Mass Shooting in Stockton


Mr. HARDER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this  weekend my community in Stockton, California, was shaken by a horrific  mass shooting.

Families were gathered at a banquet hall for a 2-year-old's birthday  party. They were about to cut the cake when gunshots rang out. Four  people were killed, including three kids. They were 8, 9, and 14 years  old. Thirteen more were injured. Think about that for a second.

As a dad, I cannot fathom the pain these families are feeling right  now. This was supposed to be a moment of celebration, and instead it  became a nightmare that has rocked our community to its core.

Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence to honor the victims,  including Amari, Susano, Maya, Journey, and their families as they  navigate this tragedy.

My wife, Pam, and I are praying for the victims, their families, and  our community. We are and always will be Stockton Strong.
