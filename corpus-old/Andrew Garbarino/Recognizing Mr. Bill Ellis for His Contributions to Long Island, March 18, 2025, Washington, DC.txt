Recognizing Mr. Bill Ellis for His Contributions to Long Island


Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. William  ``Bill'' Ellis for his years of dedicated service to his community. In  his long career in public service, Mr. Ellis has made immense  contributions to keeping Suffolk County safe and prosperous.

Soon after moving to Long Island from Brooklyn as a child, Mr. Ellis  followed the example of service set by his father, who saw combat in  the South Pacific while serving in the Navy during World War II. Mr.  Ellis was first elected to be a State Committeeman at 21 years old and  worked alongside elected officials and stakeholders to reach a fair  contract for Correctional Officers. Mr. Ellis's years of hard work have  made Smithtown a great place to live, work, and raise a family.  Alongside Patricia, his wife of 51 years and a State Committeewoman,  Mr. Ellis has shown an unwavering commitment to doing what is best for  his community

During his 25 years serving as Chairman of the Smithtown Republican  Committee, Mr. Ellis has utilized his vast institutional knowledge and  experience to lead the party to unprecedented levels of success.  Smithtown residents have benefited from the town's tremendous growth  and improvement thanks to Mr. Ellis's stewardship and advocacy. Some of  the projects his leadership has made possible include investment in  community and educational facilities, transportation infrastructure,  and initiatives to protect the environment and access to clean drinking  water, all while ensuring accountability and preventing waste of  taxpayer funds.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the  lifetime of work that Mr. Ellis has accomplished and wish him many more  years of continued success.
