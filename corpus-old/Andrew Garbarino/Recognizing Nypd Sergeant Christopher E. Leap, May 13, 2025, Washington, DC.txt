Recognizing Nypd Sergeant Christopher E. Leap


Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent,  NYPD Sergeant Christopher E. Leap of Babylon, New York on the occasion  of his recognition with an Honorable Mention in the 2025 TOP COPS  Awards from the National Association of Police Organizations. Sergeant  Leap has been an exemplary member of the NYPD and has been recognized  by the department for his meritorious and excellent service to the City  of New York 12 times since he joined the department in June 2013.

Sergeant Leap was nominated for this award by his fellow officers for  his heroic actions above and beyond the call of duty in an incident  that occurred on August 1, 2024, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.  On that night, Sergeant Leap, along with Sergeant Carl Johnson,  responded to reports of an armed robbery and apprehended a suspect  after pursuing him on foot through busy traffic. During the struggle to  detain the suspect, the assailant fired a shot, wounding both  sergeants. Additional officers arrived on the scene, and working  together, they were able to subdue the suspect and secure the area.  Thanks to the swift and coordinated response of Sergeant Leap and his  fellow officers, this violent criminal was taken into custody.

Mr Speaker, it is my great honor to recognize Sergeant Leap and to  commend him for his heroism and this well-deserved award. I wish him  many safe and distinguished years on the police force to come and  convey my deepest gratitude for his outstanding service to the people  of New York.
