Thanking Police Officers for All They Do


Mrs. BICE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Police  Week, which serves as a reminder to remember and memorialize law  enforcement officers who have fallen in the line of duty.

During this week, I am reminded of a quote from Matthew chapter 5,  verse 9: ``Blessed are the peacekeepers, for they shall be called the  children of God.''

Our law enforcement officers put themselves in harm's way every day  in the pursuit of justice and protection of the innocent. They are the  thin blue line that represents courage when faced with unbelievable  chaos and uncertainty.

One of the greatest strengths of law enforcement is their ability to  bridge gaps, forge connections, and build trust within our communities.  For our officers, stopping criminals, saving innocent lives, and  helping our communities is more than a job. It is a way of life.

I thank them for everything they do to protect and safeguard our  communities.
