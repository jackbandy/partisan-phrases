Congratulating the Oklahoma City Thunder


Mrs. BICE. Mr. Speaker, a month ago, I spoke on the House floor to  congratulate the Oklahoma City Thunder on winning the Western  Conference finals. Now, I am thrilled to be able to recognize the  Thunder on their first NBA Finals championship.

This team is truly historic. Their season win total is now tied for  the third highest ever. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander hit a rare superfecta:  Regular season MVP, Finals MVP, NBA champion and scoring champion.

This season is the culmination of the vision of Clay Bennett and the  entire ownership team, the team's General Manager Sam Presti, and of  course Coach Daigneault.

I know that I speak for the entire State when I say thank you to SGA,  Alex Caruso, Chet, Jalen, and the entire Thunder team. They truly have  inspired us all, and we are all proud of them.

Although I can't be there tomorrow, it is time to celebrate. Mr.  Speaker, Thunder Up.
