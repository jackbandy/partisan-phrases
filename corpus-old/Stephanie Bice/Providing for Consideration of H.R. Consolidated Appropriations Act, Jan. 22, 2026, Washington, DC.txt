Providing for Consideration of H.R. Consolidated Appropriations Act, and Providing for Consideration of H.R. Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, and for Other Purposes


Mrs. BICE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule to  consider the final four fiscal year 2026 appropriations bills.

These appropriations bills, like the previous eight that came before  it, are fiscally responsible and represent a return to regular order.  The deliberate and Member-driven approach of this process is a  testament to the leadership of my friend and fellow Oklahoman, Chairman

Tom Cole.

This package will strengthen American military superiority and fund  the E-7 Wedgetail program at Tinker Air Force Base. It also ends open- border policies of the Biden era, champions measures to make America  healthier, and allows the Nation to build stronger, travel safer, and  support future growth.

Through late nights and long markups, the Appropriations Committee  has done its job, reduced spending, delivered wins for our  constituents, and codified the priorities of the Trump administration.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work that the Appropriations Committee  has done, and I encourage my colleagues to support the rule.
