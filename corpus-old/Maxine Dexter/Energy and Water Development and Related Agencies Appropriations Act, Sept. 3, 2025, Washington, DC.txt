Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for her time.

Mr. Chair, data centers are sucking up our most precious resource:  water.

Larger data centers can each drink up to 5 million gallons per day or  about 1.8 billion gallons annually, usage equivalent to a town of  10,000 to 50,000 people.

At a time when the climate crisis is driving water scarcity even in  places not used to shortages, we cannot afford to ignore this grave  threat. As the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Subcommittee  on Oversight and Investigations, I am not ignoring this threat.

Today, I am grateful for the inclusion of my amendment in the en bloc  that gives the Federal Government the tools it needs to understand and  address how new technological demands are straining our communities'  water. It is a simple, commonsense step, and in the face of an  otherwise catastrophic bill that slashes clean energy incentives and  raises prices, I am grateful to find consensus around safeguarding  water for our communities.

This amendment is one small step in the right direction. I will not  stop fighting to protect water, to protect our children's future, and  to protect our planet.

Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of this amendment en bloc.
