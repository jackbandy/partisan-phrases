Horrific Ice Abuses


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with urgency and outrage.

The Trump regime, with its lawless and cruel immigration agents, has  become a source of nightmares for children.

People are living in hiding, fearful, as these agents are kidnapping,  assaulting, and murdering people.

Last month it was Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti.

Next month? It could be another beloved, hard-working member of your  community.

Agents are detaining sick children.

Last month it was Diana Crespo, a seven-year-old from my district and  her parents who were detained on the way to urgent care.

Next month? It could be another sick second grader in your community.

Children are being traumatized, communities are being torn apart, and  people are being murdered.

Republicans need to wake up from the delusion that what Trump is  carrying out in your name is lawful, needed, or making us safer.

When your children and grandchildren ask what you did when secret  police came for families, when children were imprisoned, when U.S.  citizens were murdered by federal agents without accountability, what  will you say?

You have the power to help stop this.

It is past time to do so.
