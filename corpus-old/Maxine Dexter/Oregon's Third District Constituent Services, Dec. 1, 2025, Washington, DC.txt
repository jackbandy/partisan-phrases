Oregon's Third District Constituent Services


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share how my office has been  hard at work for the people of Oregon's Third Congressional District.

Since coming to Congress, our office has helped constituents recover  more than one-half million dollars owed to them by the Federal  Government through our casework services.

That is one-half million dollars returned to veterans waiting on  care, to families caught in bureaucratic limbo, and to seniors who  depend on their Social Security checks to live with dignity.

If my constituents need help navigating a Federal agency, my team is  here for them. Visit dexter.house.gov or call 503-231-2300.

I certainly cannot reverse every agency decision, but I can ask  questions, and I can press for answers and work to move stalled cases  forward.

We do that every day for veterans seeking care, for seniors needing  benefits, for families waiting on tax refunds, and for neighbors who  simply need someone in their corner.

That is what representation looks like.
