Youth Advisory Council


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I recently held the first meeting of my  Youth Advisory Council, a group of two dozen high school students from  my district who will help guide my work here in Congress.

These students spoke boldly about their fears and hopes for the  future, and they made one thing clear: They are done waiting for  change.

I don't blame them. Our country's policy failures have grounded our  kids in uncertainty. Many feel like the American Dream is out of reach.

That is personal for me. My trajectory has been an American Dream:  the first in my family to graduate from college, then become a  physician, a U.S. Congresswoman, and give my children privilege and  opportunity that I never knew.

I didn't do it alone. Strong public schools, a union job, affordable  higher education, and affordable rent were all critical. Today's young  people deserve the same opportunities that I had. That is why I created  the Youth Advisory Council. That is why I will continue to go to them  to help us shape our policies of the future.

What I say to them and all youth in my district: Demand a seat today.  We need to support their ideas and their dreams.
