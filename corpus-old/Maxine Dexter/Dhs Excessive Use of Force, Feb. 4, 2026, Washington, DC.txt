Dhs Excessive Use of Force


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise as Federal agents once again  descend upon Portland, not to protect, but to terrorize.

Over the weekend, during a peaceful labor-led protest, DHS agents  deployed tear gas on civilians, including children in the crowd. DHS,  let me say that again, tear-gassed children. The clouds were so dense,  they sickened families and left a stench that lingered for miles.

This wasn't crowd control. It is state-sponsored violence.

The courts agree. Yesterday, a Federal judge ordered a temporary  restraining order against Federal agents tear-gassing peaceful  protesters.

This isn't the first time Federal agents have used excessive force.  In Portland just last October, after protesters were already  restrained, Federal agents pepper-sprayed them pointblank. This is not  law enforcement. This is Donald Trump's goon squad deployed to punish  dissent and sow chaos in our communities.

Let me be clear. Portland will not be bullied into compliance nor  into betraying our values.

Mr. Speaker, I echo Mayor Keith Wilson's call: If you are still  working for ICE, resign. It is no honor to participate in this kind of  hostility.
