Recognizing Constituents of Oregon's Third District


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, this week, my office received our 100,000th  message from the people of Oregon's Third District.

This is incredible. On an average day, I receive more than 650  messages, and that is just since being sworn in. We have got a lot to  go.

Here is what I am hearing:

People in Portland are fearful. They fear for their children and  their neighbors.

People in Rhododendron want to see courageous leadership that  understands the needs of working families.

People in Gresham are working hard and are barely making ends meet.  They want to know their families will be able to thrive.

People throughout Oregon's Third District want immigrant neighbors to  feel safe, housing to be affordable, the climate to be protected,  schools to be funded, and to have universal healthcare that they can  access.

These messages aren't just correspondence. They are marching orders.

I thank every Oregonian who has written. Keep the emails coming.
