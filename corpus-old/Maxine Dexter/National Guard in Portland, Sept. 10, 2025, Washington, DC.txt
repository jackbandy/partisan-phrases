National Guard in Portland


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not just as a Member of  Congress but as a proud Oregonian.

Donald Trump is once again threatening to deploy troops against  American civilians. We have already seen him abuse Federal power in  cities like D.C. and L.A., and now he is targeting Portland.

Let me be clear: Donald Trump is punishing cities like Portland  simply for standing against his authoritative power. This isn't about  safety. It is political retribution, plain and simple. Portland doesn't  need his help. We are resilient, creative, and strong.

To my fellow Oregonians: I am standing with Governor Kotek, Attorney  General Dan Rayfield, our delegation, and local leaders to defend our  communities and our rights. I will use every tool available-- legislation, litigation, and public pressure--to stop this dangerous  overreach.

We will not be bullied. We will not be silenced, and we will not back  down. In Oregon, we fly with our own wings. We rise, we resist, and we  stand together, undaunted and unafraid.
