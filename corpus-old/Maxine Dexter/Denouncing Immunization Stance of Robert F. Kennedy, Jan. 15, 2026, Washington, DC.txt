Denouncing Immunization Stance of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, last week RFK, Jr., upended the childhood  immunization schedule, reducing the number of universally recommended  vaccines without substantive input from relevant medical experts. One  of the vaccines RFK, Jr., downgraded was the flu vaccine.

The science is clear. This decision will hurt our children, our  elderly, and our families. Science doesn't care about our feelings.  Science doesn't care about our politics. Science is built on data,  evidence, and facts.

RFK, Jr., seems to think if he ignores the science, it will simply go  away. It won't. His decision will mean fewer kids get vaccinated  against preventable diseases. More children will get sick, and more  children will have morbidity and mortality as a result.

It is shameful. RFK, Jr., is absolutely unfit and should resign.  Let's give our kids the healthy future they deserve.
