Clean Air and Healthy Parks Go Hand in Hand


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as someone who cherishes both  the breathtaking beauty of our national parks and the fundamental right  to clean air.

When one asks what sets the United States apart, our national parks  top the list, yet, increasingly, so does our  dirty and polluted air. That should alarm us all.

The Washington Post recently reported on what too many of us already  know: Air pollution and climate change are choking even the most  treasured corners of our country.

Wildfire smoke now blankets our parks each summer. Haze clouds once- clear views. The places we go to breathe deep and reconnect with nature  are being smothered by our inaction.

At Look Rock in the Great Smoky Mountains, I saw how long-term air  quality monitoring helps us track these threats, but data alone isn't  enough. We must have the courage to act.

As a physician and mother, I know what is at stake. Every child  deserves to explore our parks without wheezing from smoke or smog.

Clean air and healthy parks go hand in hand, and they are worth  fighting for.
