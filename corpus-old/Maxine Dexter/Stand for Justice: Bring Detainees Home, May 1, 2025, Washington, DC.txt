Stand for Justice: Bring Detainees Home


Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, the emergency isn't coming. It is here.

Donald Trump is abducting American children. He is detaining judges.  He is disappearing people into foreign prisons. This is  authoritarianism in full view.

I didn't come to Congress to sit back while democracy is dismantled.  To the contrary, I will use every tool at my disposal to protect our  democracy.

When the people of Gresham, Hood River, and Portland demanded action,  I went to El Salvador because we have to stand up for due process. As a  critical care physician, I am trained to act. I am trained to do  everything in my power to address the crisis in front of me.

When we sat down with the U.S. Embassy, one thing was chillingly  clear: Donald Trump has done nothing, not one thing, to bring Kilmar  Abrego Garcia or any of the detainees home. Their families haven't  heard a word--no calls, no updates, and no proof of life, just silence.

Here is what gives me hope: Yesterday, Mohsen Mahdawi, a detained  Columbia student, was released on bail. He said something we all need  to hold close: We must ``believe in the inevitability of justice.''

I will stand for justice. I encourage my colleagues to stand for  justice, and I look forward to the fight ahead.
