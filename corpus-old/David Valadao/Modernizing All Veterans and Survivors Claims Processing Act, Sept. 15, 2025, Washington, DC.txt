Modernizing All Veterans and Survivors Claims Processing Act


Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge support for my bill, the  Modernizing All Veterans and Survivors Claims Processing Act.

Our veterans put their lives on the line to defend this country. When  they come home, they shouldn't have to fight another battle just to get  the benefits that they deserve.

Unfortunately, outdated systems at the VA are causing unnecessary  delays that create real hardships for both veterans and their families.

To speed up disability claims, the VA has used automation tools, like  AI, to draft letters and gather documents. That same technology has not  been applied to other types of claims, such as pensions or survivor  benefits. This has led to a growing backlog and, in some cases, missed  benefits altogether.

My bill takes steps to fix this. It requires the VA to expand the use  of automation tools, ensure that documents are properly labeled in the  system, and improve coordination between offices. It also directs the  VA to use the tools for pensions and survivors' benefits, so families  aren't left behind.

By improving coordination across the VA and other Federal agencies,  we can reduce overpayments and prevent families from being hit with  unexpected debt notices.

This is a commonsense bill that would help to ensure that our  veterans and survivors receive the benefits that they deserve in a  timely and efficient manner.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I also thank  Chairman Bost and his staff at the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for  their work on this very important issue.
