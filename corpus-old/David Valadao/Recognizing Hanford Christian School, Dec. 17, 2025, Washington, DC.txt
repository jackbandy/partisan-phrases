Recognizing Hanford Christian School


Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Hanford Christian  School on their 80-year anniversary and to thank them for their  significant contributions to the Kings County community.

Since its founding in 1944, Hanford Christian School has provided  students with the tools they need to succeed in their personal and  professional lives. Hanford Christian School pushes students in and out  of the classroom to reach their academic potential, through a  challenging curriculum, Christ-centered teaching, and hands-on learning  experiences.

The students, faculty, and families at Hanford Christian are  dedicated to serving their community. Every year, they contribute to  food drives and volunteer with the Salvation Army and Gleanings for the  Hungry. Their community service impacts the community all year long,  including during the holiday season when families donate blankets to  the homeless and sing at retirement homes. These experiences at Hanford  Christian and within the community empower students to become  thoughtful leaders inside and outside the classroom.

The dedication of the teachers and staff at Hanford Christian School  plays a vital role in helping students across the Central Valley  thrive. I want to thank the entire faculty for fostering a learning  environment that helps our youth become the best they can be.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to  join me in celebrating Hanford Christian School on their 80-year  anniversary. Their work to enrich the lives of students in the Central  Valley will be felt for generations to come.
