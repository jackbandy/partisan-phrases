Recognizing the City of Delano, California


Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the city of  Delano, California as it celebrates its 110th anniversary.

Incorporated in 1915, Delano was originally established as a railroad  town, serving as a hub for hundreds of workers building the southern  terminus of the Southern Pacific railroad. Over the years, Delano has  been the site of several historically significant events, particularly  during World War II. The Voice of America Delano even operated as a  vital broadcasting facility, relaying news and information to VOA  stations across the Pacific, including Hawaii, Okinawa, and the  Philippines.

In more recent history, the Delano Municipal Airport gained  distinction as the home of a squadron of Northrop P-61 Black Widow  aircraft--twin-engine fighters that played a key role in defending the  Pacific Coast during the war.

Today, Delano is best known for its thriving agricultural industry.  The city is a major producer of grapes, oranges, almonds, pistachios,  and cotton. Alongside its agricultural success, Delano has experienced  steady commercial growth, attracting major businesses such as Wonderful  Citrus, the company behind the widely popular Halos brand.

Delano is also a culturally rich and diverse community, shaped by  generations of residents from around the world. Since the arrival of  early settlers under the Homestead Act, Delano has welcomed people from  Latin America, Asia, and Europe, each contributing to the city's  distinct character and traditions.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my congressional colleagues to join me in  celebrating Delano on its 110th anniversary, and to honor its rich  history, diverse community, and the spirit of those who call it home.
