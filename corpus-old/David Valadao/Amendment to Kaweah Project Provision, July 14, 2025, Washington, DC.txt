Amendment to Kaweah Project Provision


Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge support for my bill, H.R.  1044, which authorizes seven permit renewals for the Kaweah  Hydroelectric Project in Tulare County, California.

Southern California Edison has operated the Kaweah Hydroelectric  Project since 1899, marking well over a century of reliable, clean  power.

For decades, Congress has allowed for the continued use of the  Federal lands for this purpose, but unless we act now, the  authorization will expire in 2026.

Without authorization, Southern California Edison would be forced to  dismantle critical infrastructure, costing ratepayers in the region  tens of millions of dollars and eliminating a clean, reliable, and  affordable source of energy.

This bill ensures that Kaweah can keep operating without disruption  or unnecessary costs for families across California.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Westerman and his staff at the  Committee on Natural Resources for their work on this issue. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill and protect the Central Valley's clean  energy future.
