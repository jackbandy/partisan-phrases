Recognizing Michelle Nuckols


Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Michelle Nuckols  for being named the 2025 Cattlewoman of the Year by the Tulare County  Cattlewoman's Association.

Michelle moved to Visalia, California in 1975 with her parents at the  age of six. She discovered her love for agriculture in high school  through Mt. Whitney High School's FFA program, where she quickly  immersed herself. Her involvement in FFA inspired her to pursue a  career in agricultural education, leading her to attend the College of  the Sequoias and later Fresno State University. While at Fresno State,  Michelle met her husband, Justin Nuckols, who came from a farming  family in Porterville. The two married in 1995 and made their home near  Justin's family farm. Following graduation, Michelle began teaching at  Tipton Elementary, where she has now served for over 29 years. In  addition to teaching English, she offers an agriculture elective that  introduces students to FFA and Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE)  projects. Her class includes hands-on lessons about dairy and beef  cattle, visits to local farming operations, and a variety of  experiences designed to connect students to agriculture. Michelle also  has a deep passion for photography, which has inspired her to preserve  the farming traditions of Justin's family farm through the lens of her  camera. She captures branding events, assists in tagging calves, and  most importantly, ensures that donuts and cold drinks are available for  all who attend.

Since Justin's unexpected passing in 2022, Michelle has taken on a  more active role in the family's cattle operation alongside her sons,  Tanner and Carson. She also joined Tulare County Cattlewomen,  continuing her lifelong support for agricultural education and honoring  Justin's legacy through advocacy and community involvement.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to  join me in celebrating Michelle Nuckols on being awarded Tulare  County's 2025 Cattlewoman of the Year.
