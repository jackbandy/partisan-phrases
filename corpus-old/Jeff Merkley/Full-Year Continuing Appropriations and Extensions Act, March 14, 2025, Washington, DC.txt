Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025


Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1273 and ask  that it be reported by number.

Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, colleagues, let me keep this very simple.  We provided a lot of funding in the Inflation Reduction Act so that  those who have very sophisticated finances and very powerful advisers  that try to avoid ever paying their taxes don't get away with it,  because it is a fundamental fairness all across America.

Ordinary working people have the money taken out of their paychecks  every week. Just because people have enormous paychecks and fancy  consultants, it shouldn't mean that they get a license to cheat.

And all of that money went to make sure that those upper income folks  knew that somebody might be taking a look at their finances.

If this amendment fails, it will increase the deficit by $46 billion.  So I hope all of you who are fiscally responsible and care about  fundamental fairness to workers across America will vote for this  amendment.
