Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4272 and ask that  it be reported by number.

Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, a freelance journalist discovered recently  that billions of dollars had been stolen from welfare programs in  Minnesota. Congress didn't discover this theft; a member of the public  did. How did Congress respond? Did Congress open an investigation? Did  Congress claw back the money from Minnesota? No. Congress simply  decided to give another $5 billion in refugee welfare.

My amendment says: Stop. No more welfare for refugees until there is  a nationwide investigation of the level of this fraud. No more welfare  for refugees until Congress balances the budget.

America can't be the world's sugar daddy when we can't even afford  welfare for our own citizens.

Many refugees are good people--frankly, some of the best Americans  just got here--but our welcome mat should not be a welfare check.  Anyone who sponsors immigrants or refugees should be responsible for  their welfare. Charity is when you give your money. Any groups  assisting immigrants or refugees should themselves be responsible for  the welfare of the refugees.

So my amendment will remove from the bill a little over $5 billion  from the refugee welfare programs. I ask for a ``yes'' vote.

Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I yield back all time on Paul amendment No.  4272.                          Vote on Amendment No. 4272
