Recognizing Gavin Proffitt


Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Gavin Proffitt for  his service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

A Lynchburg, Virginia native, Gavin began his career on Capitol Hill  as a Research Assistant for Rep. Louie Gohmert (TX-01) in October 2016  before becoming a Legislative Correspondent and Legislative Assistant  for Rep. Bob Goodlatte (VA-06) and a Professional Staff Member for the  Republican Study Committee. In February 2023, Gavin joined the House  Committee on Energy and Commerce as a Professional Staff Member for the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations after serving as a Senior  Advisor to the Administrator and Medicaid Project Officer for the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. During his time working for  the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Gavin worked on a  wide array of issues such as the fentanyl crisis, FDA drug shortages,  and antimicrobial resistance.

Recently, Gavin departed the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  to take on a new role as Health Policy Advisor for Sen. Ron Johnson  (WI). I wish him the best, congratulate him on his new role, and thank  Gavin Proffitt for his service to the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce.
