Recognizing Joanne Thomas


Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Joanne Thomas for her  service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

A graduate of Wayland Baptist University, The University of Sydney,  and The Catholic University of America's Columbus School of Law, Joanne  began her career on Capitol Hill as a Law Clerk for the United States  Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 2022 after having previously  worked in the legal field. In January 2023, Joanne joined the House  Committee on Energy and Commerce to serve as Counsel for the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. As Counsel, she oversaw  Congressional investigations into FDA foreign drug inspections, the  Office of Refugee Resettlement's management of unaccompanied minors,  and a $900 million taxpayer funded HHS COVID-19 Public Health Campaign.

Recently, Joanne departed the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.  I wish her the best in her future endeavors and thank Joanne Thomas for  her service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
