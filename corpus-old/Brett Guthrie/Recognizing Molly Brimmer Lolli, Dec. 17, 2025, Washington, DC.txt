Recognizing Molly Brimmer Lolli


Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Molly Brimmer Lolli  for her service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

A graduate of the University of Maryland for both a bachelor's degree  in Political Science and a Juris Doctorate degree, Molly began her  career on Capitol Hill as a Legislative Assistant for Rep. Andy Harris  (MD-01) in 2019, before becoming Senior Advisor on Health Policy and  later Legislative Director for Rep. Richard Hudson  (NC-09) in 2021. In  January 2023, Molly became Counsel for the Subcommittee on Health for  the House Committee on Energy and Commerce under Chair Cathy McMorris  Rodgers while I was serving as Subcommittee Chair. When I became  Chairman in January of this year, I knew I wanted to keep her on my  team as an expert on health issues.

After serving two Chairmen and three Subcommittee Chairmen, Molly has  departed the U.S. House of Representatives to accept another  opportunity to continue to serve as a health expert. I wish her the  best, congratulate her on her new role, and thank Molly Brimmer Lolli  for her service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the  United States Congress. I also congratulate her on the birth of her and  her husband Tim's new 6 pound, 2 ounces baby girl Carmela Gray Lolli  who was born on October 26, 2025, and wish this young family all the  best. I know Molly, Tim, and Carmela's big sister Breslin are very  proud to welcome her to the family.
