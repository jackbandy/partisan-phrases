Recognizing Seth Gold


Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Seth Gold for his  service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

A native of Cincinnati, Ohio and graduate of The George Washington  University for both a Bachelor of Science in Public Health and Master  of Public Health--Seth began his career on Capitol Hill as a Health  Legislative Assistant for Dr. Michael Burgess (TX-26) in 2016 before  moving to the Senate to work as Health Policy Advisor for Senator Rob  Portman (OH) in 2017. In May 2021, Seth joined the Subcommittee on  Health for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce when I served as  Subcommittee Republican Leader, and later Subcommittee Chair, under  Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers. During his time under Chair Rodgers and  myself, Seth was an invaluable Professional Staff Member and under his  leadership--our committee strengthened Medicaid through the Working  Families Tax Cuts, which established Medicaid work requirements and  expanded home and community-based services to new beneficiaries.

After serving two Chairs and three Subcommittee Chairmen, Seth will  soon depart Capitol Hill and move to Louisiana to serve as the Policy  Director for the Louisiana Department of Health. I wish him the best,  congratulate him on his new role, and thank Seth Gold for his service  to the House Committee on Energy and United States Congress.
