Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act of 2025


Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker. I wish to include in the Record the  following letters of exchange between the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs with respect to  H.R. 1765, the Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act of 2025.  By these letters, the Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign  Affairs agreed to discharge the bill and forgo further consideration of  the measure so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House Floor. I  agree that this discharge in no way diminishes or alters the  jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or prejudice its  jurisdictional prerogatives on this measure or similar legislation in  the future.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                       Washington, DC, July 1, 2025.      Hon. Brett Guthrie,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Guthrie: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Foreign       Affairs on the text of H.R. 1765, the Promoting United States       Wireless Leadership Act of 2025. I agree that Foreign Affairs       may be discharged from further consideration of the bill, so       that it may proceed expeditiously to the House Floor.

This agreement is made with the understanding that it does       not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs or prejudice our jurisdictional       prerogatives on this measure or similar legislation in the       future. I also request your support for the appointment of an       appropriate number of Foreign Affairs conferees to any House-      Senate conference that might occur on this legislation.

I would appreciate it if you could include this letter in       your committee report on the bill or place it into the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration. I look       forward to continuing to work together as this measure moves       through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                        Brian Mast,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                      Washington, DC, July 7, 2025.      Hon. Brian Mast,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Mast: Thank you for your letter concerning       H.R. 1765, the ``Promoting United States Wireless Leadership       Act of 2025.'' I appreciate your willingness to forgo action       on the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House       Floor.

I agree that your decision to forgo action on this bill       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs, nor prejudice that Committee's       jurisdictional prerogatives on this measure or similar       legislation in the future.

As you requested, I will include a copy of our exchange of       letters on H.R. 1765 in the committee report on the bill and       in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill       on the House floor.

Thank you again for your assistance on this matter.            Sincerely,                                                     Brett Guthrie,      Chairman.
