Recognizing Reese Patricia Fritsch


Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the birth of  Reese Patricia Fritsch.

Reese was born on October 7, 2025 at 2:45 P.M. at Luminis Health Anne  Arundel Medical Center weighing seven pounds, two ounces and measuring  21 inches long to loving parents Taylor and Kristin Flukey Fritsch, who  serves as a valuable member of my team on the Subcommittee on Health  for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

I'm grateful to have Kristin as a part of the Energy and Commerce  family, and I'm excited for her and Taylor to start their family with  their newest addition.
