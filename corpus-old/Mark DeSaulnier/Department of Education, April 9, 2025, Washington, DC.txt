Department of Education


Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, President Gerald Ford had a vision. He  signed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to protect the  most vulnerable amongst us: special needs kids.

One of the most cruel things I have seen in my time in Congress and  with this administration is the attack on the public servants who  promote and have never had the resources to really protect special  needs kids.

This President has cut public servants at the Department of  Education. Mr. Speaker, 1,315 workers were fired, 572 accepted  voluntary separation packages, and 63 probationary workers were  terminated. Programs for students with disabilities were moved to the  Department of Health and Human Services where 20,000 public servants  were cut in January.

There are approximately 7.5 million special needs kids in this  country protected by IDEA in the Department of Education. They rely on  the public servants who were just fired and eliminated.

The number of students served by IDEA has grown by over 1 million in  the last decade. The administration has gutted the Office of Civil  Rights which protects these students with disabilities from  discrimination. This is outrageous.
