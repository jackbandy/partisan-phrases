Affordability Crisis in America


Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, today I express my outrage about the  affordability crisis in American healthcare.

Republican leaders have failed to extend the expiring tax credits  that help people afford their insurance. Consumers affected will face  an average increase in their premium costs of 114 percent next year.

Rather than making healthcare more affordable and effective,  Republican leaders and President Trump passed their big, ugly bill that  kicks 10 million Americans off of Medicaid. It increases healthcare  costs for 5 million small business owners and self-employed workers. It  fails to extend critical tax credits. This is all to give billions of  dollars of tax credits to the wealthiest Americans.

Time is running out, as we all know. I urge my Republican colleagues  to do the right thing and work with Democrats to make healthcare more  affordable and more effective for Americans.
