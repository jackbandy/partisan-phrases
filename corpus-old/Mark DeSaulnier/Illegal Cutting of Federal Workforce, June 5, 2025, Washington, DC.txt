Illegal Cutting of Federal Workforce


Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, the administration's reckless public  servant firing spree is hurting the health, safety, and financial  security of people across the United States.

Since he came into office, the President has laid off at least 58,000  Federal civil service workers with plans to eliminate an additional  150,000 workers. Another 76,000 workers accepted buyouts after being  threatened with relocation or termination.

These layoffs include hundreds of staff members at the Centers for  Disease Control who protected children from lead poisoning and air  pollution, among other services. Staff cuts at the Social Security  Administration have resulted in longer wait times for seniors applying  for benefits.

I have been proud to join legal briefs filed against the  administration, which are resulting in the reinstatement of thousands  of Federal workers. I will continue to push back against the President  and oppose illegal cuts to the Federal workforce, which block Americans  from accessing the critical government services they rely on.

Mr. Speaker, if we want to talk about efficiency, then let's join  together to evaluate it, not do it this way.
