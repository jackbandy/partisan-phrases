Welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to the United States


Mr. GOODEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome His All-Holiness  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to the United States and congratulate  him on receiving the distinguished Templeton Prize.

As the head of the Orthodox Christian Church, Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew is the spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians  worldwide, having faithfully served in this role since October 1991.  Throughout his tenure, he has reached across borders and barriers to  build peace and reconciliation among diverse faiths and nations. He has  convened conferences with Jewish and Muslim  leaders, strengthened Christian-Muslim relations, and championed  environmental issues worldwide. Because of this work, he is endearingly  known as the ``Bridge Builder and Patriarch of Peace.''

His All-Holiness's commitment to interfaith harmony, human rights,  and global peace exemplifies the highest levels of compassion and  unity. We are honored by his visit to the United States and are  grateful for his dedication to peace and unity. May his legacy,  humility, and love for all people continue shining light toward a more  just and peaceful world.
