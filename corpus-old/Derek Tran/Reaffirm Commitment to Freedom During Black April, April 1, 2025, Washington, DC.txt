Reaffirm Commitment to Freedom During Black April


Mr. TRAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark the beginning of the most  solemn month of the year for Vietnamese Americans and diaspora. We  refer to this month as Black April, or Thang Tu Den, because so many of  us lost our homes, our livelihoods, and our country.

My own parents escaped brutal oppression at the hands of the  Vietnamese Communist Government and came to this country seeking the  freedom and democracy that had been ripped away from them in the  country of their birth.

This year, we recognize the 50th anniversary of the Fall of Saigon on  April 30, 1975. In the years since, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese  Americans have built vibrant communities in the United States that have  enriched our Nation and strengthened our communities.

By recognizing Black April, we honor those who sacrificed their lives  for freedom, including members of the South Vietnamese military who  fought alongside American allied forces. We also honor the immense  hardships endured by the refugees as they embarked on the perilous  journey to seek refuge and rebuild their lives.

I am so proud to be the first Vietnamese American to represent Orange  County's Little Saigon community in Congress. Home to the largest  Vietnamese diaspora in the world, Little Saigon is a beacon of hope and  testament to the resiliency of our community.

I am proud to tell the story of our community on the floor of the  United States House of Representatives to ensure that no communist  regime can rewrite our history.

As we mark this solemn milestone, let us reaffirm our commitment to  freedom and human rights and honor the indomitable spirit of the  Vietnamese diaspora.
