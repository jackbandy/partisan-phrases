Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza


Mr. TRAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my horror at the  reports coming from Gaza of hundreds of innocent civilians being killed  or maimed while they are seeking humanitarian assistance. This is a  humanitarian crisis.

Congress and the Trump administration must take action to put an end  to the violence. Killing those seeking food is incompatible with the  pursuit of peace.

The choice by Israeli leadership to engage in military actions at aid  sites endangers all innocent Palestinians and Israelis who deserve to  live with dignity.

I am the child of refugees. My parents were forced to flee because  they feared for their own lives in their home country.

The United States must ensure that the Palestinian people can live  their lives in peace without the fear that they will be killed in line  for food.
