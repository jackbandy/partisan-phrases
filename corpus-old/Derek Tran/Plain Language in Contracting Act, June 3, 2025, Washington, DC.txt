Plain Language in Contracting Act


Mr. TRAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 787, the Plain  Language in Contracting Act.

Far too often, bureaucratic barriers and complex government jargon  prevent small business owners, especially veterans and immigrant  entrepreneurs, from accessing and securing Federal contracting  opportunities.

I consistently hear from small business owners in Orange County that  the main reason they do not apply for Federal contracts is that the  barriers to entry are simply too high.

H.R. 787 will address this barrier facing small business owners and  mandate Federal agencies to use clear and accessible language in their  contracting opportunities.

I am proud to co-lead this bill, and I thank the gentleman from Long  Island (Mr. LaLota) for working with me to improve the SBA and simplify  the Federal contracting process. Let's continue to empower local  businesses and ensure that every entrepreneur has the opportunity to  succeed.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bipartisan  bill.
