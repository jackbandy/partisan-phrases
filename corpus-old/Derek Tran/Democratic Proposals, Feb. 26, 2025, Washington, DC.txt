Democratic Proposals


Mr. TRAN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to announce that the first bill I  will introduce as a Member of Congress is the Protect Veteran Jobs Act.  The men and women who serve our country deserve our unwavering support,  not broken promises.

The indiscriminate firing of veterans by the Trump administration and  Elon Musk's DOGE dishonors the unwavering commitment that these public  servants have dedicated to our country. These heroes stepped up for us,  and now, we must stand up for them.

This issue is deeply personal to me. I am the son of Vietnamese  refugees who fled war and persecution in search of safety and a better  life in America. This country welcomed them and gave me the chance to  succeed.

I joined the Army out of sense of duty to my country because I wanted  to give back to the country that gave me so much. I wanted to protect  the very principles of freedom, justice, and decency that we hold dear.

I don't see those values in the actions by the Trump administration.  I see only division, fear, and cruelty.

I have a duty as a Congressman, as a veteran, and as a proud American  to stand up for those who made the highest commitment to us. It is my  honor  to introduce the Protect Veteran Jobs Act to reinstate veterans who  were recklessly terminated under the Trump administration's  dishonorable purge of the Federal workplace and hold the executive  branch accountable for any future terminations that may occur.

This isn't about politics. This is about basic decency.

Veterans make up 30 percent of the Federal workplace, and when they  are unjustly removed, it impacts all of us. From delays in healthcare  and disability claims to staffing shortages at the VA, the consequences  are dire.

Mr. Speaker, veterans have our backs, and we must have theirs. I hope  my colleagues will join me in supporting this important bill. Veterans  gave everything for us. It is time we give back to them.
