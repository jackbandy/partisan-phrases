Connecting Small Businesses with Career and Technical Education Graduates Act of 2025


Mr. TRAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1642, the  Connecting Small Businesses with Career and Technical Education  Graduates Act.

Small businesses can't thrive if they can't access a highly qualified  workforce. This legislation will help small business owners connect  with graduates of vocational programs and hire employees who can help  their businesses thrive.

Talented graduates come out of vocational education programs in my  district, like Coastline College in Fountain Valley, and have the  skills that small businesses in Orange County need.

This bill will help ensure graduates of career and technical  education programs find good-paying jobs that they are already trained  for. It is pro-small business, pro-students, pro-workforce, and pro- economic growth. It is a win for everyone.

I am proud to co-lead H.R. 1642. I thank my colleagues, Chairman  Williams and Congressmen Olszewski and Bresnahan, for their leadership  in championing this important piece of legislation. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''
