Indiana--College National Football Champions


Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, last night the country watched something  nobody predicted: Indiana, national football champions. Our Hoosiers  beat Miami 27-21, and finished a perfect season and brought the title  home to Indiana.

I say that as a proud IU alum, former chairman of our IU Alumni  Association, over 800,000 living alumni strong. My wife, Mary, and I  have been cheering on our Hoosiers since our college days.

We will be talking about this play for a long time: Fourth and five,  Fernando Mendoza puts his head down, bounces off defenders, spins,  stretches, and powers in for the touchdown.

Coach Curt Cignetti took over just two seasons ago. There were no  shortcuts and no gimmicks. It was just work and belief.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate IU's president Pam Whitten, our AD Scott  Dolson, every player and coach, and our Hoosier fans who never gave up.

Coach Cignetti said of the season: ``It would be a helluva movie,''  and he is right.
