Recognizing Future Astronaut Yuri Kubo


Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a fellow Hoosier and  Purdue University engineer, Mr. Yuri Kubo. Yuri is a native of  Columbus, Indiana, back in my district. He was recently selected as one  of just 10 candidates from a field of 8,000 to join NASA's next  astronaut program. That is rarefied air by any measure.

Over the next 2 years, Yuri and an elite cohort will train at NASA  Johnson Space Center down in Houston as they prepare for missions to  the International Space Station, the Moon, and whatever comes next.  Yuri reflects the kind of scientific talent that Indiana grows.

Purdue, my own alma mater, has long been a launchpad for many of  America's sharpest engineers and explorers, and he is rocketing that  tradition forward. We are filled with Hoosier pride back home to see  Yuri representing our State on a stage that is literally out of this  world.
