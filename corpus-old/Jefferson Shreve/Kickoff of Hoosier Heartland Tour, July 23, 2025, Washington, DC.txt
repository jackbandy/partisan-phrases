Kickoff of Hoosier Heartland Tour


Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to kick off my Hoosier  Heartland Tour. As this Chamber adjourns, I eagerly look forward to  beginning my first summer district work period.

As I move about Indiana's Sixth District over the weeks to come, I am  eager to share this time with our hardworking Hoosiers.

For 7 months, I have been working to deliver for our communities. I  look forward to sharing my work and bringing details of our wins back  home.

Most importantly, this time will focus on listening. I look forward  to touring our local businesses, meeting with our 11 county sheriffs,  visiting the many district airports I represent, and hearing from our  family farmers.

This Hoosier Heartland Tour promises to encompass many meaningful  conversations that will inform my work as we return in September, and I  eagerly undertake it.
