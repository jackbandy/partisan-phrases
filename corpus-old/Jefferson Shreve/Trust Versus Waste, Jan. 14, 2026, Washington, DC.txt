Trust Versus Waste


Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Speaker, across my home State of Indiana, I hear the  same thing time and again. People work hard. They pay their taxes, and  they expect Washington to treat their dollars with respect.

Hoosier hospitality means that we help neighbors who truly need it,  but fraud turns this virtue into a target, and hardworking Hoosiers  foot the bill.

This is not left versus right. It is honesty versus the dishonest,  trust versus waste. For every dollar stolen by fraud, it is a dollar we  cannot spend on public safety, on our national security, or on helping  working families get ahead.

We owe taxpayers accountability, stronger oversight, and closed  loopholes that invite abuse.

Protect the taxpayers. Protect the programs, and punish the scammers.
