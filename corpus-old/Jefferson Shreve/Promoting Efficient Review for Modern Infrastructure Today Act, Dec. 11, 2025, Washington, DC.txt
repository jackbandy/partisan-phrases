Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act


Mr. SHREVE. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding. I  appreciate the time, and I appreciate my colleague  Mike Collins' work  on this commonsense package of clean water reforms.

I am grateful that my bill, H.R. 3934, the Water Quality Standards  Attainability Act, is included. My bill serves to maintain State and  local leadership in setting their water quality standards under the  Clean Water Act.

Let me cite a compelling example of why this legislation is  necessary. In 2020, the EPA approved in Indianapolis, in my district,  new standards for stormwater management. These updates were an aid to  ensure that Hoosiers had access to clean water and that our localities  were able to deliver on this responsibility. In early '24, under the  Biden EPA, this approval was revoked for the infrastructure updates  that were already well underway, costing our taxpayers needless  millions.

This unpredictability has been a practice of our Federal Government  for too long. It is time our local governments and taxpayers have the  transparency and certainty with which to cost-effectively invest in our  infrastructure.

My legislation will ensure that the regulatory whiplash is in our  rearview mirror. My bill will ensure that when States write their  rules, they consider affordability and accessibility to water treatment  technologies.

Through this legislation, we are providing certainty and  predictability in the EPA approval process and a little Hoosier common  sense in delivery. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
