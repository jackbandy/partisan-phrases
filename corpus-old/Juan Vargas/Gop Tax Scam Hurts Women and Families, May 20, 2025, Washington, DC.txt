Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, this week, Republicans are attempting to  pass a budget that will gut Medicaid, all to pay for tax cuts for the  rich.

These Medicaid cuts aren't just numbers on a page. They will hurt  real people.

My constituent Rosemary wrote to me and shared her family's story.  Rosemary has a child with disabilities. She says that if Congress were  to cut Medicaid, their lives would be upended.

She wrote: ``My child would no longer be able to receive therapies,  and I would lose my ability to care for her and keep her safe. We have  been stressed completely about our daughter's future without Medicaid.  Please help our children by voting no on the cuts to Medicaid and other  proposals that would take away these lifesaving services from people  who need them, like my child.''

I ask if my Republican colleagues, my friends, are listening and hear  Rosemary and the millions of moms and dads across the country.

Giving a handout to the rich at the expense of families' access to  care is shameful. It is just shameful.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to stand up and fight  for their constituents, not for their billionaire buddies.
