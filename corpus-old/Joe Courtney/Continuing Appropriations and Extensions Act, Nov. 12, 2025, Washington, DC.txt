Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, there are many flaws in the hastily  written Senate Republican Continuing Resolution, before us today. The  most egregious is the Continuing Resolution's failure to ``continue''  tax credits for health insurance which have been on the books for 4  years, right at the same time 24 million Americans are enrolling for  2026 insurance coverage in the ACA health exchanges. For millions, the  abandonment of premium assistance will result in increases of 100  percent, 200 percent, and even higher. A couple in Enfield,  Connecticut, in their 60s, who visited with me last week with their  premium notice, are looking at an increase from $300/month to $2,449/ month. The only way they can pay that is to draw funds from their  retirement 401k, triggering tax penalties on top of the increased out- of-pocket costs. My office heard from many other constituents with  similar shocking increases, whose stories are attached to my written  statement.

I also want to alert Members of the House that this new continuing  resolution (CR) released this past Saturday November 8, 2025, which  funds the government to January 30, 2026, has a serious gap in funding  for the Columbia-class submarine program. This program, which has been  referred to as the ``number one acquisition priority'' of both the  Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense, is building new  ballistic submarines on a very tight schedule to replace the aging  fleet of Ohio-class submarines, who have been on patrol starting in the  1980's. The first two submarines--USS District of Columbia and USS  Wisconsin--are under construction and fully funded with appropriations  approved by prior Congresses. The third, USS Groton SSBN 828 is ready  to start construction, subject to Congress approving the funds.

For this CR, The Navy requested an anomaly for full fiscal year 2026  Columbia program funding to Congressional leadership to keep this  program on track. In past years, this has been a normal request in  order to make sure production stays on schedule, regardless of late  passage of the full Navy budget. Astonishingly, Mr. Speaker, the Senate  continuing resolution refused the Navy's request and Columbia program  has zero additional funding. This is not a minor bookkeeping concern.  The absence of a set aside, or anomaly, to fund construction of SSBN  828, will create serious risk of a halt work order to the production  schedule of the Nation's most critical defense program.

The legislative chaos of the last two months, with the House shut  down at the Speaker's behest, has suffocated the normal communication  and negotiation that would address glaring harm, such as the cut off of  health insurance subsidies and steady funding of the Navy's  shipbuilding budget. There is a better path, Mr. Speaker, which is to  have our chamber exercise its independent constitutional role and  protect both the health care and national security of our Nation.  Reject this budget and fix these glaring flaws. I include in the Record  the following written statements from my constituents:                          Kristin McShane--Norwich

My name is Kristin McShane and I live in Norwich CT. My       husband and I own a martial arts school. We buy our health       insurance through the state health exchange and on average       pay $850 a month for insurance. We got a letter the other day       that our rates will be increasing a lot due to ACA rates       expiring. On top of high monthly premiums, we have high       deductibles and many things are not covered. We also pay for       all vision and dental expenses out of pocket as they are not       covered and out of pocket coverage is even more than that.       It's hard to have so much of our monthly income going to       medical bills and insurance. We haven't been told exactly       what our increase will be but we are going to have to make       cuts to other parts of our lives to afford them. It's not       right or fair to give very earthly people tax breaks while       increasing necessary expenses for average hard working people       who are barely getting by. I can't remember the last stress       free day we have had because of the increasing costs of       everything but most especially healthcare.                                Caleb--Norwich

As a small business owner in Connecticut, I am writing to       share my deep concern about the potential loss of the health       insurance exchange and the premium tax credits.

For business owners like me, the ACA marketplace (the       exchange) is often the only way to get affordable health       coverage. The tax credits are not just a small help--they are       essential. Without them, many of us, our families, and even       our employees would not be able to afford health insurance.

Losing this system would negatively impact our business. It       would mean facing impossible choices between our health and       our livelihood. It makes it harder to run a stable business,       stay productive, and provide for our families.

We are counting on you to protect the health insurance       exchange and the tax credits that make coverage possible.       Please oppose any efforts that would take away this critical       support for Connecticut's small business community.                                 Lee--Mystic

She and her partner buy their insurance through the       exchange and she's expecting their premium to go from $700 to       approximately $2,500 per month. Her partner left a higher       paying job last year to take a different role without       insurance, and now they aren't sure if they can make it work.

I won't be able to afford insurance next year without the       ACA. I work for a small business that can't afford to offer       benefits. At 54 I will go without coverage and hope I stay       healthy.                            Anonymous--East Haddam

I am a widow who resides with my 23-year-old son who just       graduated from college in May '24. He is, and has been,       seeking full time employment in the criminal justice field. I       have a full-time and part-time job. My full-time employer       does not provide medical insurance. Both my son and I are on       a medical/dental insurance policy which I purchased through       Access Health CT. Due to our household income, we qualify for       tax credits. Even with these tax credits, I am currently       paying close to $700/month for our insurance. I know that I       cannot afford a monthly premium upwards of $1000!

It is a well-known fact that health insurance premiums in       the United States are ridiculous! Our healthcare system is       broken, now it will become unaffordable! it is a sad       statement when other countries medical programs far surpass       the United State of America!

Current plan is no longer available. New Bronze Anthem plan       ($6k deductible) but without dental or vision. Premium is       $1,384.15 which is a 14% increase. Premium tax credits are no       longer available, leading to a monthly premium of $1,384.15       (258% increase) however, also need to add in a dental plan       with premium of $23.56 so final monthly premium for 2026 will       be $1,407.71.

Versus 2025 premium of $386.90 means the premium increase       is $1,020.81 every month (264%) which is $12,249.72 for the       year or 13% of our annual income. Additionally, under       the new plan available, copays have been changed to co-      insurance and I've lost vision insurance.                              Anonymous--Enfield
