Request to Consider H. Res. Condemning the Violent Antisemitic Attack in Boulder, Colorado, and Expressing Support for the Survivors and Their Families


Mr. NEGUSE.  Res. 476, my  bipartisan resolution to condemn the terror attack in Boulder and to  denounce anti-Semitism, be called for consideration by the full House.

Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.

Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, my understanding under ``Jefferson's  Manual,'' is that the Speaker has the ability to disclose in the  Congressional Record the source of the objection. The minority does not  object to this unanimous-consent request.

Will the Speaker tell the House and the American public, is it  Speaker Johnson that opposes this?

Who opposes unanimous consent to this resolution denouncing the  attack?
