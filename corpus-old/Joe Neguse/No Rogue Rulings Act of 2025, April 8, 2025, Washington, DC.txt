No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025


Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his  leadership, and I echo his remarks.

Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to listen to this debate and to hear the  arguments peddled by my colleagues that are hypocritical at best and  intellectually dishonest at worst.

Where were my colleagues when 14 Federal judges appointed by  Republican Presidents issued injunctions against policies that the  Biden administration was pursuing over the course of the last 4 years?  Where were they? Nowhere to be found.

I don't remember my colleagues bringing this bill to the floor. Of  course not. Spare me the feigned indignation.

Republicans talk of defending the Constitution when President Trump  is running roughshod over provision after provision. The majority talks  of judicial overreach as Republicans attack judges across the country.

Read the Constitution. Read the Federalist Papers. The majority  should read about the importance that our Framers and Founders placed  on judicial independence and reflect on what their conduct will do to  the administration of justice in the United States of America and to  the rule of law that has been sacrosanct for the better part of two- and-a-half centuries.

Mr. Speaker, I suppose I should, but I cannot believe that my  colleagues would waste time on a dangerous bill like this instead of  addressing the consequential challenges that our country faces.

Mr. Speaker, I urge every colleague of mine to vote ``no'' on this  bill.
