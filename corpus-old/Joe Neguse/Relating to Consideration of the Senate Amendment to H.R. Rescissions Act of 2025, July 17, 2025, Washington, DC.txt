Relating to Consideration of the Senate Amendment to H.R. Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, only in Washington, D.C., could politicians  come to the floor and brag about cutting $9 billion from rural radio  stations while 2 weeks ago they voted to increase the deficit by $4  trillion. Spare us these lectures.

For years, Republicans have lectured us and the country about so- called fiscal responsibility, the deficit, the debt, and then they have  the audacity to increase the deficit by $4 trillion to pay for tax cuts  for the 800 billionaires that my Republican colleague from Pennsylvania  is so carefully tracking. It is shameful.

This bill, make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, is a war on rural America.  They are closing rural hospitals by virtue of the bill they passed 15  days ago. Now they will close rural radio stations in the chairwoman's  district in North Carolina and in my State, Colorado, the western part  of my State that I have the privilege of representing. There are rural  radio stations across the country that help constituents during  wildfires and during floods. It is shameful. It should be rejected, Mr.  Speaker.
