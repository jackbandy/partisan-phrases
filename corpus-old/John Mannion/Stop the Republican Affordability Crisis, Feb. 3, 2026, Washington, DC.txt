Stop the Republican Affordability Crisis


Mr. MANNION. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Rivas for her  leadership on affordability and giving me the opportunity to speak  today.

Across central New York and the Mohawk Valley, people are worried,  and they have every reason to be. Grocery prices are going up.  Healthcare costs are rising. Energy bills are spiking. Too many  families feel like they are being asked to absorb the hit while  Washington does nothing to make their lives better or more affordable.

On healthcare, the threat is real and urgent. Just this week, I met  with leadership and toured Oneida Health, a rural hospital in my  district that has been there for over a hundred years. They are feeling  the largest healthcare cuts in the history of the country that were  passed in the big, ugly bill, and they know firsthand that the deeply  inadequate rural healthcare fund comes nowhere near making up for the  lost revenue that happened in that bill.

You cannot cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid and decimate the  foundation of our healthcare system, cutting at the knees our rural  hospitals, and pretend that a one-time Band-Aid of $50 billion will  hold the system together.

Many of my Republican colleagues continue to tout their votes in  support of the largest healthcare cuts in our history while letting  critical subsidies expire.

We should be doing the opposite. There is bipartisan support to  extend the ACA premium tax credits. We should be working together to  prevent premium spikes and make sure seniors and working families  aren't forced to choose between prescription drugs, groceries, and  keeping the heat on.

Healthcare should provide peace of mind, not financial anxiety,  because when essential services are gutted, community health centers  and rural hospitals face shortfalls, and people are forced to drop  coverage. It impacts everyone through higher premiums, and all of us  will be paying more and are paying more to get less. The House has  wisely voted to extend the subsidies, and the Senate needs to do the  same.

The same affordability crisis is playing out with energy costs. I  hear it every day from families and small businesses who simply cannot  afford another rate hike. That is why I helped found the Congressional  Lowering Utility Bills Caucus, to push real, practical solutions that  put consumers first.

Upstate New York knows extreme weather--long winters, hot summers-- but weather alone doesn't explain why utility bills have become  unmanageable. Families in my district are projected to pay hundreds  more each year, even when usage stays the same. I have heard from  constituents whose bills jumped hundreds of dollars and more in just a  matter of months. That is not sustainable, and it is not acceptable.

Part of the problem is growing demand from energy-intensive data  centers. Regular Americans should not be forced to subsidize massive  corporate energy use.

Another part of the problem is this administration's decisions that  undercut long-term affordability, such as blocking transmission,  canceling low-cost energy products--some of which are green energy  projects--and slowing investments that would expand supply, stabilize  prices, and give consumers the options they need and demand.

Republicans control the White House, Senate, and House, and it seems  like big energy corporations control them. We see every day that their  actions demonstrate that they are not interested in lowering the costs  for hardworking Americans.

The good news is that solutions do exist. We need smart investments  in generation and transmission, expanded energy-efficiency programs  that help families use less and pay less, and a balanced approach to  create more affordable energy options, including renewables and clean,  reliable nuclear  power. We also need accountability, including keeping utilities local  and making sure profits aren't shipped overseas while families here  struggle to keep the lights on.

Consumer affordability, not corporate profit, has to be the priority.  Paying for groceries and healthcare, keeping the lights on, and heating  your home are the basic expectations that should exist in the  wealthiest country in the world, Mr. Speaker. They should not be  luxuries.

This affordability crisis isn't just hitting hardworking families  across central New York and the Mohawk Valley. It is squeezing our  small businesses, our hospitals, and our schools. I will keep fighting  to make sure Washington treats this crisis with the urgency that it  demands.
