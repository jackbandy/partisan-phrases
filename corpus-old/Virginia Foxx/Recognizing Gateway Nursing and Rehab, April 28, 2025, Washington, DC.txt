Recognizing Gateway Nursing and Rehab


Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to visit Gateway Nursing and  Rehab in Lenoir, North Carolina, this past Friday and attend a program  that honored veterans who are receiving care there.

I commend Shannon Price, the director of social services, as well as  members of the staff for taking the time and making the effort to  recognize those veterans.

The program was very positive. Shannon is a true patriot, and so,  too, are members of her family, including her son Seth, who is  currently serving in the Army.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Shannon and all the wonderful staff at Gateway  Nursing and Rehab for all they do in service to our Nation's veterans  and for those who are currently serving in the Armed Forces.
