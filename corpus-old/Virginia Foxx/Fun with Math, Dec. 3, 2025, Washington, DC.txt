Fun with Math


Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague Mr. Schweikert for  yielding to me.

Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, I had the wonderful opportunity to  stop in at Top of the Mountain Farms in Ashe County and support a local  small business selling Christmas trees and wreaths.

Becky and Bill Fairchild, the owners of this Christmas tree farm,  were very welcoming. I was fortunate to meet their three daughters-- Bailey, Brooke, and Blair--along with other members of the family  during my visit.

Western North Carolina for many years has produced impeccable  Christmas trees that have been featured at the White House and are the  most beautifully grown anywhere. The Fraser fir, the true Cadillac of  Christmas trees, is what our area is known for producing.

Christmas tree farms play such an important role in the economy of  North Carolina, and I want to highlight them especially during the  Christmas season.

The beautiful tree that I picked up that day is now in my living  room, and I will be enjoying it until January.

I thank the Fairchild family for such an enjoyable visit and for  helping me pick out a tree of my own. I look forward to stopping in  again to see all of them in the future. May God continue to bless them  and may He bless our country with a very happy and joyous Christmas  season.
