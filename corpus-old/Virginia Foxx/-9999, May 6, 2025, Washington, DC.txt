Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Israel's Independence Day  and 77th birthday.

The United States and Israel have a binding, ironclad partnership  that continues to grow stronger as the months and years go on.

As President Reagan once said: ``For the people of Israel and America  are historic partners in the global quest for human dignity and  freedom. We will always remain at each other's side.''

Our values are one and the same, and our joint commitment to  advancing freedom and human dignity will never cease.

To the State of Israel and the Jewish people, I say this: We will  always stand firmly alongside you. You can count on us today, tomorrow,  and always.
