Recognizing Rockingham County Veterans Treatment Court


Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the Rockingham County  government and Kevin Berger, chairman of the Rockingham County  Commissioners Board, in the planning and implementation of the  Rockingham County Veterans Treatment Court.

In October of last year, the Rockingham County government received a  $900,000 grant to help fund this novel endeavor. It was one out of five  counties within the United States to receive this level of funding for  such programs.

This money will go on to make a real difference in the lives of  veterans by offering evidence-based treatment for substance abuse and  mental health.

The process of obtaining this grant was very competitive, and I am  immensely pleased that Rockingham County has this opportunity to make a  real difference in the lives of our Nation's heroes.
