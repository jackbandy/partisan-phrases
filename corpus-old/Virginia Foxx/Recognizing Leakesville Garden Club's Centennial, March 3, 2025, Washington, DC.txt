Recognizing Leakesville Garden Club's Centennial


Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 100th anniversary of  the Leakesville Garden Club in Rockingham County, North Carolina's  oldest active gardening club. It was formed in March 1925 and was  recognized as the third garden club to be organized within the State of  North Carolina.

Mr. Speaker, this club is more than just about gardening. It is about  fostering pride in the community, strengthening bonds of fellowship  between people, and upholding tradition.

This club is a shining example of the best that North Carolina has to  offer. Its 100-year history is a testament to that simple fact.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Leakesville Garden Club and its  members on this historic milestone. Here is to another 100 years.
