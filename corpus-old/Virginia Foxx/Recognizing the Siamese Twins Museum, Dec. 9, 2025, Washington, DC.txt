Recognizing the Siamese Twins Museum


Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Siamese Twins Museum,  dedicated to Eng and Chang Bunker, located in Mount Airy, North  Carolina.

Born in Thailand in 1811, which was then referred to as ``Siam,'' Eng  and Chang were the first documented Siamese twins. Early in their adult  lives, they traveled around the entire world working in show business,  but decided to settle in the United States.

After becoming naturalized American citizens and following a short  stint in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, Eng and Chang, along with their  wives and children, made the decision to move to Mount Airy in 1854.

They settled on Mount Airy because they sought better farmland and  believed that the area presented many educational opportunities for  their children. They each had 13 children. Soon after moving to Mount  Airy, the two brothers became very successful in farming and were  regarded as upstanding members of their community. Their many  descendants have become very successful and prominent citizens also.

Mr. Speaker, the Siamese Twins Museum tells their story and does an  excellent job of highlighting their lives through artifacts and  interactive displays. Not only does Mount Airy house this museum but  also the Andy Griffith Playhouse and Museum. Of course, Mount Airy is  the prototype for the famous Mayberry series starring Andy Griffith.

Mr. Speaker, Mount Airy is a wonderful place to visit, and I  encourage everyone to do so.
