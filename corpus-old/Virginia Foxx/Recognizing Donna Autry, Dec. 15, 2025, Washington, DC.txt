Recognizing Donna Autry


Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a real hero in our midst  and a dear friend of mine, Donna Autry.

Donna was a first grade teacher for over 30 years. Like most  teachers, she was committed to doing one of the most important jobs in  our Nation, but she has never sought the limelight. She simply did her  job quietly and effectively.

Donna is also an artist who creates beautiful quilts and paintings  that she gives to others. She is extremely generous with her time and  talent. She also has a passion for dogs and volunteers with the Avery  County Humane Society.

Mr. Speaker, we ought to recognize more people like Donna who live  quiet lives and, at the same time, contribute so much to the world  around them. We need more Donna Autrys in our world. They make a  positive impact that deserves to be highlighted and praised.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Donna for being such a wonderful person.
