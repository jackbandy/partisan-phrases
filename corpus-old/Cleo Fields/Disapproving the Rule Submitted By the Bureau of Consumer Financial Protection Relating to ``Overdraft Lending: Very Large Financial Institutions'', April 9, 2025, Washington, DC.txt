Disapproving the Rule Submitted By the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Relating to ``Overdraft Lending: Very Large Financial Institutions''


Mr. FIELDS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California, the  ranking member, for fighting predatory lending over the years.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose S.J. Res. 18 which would  dismantle important protections against predatory overdraft practices.

Let me be absolutely clear: Overdraft protection is a profit center  for big banks disguised as a service fee. These institutions made over  $9 billion from overdraft fees last year alone.

When a constituent in my district gets a $35 charge for a $5  purchase, that is not covering bank costs, that is a 700 percent markup  designed purely to boost profits.

The CFPB's rule only affects banks with assets over $10 billion,  institutions that would remain highly profitable without these  predatory practices. These megabanks aren't using overdraft fees to  stay afloat.

Mr. FIELDS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the additional  time.

They are using them to pad their already substantial bottom lines at  the expense of working families in Louisiana and across America.
