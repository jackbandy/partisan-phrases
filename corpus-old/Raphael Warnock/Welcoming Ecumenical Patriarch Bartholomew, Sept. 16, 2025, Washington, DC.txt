Welcoming Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I welcome His All-Holiness Ecumenical  Patriarch Bartholomew of the Eastern Orthodox Church to the United  States of America. Since 1991, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has  served as the spiritual leader for 300 million Orthodox Christians  across the world. Throughout his diakonia, Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew has dedicated himself to fostering inter-religious  dialogue, advancing initiatives to promote understanding and tolerance  amongst Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Middle East.

In addition to his commitment to religious tolerance and freedom,  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has been a champion for ecological  justice and the protection of the environment. Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew's dedication to the spiritual responsibility of  environmentalism and the necessity of caring for God's creation led to  him being referred to as the ``Green Patriarch.'' As a result of his  efforts, the John Templeton Foundation has awarded Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew with the 2025 Templeton  Prize for helping ``bridge scientific and spiritual understandings of  humanity's relationship with the natural world.''

It is an honor to have him visit Washington, DC, and our government  officials during his trip to receive the Templeton Prize.
