Providing for Consideration of Senate Amendment to H.R. Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026


Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, yes, the Federal Government will officially  reopen with the House vote today, but here is what won't happen. We  won't protect the 22 million people paying more for the ACA or the 15  million people losing their healthcare outright due to Republican  actions in the big, ugly law, nor will we stop the healthcare rate  increases for everyone in this country.

We won't be restoring food assistance today for the millions of  Americans who benefit from SNAP because House Republicans voted to cut  the number one program that keeps kids and seniors out of poverty by  over $180 billion.

Nor will we be able today to roll back the tax cuts for billionaires  and Republicans' GOP donors that they funded by gutting those  healthcare and food programs.

I sure hope Republicans are tanned and rested after their 8-week paid  vacation, because they are going to need it. Democrats are going to  continue fighting every single day for people's healthcare and food  benefits. We are going to be on Republicans day after day until we get  it done.

Vote ``no.''
