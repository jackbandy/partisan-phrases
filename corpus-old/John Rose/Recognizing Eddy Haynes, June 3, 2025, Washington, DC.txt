Recognizing Eddy Haynes


Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the inspiring career of  Eddy Haynes who recently retired from Putnam County, Tennessee,  Emergency Medical Services. For 37 years, he faithfully served his  community as an advanced emergency medical technician.

Over the years, he endured long shifts and countless challenges but  never lost sight of the mission: Helping people when they needed it  most. Those who worked alongside Eddy described him as dedicated, a  professional, and committed to the health and safety of others.

According to his coworkers, Eddy not only helped save lives, he  shaped them by mentoring young EMTs. They noted that his calm demeanor  under pressure instilled confidence in his team, and his intense sense  of duty set a high standard for all who worked with him.

Mr. Speaker, Eddy's legacy of commitment to service in Putnam County  will long endure. I congratulate Eddy. May he enjoy this well-deserved  time off.
